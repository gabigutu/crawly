		<shortDescription>Depp for Emperor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney "adventure" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen "Pirates" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, "Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?"And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected "money shots" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, "You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking "overproduced by" credit on the cover-liner. "Bombastic." "Overdone." "Absurdly Stupendous."Well, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.Once again, the children were wondering, "What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?"Perhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, "Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.At this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.This is not just another "entry" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of "The Wizard of Oz." I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is the rum gone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A damn good movie. One of the best of 2003 in my view.This movie made me laugh, and it really pulled me in.At first I was afraid this would be another bad Pirate movie. I went to see it anyway, as I've always loved the legends of pirates, and I love adventure. I saw it once. Then twice. Then Quadrupul. Then six times. And one more 7. And now I eagerly wait for the DVD in Australia.What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done.Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the british fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I had expectations ( from watching the trailers ) that this might be a good movie, I was still surprised that it's as good as it is. The story is actually more complex than I had expected, involving cursed pirates and their quest to rid themselves of the curse. I won't say more than that so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.There aren't as many action scenes as I had thought there would be in a pirate movie, but the ones that are in the movie were very fun and enjoyable. After seeing it, I think it had the right balance of action and drama. There are also, of course, a lot of funny bits interspersed between the action and drama. Some really good special effects also add to the enjoyment of this movie.I wasn't much of a fan of Johnny Depp until I saw this movie. I think he deserved to win the Academy Award for best actor. It's largely because of his performance, IMO, that the movie was so good. Most of the supporting cast did well, mind you, just that Johnny Depp stood high above the rest. I did find Orlando Bloom's performance a bit wooden, but other than that the acting was good.Basically, it's a really fun movie and I'd give it about 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that Disney can still create good movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will always remember this as the movie that made Johnny Depp a superstar and almost got him an Oscar.The fact that he didn't win isn't a problem,since thanks to him this is the best pirate film ever made.The opening concept is a clich?:a beautiful woman(Keira Knightley)is kidnapped by a bunch of filthy pirates(led by Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa)and the man(Orlando Bloom)who's desperately in love with her decides to track them down.From now on,things get unexpected,as he asks another pirate for help.And it's no ordinary pirate:it's Captain Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp),a lying,cheating,but charismatic scumbag,the hardest man on Earth to predict,not to mention quite unlucky and clumsy("You are,with no doubt,the worst pirate I've ever heard of" "But you HAVE heard of me!").It's got all the elements of a classic pirate movie,elements that would give this flick a 9/10.So,why am I giving it a 10/10? The answer is simple:Captain Jack.From the moment he makes his entrance,justly included in the Empire Top 10 Entrances of all time,we know he's the reason people will keep watching the movie.He 's Depp's best non-Tim Burton-character ever,and I can't wait 'til he returns.See you next summer,Captain!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie full action, adventure, humor and a hell of a lot more! The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.The film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all times but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this marvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953 swashbuckler 'The Crimson Pirate' when Will and Jack walk underwater in an upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however, Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents, children and grandparents alike. I'm definitely buying it when it come out on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a real swashbuckling film to make me laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> "Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male," a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.With hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)The moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)The other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...The basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: "we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'"Jack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as "the worst pirate I've ever seen", as in "the worst at it", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).This character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another "Mask of Zorro", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...There are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.The film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - "it's okay", "I was rooting for you" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.But then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp puts a little swish in swashbuckle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being rife with technical blunders such as the longest full moon in history, Disney's first non-PG film is proving to be a financial boon while at the same time collecting reviews from critics that run from tepid to red hot. I am in complete agreement with Roger Ebert on one point: Somewhere in this 143 minute tour de force there lurks a very good ninety-minute film.Other than Johnny Depp, who fashioned his character's personality (and eye makeup?) after observations of his good friend Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the cast of 'Pirates' reads like a Who's Who of English film actors, including Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport and Mackenzie Crook.When screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio originally pitched the movie to the Disney executives in the early '90s, Disney rejected it. It makes one wonder just who is running the Disney empire. Universal Studios have been combining action/adventure movies with theme park rides for over two decades (E.T., Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Back to the Future to name a few) only in reverse order-first the film, then the ride. This combination has worked well for Universal, and it seems almost absurd that Disney has taken so long to pick up on the obvious.I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.A few predictions may be in order, however. Look for an Oscar nomination for Depp's efforts. Look for nominations as well for sound, set design, makeup, and cinematography. As far as best picture? Next to Lord of the Rings (Return of the King)? Not likely.Director Gore Verbinski, who used to play in a punk rock band and is best known for creating the Budweiser frogs, does an outstanding job keeping track of the myriad details required of a director, given his limited experience. True, 'Pirates' has countless errors in continuity, but those occur in any film of such scope. Mr. Verbinski has only four other films to his name: a short entitled The Ritual (1996), and then three very different but effectively made films, Mouse Hunt (1997), The Mexican (2001), and the very creepy thriller The Ring (2002). Again, it makes one wonder just who is at the helm of the USS Disney to put a $125 million movie in the hands of a neophyte. Well, it worked with Lord of the Rings and a very inexperienced Peter Jackson, and it worked here for Disney as well.'Pirates of the Caribbean' is a fun movie for most of the family. It may be rather scary for children ten and under and somewhat boring for many over twenty-five. I enjoyed it immensely for exactly what it was... an amusing ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Delightful Pirates Adventure Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 April 2004, and I have just watched again today (10 Feb 2007) enjoying the same way as in the first time. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Piratas do Caribe ? A Maldiç?o do Pérola Negra" ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of fun, perfect popcorn entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie to sit back and enjoy. Funny, fast-paced and with sterling performances from all of the cast, it's not to be missed for good, old-fashioned entertainment. I'm not a huge fan of Depp, but here he excels. Knightly and Bloom make an engaging couple and I enjoyed the fact that the characters of Governor Swann and Norrington were taken in a different direction from that which might be expected by Hollywood. The former could have easily become the stereotypical "You'll marry who I say you'll marry, girl!", while Norrington could have been the standard English navy bully and nasty piece of work. Instead, both were engaging good guys and Norrington's graceful dealings with Will and Elizabeth brought a core of humanity to the movie.And to the previous reviewer who thought they'd spotted a plot hole:SPOILER[quote]while there`s a serious plot hole at the end where it`s revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?[/quote]Actually, you just weren't watching the movie properly. Jack wasn't in a skeletal state all along. Shortly before the swordfight in the caves with Barbossa and being shown to be skeletal, Jack stole one of the cursed coins from the chest. When he was stabbed by Barbossa, he became skeletal because he was cursed from that moment on. This was made clear at the time when Jack's response to finding out he was suddenly skeletal was to declare, "That's interesting!", flip the stolen coin between his fingers and tell Barbossa, "I couldn't resist." Indicating that he was aware that it was his stealing the coin that had turned him skeletal once he was stabbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pirate For Our Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What lifts this film above typical Disney fluff is Johnny Depp's humorous performance as pirate Jack Sparrow, the eccentric, individualistic anti-hero, who confronts other pirates, and outwits a humorless, incompetent bureaucratic establishment. Sparrow looks more like Cher than Johnny Depp, and talks more like William F. Buckley than a pirate. Geoffrey Rush is a worthy foil as the main rival pirate, Barbossa, a character who vaguely resembles Margaret Hamilton in "The Wizard Of Oz".Most of the plot is silly. There's lots of fighting, shouting, and general mayhem, all accompanied by a frantic score. It's a cinematic slight of hand that conveys an illusion of substance. Still, it's an entertaining popcorn flick. I'm glad I watched it. Depp's deft performance gives us a memorable character, one that is perhaps unique in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---Mild Spoilers---This is my all time favorite after 30+ years of movie going. I've viewed it many times and was happy to see it surpass the $300 million mark!I just love the fact that everyone involved in this movie seemed to be h***-bent on entertaining us. Not to make us cry, not to make us think deeply, not to manipulate our feelings. Just good, old-fashioned entertainment with no profanity or nudity necessary. I'm glad such times are back.The cast was simply fantastic and they generously let the fun they were clearly having rub off on us. But they did not let this cause them to sacrifice one iota of dedication to their performances. Jack Davenport, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and outrageously talented Johnny Depp just swept us away. (I also can't neglect to mention Damian O'Hare, who had the small role as Lt. Gilette. Watch his facial expressions throughout the movie; he was just the perfect British prig, and I hope we see more of him in the future.) Relative rookie Kiera Knightley: not bad given her age; but she is much better in the scenes where she is angry than when she's Will-ting.I think that Davenport, Rush and Depp all delivered reasonably complex characters despite the superficial story line. Norrington is ambitious but also has a strong compassionate streak. Barbossa's integrity is his evilness, yet we can also see his weaknesses and humanity. Sparrow is like that friend we all have who is a bad boy but would do anything for you in the end, along with the many other traits Depp built into this character. Depp, by far, is the one who jumped off the screen and grabbed you and pulled you into the show. It's hard to say more, the guy is just astonishingly freakin' talented.I think that there were some nice themes in this movie. I especially liked the ending, given that Jack Sparrow spent a good deal of the movie in handcuffs, in jail, in the brig, walking the plank, stranded on an island, with guns pointed at him, on the gallows, etc. Combine all of that with his confession to Elizabeth (on the Island) of what the Black Pearl really is. Did we get set up to love that ending or what? I also like that the movie started and ended on the same song, and that Elizabeth at the beginning held the key to Jack's situation at the ending.The scenes with Jack and Barbossa in them together were by far the best. It takes until about halfway through the movie until we get them face to face. Their exchange at the plank-walking was priceless, as was the "parle" on board the Pearl. But that sword fight in the cave took all! It's new and it's classic all at once and it just feels like what pirate-movie-making should be all about.Speaking of pirates, I loved their scenes too, especially the "gents, take a walk" scene. I also loved the sly way that Mr. Cotton's parrot snuck in all of the pirate cliches that were just too cliche to work into the dialogue. Clever!Even if you don't like the story, just sit back and watch the scenery/great use of color and listen to the music. Nothing was left to chance in putting together a great visual and audio experience for us, and there is something for everyone here. I've seen many fun, witty, adventure and other movies. But this one is just above all in my book because it is having fun and entertains you up and down in the process. There are many reasons, I suppose, that people go to movies, but entertaining is really what they are for, and this film delivers in spades.It is no wonder all of the main cast signed up for the sequel/prequel (whatever it is). I, for one, can't wait!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is not y/our typical Errol Flynn type of machismo, swashbuckling pirate; nor does he play another Disney Captain Hook. He's more like Fagan in "Oliver." Capt. Sparrow's ever so fey. That's his charm.Though the pirates on the "Black Pearl" ship are dead &amp; sometimes in their skeleton form they aren't scary enough for kids since this is a comedy.The story line goes as follows: A governor's daughter is in charge of a young boy her own age who has been pulled out of the sea by her father's bourgeoisie crew. She notices his necklace is a pirate's &amp; takes it from him to protect him from being hung to death.But, the golden medallion is the last 1 of a pirate's treasure that has cursed the "Black Pearl" ship's crew. Without its return, with the blood of the boy on it, the skeletal crew remains dead, unable to feel any life in themselves; they are also not killable since they are already dead.Capt. Sparrow (Depp), though a bumbling comical pirate who's bent upon owning the "Black Pearl," the ship the cursed crew stole from him, plays a marvelously lovable &amp; lucky pirate who is the super glue that holds together the loose ends of the movie. Depp gives his cutest performance I've seen; he's now my favorite pirate! The script is clever; cinematography is fine; special effects are spot-on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the film, I thought it was awesome- the graphics were great and no doubt, Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Will Turner (Bloom) were hot in their own ways. I was surprised that Disney would have scary skeletons in a movie, but it was a very good film indeed.This movie starts off with a song about pirates, which, I think, is genius. Not subtle, not direct, just genius. The whole plot revolves around rescuing... and rescuing... and rescuing, again.The second time I saw this film, I thought it was disgusting. What the heck, I thought to myself. It's so... so... unrealistic (which is really unlike me, because I adore fantasy- just not too far-fetched in the fantasy world, like Mary-sue or people popping out of no where to help others). Until I saw it for the third time. I loved it then. (And yes, to watch a film for 3 times and have 3 different opinions each time makes the following statement true- 'there is obviously something wrong with me.') The thing that made me love this movie SOOOO very much was- 'Freedom'. As Sparrow had said, being a pirate is like having freedom. I had a knot in my stomach when I heard this- I mean, oh my god, I hated being trapped in a boring routine everyday. Being a pirate meant adventures, risks, excitement. And that really attached me to the movie. Whenever I read books or watch TV shows or movies about high adventures or fantasy, I almost cry because I'm not the main character- it's not me who's having all the fun, and reading these books or shows or movies might be the closest thing I will ever be to having the adventure of a lifetime.Watch this movie. It will give you a knot in the stomach if you will just pay close attention and hope to feel like you are one in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates is one of the best movies and Johnny Depp is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having always been interested in pirates, curses, and adventures (when it comes to movie entertainment) this movie appealed to me the first time I saw a preview for it. I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??) Again, I greatly applaud Johnny Depp's performance and I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay goofy pirate adventure, but kinda boring and forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't go to the theater too often. A film really has to light my fire to get me to actually go out and see it. Well, "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" got me interested enough to go see it when it was released in the summer of 2003. Why was I so interested? Probably because I occasionally enjoy fun adventure films in the manner of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981) or "The Mummy" (1999). "Black Pearl" is a film of this ilk.WHAT WORKS: The film looks and sounds great, which includes the actors, costuming, cinematography, locations and score. Johnny Depp as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow is a notable character; Sparrow comes off as a young Keith Richards gone Pirate. Keira Knightley is beautiful as Elizabeth Swann; and Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom &amp; Lee Arenberg are all fabulous in their roles.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: When I first saw it in 2003 the film struck me as too long for such lightweight fare (2 hours and 23 minutes). It also struck me as boring and forgettable for some reason. I decided to see it again recently and came away feeling the exact same way. What makes it boring and forgettable? I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint. Maybe because it's too drawn-out; light film fare like this works best at around 80-95 minutes. Maybe it's because many of the characters are unable to die because of the curse, which naturally creates a lack of suspense. Mostly it's because the story and characters, although fun, are absurd and superficial. Also, I suppose it's too much to expect to glean some morsel of depth or truth from a film like this.CONCLUSION: "Black Pearl" is a fun, goofy pirate adventure; it's okay but far from great like, say, "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or even the 1999 version of "The Mummy." It's overlong, overly light, kinda boring and ultimately forgettable. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a fan and can't recommend it, except maybe to kids. But if it trips your trigger that's great.GRADE: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two few action-adventure movies now a days that delivers such original characters, played by a truly incredible cast. When I first saw The Curse of the Black Pearl as a boy I was fascinated. There where Pirates, cannons, sword fights, treasures funny monkey's and a beautiful girl, What more could you possibly ask for. I can still remember when I saw Jack Sparrow for the first time. He may not of had the typical "hero" qualities that would see in somebody like say William Turner, but that is what made jack so undeniably brilliant, he wasn't somebody we have experienced before. He was a witty, drunk, Sword fighting Pirate, with a flare for the dramatic. Seen for the first time in possibly the greatest hero entranced ever made. I glanced my stunned eye's at the screen to behold the one they called Jack Sparrow, or should I say "Captain" Jack Sparrow. There he stood in all his glory, the anthem soundtrack blared as he stood on top of his wooden sinking ship, or boat... As he floats by the pirate outlaws hung by there necks, with a sign on them that states "pirates Ye Be Warned" he stops bailing his sinking boat in time to offer a kind salute, to his fellow dead pirates.Its not long in till we are swept away by a amazing story of a two men desperately trying to find the loves of there life. One a Pirate after his stolen ship, and the other, a working hard blacksmith boy, trying to find his true love. Luckily for them, both loves have been taken by the "crew of the dammed". Barbossa, the fearless pirate with a pet monkey, yes a pet monkey. It soon becomes apparent that everyone in the story wants something, and they will screw and back-stab anyone who gets in there way, honestly this film there are know such thing as true friends, everyone will become an enemy in time.After years of watching this film, it still reveals itself as nothing more but a great adventure movie, just plain fun. So why not give it ten out of ten. There is everything you want in an adventure movie, girls, fights and a little magic and mystery. Not to mention some of the best 1-liners you will ever hear, "you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner, you're in one", and my personal favourite, the very last line in the film, as Jack prepares to embark on more of his adventures he quotes "bring me that horizon" as the ship sales off into the sunset.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the drawbacks to seeing a big movie, an immensely popular film from a few years back is that you enter into it with such preconceived notions that the flick will be . . . good? I saw Pirates of the Caribbean over the weekend and it was just so much fuss and feathers, a gory, tedious mess. Since you already know the story, I'll tell you why POTC stunk (stank? stinked?). I don't think this movie knew exactly what it wanted to be. It could have been a jolly, smartassed romp or an exciting and suspenseful thriller or a story of love and devotion. Since it tried for all three, it missed.The female lead (something Knightley?) was bland, the Orlando Bloom character was also a nothing, the baddies weren't even there unless the moon was out, and Johnny Depp left me totally confused. His simpering, effeminate Jack Sparrow spent the movie lurching and reeling as if Depp wanted to impress you with his Foster Brook's impression.I wasn't.Needless to say, if anyone reads this review, I'll be earning my one zillionth "unhelpful" vote on IMDb. I don't write that I don't like movies to get people to react negatively but to get them to ponder whether or not what they liked was actually good or just popular.Pirates was staggeringly popular . . .and awful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not originally see the movie in the theater but rented it when it came out on video and loved it. I have eventually bought it and have watched it so many times I have lost count. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was really good and you couldn't help but love him. I also liked that the movie didn't have a lot of gore and sex in it but still kept the viewer captivated. As for T. Robertson's comment on Captain Sparrow having been under the curse too the whole time-he was not. Jack only came under the curse after having slipped a coin out of the chest after Will had been captured (You have to watch closely). That in itself was rather clever on Sparrow's part since you can't do battle with an immortal pirate and win if you are mortal. :-)This one definitely ranks in my top ten favorite movies. I hope they make another one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really does steal the screen!This is, without doubt, my favourite movie of all time. It was brilliantly written, performed, filmed, and put together. I cannot work out the mystery of why critics gave it such bad reviews. The special effects were excellent, as well.I was very choked that it did not get a single Oscar award. I especially couldn't believe that Return of the King got best Makeup over it. I saw NO makeup in that (the Orcs were people wearing masks), and then in Pirates, in come Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in spectacular makeup. I certainly think that Johnny should have gotten "Best Actor" for Jack Sparrow rather than Sean Penn.A great movie for all pirate lovers out there, and well - any movie lover out there.</fullReview>

It's a wild ride that keeps you laughing and thrilled from beginning to end. Johnny Depp is incredibly funny and incredibly sexy, and since potc I have become a JD addict, which is costing me a fortune on Ebay. The special effects are perfect - the pirates are very funny and not overdone at all. It is fun for all the family, and I can't think of anybody who isn't a complete kill joy, who wouldn't enjoy this film. It's always worth a watch when you need cheering up. I have seen it around 9 or 10 times and there will be more. Can't wait for the sequel, and praying that they can secure Johnny for part 3 too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jolly Good Pirate Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this while babysitting my neighbor's kids ages 9 and 12. They liked it a lot, I thought it was okay. I got a little bored about half-way but not enough to turn it off, I wanted to see how they would wrap it all up.It has some neat effects and the story line is pretty good, every kid wonders what it would be like to do something amazing. The acting was pretty good, especially from Johnny Depp he delivers an excellent performance. The beautiful Keira Knightley delivers a good but not great performance and so does eye candy Orlando Bloom. I think that this movie is a good movie for Keira Knightley's future career, she is a beautiful young actress that has a lot of potential. I thinks that she would be in many of the future "big" movies! I also think that Orlando Bloom would become a big actor, but I don't think that he will become bigger than Keira Knightley. Well this wasn't the greatest pirate movie ever told, but the potential for it to be above average is definitely there. I went into this movie expecting it to suck right up there with one of those crazy Lampoon type spoofs of a movie, not to mention something that was just for kids. I was totally wrong. Me being a 18 year old adult found it to be quite humorous and quite exciting in most parts. Johnny Depp, in my opinion was cast perfectly for the role. Of course I tend to be a bit biased when it comes to good ol' Johnny( I loved him in Edward Scissorhands). He definitely shines in all of his performances and will blossom into one of the great actors of the upcoming generation. As far as this movie goes, its all about having fun, and that's exactly what Johnny accomplished with this film... hail Jack Sparrow (Johnny). When I took my cousin out to see "Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl", I fully expected to be bored and go away hoping that at least the children enjoyed it... boy, was I surprised! Johnny Depp played a great pirate, and Keira Knightley was a cute rich girl. I thought it was really funny and full of action, and my cousin thought it was "really cool!" It's a creative family flick...fun for the whole family. (Even I enjoyed it!) I think this movie will be on every kid's top ten for a while to come...as for me, I'll be waiting for a sequel. I know what you're thinking, and you're right. Keira Knightley's acting really doens't leave much to be desired, but the witty script, good lead from Johnny Depp and excellent fighting make this a must see. A great movie. I liked "Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl". It was cool, funny, thrilling, and had a lot of action. Although I am a big fan of Keira Knightley's and was disappointed at her acting in this movie. Sure, she was great in "The Hole" but in this movie I found her to be a bit over-the-top. I know Keira could've done better than that. On the other hand, Johnny Depp did great playing Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira's clothes weren't really appropriate for a PG movie. But I thought this movie was a little bit too intense for a PG and for little kids under the age of 7 to watch. Some of the violence was just a tiny bit intense. In one scene they show Will running his hand up Elizabeth's chest, but I don't think it was meant in a sexual way, and some woman show cleavage and look like prostitutes. But I still recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, you should!!Pirates of the Carribean :Curse of the Black Pearl has an interesting premise even if at first I was a little cautious about it. But we must look at it from the right point of view, meaning like a kid would. Who never wished to be to be a pirate? Even today I think about it.Johnny Depp is perfect for the role. He represents a feisty pirate captain. Orlando Bloom is also great as his tough, icy partner. The amazingly beautiful Keira Knightley however suffers from a huge lack of screen time. Her acting could also be better and we can clearly notice the girl has a huge ego. With her looks she can go far no doubt about it. But she has to be a little humble and be ready to learn. I'm not sure that is the case. With full knowledge of the power of her physical side she appears not the least interested and I would say even bored throughout the movie.The story is simple and without a touch of reality to it, just like it was supposed to be. The humor however could be more efficient. Some jokes, maybe too many, fall flat. The action could also have been improved. It's not even close to spectacular. The opening scene is very attractive but then all we get is some explosions and a few swashbuckling fights. There's also some violence, but nothing too extreme.POTC:COTBP has some flaws. Its slow to build, some scenes fail miserably and sometimes its just too stupid.But since I'm not in its target audience. not anymore, I would recommend it because I still enjoyed it very much. It has a light, childish atmosphere that works very well and provides an innocent fun. This was a very entertaining film for anyone of any age. It had cool action, and good special effects. Johnny Depp was good as Jack and was excellent at playing the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.Perfect Film to take the whole family to. This was also pretty funny. Very good action/family/comedy/pirate movie.Loved this movie! Saw a free sneak preview and would pay to see it again. Johnny Depp was crazy/wonderful as usual. Funny, creative, handsome, surprising - as he always is.Orlando Bloom was like a young Errol Flynn. He was a dream in Lord of the Rings and this proves that was no fluke. He can act, he's good to look at - has a sweet personality and the physicality to carry the role. The swordplay between Bloom and Depp was terrific!Geoffrey Rush pushed the envelope at being wonderfully hammy and the rest of the cast was simply great.Beautifully visual, a bit too long, but worth the ride. And I mean Ride!Really cool! 8.5/10I liked the action parts and the skeleton pirates. If you think of yourself in place of the actors,it helps you get a feeling of how the actor were.There is also romance at the end of the movie.I would recommend this movie.Went to see this on a rainy evening on vacation with my cousin. They loved it, and my parents and I enjoyed the experience too.Depp is an excellent lead - charming and likable, and the other cast members are well cast. Interesting story, good dialog, pretty decent special effects, great pace and length - what more could one ask for?AND IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER FREAKING PIRATE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl truly is a work of art.With the notable exceptions that the Disney logo is slapped on beside the title and a ride bearing its name exists within their parks, this is far from the cliché kiddy flicks they have grown famous for. It's obvious that they've done little other than collect royalties and throw a killer premiere party for this film, leaving it in the very capable hands of Verbinski and Bruckheimer. So for those of you who swore off seeing it, claiming you'd rather die than deal with little mermaids and lion kings, get over yourselves and give it a try.First off, this film brought together the very best of Hollywood, with a stacked cast both in front of, and behind, the camera. It is obvious from the beginning that more than one or two people threw their all into this production, for everything oozed precision.The ships were incredible and the attention to detail was startling, especially on the Black Pearl. The cursed pirate vessel was everything one would imagine it to be. The weathered wood was dark as were the shredded sails (although they were a bit over done and sort of resembled Swiss cheese, but you can't win 'em all...) and everything was draped with cobwebs and immersed in fog; it was incredible.The setting was utterly breathtaking, and the views of clear blue-green waters, white sand beaches, and tropical foliage were enough to make anyone in the audience damn near suicidal. The re-creation of the colonial ports was very well done and, once again, the attention to detail was insane!But the storefronts and marketplaces would not have gone far without the great work of the many extras employed. Between soldiers, sailors, and townsfolk, the amount of people needed for filler was staggering, and yet they seemed to find the very best to provide a foundation for this story. The pirates were especially well done, reviving the idea that the supporting characters can, and will, steal the show. They were funny and disgusting cutthroats who each had their own personalities and quirks, making it seem like there were eighty main characters instead of four.Speaking of the main characters, the casting done for these roles was simply masterful. While the character of Will Turner is a bit melodramatic and annoying, Orlando Boom's good looks and some really smart one-liners make him loveable in the end. Kiera Knightly's character wasn't all that special or different, but she shined in her portrayal of the beautiful rich girl who secretly longs for adventure and the not so rich boy, so snaps to her. Geoffrey Rush was Captain Barbossa, and it is next to impossible to imagine him as anything else. His gait, his costumes, his speech, it only added to his mystique, making it completely impossible to outright loathe his character even though you know you should.But the man of the hour is without a doubt Johnny Depp. Known for taking the most bizarre and least publicized roles, he went from the pasty introverted Edward Scissorhands characters to a very tan, very loud, and very drunk pirate by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow, solidifying his status as one of the foremost acting talents of his day. With the aid of incredible costuming and extremely witty writing, Depp becomes the man, swaggering and slurring, not once falling out of character. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this performance, the Academy is most definitely on all of the drugs in Raoul Duke's damned briefcase.Basically, this film is a gem, and while it doesn't solve world hunger or confuse the viewer into a coma, it does take the audience away from their humdrum lives and into a simpler time where adventure was a way of life, not office work in a cubicle. Many people have griped about this film, and to them I say this: There simply isn't a need to overanalyze it, so just sit back and enjoy, and grow a sense of humor, for Pete's sake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting and sexy fantasy film (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean" is a fine fantasy movie. The poster alone conveys all the elements to be found here: action, mystery, piracy and a hint of sexy romance. The result is a slick and exciting film that entertains from beginning to end.A brief sequence at the beginning shows a young girl, at sea with her sailor father (Jonathan Pryce), retrieve a mysterious medallion from the neck of a drowning boy. The young girl grows up into the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and the young man, who has admired from afar, is now a local sword-maker Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in a Mediterranean coastal town. Chaos ensues Elizabeth is captured by undead pirates led by Captain Barrabosa (Geoffrey Rush), who need Elizabeth's medal to restore their souls. With the aid of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a mad pirate, Turner sets after Barrabosa, intending to rescue Elizabeth....The story is excellent, very conventional but enjoyably so. The usual pirate cliches are in evidence; buried treasure, scurvy seadogs, buxom damsels in distress and dashing heroes. All of this works through a line of outrageous humour that satirizes the kind of thing the film is paying homage to.The technical aspect of the film is marvellous. Well lit and directed with sumptous costumes, scenery and props, it looks great. Special effects are a good mix of CGI and model work. Fight scenes are fantastic, the first duel between Turner and Sparrow, and the last between Sparrow and Barrabosa being especially inventive and memorable.Johnny Depp all but steals the movie as mad pirate Sparrow. With a raspy Cockney English accent, and a sense of humour that's ahead of his time, it's a very memorable performance. Only Geoffrey Rush as the villain can really stand out with him on board, and Rush turns in his usual fine performance. Orlando Bloom plays the straight good guy role he's fashioned so well in "Lord of the Rings", and Keira Knightly is gorgeous and spunky as the girl of his dreams. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport are on hand to play the standard British fops.Never dragging on, there is not a moment wasted here. They certainly don't make them like this any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a time where movies of this type had practically disappeared or bombed badly at the box office (Cut Throat Island springs to mind), it is nice to see Hollywood once again embracing this classic genre.Despite suffering from a mild case of over hype, this is actually a very good movie, mixing in modern day film making with the classic pirate yo ho ho's without getting all lost at sea (Da-Dum!!)Johnny Depp plays the lovable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow who along with the dashing Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, sail the Caribbean Seas to stop a ship of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew, who are trying to break an ancient curse... by using the blood of the Governor's daughter (Knightly)From the outset the film is light hearted and playful in tone giving it an old fashioned ?boys own adventure' feel without coming across as camp. The set design, locations and costumes are fantastic and really help to set the scene and create the atmosphere.The story is told well and although getting bottle necked at times, keeps a jaunty pace. There is plenty of swash buckling sword fights and sea bound action, plus some effective if sometimes overused computer driven effects to create the cursed pirates.All of the main performances are strong. Bloom is fresh faced and as charming as a modern day Douglas Fairbanks (if sometimes too much of a goody goody), Knightly is beautiful and compelling, adding a touch of glamour and Rush is superbly extravagant and plays his part with a good sense of fun.However all are very nearly played off the screen by Depp as Sparrow, a fantastic character who is swaggered, eccentrically unrefined, wiley, self-promoting and loveably roguish. This is one of Depp's more funny and notable performances making the film worth watching for him alone.I have no doubt that we will see more of Captain Sparrow in the future and I will look forward to it as POTC was head and shoulders above the rest in a summer of disappointing blockbusters.</fullReview>

Like most films, there are a couple of holes here and there in the fabric of the story; but this film wasn't made for the Oscars, it's meant to entertain and it succeeds in full at that.

		<shortDescription>The best movie to be created....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tops them all with AMAZING direction, AMAZING moods, AMAZING music and mostly AMAZING OF ALL AMAZINGS... acting! I have the biggest passion for Johnny Depp and thought this was the most hilarious role to have him play. He did it flawlessly! and he's so hot! Just an added bonus. Orlando Bloom was probably at his best in this movie as well, and because i don't really like him at all, that is definitely a huge compliment to say the least. And if all i told you about this movie is that it was produced by Jerry Bruckhiemer, then you would automatically know it is something worth watching. From The Amazing Race, to CSI, Jerry Bruckhiemer produces everything worth watching. And don't get me started on the flawlessly beautifully talented Keira Knightly. She is beautiful, has the cutest accent and is extremely talented! Honestly, if you didn't like this movie you have got to have something seriously wrong with you - it's a classic to be remembered for the rest of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie works so well on a variety of levels. Despite being so outlandish, Depp's pirate is clever, creative and believable ... except that he doesn't seem like he'd ever be able to back down a crew of pirates; to wit, his crew abandoned him on a desert island. That he could come back over and and over would create respect in many and, sometimes, those who seem craziest are most feared, so perhaps he could do it.Verbinski knows what he's doing but I wish so much of the movie hadn't rested on Depp's shoulders. That being said, it still works beautifully and Depp's acting is spot on. I guess it comes down to this: When you're watching the movie it can be totally absorbing and any criticisms spring to mind only when the lights are up and I've moved on to other things. I've seen the movie several times and get sucked in every time. If I were to judge a movie only by my thoughts after it's over, that wouldn't be fair. I believe you have to judge a movie mostly by what's on your mind during it and give much less criticism after wards. The movie IS the moment, not the trip home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this is one of the best movies that i have ever seen. I own it on DVD and watch it every time that i get the chance. I can not wait for the next one. Hopefully it is as good as the first, but i have no doubts. Johnny Depp is a great actor and he plays the part of Jack Sparrow well. Orlando Bloom is great too. I think that all the actors played a big part in making the movie and they put it all together and made it come to life. Thanks to everyone involved!! The next one sounds really good and as soon as it comes out i am going to gather up all of my friends and we are going to go see it in theater. It is going to be really fun and i hope that it comes out soon because i can't wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of reality TV. When I watch TV, read a book, or go to a movie, I want to escape from the real world for a while. POTC is just such a movie. I was never a Johnny Depp fan, but seeing him in this show made me one. He is the coolest pirate ever. He was funny, cool, arrogant, daring, dashing, brave, cunning, and many other things throughout. There was plenty of action - never a dull moment. I liked it so much that I have the DVD and have watched it many, many times and don't get bored with it. Now I am trying to see anything I can with Johnny Depp in it. The other actors all did a great job, from Captain Barbarosa to Elizabeth and William to all the other pirates. I loved this movie!! I just have one question - "But why is the rum gone?"!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp Perfect!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magnificent! I will start off with the one problem so that I can end by thrashing it with compliments: Too long. If they had just cut out all the crap in the scenes which made this movie so long it would've gotten a perfect 10 from me (I gave it a 9). But anyway, no movie is perfect. To the compliments, Jack Sparrows (Johnny Depp) was out of this world. His performance was just outstanding. No one in my opinion could have done the role better and I could probably find a better person for the role of just about every main role in a movie except this one. The way he says things are the kind of jokes that make you laugh in your head and think about what and outstanding movie it is without laughing out loud. It's like when you go a movie with someone and you don't hear them laugh once but when they come out they say it was the funniest movie they've ever seen it's because the jokes are the kind that if you laugh out loud you're going to sound crazy. That's what all comedies look for and this one got it right with Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the "Pirates of the Caribbean" was released, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. However, I finally managed to watch it many months later and I LOVED it!It's a breath-taking movie, with an interesting plot and great performances from the actors. Although the movie is a little bit long, nobody can get bored while watching it. What I liked most -and I think most people liked- is Johnny Depp's performance. He was GREAT, he perfectly played the role of Jack Sparrow and whenever he appeared, he was "breaking" the "gravity" that prevailed in the movie and turned everything more pleasant and funny, by reminding us that he's a really great actor, something he has already proved many times so far.Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were also very good and proved that they are two talented actors. However, they are still quite young and I personally think that their performances seemed rather indifferent, comparing to Geoffrey Rush's and Johnny Depp's.To sum up: I found this a great movie and anyone who hasn't watched it yet, he should definitely buy the DVD!Finally: Many people say it's a good movie, while others disagree. However, there is one point that nobody can doubt: Even if you are not a fan of such movies, it's worth watching just for Johnny Depp!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though supposedly a movie for Orlando Bloom....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that was suppose to have Orlando as lead, is taken by my beloved Johnny Depp. I have been a fan of his since I can't even remember how far back. I not only drool over him, his talent is true and original. How many sexy males do you know that would or could pull off a very believable rendition of a punk-rock pirate named Jack Sparrow. The plot is almost perfectly mending to all genre's and pulls anyone in by its diverse levels of movie goers. If you like action, comedy, and anything with Johnny Depp, this is the one to see. I recommend other Johnny Depp movies, and that you keep watch on Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom for other upcoming movies to see that they are savvy actors and actresses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Originally I thought this movie wouldn't be so great, but after I saw it, I realized how stupid I had been. This movie is fantastic. It's Romantic, funny, a little scary, historical, and, of course, action packed. Is there any genre this movie ISN'T? The plot and characters are well-developed, and It's the kind of movie that you just want to see over and over again. And, it seems to get better every time I see it (approximately 10 times)! The only flaw is the fact that if bootstrap bill had in fact taken a piece of gold (which we know he did; he sent it to Will) then he would have been affected by the curse. And..If he was affected by the curse, he would be immortal. So...How did launching him off a cannon into the ocean kill him? I guess that's why there's a "Pirates of the Caribbean 2"... I can't wait. As Captain Jack Sparrow might say, "Go see this movie. Savvy?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good action movie; needed better editors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have probably seen this movie 15 times. I love movies and I am terribly critical of them. When I read the goofs page on this movie, I was shocked to see how many there were. IT is not good that the editors let so many slide. But, as a whole, this is a great mindless movie. I read a review by another user that said a good movie is one that raises important issues and questions; I agree. But, there can be other kinds of good movies. This is one! Watch it with an empty mind needing entertainment and the willingness to pass off goofs by saying "it is a movie" and you will find great satisfaction in Pirates. All in all, I would call this a new classic because it appeals to the masses who generally care nothing for "great art films".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp, in my humble opinion, has been ignored far too long by Tinseltown. His acting in this film was truly gifted and inspired. If you have not seen this movie, please do so. Mr. Depp is able to completely submerge in whatever character he plays and he does so amazingly in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. A pirate with a heart of gold! Oh, the movie is great, too! Orlando Bloom is fantastic and the special effects are quite phenomenal. I cannot believe that the Disney Studies actually produces this film so perhaps there is still hope for them after Eisner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie was awesome!!Johnny Depp can play any character he's a well rounded actor, one of the best in the business (I feel). He's not to bad on the eyes either:). I'm so excited he's going to be in the 2nd movie, I feel that if they had chosen some one else to play Cpt. Jack Sparrow, Will Turner or Elizabeth Swan, it really would have not made sense. I saw the movie 6 times mainly for the actors and the plot it was very interesting and well thought out. Many people said it was too long, I believe it was perfect it kept getting interesting just as you thought Jack was going to be hung Will's to the rescue and then you think Jack and Will are caught and will go to jail Elizabeth is there. Best movie Gore is going to have trouble making the second look good as the first, hopefully it will come close. Music for the movie was great too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, to sum it all up this is my FAVORITE movie of all time.It appeals to a wide range of people from kids to adults it has something for everyone. It never speaks down to its audience and the script is pure genius. The characters are so well developed that you feel that you have known them all your life.Johnny Depp however, is the pride of this film. He shines through as the mischievous, and mysterious, Captain Jack Sparrow. His acting skills are amazing as he creates a character that is surely the most memorable pirate to ever sail the Spanish Main.It is BRILLIANT, the movie never slows, never bores its audience. I am sure you can now see why this is my favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a definite Two Thumbs Up! for Disney! A great movie filled with swashbuckling adventure, beautiful scenery, and the best of the best -- Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom! The chemistry between the two of them was a beautiful thing to see! I bought it on DVD and have almost worn the disc out, enjoying every second over and over again. I am definitely looking forward to their second one and hope it will be out soon! Even the female, Kiera, was good, though we all could have done without the Will/Elizabeth romance at the end! About the only bad things in the story were the bad pirates and the lack of Will sailing away into the sunset with Sparrow on their ship! These two fine actors deserve a pat on the back and more like about a thousand stars for making their characters likable, enduring, and leaving a taste on your tongue for wanting more! I highly recommend it for all family members! Once seen, this movie will stay with a fond place in your heart forever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A positive review of Pirates of the Caribbean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie and I thought it was excellent. Admittedly, I originally was only going to see it for Orlando Bloom, but I ended up loving the film as a whole. The actors are excellent in their individual roles and all worked very well together. Johnny Depp was hilarious and portrayed a unique and lovable pirate. Geoffrey Rush played an excellent adversary who was both sinister and entertaining. Orlando Bloom played his part of a devoted lover wonderfully despite many people's opinions that he was weak and too lovey-dovey. The plot was interesting and captivating, and although I found a loophole, I think it was purposeful as they are making a sequel. Wonderful special effects and sets helped to make this movie excellent. Wonderful direction from Gore Verbinski held this movie together and an awesome score by Klaus Badelt accompanied the entire movie very well. Overall, I thought it was an excellently made movie that was fun for all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best pirate movies you will see in a long while. That is until they make the sequel. Pirates of the Caribbean, is an action adventure film with a great cast and a wonderful story line. It starts in Port Royal, Jamaica. Where Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by a crew of cursed pirates. Right before the kidnapping a pirate by the name of Jack Sparrow comes into town looking to commandeer a ship. Sparrow agrees to team up with Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner in search of Elizabeth. But what Will does not know is that Jack is linked to the kidnapping and the cursed pirates in more ways than one. To find out the rest, see the movie! A must see for all adventure lovers and Johnny Depp fans of course! Take my word, a great movie. My rating is an A!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski follows up The Ring with this incredible family film. Johnny Depp turns in another incredible performance that should get a laugh out of everyone. This is the type of incredible family adventure/comedy that should be a favorite of the youth in this generation as The Princess Bride was for those before it. Both movies give you that good feeling and have that quality where you never get sick of watching it and hearing the lines over and over. This is a film that everyone should see a couple of times, just to enjoy the pure fun it has to offer. The great film was a surprise to me, since I knew it was based off of a Disney ride and I thought it was going to be a film for kids, but it is definitely something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Captain Jack Sparrow is the pathetic yet savvy and smooth pirate that you can't help rooting for. Orlando Bloom is the one actor I don't particularly care for in any movie, but he doesn't bother me in this one. Geoffry Rush is cast perfectly and the special effects are nice. If you haven't seen this great film yet, go out and rent it or buy the DVD which is loaded with extras that will keep you happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before this film i had never heard of Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly or Geoffery Rush but i had heard of Orlando Bloom. I had never even seen the trailer to 'Pirates of the Caribbean'! My sister first saw the film and told me so much about it and told me that I really should go and see it with her... I kept on saying no because it just didn't appeal to me. I then spoke to other people about it who said it was great so i finally decided to go and see it. From start to finish i was taken on a swashbuckling adventure! It had everything that a movie should have... love, comedy, adventure, a kidnapping and cursed pirates after treasure. The film was mainly carried by the fantastic Johnny Depp... playing the slightly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow who's main mission in the film is to get back his ship 'the Black Pearl'. However, he ends up taking on board Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) a blacksmith who is in love with the Governers daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates and it is up to Jack and Will to save her. However the Pirates are cursed and are neither living nor dead...they must repay their blood otherwise they will be cursed forever. So as you can see there is a lot to go by on the film. Can Jack Sparrow be trusted? Will they reach Elizabeth before it is too late? Will the pirates ever be rid of the dreaded curse? Watch this film as it is perfect for anyone! This film is one of the best epics every made! Watch it...you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a huge fan of The Pirates of the Caribbean long before the movie, so I was very nervous--would the movie do justice to the attraction? Or would it be another stinky pirate movie? The first time I saw it, though, I knew it would be a hit. The casting was perfect, the music spectacular, the special effects astounding, the story intriguing--this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in a long time. It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the "damsel in distress" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only "cardboard" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels. Even if he doesn't, though, this will be one of his best roles ever, and it's truly a movie that everyone involved can be proud of.</fullReview>

Sure there is efforts to have a dense story and there are strong characters and funny back roles as well, but the way it's told and filmed isn't dynamic : so it's a pure Disney movie as every age can follow what happens on screen, old or young ! The action sequences are quite boring and repetitive, Deep gets irritating with his pantomimes, Pryce with his usual dandy manner (he is not John Cleese !) and getting aboard and out of ships isn't really exciting at the end ! With this dragging ambiance, i felt again asleep when Keira was abducted ! At least she was here because she is really the revelation of this movie as well as the fighting skeletons by moonlight ! Withtout them, i couldn't have sustain such a long movie for which i have the big feeling to have seen it already before !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curse of Jack Sparrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean are without a doubt one of the best movie series of all time, but as it happens, The Curse of the Black Pearl is the worst one of these movie series.The jokes are lame, Jack's mimicry not even funny. Elizabeth and Will make a boring couple and there is no chemistry between Keira and Orlando.The story is boring, confusing, twisting into such incomprehensible storyline and dumb scenes, that if you won't sleep yourself to death, then thumb up.But why did I bother to watch the sequels, when this one I didn't like? Because I happened to watch the sequels first and loved the story of The Dead Man's Chest and the sequel of its storyline in the third movie At World'd End. I completely got into the story without even watching the first one, so it seems.Meant as introduction this Curse of the Black Pearl is, but there is no introduction at all. You can well meet the characters in the sequels and don't need to be sorry for skipping this one.Barbossa as the main villain is lame, old, boring and inexpressive, nothing compared what is to come next. He doesn't even have his own soundtrack song, and well, speaking of the OST, there isn't much to say either. I promise, watching the sequels will make you laugh at sophisticated jokes and hold your breath when the REAL enemy comes.This Curse of the Black Pearl is nothing more than a fairytale for 10-year-old boys. The only reason why I've given it 5 stars are for the respect I keep for its two younger brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special Effects: 10, Storyline: 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of both Depp and the original Pirates. Naturally I went into this movie with a bit of skepticism as I do with ANY sequel. My daughter (15) had seen it twice and raved about it. So my 13 year old son and I went today. As we walked out, he said EXACTLY what was going thru my head: "I was kind of bored". Me, too.Special effects do not a movie make any more. We've come to expect that. Something that NEVER changes, though, is the critical element of a strong plot, something that "Dead Man's Chest" lacks. As near as my son and I could figure, the whole plot line was that everyone wanted Davy Jones' heart to control the seas. Yawn. The rest was a showcase for some admittedly fantastic special effects.Another gripe I had with this movie, as I do with many nowdays, is that the trend towards such utterly authentic dialogue almost makes much of the dialogue incomprehensible. Okay, maybe it's because I'm "old" (51) and my hearing sucks. But the dialects used by Naomi Harris (Tia Dalma) as well as the usual cast of ragamuffin sailors, was often impossible to understand. I love the realism; I hate the fact that I missed so much of the dialogue.It's hard - almost impossible - for a sequel to live up to the expectations of an original. Only a very few ("Aliens" for example) can come close or achieve it. In my opinion, and my son's, "Dead Man's Chest" fell a bit short. Am I glad I saw it? Absolutely. I was moderately entertained. Would I see it again or buy it on DVD? Absolutely not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>copy of monkey island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this film has completely copied the famous 1990 computer game monkey island. In which the governors daughter is kidnapped by an undead pirate ghost and you have to rescue her. It even copies ideas like being stranded on an island and going crazy (like how herman toothrot was stranded on monkey island for so long and went mad). The idea of finding a ship and a crew. And it copies other things like not only it being set in the caribbean and having a voodoo lady, but the actual set and having to row through a swamp to get to the voodoo lady's shack, pirate towns made of broken ships and so many things just completely lifted from the game and lazily put into the film. The main villain of Pirates of the Caribbean also looks identical to the villain in Monkey Island. If you search for this on google, youtube, or anything, you can see how pirates of the caribbean just completely ripped off this game and is a really uninspired unoriginal film. The thing I did like about the film is probably Johnny Depp who seemed to play an alright quirky, silly pirate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent (but overrated) adventure flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie. I consider it to be a very well done pop-corn flick which was very well directed, managed to combine in a clever way the comedy, the adventure, the action and the fantasy (And this even adds some little hints of horror) without insulting the intelligence of the viewers.It is something that whole family could enjoy, and it certainly has many virtues that deserve appreciation: The production values are wonderful, the soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is excellent, and the performances of the entire cast were more than appropriate. Even when the story of the movie isn't very deep or complex, the result is pretty satisfying.What I don't understand is the absurd comparisons between this movie and superior films such as "The Lord of the Rings" from Peter Jackson or the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Those movies are in a completely different league, and (for me, at least) were life-changing experiences, with many memorable scenes, while this didn't have anything remotely comparable to that. "Pirates of the Caribbean" it's a decent adventure flick, but it's way too overrated. Well, at least this movie was worth-watching and entertaining, unlike the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp is Awesome, Pirates is Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is a huge movie. However, quite a disappointment. Pirates starts off right. The first appearance of Jack sparrow is quite funny and effective. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Sparrow. His performance is top notch as the dubious and ragged pirate. The story is unconvincing. I truly never understood the curse at all.Pirates does have some excellent sword combat. We see one between Sparrow and Turner(Orlando bloom)does quite well. The dialog here is mostly lame. It would have been better with good dialog or if these two just fought without saying a word. Some later combat is just lame. Your opponent is a undead monster that can't be stopped by your sword. If the two were living, then the combat would be much more satisfying. The sword combat does suffer from being repetitive as well.Johnny Depp aside, the acting here is okay. Nothing breathtaking. Keira Knightly is great eye candy, but seems like wasted talent here. Orlando Bloom is not bad, just over-acts his role. Keep it simple kid. There are many others but the only other one worth mentioning is Geoffory Rush. He has one line in this movie that is just juicy. Every time I hear it, it just rules.The Special FX are amazing. Convoluted story aside, the skeletal pirates are dazzling to just look at. Never has the undead looked this good. Most of the comedy does not work well here. There are exceptions to that though. Example, Jack Sparrow, no matter the situation always gets annoyed when he is not referred to as "Captian". Another is The Black Pearl is getting damaged during a sea battle and during all the danger, Jack shouts out: "Stop putting holes in my ship!". Depp is good like I say.Pirates also suffers from overstaying it's welcome. It's just too long of a movie. Also, one sequence of scenes that should have been immediately sent to the cutting room floor are the scenes with the Govener dealing with a severed hand. Useless and plain annoying. I did not much care for the pirate with the fake eye either.The Last Word: Pirates, not a terrible movie is not engaging enough either. There are some high marks and lows. To many characters and a difficult story. Depp is the best. Jack Sparrow is very likable. Pirates just could have been a much better movie. **1/2/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High production values do not cancel out the mostly hollow affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This big budget swashbuckler reinstated Hollywood's interest in pirates, reaffirmed Johhny Depp as a bankable mainstream leading man, and refocused the industry with it's surprisingly high box office performance, followed by an even more surprising (though widely regarded as inferior) net gain from it's sequel. So why did I not have half the fun as I was anticipating with The Curse of the Black Pearl? Despite having all the key ingredients at making this rousing adventure come to life, Pirates still flounders with a repetitious script, an overkill of production, and of course the general disengaged, auto-piloted mentality that one immediately associates with any massive studio release. Yes, Depp's inspired take as the woozy captain Jack Sparrow does breathe some fresh air into the stale script, though his acting, more often then not, devolves into processed caricature rather then the engaged perceptiveness we are used to seeing from an accomplished actor such as Depp. Also, the casting of uber-talented Geoffry Rush did help break up much of the monotony the time-killing script wished to parlay. Ultimately though, these elevated Hollywood performances are buried under ten tons of sheen, smoke, and explosions that could only be appropriately titled "The Bruckheimer effect" which finds the mega- producer, as usual, filling in any actual emotional content with a barrage of over-excessive special effects and action sequencing. Shame too, because with Depp at the helm, and the few scenes that show off the inherent humor, personality and flavor this franchise could have offered, it became obvious that this could have been so much more memorable then the hollow ride it turns out to be. As far as popcorn family entertainment goes, I can justify the massive amount of success the movie has reaped, although to elevate this movie past the point of good, into the realm of great, as many reviewers have done, seems well overrated, as I mostly spent my two and a half hours waiting for the resolution in this lackluster plot.</fullReview>

And then I realized that is in Pirates just changed slightly. It pisses me off that you have to go and steal music from another movie especially since its one of the best movies ever made. Gladiator = KICK ASS Pirates = Music Stealer/not as good as Gladiator So if you think Pirates is good well watch Gladiator instead cause it kicks Pirates ass any day of the week!!!! I mean Johnny Depp was good and all but people make him out to be God in this movie. I'm sick of all the hype and people having orgasisms over these movies. I mean OK they are good we get it already!! Now if you want to see some good acting watch GLADIATOR!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bunch of pirates have been cursed and need the blood of a certain individual to break the curse. They end up chasing two englishpersons, Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley, and Will played by Orland Bloom. Helping them out is the good guy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow played by Depp.Depp gives an energetic performance to be sure but this movie goes way over the top with outrageous scenes and dialogue that would never happen in real life. I love action-adventure movies and I wish the producers had taken this show seriously and left out all the slapstick. There's even a running gag about a pirate with a glass eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie, but doesn't deserve such high praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Johnny Depp is one of today's greatest actors and it's amazing that he'd dedicate so much time and effort to a character in a flavour-of-the-month fad movie like this one. But really, that's all there is to this film. If another actor entirely had played Jack Sparrow, this movie would get a 5 from me, tops. It is simply an extremely forgettable film. In 20 years, who will even remember who played Will Turner or Elizabeth Swann? Knightly and Bloom are good to look at, but they'll soon be past their expiration date and, let's face it, no one watches their movies for their acting.The entire movie consists mainly of CGI skeletons, CGI ships and tired children's' humour derived from would-be funny characters (the transvestite ghosts, whatever their names were, are the most forgettable sidekicks this side of Tantor). The plot is as uninteresting as they come. The only reason to see this film is Depp, and although his performance is positively amazing, it's not enough to boost this flick to "great movie" status. His great job and the gorgeous Caribbean scenery is enough to make this movie an above average kids' flick, but no more, no less.There's not much else to say on the subject, so I'll leave you eunuchs to re-watch the film and consider that maybe everything about "Pirates" really isn't as amazing as you first thought it was.

		<shortDescription>But isn't piracy BAD for movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lame joke, but I can't think of a good summary. Pirates of the Caribbean is a pretty decent summer blockbuster that received much acclaim thanks to massive marketing. It's not terribly original, it's not terribly funny(lots of the lines meant to be funny really doesn't work very well) and in the end, it's not terribly satisfying either.As movies come, it's solid and well-made and there's nothing to complain about in directing or the score, which both are good. The acting is one of the disappointments. Orlando Bloom is totally wooden as usual, Kiera Knightley doesn't exactly leave an impression, and Johnny Depp, although he is a god of acting, doesn't take his cool role nearly as far as he could have(with a script like PoTC's, there's no room for anything outside the frames of well-tried movie/money-making guides).The plot is the standard damsel-in-distress scenario and some Incan curse thrown in for good measure. Add a bit of Dawn of the Dead or the work of Ray Harrihausen in "Jason and the Argonauts" and you have the storyline.I've watched PoTC two times and it has failed to impress me both times. It's a bit too violent to be appropriate to the audience I think would have appreciated it best, and a bit to childish to appeal to the rest of the movie-goers. Not something you have to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most overrated movies of the last decade, just unbelievable that it reached the top 250.. Johnny Depp is good to watch (as always) but the rest of acting was terrible, especially Orlando Bloom. Many people talks about fun, but what is fun? In this movie I found so much hackneyed entertainment just disguised in a new form: take away the skeleton pirates, put in it criminals, terrorists, cops or whatever and you get the same result. With a less banal script and a bit of drama, ah and yes with a *bit* of characters development this could have been better, but hey, it's Disney.... This is just the usual "turn-off-brain" movie, nothing less, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank god there are other people in the world whom don't 'love' this film. Pirates of the Caribbean is so overrated, if it wasn't for johnny depp, then it would be a washout completely, which says a great deal about it. If I am honest I fell asleep about three quarters of the way through the film, out of sheer boredom, i think Knightley's famous line 'try wearing a corset' set me down for the night. I saw this film last year, and had expected a masterpiece since many people had such high praises for it. The storyline is mediocre, the acting of two of the key actors, Knightly and Bloom (sorry I don't know their characters names, there is a simple reason for this!) is very average. I can remember very little from the film, as it has mere substance. Unfortunately, I have to now deal with people having panic attacks over the release of the sequel..oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i loved this movie although i don't think it is the best out of all the pirates of the Caribbean movies. it starts out with jack sparrow (johnny Depp) a notorious pirate who has just been over thrown by the ruthless Barbossa (geoffrey rush) who now owns the black pearl (a pirate ship). while he is on a British colonized Caribbean island he meets the beautiful Elizabeth swan (keira Knightley). Elizabeth swan has a connection with the black pearl that she does not know until pirates from the black pearl attack the island that she is on and kidnaps her. when she gets on the ship they ask her what is her name she Elizabeth turner, but little did she know turner was the name another pirate that used to be part of the black pearls crew. jack sparrow knowing this while in prison. when a young blacksmith named will turner (bloom) who secretly has a thing for Elizabeth turns to jack to get her back.so over all this was an excellent film no doubt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see this movie till it came out on DVD back 2 years ago.I regretted not seeing it in theaters, because I kept thinking it'll suck, because it didn't look like it be anything similar to the ride at Disneyland.But I was surprised to see that it's a very well done action movie. And surprised that it's even done by Disney. Cause it's not the common Family Friendly movie you'd find from Disney.The movie of course takes place in the Caribbean and during the 16th or 17th Century era. Which is when pirates ruled the 7 seas. A ship was sailing across the Atlantic which came across a wreckage of another ship. With only one passenger who is a young boy named Will Turner. Who had a gold medallion in his position. A girl named Elizabeth noticed the medallion to be pirate related so she took it and hid it from the ship's crew so that way they wouldn't think that Will is a pirate.8 years later Elizabeth is more grown up and Will is a blacksmith who makes and repairs swords for the army of the seaport town of Cape Royal. Life was very calm and peaceful till Jack Sparrow came ashore of Cape Royal. He is not your average pirate and he's very well known throughout the Caribbean. And there's a lot more to his back story than there seem to be.The medallion that Elizabeth holds is the key to breaking the curse of the pirates of the black pearl.I gotta admit i did like it quite a bit. I just wish I knew it was going to be a must see movie. It had action, great special effects, plenty of humor in some parts, and great characters to know while watching the movie.It's also unlike the common pirate movies you'd see anywhere else. Which is because it's a modern day made pirate movie. Those who are obsess with the ride might enjoy this movie a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POTC: TCOTHBP was occasionally interesting. What can one expect, the movie is based on a ride? Keira Knightley fills well the lovely young woman role. Johnny Depp is occasionally hilarious and interesting.What largely lacks for POTC is the story (hey, I understand, the ride was supported by effects and posing too, but it is only a few minutes long) and... well... the male second. While one can certainly understand Orlando Bloom's Will Turner's interest in Keira Knightley's Elizabeth, one can't, however, understand the reciprocation. I understand actors' withering beside Johnny Depp's irresistible, on-screen energy and force of personality, but poor Orlando Bloom nearly puddles beneath the glare. For LOTR all he had to do is stretch his neck and furrow his brow and that, beneath his lovely, light locks is what we needed from him there. Unfortunately for us, it seems that producers haven't yet realized that is all he can do.Geoffrey Rush ranged from over-the-top (which worked) to occasional attempts at being a sympathetic character (which didn't).There are some decent moments of entertainment including some laugh-out-loud funny lines involving Captain Jack Black. But this is not a keeper -- at most, a renter, preferably a borrower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among all of my friends who saw this movie, both pirate/Depp fanatics and neutral, told me that it was such an amazing movie, and that they are excited about the sequel that's coming soon, and how I HAVE to see this movie. So, I did.I got pretty much what I expected, except less. I found the jokes unamusing, action sequence unexciting, the music just droning on-and-on-and-on... Really, I mean, what was so spectacular about this movie? I'm surprised that I managed to stay wake for the ordeal.The acting was good, I guess. I wasn't too impressed with any of the characters. Jack Sparrow was kind of amusing, but his antics got really old very fast. Orlando Bloom and Knightly's characters were plain boring. But the character I was most disappointed in was Captain Barbossa -- such an uninteresting villain, absolutely no noteworthy character.I'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10, and I feel like I'm being generous. I know I'm not going to spend my hard earned dollars on the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offers fun times but little else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Pirates of the Caribbean' is an old-fashioned adventure pirate film, combining new animation techniques with humor, romance, and pirate battles. The film is not a great film by any means; it is simply fun. The film moved a little slow in some places, and I was not impressed by Johnny Depp's performance at all. The film really had little to offer in terms of an original story, but if you are looking for a film that is fun and something to liven up a dull evening, this film is okay. Children and adults can both enjoy this. It's not great, but it can probably be enjoyed by a wide audience. I give this a 4/10 because I did not think it was anything special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My movie review for this particular film is only based on the first two hours of the movie. The reason being for this is that after I saw that it had been over two hours and the movie was still going on, I just got up and left.I'm not sure whether or not you'll enjoy this movie. To be honest, I didn't really like it much. However, every other person that I have talked to who has seen this film has said that it was cool. I just didn't feel that way personally.I found it to be just another boring, typical pirate movie with predictable plot movements and unfunny comic relief. There was way too much dialogue and not enough action. And, well, I realized that I had been sitting in the theater for an hour, but I thought that I was only just FEELING like I was in there for so long just because it was so tedious and I was just waiting for it to end. However, it never ended.Although I didn't like it personally, everybody else did. So, I don't know what to say. I guess if you're into those kinds of movies about pirates and such, then you may enjoy it. I just found it to be predictable and lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say when I first watched this movie, I loved it, I loved the plot, music, characters, and the actors. The actors are so good in this movie that I surprised that they were even acting, and pretending to be like the people in the movie. Johnny Depp really did his best in this one, and I was not even the smallest surprised that he did an amazing job in this movie. Seriously, if they picked anyone else for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, then I would not like this movie, and no one else would like it. Everyone I know believes so, and no one yet has stepped up and said something about changing the actor for Captain Jack Sparrow.The writers did an amazing job with the script, but obviously Johnny Depp did a little improv while acting this role. Very good improv at that. All the other actors where good too, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffory Rush, which happened to also be one of my favorite characters in the movie also. Oh yes, the role of Barbossa really knocked me in the head. His acting was almost as good as Johnny Depp's. The way he looked and talked just freaked the hell out of me and I just wanted to scream my lungs out.The special effects in this movie also got me too, the way the Skeletons look when the moon rises really got me. The special effects people did an amazing job at that, as well as the Make-Up people. Putting Make-Up on Johnny must of been tiring for both him and the people, as his role had a lot to do with that. I for one would not like it at all, I can't even handle 2 days of it.10/10, most people would agree that this movie is very stunning, and well done. The actors play their roles as if they themselves are that person, and all the other people who made this film possible, I bow down to your success pf getting into half of the worlds hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl - The movie is as aimless as the tittle. Pirates attack a settlement known as Port Royal and capture the town's governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), as they believe that she is the one who can remove a curse set upon them. They lug her aboard the Black Pearl, their ominous sailing ship. In a prison in a battered garrison in Port Royal, William Turner (Orlando Bloom) makes arrangements to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), A captive, and some-what idiotic pirate, in exchange for his aid to rescue Miss Elizabeth Swann, the woman who William is madly in love with. Along the way, there are many sword fights, but as this movie is a pirate one, viewers will expect a major death. Sadly there are none. Most of the time it miraculously stops or those cursed pirates never die, because they're practically undead. Many of the fights are absolutely retarded and pointless, with no purpose what so ever, except just to allow this movie to be classified under a pirate theme. The director, Gore Verbinski, made a horrific effort to add suspense, and about the only scary thing in the film is a cursed monkey!The characters, although interesting at first impression, soon get boring and ridiculous! Jack Sparrow has a major speech impediment, always looks like he's drunk 24/7 and seems to have hands that don't look connected to his wrists! His opening scene where viewers first catch a gimps of Jack was quite comical, but his later acts were plain, foolish. It's impossible to believe that such a pirate could even be conceived! The actor Johnny Depp played a magnificent part, but it's Disney's lack in concept to produce a more credible character, which unfortunately destroyed the feel of a real pirate film. The character William Turner was an even bigger let down. His jokes are dry to the bone, at best they my cause a chuckle. His character's desires are typical of what modern movies are about. All of this was made worst with the selection of actor to play the role. Orlando Bloom's parts in the film were particularly weak and lacking in emphasis, as you felt that Jack Sparrow was more important then the less adventurous blacksmith Will.The few good things about, The Pirates of the Caribbean, The Curse of the Black Pearl are the tunes and the CGI effects. These are the only factors that keep the viewer from going to sleep! The music is on the dot, particularly when you see beautiful long shots of the surroundings. You'll get butterflies in you stomach, similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, when you witness the sight of the Computer Generated Images! Since the cursed pirates can only take the undead form in certain conditions, the lighting, and shadow effects make these images top-notch.This film is better of to just have CGI pirates walking around, raiding random ships, then to have poorly thought of characters, residing in the picture. There is too much that has been added to the film, and the mambo-jumbo comedy, action, thriller, love story, adventure theme is just a missive cliché of genres. The attempt made by Disney to have a classical family movie was a disastrous shamble! Millions of dollars have been wasted, down drain on actors who don't even suit the characters. I strongly recommend no one see this monstrous movie, as viewers would also be throwing away their money down the drain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow was this movie good! I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this before! I went to go see it when it first came out in 2003 at a huge theater and it was almost completely full, but luckily I got in. I wanted to go see it because people kept on bragging on about it so I just wanted to check how it really was, and to tell you the truth, I don't regret any of it.This is also probably one of Johnny Depp's best movies. He was a perfect and sometimes even funny character in the movie. He met the exact pirate voice, which is kind of weird because I haven't heard him talking like that before. Also, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did a good job. It was just a really good movie with an awesome storyline.The reason I'm giving it a 10 is because of the plot, the cast, the acting and so forth.. And I feel that it was delivered in this amazing pirate movie! So if you're bored one night, and decide that you wanna rent a movie that you haven't seen before, I suggest picking up Pirates of the Caribbean, as you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp made this movie, with a little help from his friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is truly an acting legend of recent years. This film is proof of it. He is always very considerate of what roles he takes on and is usually a totally different character in each of them.Jack Sparrow is no exception. He is absolutely hilarious, as is his accent which does ring true; plus his friendship with Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner also rings true. There is chemistry between Depp and whomever he shares dialogue with because he is central to the whole movie - thankfully. Depp is my all-time favourite actor, I think he is so much more talented than he gives himself credit for. Bloom and Keira Knightley form the romance, which expected in all modern movies so I can't complain because the acting is great all round. Another talented actor who proves himself in this movie is Geoffrey Rush. Like Depp he brings charisma and comedy to the role, as well as threat. Barbosa is a character you love to hate (because of how he treats Sparrow as you will see for yourself and what we learn from their history).Jack Sparrow's drunkenness will have you splitting your sides with laughter, believe me. If not then you can't possibly be viewing the same movie. 'Yo ho a pirate's life for me' was sang by Depp and Knightley who are rightfully paired by a campfire in one scene. There is a spark but the romance is firmly between Will and Elizabeth (Knightley). A great movie I would definitely recommend for anyone over the age of 12 who loves a good action movie mixed with comedy, romance and the talent of Johnny Depp! I give it full marks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Over Rated Something Or Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of 'the' most over rated films of the twenty-first century, this film is truly abysmal. I know those of you who have posted positive reviews will be searching these pages for negative comments so that you can then go on to berate us, will loathe me and this brief summary but it is true. The film is a one man band, and therein lies its most fatal flaw and its only saving grace. Johnny Depp, arguably one of the most, if not the most, well rounded actor of the present times, provides a captivating and mesmeric performance as "Captain Jack Sparrow" and is truly a delight to watch, from his accent, to his well timed humour, to just about everything that goes wrong for him...and that's about it. Take out Depp, and you have a Shakespearean tragedy without the Shakespearean part. Orlando Bloom has already proved in recent times that he is completely incapable of carrying a film. He does not only not have the stage presence, but his acting varies from poor to woeful, and always with that unnecessarily husky voice, to show that he's conveying either aggression, passion, fear, loathing and just about every other emotion under the sun, as he is just so damned monotonic. Knightly is THE most over rated female actor of the present day. I hear people raving over her acting skills, yet this and Pride and Prejudice have been the biggest films she's starred in, one flopped and one was carried through by Depp, hardly a sparkling resume. Not only is she incapable of acting (like Bloom) but she has THE WORST line in cinema of the 21st Century "Try Wearing a Corset"....no thanks. Honestly, she delivers it in such a matter of fact manner as if it were part of a recipes serving suggestion, "you could try adding a touch of basil or garlic or even wearing a corset"The film is entertaining in moments, but follows a very predictable and very typical Hollywood formula which is starting to get really old, really fast, and with the new one on its way, is only going to get older and more decrepit.So welcome to Pirates of th...zzzzzzzzzz....oh, sorry...Is it over yet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the obvious gift of total hotties in this movie (Ahem: Johnny and Orlando) the plot, for the most part, is very original. Sure, it's about Will Turner going off to save the woman he loves, but the plot is so intricate and delightful that the first time you watch it, you don't even concentrate on how gorgeous these men are, but more so on the plot.The actors were well-placed as their characters, but most importantly the characters were believable, due firstly to the writers. The CGI effects were truly amazing, as they were able to characterize the skeletons to the characters, which made it easy to keep track of them.Pirates, well put together, is not just a family-fun movie or a chick-flick, but rather something that just about anyone can enjoy: action for men, romance for women, and humor all around.Shorlty: humorous and captivating, this is a must-see. One can only hope that the second and third movies are as well-written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh and what a movie this is. There is something for everyone in the family with this movie, romance, action, drama, horror, adventure and fantasy. A quality of acting rivaling no other movie in recent times, except for the Rings trilogy, but that's another thing altogether. I have watched this movies so many times that I can't even keep track. This movie never gets boring. Johnny Depp is at the top of this career with this film!! A must see, many times over. A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best movie that I have ever seen! I didn't see this film at the cinema, but I really wish I had because it has instantly become one of my favorite movies of all time. I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humor. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing "Yo ho, ho ho" for days and days to come. A "pirate's life" is plenty the life in "Pirates of the Caribbean", an worthy, intelligent sea-faring adventure guaranteed to leave you, at the very least, plenty satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a very funny romanticization of those Pirates of the Caribbean during the early 1700s, yet touches a deep &amp; wonderful sense of adventure in us even now.The sea "pirate" that is Captain Jack Sparrow is that childlike spirit that lives in all of us - "despite all the evidence to the contrary" - and has its source beyond and without any definition of worldly authorization. J.R.R.Tolkien had a saying - "not all who wander are lost".And another truly great thing about this movie - it is not in the least pretentious or heavy handed nor does it wallow in personal issues like so many self-important films today.'Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl' is just one very cool, well made and fun movie!! p.s. if you liked this Pirate flick - another kind of 'pirate' in our more contemporary times (1992) that you might enjoy and might want to check out is 'Captain Ron' (as in the movie with Kurt Russell). Two very different movies but the spirit of Captain Jack Sparrow could be a match with 'Captain Ron' in another time and place .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Critical Voice In The Cinema Wilderness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a perfect movie if (A) you are a twelve year old boy, (B) you like to see stunt men ejected from explosions over and over and over again (C) you will watch anything with Johnny Depp, regardless. For more discriminating adults, the two and a half hours of noise and chaos unrelieved by any semblance of careful plotting becomes tedious. Depp is certainly fun for the first half hour, sending up the pirate image by coating his eyes with kohl and sending up the Disney image by acting a little less than wholesome, but after a while, one longs for more than people screaming with swords in their hands backed up with a bombastic music score that underscores the emptiness of the enterprise.One longs for the sense of heroic purpose and genuine derring-do exemplified by Errol Flynn/ Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, or Burt Lancaster in such grand adventures as The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Sinbad The Sailor or The Crimson Pirate, all recently released on vivid, family-oriented DVDs; Pirates From The Carribbean is cynical corporate entertainment, the humor ironic or tongue-in-cheek, and, though marketed as such, is really not for children unless they are so desensitized to blood and savagery from video games that nightmarish visions do not bother them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This can impossibly appeal to an adult audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you voted 10 for this film, you'd better be 10 years old or else this is simply unforgivable.Pirates of the Caribbean is a truly excruciating experience. I hate this film on so many levels, covering so many aspects and ranging from crew to cast that it actually makes me physically ill to watch. So if I hate this film to the core, then what's the 2/10 for, you ask? The answer is; I think this film could be entertaining to kids and the odd pre-teen. It is, after all, a Disney production based on a popular Disney ride in a theme park and I think this explains its paper-thin plot of "saving the damsel in distress (Keira Knightley), killing the bad guy (Geoffrey Rush) and having an over-the-top comedic sidekick (Johnny Depp) whilst doing it".I don't know whose genius idea it was to cast Orlando Bloom as the romantic and heroic lead, but this choice helps him cement his position as the resident Hollywood lucky-guy, getting by without so much as a shred of talent, but inexplicably being offered big-budget project after the other. Furthermore, my theory is that Bloom's bad acting is contagious and affected the rest of the cast of Pirates of the Caribbean like a nasty case of the flu. Keira Knightley is a stunning woman but all she does here is pout with her pretty lips until she gets to deliver some cheeseball tough-chick line like "You like pain? *WHAM* Try wearing a corset." I'm no member of the Depp camp but I think he has pulled off some great performances in the past, but in Pirates, he is so over-the-top and corny that this can impossibly appeal to an adult audience.So aside from the cringe-worthy "corset" line by Keira Knightley, the dialogue-writing on the film really puzzles me. It's like it's camp but not intentionally. I believe this film truly thinks it's clever and amusing when it's only extremely embarrassing. Juvenile generic action sequences, long-drawn segments, contrived performances, dumb plot and overblown special effects make Pirates of the Caribbean an unwatchable adventure.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I am a bit of a nut when it comes to pirates, but there simply aren't enough films that depict this brilliantly caricatured era.Pirates of the Carribbean adds to the mix a tad of supernatural elements and makes a very standard plot into a fun adventure by adding several memorable characters. The special-effects add to the feeling of the film, but at no point does the film become too big. There's no plot to conquer the world. Everything in the film is very down to earth and personal.Johnny Depp naturally adds to the film with his brilliant performance as Jack Sparrow, possibly one of the most original characters I've seen in a long while. He's become one of my favorites alongside such figures as Darth Vader, Bond and Riddick.A very nicely done adventure. Brilliant movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great poster, lousy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell you the truth I can't remember much about the plot--and I just saw it last night! Something about a cursed pirate ship and its crew and how they all turn to skeletons when moonlight hits them and how they need some coins or something to release the curse...I was so bored during this film my mind kept wandering. Maybe I just don't like pirate films but I think there's more to it than that.This film has some major problems--it's way too long (half an hour could have been cut out easily); the story is (needlessly) convoluted and very badly done (I'm blaming the screenwriters and director, NOT the actors); despite all the explosions and fights the action scenes are surprisingly dull; there's loads of casual violence; leading lady Knightley is constantly being hit in the face and the admittedly great special effects just didn't grab me. There is a spectacular sword fight at the end with the men going in and out of moonlight and going from skeleton to man and back again--but it's too little too late. The direction is WAY off too--he seems unsure of how to frame scenes and it makes things very confusing.I can't fault the actors--Orlando Bloom (very handsome with beautiful black eyes) is very good in a badly written role. Keira Knightly's role is even worse--she's just "the girl" in the movie and no one could be good in it. Geoffrey Rush is OK as the pirate chief. Johnny Depp is the one reason to watch this movie. His performance is so off-beat and funny he keeps the film afloat. Just his mannerisms and facial expressions give an unexpected kick to lines.So...this handsome production sinks because of bad direction, ridiculous length and many many boring stretches. Unless you're a huge fan of pirate movies you can skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting to see a movie that was decent at best. I was very surprised to find how unbelievably bad it was. The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is among the best from Hollywood, I don't think I'm going to another for a long time.I know I'm in the minority, but I just don't see the point of this movie. Its plot was totally predictable, filled with all the usual silly impossible heroics. The protagonists, by all rights, should have been killed many times over.The movie also had a rash of other implausibilities, e.g., no one on the protagonists' crew died despite sustained mortal combat against a superior foe, who by virtue of a curse, could not die. The ending was especially nonsensical: several times throughout the movie, Orlando Bloom had been condemned to death (of course, he implausibly escapes each time) after having saved the life of the beloved fiancée of the commander (and daughter of the governor). Then at the end, they simply lets him and his accomplice go?!?! Even the Johnny Depp character, which admittedly had some charm and craftiness, didn't make sense: why was he seemingly quasi-drunk all the time, slurring his syllables? And why all the eye-makeup? In the end, I wonder about all the money spent on this movie, and about a society in which a silly, pointless fantasy can be lauded as among the finest cultural outputs in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curse Of The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can probably tell from the title, this film never gets old! "Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl" is a swash-buckling pirate adventure/action film released in the summer of 2003. The entire crew working on this film were certain it would flop majorly in every sense of the word, as earlier attempts at kicking off a Pirate movie saga was met with little to no attention, and failed at gaining a trusty audience. But with the help of star Johnny Depp, as well as other notable actors, the movie grossed well beyond any other production in the box office at the time, amazing and surprising its creators. The movie is pure fun, from the way the characters are introduced for the first time to the action of the saga's original tale, scored beautifully by Hans Zimmer (One Of The Best Alongside John Williams). The music has that pirate feel to it, the awesome intensity of the action taking place and the confused but comical little tune that plays as Jack Sparrow stumbles around in the mystery. Johnny Depp gives a majorly entertaining and unique performance of Jack Sparrow, a dwindling hero with his own goals and aspirations. The character is immediately welcome alongside the likes of such action heroes as: Indiana Jones, Luke Skywalker, The Terminator and more..! The other characters receive the same amount of dedication, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly) alongside many more all have interesting and well written arcs. The movie also looks great, the visuals in some shots are stunning, though some of the CGI looks just a bit unfinished. As stated before, the original Pirates of the Caribbean film is pure fun and a great couple of hours to spend. It is... without a doubt, the best one out of the current four. SAVVY?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp- Captain Jack Sparrow Orlando Bloom- Will Turner Keira Knightley- Elizabeth Swann Geoffrey Rush- Captain Hector Barbossa The plot of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is pirates on the black pearl needed to get the last piece of gold returned with the blood of the pirate who has it. The last piece of gold is in the hand of Elizabeth Swann who encountered it when her father rescued a boy named Will Turner. He had it around his neck and Elizabeth thought he was a pirate so she took it from him to save his life. Captain Barbossa and his pirates find the last piece of gold and kidnap Elizabeth to get it. With this going on Will is in love with her and needs to save her so he asks help from Captain Jack Sparrow, who wants the Black Pearl back that he once was a captain of. During the movie many encounters happened between the two pirate groups. One group being Captain Barbossa's and the other being Captain Jack Sparrow's. Captain Barbossa's pirates want to regain life back and not become skeletons in the moonlight while Captain Jack Sparrow's pirates are trying to save Elizabeth and get the Black Pearl back for Captain Jack Sparrow. The theme of this movie comes from a ride at the Disney theme park. It is a fantasy movie because it does not happen in real life. The theme of this movie is to catch the viewers' attention by making them think it is real life. Camera angles during this movie helps that part. The angles of the camera when the movie is shot makes the scenes when the fighting takes place more real life. It gets you close and up personal. Also the lighting during the movie sets the mood. Most of the scenes are darker with less lighting making it not scary but letting the viewer know that something is going to happen like the fighting or when the moon light is out and the pirates turn into skeletons. The theme of this movie to me a great. I liked this movie and will watch it more times to come. This movie kept it interesting throughout the whole time.</fullReview>

For many of my students, movies are a luxury they seldom afford, so they enjoy watching in class. These students are very fascinated with the "how'd they do that" component of movies. My focus on media is that almost all media is trying to sell you something. Some of my students can relate scenes from various movies that contain "plugs" for various products. These students are pleasantly surprised to find none of these overt efforts to promote particular products in this movie. I seldom watch a movie a second time until it has been five or more years since the first time I saw it. I watch this movie in class every year and at least once during the summer each year.

It is worthy sea-faring entertainment indeed, featuring glorious and realistic set design, spooky and impeccable visual effects, some fine, indelible acting by Johnny Depp (in his most whimsical performance yet), and some classy, comical dialogue between the British sea captains and the vicious, blood-thirsty pirates. A film that provides basically everything you might expect in this kind of fun-filled adventure, albeit somewhat overstaying its merry welcome and deviating enormously from its Disneyland theme park ride inspiration, hardly ever does this amusing, entertaining extravaganza of a movie go wrong. From the gorgeous costume designs to the murky, gloomy, and shanky sets of the Caribbean, pirates' ships, and lands ahoy, to the eye-popping, deceiving visual effects (I was chilled to the bone at the transformation of the "pirates in the light" sequence), aside from being sheerly entertaining and festive, this is one amazing technical piece of cinema. Johnny Depp steals practically every scene he occupies, and Geoffrey Rush is excellent and sinister in his villainous turn. It's about as high-quality fun as one might demand in a summer blockbuster, and will have you singing "Yo ho, ho ho" for days and days to come.

The element that the movie contained was that of superiority above movies. While it contains such bathroom humor and immaturity, it also contains a sense of seriousness. The fact that the crew decided to use a navy ship for the Black Pearl and decided to build the Interceptor shows the amount of effort (effort musn't be disregarded) put into Gore Venbrowski's film. The action packed sea battles and sword fights had the whole audience wowed. Speaking of the audience, I also noticed that there were old folks, little toddlers, teenagers, and middle aged people all around. Johnny Depp puts up a killer performance, as does Orlando Bloom.

		<shortDescription>Not all pirates are cold hearted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yo Ho, Yo Ho, a pirates life for me! The film, The Pirates of the Caribbean has a theme that is evident. The Pirates of the Caribbean shows that the central insight is the fact that not all pirates are cold hearted. They can show compassion and camaraderie. It was under the brilliant direction of Gore Verbinski (The Ring, The Mexican) that this film's theme could be so easily seen. The Pirates of the Caribbean is a visually pleasing display of a true pirate adventure. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, Edward Scissorhands) steals the show by revealing that not all pirates are cold hearted. The story begins with a gold medallion found on a boy which is taken from him to protect his identity from the British Navy that he is a pirate. The evil pirate Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush, House on Haunted Hill) and his crew are drawn to the medallion and will stop at nothing to get it back to break their curse. Johnny Depp's character has little concern about the medallion, but does want to get his ship, the Black Perl, back. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, Lord of the Rings) teams up with Jack Sparrow to fight the pirates to regain the kidnapped governor's daughter (Keira Knightley, Love Actually) regain the Black Perl and defeat the evil pirates. The lighting in this film says a lot to describe the contrast of good and evil. When the camera is on Barbosa and his crew it is very low lighting to give the audience a sense of darkness. When the camera is on Jack Sparrow and his crew the lighting changes, it is bright and gives a feeling of camaraderie. This brings us back to the theme of the film, not all pirates are cold hearted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever! Johnny Depp is amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie at least two dozen times, and I love it. It is my favorite movie ever! Johhny Depp does an amazing job acting the part of Captain Jack Sparrow, and the rest of the cast is great too.Pirate movies have never been that popular, but this movie was AWESOME! I became obsessed with pirates after seeing this movie, and I even bought a huge poster of Johhny Depp to hang on my bedroom door.This movie was everything. It was a hilarious action/romance with great costumes and actors and visual effects, and though the storyline was a little confusing at first, after seeing it a couple of times, I fell in love with this movie. I bought it on DVD right after it came out, and I watch it all the time.A wonderful, awesome, amazing, great, fantastic, fabulous, MUST-SEE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting thoughts on the Caribbean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dragged my heels on seeing this movie, and I was sorry that I did. Johnny Depp is hysterically funny as Captain Jack Sparrow, a shipless pirate who dodges capture deftly, if not haphazardly. Supported by Orlando Bloom as a reluctant son of a pirate, the two embark upon a quest to rescue a lovely lady, and capture a ship who's crew is under an interesting curse. The action was very well executed, and the plot kept you going through the over two hour movie. A testament to it's character is that you really do not notice the time passing. Johnny Depp shows us again why he is an acting force to be reckoned with, choosing obscure and lucrative roles for our imaginations. This particular character is like none other than he has ever played. New viewers (or even returning viewers) should pay close attention to Depp's facial expressions, particularly in scenes where the focus is not on his character. Special effects usage was eye opening, and Orlando Bloom is moving right on up the ladder of his career with solid steps upon the rungs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a comedy and a romance and I feel it's all the better for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mid-18th century, it can be difficult for a motley crew of pirates to make a name for themselves on the high seven seas. The Black Pearl is the exception. Boasting a star-studded crew, this whale of a ship has already slaughtered the US Box Office, and is set to do the same when she sails to European shores later this month. Featuring plenty of buckling swash, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is quickly becoming this years must-sea action/ adventure blockbuster. Inspired by the infamous ride of the same name at Disneyworld, Producer Jerry Brockheimer has made sure no expense has been spared to reproduce a big screen replica that keeps true to the genre of a swashbuckling pirate adventure. Do not fear though! If you've been waiting for a decent pirate film for this decade, that spares you corny accents and puns, then this could just be the film for you!The film's plot is centered on the cursed, un-dead pirates of the mysterious ghost ship of legend ? the Black Pearl. She and her compatriots are on a quest. A quest to find all the Aztec gold medallions that cursed them. And it just so happens that a child Elizabeth Swann stumbles upon one around the young Will Turner's neck when he is rescued by Swann and her father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Unfortunately, the medallion, which Elizabeth took to hide Will's piracy, sends out a signal to the pirates when it falls into the sea years later ? a time when Elizabeth is set to marry Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport); and a blacksmith Will Turner can only look on as his love is married (His love being Elizabeth not Norrington). Thus a hoard of gibbering, unkillable pirates; led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), follows to destroy the town of Port Royal where Swann is living, and retrieve their stolen item. Thus, with her having been kidnapped by the pirates, heart-broken gentlemen Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Norrington set sail after the Black Pearl. Sounds good doesn't it?Yes, but it's not perfect. The plot is riddled with holes, so it doesn't all make total sense, but like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything. However, don't go to this film wanting an ideal remix of an old genre; yes Verbinski and Brockheimer have breathed new life into the mould, but rather than getting a full on swashbuckler, it's a comedy and a romance, and I feel its all the better for it.The brunt of the goodness in this film is carried by Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow), who's comic portrayal of Jack Sparrow (Captain Jack Sparrow) is comparable to a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft. It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun. Zoom In Elizabeth Swann may have the looks and the rich ? posh background, but we quickly see her develop into an unusual heroine in this film. Unlike her contemporaries, such as Maid Marion in 'Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves', Miss. Swann plays a rather more pivotal role ? moreover, a more active role. Rather than playing a 'Damsel in Distress', a convention for women in this sort of genre, she's central to the story and gets involved with her own share of the action and the fighting, daring to attack the pirates and even Barbossa, and she saves hers and others lives a plenty. So although she may have the beauty, innocence, money, clothes, and the attraction to all the men around her like the traditional stereotype, she is not a girl to be messed with - feisty, smart, brave and witty. Definitely a 'Modern girl stuck in an eighteenth century world' (Keira Knightley on Elizabeth Swann).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite pasttimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unusual in this day and age to find a fun movie the whole family can enjoy. The violence is what I would expect in a pirate flick, the language was extremely tame ( damn, hell) Geoffrey Rush was outstanding. I've a place in my heart for a good old fashioned bad boy. Some of his comments are hysterical you can actually BELIEVE he is pirate. The mannerisms, the faces, the chases, the ARRRRR he has it down pat. I rewatch it for his performance. Johnny Depp is delightful and warm and quite lovable for a pirate. He's eye candy anyway (from way back in the 21 Jumpstreet days). Some of the swashbuckling scenes were a little lengthy for me but the musical score is powerful and proud and carried me through. I love Geoffrey Rush</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! Right on target for even the adult audiences. The actors did a marvelous job. Depp was super convincing. His walk, the way he talked, excellent drunkard. The movie was hilarious and the curse added the adventure and action I am constantly craving for. Never had my interests in pirates been so large. The fact that Bill "Boots" Turner's child was indeed Will Turner rather than the elegant Elizabeth Swann and had been terribly mistaken was fabulous! Elizabeth had gotten her self into a riled up ship of angry damned men. All in all, the movie was great! Righto! I've watched this movie millions of times and never once has it not surprised me. I am in love with Jack Sparrow and Will Turner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Carribean was quite astonishing in many ways. Although it may be overrated because of the high quality actors such as Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, it is still worth a try. The scenery is amzing mainly becuase its real and not fake. the music helps capture the momment and the script was pretty well wrote with the exception of a few draggy moments. The fight scenes are very good and realistic as well as the over all affect. The casting was actually very good and the characters were protrayed very well. overall---disney lucked out on this movie...9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. First of all I would like to say that whoever wrote the comment "Great Poster, bad movie", i respect your opinion, but I completely disagree. Maybe since you kept falling asleep, you didn't get the humor and storyline of this movie like you should have. This movie was great. I had no problem remembering the plot. Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, AND Kiera Knightley were fantastic. Orlando Bloom has shown his versatility in acting by going from completely different characters and playing them excellently. Johnny Depp deserved that best actor award every bit, and I was very sad to learn that he did not receive it. He played a constantly drunken pirate, who had gone a little bit mad, and he did it very well. Kiera Knightley, whose performance in "Bend it Like Beckham" was also great, plays a young girl, a little too modern for her time. She stands up for herself, and is also very clever. I would also like to mention that Jack Davenport and John Rys-Davies were also very good in this movie, and they get too little recognition. Captain Barbosa, played by Geoffrey Rush, was an awesome bad guy. I absolutely loved this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and thought that Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom played their roles to the best of their ability. Kiera Knightly was great as Elizabeth Swan and I can't wait to see the next two movies. I would recommend this film to everyone. If you get the chance to see this movie you should. The special fx were brilliant as were the cast.Everyone I know who have seen this movie have loved it. It has action, adventure, romance, horror, excitement and had many funny bits/quotes. Everything a movie fan would want. The only bad thing in this movie were some of the mistakes they have made; historical, continuity, etc... It was still brilliant though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean has lots of different effects and this is what makes it a good film. The key event is when the governor's daughter is kidnapped by a crew of dreaded pirates. Watch for Captain Jack Sparrow turning into a skeleton when he walks through the moonlight.Unsurprisingly, the film actually has pirates in it. The director Chris Columbus has done a good job. It was an Oscar-winning film and now they are working on a sequel. The film is rather long and some viewers might get bored, particularly if they like serious films. Some of the interior scenes on the video version are rather dark and difficult to see clearly. However, Pirates of the Caribbean is exciting and full of suspense, and great if you like pirates. The key actors in this marvellous film are Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. Johnny Depp was at his best, and really was Jack Sparrow. I would advise you to buy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is an adventure film which is very funny and it has some romantic touches. The veteran actor Jonhy Depp is excellent in his part as the old salt "Jack Sparrow", Geoffrey Rush is the best choice for the part of the bad character and the attractive Orlando Bloom promises to turn into one of the most important young actors in Hollywood just like Keira Knightley. The exotic landscapes and all the setting are some of the best aspects of "Pirates of the Caribbean", but I would only criticize one thing: you would know the skeletons of "Captain Barbosa" screw were made by computers, but it is great. I think I will never see a better pirates film. In fact I have never been interested in this kind of films till I have seen this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairy tale we've been waiting for a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this is Johnny Depp's best role, and Geoffrey Rush proved there are few artists like him in the worldwide movie. In general you're sorry for Depp both times he is to be hung. This kind of movie hadn't been shot for a long time, and it's good to continue Walt Disney's traditions. `The pirates of the Caribbean' is a fairy tale for everybody. I can't imagine anybody who won't enjoy it.In the last years it's one of the best projects which must be purchased on DVD. For me Jerry Bruckheimer's name is the guarantee of fresh, cheerful, dynamic and justice movie, and Gore Verbinski is great. I'll wait for him to direct another one. It was clear Orlando Bloom will a brilliant career, and about Keira Knightly ? I'm sure everybody fall in love with her. In one word all the good that can be, you'll find here. I recommend everybody who has missed the chance of watching it in the cinema, correct the mistake. This film will bring good mood and positive emotions. And now excuse me, I'd rather watch it once again. Thank you for your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Please excuse my horrible pirate language in the summary.*Pirates of the Caribbean is probably the best Johnny Depp movie ever made! If I were to make a list about the Pros and Cons of this movie, you would find no Cons! Right now I would just like to mention some of the things I enjoyed about this movie.*Johnny Depp.* Oh my gosh, I am dangerously in love with Johnny Depp. He is probably the first reason I went to see this movie. At first when I heard about the movie just coming out, I didn't think it would be too good. Now after I've watched it, I am constantly thinking up new pirate languages and slang words. &lt;shrugs&gt; A weird old banana, I am.*The Pirates.* I LOVE THE PIRATES!!! They are not only very cOoOoOol-looking, but they give you a good scare when you first see them! I liked the part where all the pirates are walking underwater. It shows you their skeletons while they are walking under the moonlight, but when they go under the shade from the moonlight, they return to normal. Then, out from under the shade they walk, and they transform back into skeletons. Can you say, "Awesome?"*The Special Effects.* Special effects were awesome in this movie! Very similar to Haunted Mansion, this movie has probably the best special effects in any other movie.There are many other things I loved about this movie, but it would take me about 300 years to point them out. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed out on seeing Pirates of the Caribbean on the big screen, and now I wish I hadn't. I first saw it at my friend's place on DVD and I loved it immediately and really wanted to see it again. The characters are all perfect for their parts, Orlando Bloom plays an excellent Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is great as the pretty governor's daughter, Geoffry Rush is a superb villain, and Johnny Depp's funny antics bring the movie together to make a masterpiece on film.I had no idea what I was about to witness as I sat on the couch, not having seen any of these actors (Except Orlando, LOTR) in a movie before. By the time it finished, I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath. I loved Johnny in the boat at the start, Orlando's heroism throughout the movie, and the kiss at the end. Everything was so perfect that I wished it would never stop, and now it's one of my fave movies of all time! There's only one thing I don't get though. Why did Jack Sparrow cut his hand at the end just before he passed the medallion to Will? I would love to get an answer to that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone loved Johnny Depp in this movie and no doubt, he deserved that Oscar nomination but if it didn't have him, it'll be some swashbuckler with Orlando Bloom which wouldn't attract much except girls.I'm not saying Captain Jack Sparrow is the only good thing. The special effects, costumes and performances from others such as Geoffrey Rush and MacKenzie Crook (Gareth from the Office in a Hollywood movie, yeah!) also to the arrival of Keira Knightley.

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am the type of person who hates action movies so for me to tell you that this movie rocked is a big deal. It might help that I'm the biggest Johnny Depp fan though. Don't be fooled by the Disney name...it's not the same old sugary crap you expect from Disney (even though that's what's to be expected as Disney is usually geared towards children). It's got a great story and the acting is brilliant. I'm not a big Kiera Knightly fan but I think she did a good job in the film. There is alot of action so if you're into that kind of stuff then you'll love this film. I think what I liked best about this film, though, (aside from Johnny Depp) is that there's a romance story laced inside of the crude world of piracy. Orlando and Kiera's characters are in a sort of forbidden relationship and they fight for eachother through the whole movie. Johnny Depp makes you laugh, Geoffrey Rush disgusts you (good actor, gross character), and Orlando and Kiera make you sigh in jealousy. Great movie for dates because you've got the love story and the action flick all in one. I'm not gonna tell you the story, just see the movie, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be one of the biggest fans of this movie. I loved every minute of it. One word of caution though, it is rated PG and I think is produced by Disney, so even though there's raggedy pirates and sword fights, there is no cursing, nudity or bloody scenes. That certainly didn't take away from it as far as I was concerned.Johnny Depp stole the show and played his part very well. Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) also did a fine job as did the rest of the cast. I wasn't overly impressed with Orlando bloom, Keira Knightley, or Jack Davenport but they didn't do a poor job and certainly didn't take away from the film. I guess you could say I liked all the pirates the best, the rest of the cast were decent fillers.I loved the humor flow of this movie, when I saw it in the theaters, I must have been the only person who had ever been on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, as I completely busted up in the first jail scene, as well as a few other scenes, whereas no one else did. I didn't find the movie the least bit scary, but I wouldn't show it to a very young kid either as it would probably scare the pants off them. All in all this movie had great acting, mainly by the two characters I already mentioned, a decent story, great effects and battle / fight scenes, and a good overall flow. I own this movie and have probably seen it more than 10 times. By far the best movie I've seen this year, with Kill Bill and ROTK being a semi close second/third.I certainly hope they make a part II, and If they do, definitely keep Depp in, without him, it wouldn't have been the 10 /10 that I rated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jolly Good Pirate Fun! (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this while babysitting my neighbor's kids ages 9 and 12. They liked it a lot, I thought it was okay. I got a little bored about half-way but not enough to turn it off, I wanted to see how they would wrap it all up.It has some neat effects and the story line is pretty good, every kid wonders what it would be like to do something amazing. The acting was pretty good, especially from Johnny Depp he delivers an excellent performance. The beautiful Keira Knightley delivers a good but not great performance and so does eye candy Orlando Bloom. I think that this movie is a good movie for Keira Knightley's future career, she is a beautiful young actress that has a lot of potential. I thinks that she would be in many of the future "big" movies! I also think that Orlando Bloom would become a big actor, but I don't think that he will become bigger than Keira Knightley. Well this wasn't the greatest pirate movie ever told, but the potential for it to be above average is definitely there. I went into this movie expecting it to suck right up there with one of those crazy Lampoon type spoofs of a movie, not to mention something that was just for kids. I was totally wrong. Me being a 18 year old adult found it to be quite humorous and quite exciting in most parts. Johnny Depp, in my opinion was cast perfectly for the role. Of course I tend to be a bit biased when it comes to good old Johnny( I loved him in Edward Scissorhands). He definitely shines in all of his performances and will blossom into one of the great actors of the upcoming generation. As far as this movie goes, its all about having fun, and that's exactly what Johnny accomplished with this film... hail Jack Sparrow (Johnny). When I took my cousin out to see "Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl", I fully expected to be bored and go away hoping that at least the children enjoyed it... boy, was I surprised! Johnny Depp played a great pirate, and Keira Knightley was a cute rich girl. I thought it was really funny and full of action, and my cousin thought it was "really cool!" It's a creative family flick...fun for the whole family. (Even I enjoyed it!) I think this movie will be on every kid's top ten for a while to come...as for me, I'll be waiting for a sequel. I know what you're thinking, and you're right. Keira Knightley's acting really doens't leave much to be desired, but the witty script, good lead from Johnny Depp and excellent fighting make this a must see. A great movie. I liked "Pirates of the Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl". It was cool, funny, thrilling, and had a lot of action. Although I am a big fan of Keira Knightley's and was disappointed at her acting in this movie. Sure, she was great in "The Hole" but in this movie I found her to be a bit over-the-top. I know Keira could've done better than that. On the other hand, Johnny Depp did great playing Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira's clothes weren't really appropriate for a PG-13 movie. But I thought this movie was a little bit too intense for a PG and for little kids under the age of 7 to watch. Some of the violence was just a tiny bit intense. In one scene they show Will running his hand up Elizabeth's chest, but I don't think it was meant in a sexual way, and some woman show cleavage and look like prostitutes. But I still recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, you should!!Pirates of the Carribean :Curse of the Black Pearl has an interesting premise even if at first I was a little cautious about it. But we must look at it from the right point of view, meaning like a kid would. Who never wished to be to be a pirate? Even today I think about it.Johnny Depp is perfect for the role. He represents a feisty pirate captain. Orlando Bloom is also great as his tough, icy partner. The amazingly beautiful Keira Knightley however suffers from a huge lack of screen time. Her acting could also be better and we can clearly notice the girl has a huge ego. With her looks she can go far no doubt about it. But she has to be a little humble and be ready to learn. I'm not sure that is the case. With full knowledge of the power of her physical side she appears not the least interested and I would say even bored throughout the movie.The story is simple and without a touch of reality to it, just like it was supposed to be. The humor however could be more efficient. Some jokes, maybe too many, fall flat. The action could also have been improved. It's not even close to spectacular. The opening scene is very attractive but then all we get is some explosions and a few swashbuckling fights. There's also some violence, but nothing too extreme.Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl has some flaws. Its slow to build, some scenes fail miserably and sometimes its just too stupid.But since I'm not in its target audience. not anymore, I would recommend it because I still enjoyed it very much. It has a light, pirate atmosphere that works very well and provides an innocent fun. This was a very entertaining film for anyone of any age. It had cool action, and good special effects. Johnny Depp was good as Jack and was excellent at playing the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.Perfect Film to take the whole family to. This was also pretty funny. Very good action/family/comedy/pirate movie.Loved this movie! Saw a free sneak preview and would pay to see it again. Johnny Depp was crazy/wonderful as usual. Funny, creative, handsome, surprising - as he always is.Orlando Bloom was like a young Errol Flynn. He was a dream in Lord of the Rings and this proves that was no fluke. He can act, he's good to look at - has a sweet personality and the physicality to carry the role. The swordplay between Bloom and Depp was terrific!Geoffrey Rush pushed the envelope at being wonderfully hammy and the rest of the cast was simply great.Beautifully visual, a bit too long, but worth the ride. And I mean Ride!Really cool! 8.5/10I liked the action parts and the skeleton pirates. If you think of yourself in place of the actors,it helps you get a feeling of how the actor were.There is also romance at the end of the movie.I would recommend this movie.Went to see this on a rainy evening on vacation with my cousin. They loved it, and my parents and I enjoyed the experience too.Depp is an excellent lead - charming and likable, and the other cast members are well cast. Interesting story, good dialog, pretty decent special effects, great pace and length - what more could one ask for?AND IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER FREAKING PIRATE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the movie! Johnny Depp was hilarious in this film. I have never seen him take a role like this and this one he took and did well! Love ya Johnny Depp!Orlando Bloom I thought was also amazing. Although it totally floored me when I found out he was the blonde in Lord of the Rings. I thought it was two different people. Don't ya love it when actors or actresses can change their looks and make you do a double take? Orlando, you have my heart!My kids love the movie and we think it's great! Anybody that wants to check it out, feel free, it's a good choice! One thing we loved about it the most it not only does it twist and turn leading you blindly into the story and keeping you entertained for hours but it's one of those movies you can watch 1,000 times and still enjoy it and never get tired of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates was one of the best movies of '03, with the exception of Return of the King and a few others. At first when I heard about it I was a bit skeptical, seeing has I had been on the ride and wasn't sure how someone could make a movie out of a Disney ride. As soon as the movie ended, though, I immediately called all of my friends and told them to see it.Johnny Depp is amazing in this, and I'm surprised he didn't win the Academy Award. I personally think he looks better with the pirate grunge than without, but thats just me. ;-) The cast is awesome, and the special effects are stunning. If you haven't seen it yet, well first of all that's kind of sad since its been out for over a year, I think...;-) and second, you'd better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello my name is Karen. I want to really commend Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of this movie. It is my most favorite movie of all time. The cast and characters are supurb and their performances are all worthy of an Oscar. I just wanted to share something with you. I work with mentally handicap people all day long. Then I come home, tend to the kids( Scouts, Beavers, Gymnastics, etc.) When the day is done I look forward to sitting back and (just for a few moments in time) to be whisked off into fantasy. I must have watched this movie more than 30 times. So you can see I must thank everyone who made it possible to bring this movie to us (the viewers). I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to Pirates of the Caribbean 2. Well I guess I have taken up enough of your time so again, thankyou for a little bit of solitude in a busy moms life.Sincerly Karen Tilson</fullReview>

It's a shame Hollywood took so long to realize this man's worth, but I'm glad that he's finally getting the recognition that he deserves:-) The movie itself was ok, nothing great. Saved by Depp and Geoffrey Rush(fellow aussie, thanks mate!) in their roles. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were merely adequate. Thankfully, the effects didn't take over the movie, merely helped it look better. A swashbuckling adventure and dare I say I smell a sequel?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST DEPP MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>warning: possible spoilers. (But probably not)&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788;&amp;#9788; (Four out of Four Suns)Although this movie has been out for a while, I thought I could put i my own opinion after watching it several hundred times. With a good plot and great casting I will give this three thumbs up (if I had that many.) Pirates gives a new edge to the boring and predictable pirate movie. The special effects should definitely not be left out. I watched the "behind the scenes" and was amazed at how complicated it is to make the skeleton pirates and the many fight scenes that were included.However, no matter how interesting the plot, the cast for Pirates is what really makes this movie great. Kierra Knightly fits her part very well and portrays it realistically. Orlando Bloom although plays second fiddle to Johnny Depp; also adds an essential ingredient. Last but certainly not least is Johnny Depp; and the sole reason that this movie is hilarious. He has a sense of humor that will keep audiences laughing the entire time. (Ladies, see this movie if only to see Depp and Bloom, I promise you won't be disappointed;) (And to see more Depp, see Secret Window, I highly suggest it.) This movie has everything it should, captivating plot, convincing special effects and great actors. Since this movie has been released in stores, I strongly suggest you check it out; a wonderful date movie! ; )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally like pirate films, so naturally love this one, too. The story is not very outstanding, but it this film has a feeling. The music was great, but some of it was from The Lion King 2. Johnny Depp adds a lot to its success. He totally stole the screen in the scenes where he was in! He's without a doubt one of the best actors of his generation. How sexy he was!!! The way he talked, walked, spoke...and I adored him, when he sang! I think it was an Oscar-worthy performance, but unfortunately the Academy prefers dramatic performances. Sean Penn was great in Mystic River, but Johnny is the clear winner in my book. Geoffrey Rush is perfect as ever, of course. As for Orlando...well, I'm not his biggest fan, but I do like him. I think he should get better roles. He didn't have to act in LOTR, it was a bit better in this one, but he STILL couldn't show his talent. Keira Knightley is a very beautiful and promising actress, suited perfectly for Elizabeth's role. The film is quite good at all, I recommend to watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Johnny Depp has outdone himself in this Academy Award nominated film.Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, reminded me of Dudley Moore's drunken character in Arthur. I was also pleased to see Orlando Bloom take on the co-starring role as the blacksmith in love with the leading lady. Rush also did a noteworthy job, as usual as the bad pirate trying to kidnap, pillage and steal what is unrightfully his.Here is my rating overall for the film:Acting (with the exception of Depp whom I give a 10): 8.5 Writing: 7.5 Directing: 9 C.G.: 9.5One of the best movies to come out this year, and I am upset that this is the first time Depp has ever been nominated for an Oscar, because all of his work is so good, that he should be nominated for everything he does. But, this was just as good if not better than all of his other work up to this point.I give the movie overall a 9 out of 10. Besides, what's better than Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peg-legs, swordplay, plank walking, ships, cannons and ancient curses. Now that's what a summer movie should be. We start off in the 1700s, give or take a hundred, in an island off - where else - the Caribbean. After 30 minutes of setup and character introduction, the island is attacked by the Black Pearl which takes Elizabeth Swann -the Governor's daughter- prisoner. But this be no random pirate attack. The pirates are victims of an Aztec curse that has left them in a state of undead and need Elizabeth's medallion to break it. The roguish Cap'n Jack Sparrow, former captain of the Black Pearl, sets off after them with Will Turner, his new sidekick. That's basically the movie. Now if you're coming into this expecting an intelligent drama about the dangers of sea life, well, forget it. Pirates is a movie whose sole purpose is to entertain, without insulting your intelligence, and entertain it does. It is one of those rare films that's good and fun, and much credit goes to Johnny Depp. One can only guess as to what compelled him to do away with the conventional Errol Flynn pirate and instead channel Keith Richards with a little PePe Le Pew. Depp is an actor who consistently rises above the script, regardless of the film's quality. The stumbling, slurred deliveries, facial expressions and goatee - things that would be out of place in another movie - only add to the performance because they fit in the context of the film. His performance is funny, eccentric, charismatic, and fully worthy of an Oscar nomination. It's time he got some recognition. Without him this would have been an average movie with a good performance from Geoffery Rush. As the mutinous first mate Barbosa, Rush also provides some humorous moments and has some good exchanges with Depp. Orlando Bloom is Will Turner, a blacksmith, who happens to be the reason for the curse. He holds his own as the movie pirate - looks, thinned mustache, ponytail - and Keira Knightley is even better as the damsel in distress. The production values - set design, costumes, cinematography -are first rate as are the special effects. The film also benefits from a rousing score courtesy of Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. The movie could have spent more time in the editing room as it sometimes looses momentum. At two hours twenty minutes, it's about half hour too long. The direction is O.K. The battle scenes and sword fights could have been better choreographed. They come off flat and fail to provide any thrills. The only enjoyable one is the last one when Sparrow and Barbosa are moving in and out of the lunar beams. But these are just minor holes in an otherwise solid film. Pirates of the Caribbean is a fun swashbuckler with a good cast and should appeal to all, even if the wind occasionally goes out of its sails</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun enjoyable movie. Others have said it, but this is maybe the only pirate movie I've ever liked. Smart marketing move in having two very handsome leads in Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, thus avoiding the typical pirates-movies trap of having too large a grunge factor.Johnny Depp gave a memorable entertaining performance as the tipsy whimsical Captain Jack Sparrow. You know it's good when (while watching the movie) you really can't wait until his character makes another appearance. Although the tone is completely different, Johnny Depp gets runner-up in my personal "Best Actor's Performance of 2003" (after Tom Cruise in "The Last Samurai").</fullReview>

If someone is worried about the length of time they are in the theatre, they are not having fun. IT is sad to see others say this about Pirates of the Carribean. This movie is a great exploration of an actors skill and well, basically a fun experience made to be enjoyed by child and adult alike. If you didnt like this movie then perhaps you need to see it again and just enjoy it. If you havent seen this movie, definitely watch it.

		<fullReview>The only reason I even gave this movie a chance was because of the IMDB '8.0' rating it had at the time. That might be just a smudge too high but not by much. When I think of pirates I think of that which I have seen in the movies...PERIOD. Most pirate movies I've seen before were pretty much the same old flat characters or pirate musicals.I recommend this movie. It was extremely entertaining. It was fun. You will like it. What more do you want?Nearly every character was portrayed convincingly and interestingly. The acting did what it was supposed to do - give the viewer the idea of what the character is and does. A good script does this. This is a good script. There was a bit of 'Errol Flynn' hamminess to the action, but that's what made it fun. Lotsa plausible acrobatics. Fantastic but entirely plausible.The scenery and props were presented and the illusion was successful. This is good in a movie like this. Period pieces. I enjoyed every costume, wall, and shrub. The special effects are really special. Some introduce themselves in one of the most interesting ways I have ever seen. I wanted to sing 'Moonlight Becomes You' in my best MST3000 fashion.To top off those special effects you have a plot that is intriguing and a story line that pulls a few surprises. Thus, I will be watching this one again just to catch everything.Now, for me, the only flaw was that it seemed too long. The pacing is real good and the cinematography is superb but after a certain point my mind couldn't absorb anymore. It may have simply been because I was up the previous night til 3:00 AM fixing a 'bug' at work for a program that isn't even mine!....&gt;ahem&lt; scuse my rant...er..or maybe this movie did 'have too many notes'. A second viewing should confirm or dispel this. But I will most certainly enjoy the second viewing as I did the first.Good thrills. Lotsa excitement. Some definite laffs. Great special effects. Twists! Turns! Have some fun! Watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny and the Pirates (Not very original I know)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer full of blockbuster sequels like the Matrix , X2, Terminator 3, etc, it's great to see a new contender enter the ring. Okay, it's not entirely original as it's supposedly based on the Disneyland theme park ride of the same name, but I'm willing to forgive them in this case. This film is one of the funniest, most exciting and entertaining films I've seen in a long time. This won't surprise you if you're a fan of Mousehunt like me. In that film director Gore Verbinski proved that he had the great ability to balance slapstick comedy with dark subject matter. Given a larger canvas, exotic locations, a huge budget and Johnny Depp he has given us a movie that proves the potential he first showed.The plot follows the adventures of pirate Jack Sparrow as he attempts to track down his ship, The Black Pearl, and get his revenge on the crew that betrayed him. Meanwhile however the crew have fallen foul to an Aztec curse that has turned them into the walking dead, doomed to appear in their true form (frightening rotting corpses) when exposed to moonlight. This doesn't sound like the basis of a rollicking action comedy but believe me, it is. Johnny Depp based his pirate character on Ronnie Wood (of Rolling Stones fame), reasoning that pirates were the rock legends of their day, and results have to be seen to be believed. When you leave the cinema you will believe that Depp is the greatest actor of our generation, and if he doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for this I will lose all faith in the Academy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to younger children, as I think the scenes with the zombies could cause nightmares, but for everyone else - you must see this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Pirates of the Caribbean after most of the rage about it had died down so that I could construct my own opinion about it. I had been very skeptical about the whole idea of a pirate movie because it was not a genre that I was attracted to at all. I believe that the movie was very well portrayed on screen by the actors, and the plot was very interesting. I constantly wondered what would happen next. It was not what I had expected from a pirate movie. I had expected the classic, search-for-buried-treasure-on-an-island story. This movie proved my skepticism wrong.I admit, the movie did seem too lengthy, but I couldn't imagine the movie any other way than it is. Part of my interest in the movie was the multiple themes it had. It was full of action, adventure, comedy, romance, and some drama. I think that this aspect of the film either attracted members of the audience, or turned them off in confusion. The movie must be watched more than once to fully grasp its whole feel. The audience must view it with an open mind for the movie to truly come to life.The fact that the movie had an array of themes also must have attracted a vast audience. The movie leaves no one wanting. The actors, especially, delivered spectacular performances, and the whole movie was made believable, and reeled me in. It is a very exciting and entertaining movie, and I believe most people would enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen many movie over my years, all from Bad Taste to real romance films, this movie tops my list because it's not only funny comments, it's also shows how incredible acting and modern technology should be used. Too much and it will cause it too be Matrix like, to little and it doesn't fit the cinemas expectations.First I didn't think Johnny Depp would fit to this movie, but today we know good actors can fit in to any movie thy want to. Acting drunk makes the whole film worth seeing, with meanings you didn't expect from a pirate. Jack Sparrow is both kind hearted and pirate, a pirate that you didn't think existed. Well it all makes the film good and might win some awards.Johnny Depp makes this movie worth the price too look at, but he can't take credit for all. Jonathan Pryce doesn't make this movie funny but he doesn't need too, it is nice to have some strictness in a movie that is solemn like this. When I read what another user had commented, I became very hungry two rewrite the review to make it all clear and no misunderstandings. He did say that it was a spoil in the movie, he sad Jack Sparrow was cursed all the time in the movie, I just have to say watch the movie again and you will se what really happened!Now I'm not a movie expert, but how did thy really manage to go under water with a boat upside down and don't flout up to the surfs. That's might be comedy in high class!Overall I would give this movie 9/10, because we are in need off good movies like this, their are so many films who take place in modern time, which I think is pretty boring. Movies that act in future and prehistoric times are the one that catches me the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HMS Pinafore meets Raiders of the Lost Ark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This rollicking film version of Disney's most popular ride brings the viewer everything they expect ? sword fights, gun battles, debauchery, alley cats, the whole lot delivered with the tongue fixed very firmly in cheek. Central to the action is Johnny Depp's hilarious, camp portrayal of Captain Jack Straw, ably assisted by those two seasoned scene stealers Jeffrey Rush and Jonathan Pryce as Barbossa the cursed pirate and Governor Swann the father of the heroine Elizabeth. Keira Knightley gives a feisty performance as the girl who is promised to the stuffy commodore,but loves the humble blacksmith Orlando Bloom. Of the principals, only Bloom failed to make much impression, although much of that could be due to the fact that his character is fairly `straight' and all the others are so over the top.Depp's performance is so reminiscent of HMS Pinafore, that I kept expecting him to burst into song - `I am the Pirate King' ? and the non-stop hilarious action , thrills and special effects owe more to Raiders of the Lost Ark than to the pirate movies of the 40s. The plot is pretty thin, but why expect more of something of this genre ? the performances are flawless, the thrills and the laughs come one on top of the other ? this is a movie made to entertain not to make you think. A thoroughly enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

The Jack Sparrow character was quite a departure from Depp's usual style of acting, but he pulled it off well, was interesting and very funny. Orlando Bloom makes a good romantic hero though I hardly recognized him without his elf ears and blond wig. Another poster to this board complained that it was illogical for Jack Sparrow to have turned out to be cursed all along;but he wasn't. He didn't become cursed until he filched the gold piece out of the chest right before the fight with Barbossa. Watch that scene again and you'll see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just say that without Johnny Depp's performance this would only be a so-so adventure film by Gore Verbinsky (who did an amazing job with "The Ring"). But Depp was never as powerful and funny as in this picture, and he's supported by some fine actors like Geoffrey Rush and British newcomer Keira Knightley.A great disappointment, though, is Orlando Bloom's so-called acting. After his overrated debut in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, he chose to change bow and arrow against swords. He's decidedly lovely but utterly deadpan, his lines come out badly (how did he ever manage to go through acting school?), and his performance as Will Turner is quite clumsy. One wonders what he will do in a part that requires no fight scenes...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho, ho, ho! It's a pirates life for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly one of this years best and most loved movies. Back here in S.A our nationwide newspaper, "Die Burger" (pronounced dy burger) has voted it as one of this years (2003) top ten movies! I've seen it for the first time somewere in September. I remember it quite well. It was a late night feast in Stellenbosh and the theatre was chocablock full. My favourite thing about the movie is most certainly Captain Jack Sparrow. The smart ellegant pirate. I've seen this movie up to date about five times! Renting the video from my video store. My advise to you is to certainly go see this movie, quite worth your while!My special greetings The Afrikaans speaking 14 year old Jan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEWARE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THIS FILM!THE GOOD:--The action sequences are fabulous and the movie is jam-packed with them. In particular the sword-fight between Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is very cool, as is the final big fight with all the CGI pirate skeletons facing off against the humans.--Gore Verbinski pulls some great performances out of his very talented cast. The stand out is, of course, the phenomenal Johnny Depp. His performance as Jack Sparrow is oozing with charisma and presence, Depp is just a joy to watch as usual. Geoffrey Rush is very convincing as the man who was rumoured to be so evil that he was "spit out of hell itself". Orlando Bloom is a charming, doe-eyed performer and given more to do than he was in the Lord of the Rings movies. Keira Knightley is babelicious to say the least and also a very good actress (seen also in "Bend it Like Beckham").--The CGI in this film is unforgettable, certainly some of the best work of 2003. The pirates were extremely convincing and looked awesome, I loved the way the movie darted from CGI to real and so on. The big action sequences were filmed with finesse and their effects were also great.--This is a film for virtually everybody. It is popular worldwide among all ages, and ended up for me being the biggest surprise of 2003 (be honest, who expected this film to be as great as it is?). Why is it that it was so popular? Because there is something for everybody here. You've got all the action and adventure on the high seas, a sweet, believable romance, lots of great physical comedy and some good suspense drama thrown in there for good measure. I loved how the film managed to mix all this in without ever losing sight of the plot and where the story is going.--This fun film is based on an adventure park ride, and I thought that director Verbinski and his team do a great job of giving the film the feeling of a ride come to life. A lot of the time I felt like I was in the movie as it was so energetic and involving - especially the scene where Keira Knightley is thrown from dead pirate to dead pirate in our first encounter with the not-so-human baddies.--I loved the score to the movie, it gave a very old-fashioned feeling to the piece and it fits well because "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is an old-styles movie, a throwback to the great, classic swashbucklers of past ages.THE BAD:--The only place the movie cops out a bit is in the way it can be a bit Disney-ish. I hated the unfunny eye-losing pirate, and some of the other pirates were a bit too cliché and supposed to be comic relief when they were really just annoying background characters. I would've also appreciated a bit more gore and on-screen blood and killing, which is probably asking to breach the PG-13 rating, God forbid.RATING:9/10 - Terrific, rip-roaring old school action/adventure that never gets old at 143 minutes and leaves you begging for a sequel.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Bend it Like Beckham (8/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (10/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (10/10) Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was a little put off by the trailer for this movie. At first it looked like a cheap, commercially-oriented piece of garbage aimed at 12 year olds. I am glad I took the time to sit down and watch it, this is one of the best new movies I've seen in a while. Johnny Depp's character was quite likeable and the whole "high seas adventure" was played up very well. The first thing I thought when I saw that it was a pirate movie is "long, drawn out scenes of bad swashbuckling." Surprisingly, this movie isn't at all bad in that respect. The amount of action satisfies, yet respects the audience's intelligence. The end is somewhat disappointing, as if Disney had to tack on a feel-good, although unrealistic ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS WARNING I think Pirates is a must-see. It is my favorite movie of all time because it has a little bit of everything. Comedy, action and adventure. I don't think they could have gotten better actors to play the parts. Everyone was good at what they did. I know it seems like I say this a lot, but I mean this. It is among the select few films that aren't the least bit corny. The fight scenes were excellent and when the Black Pearl attacked the city, it was excellent. The special effects were superb and the storyline was finominal. It is definately awesome how each main character is on their feet and quick thinking. I think it gets 2 thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Journey of a Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen. All the effort and effects that were put into it were great. I watched the bonus features on my DVD, and how the movie was made and put together. I give a lot of credit to all of those that took any part in the movie. It was fun to follow along in the wild and creative journey. Johnny Depp was my favorite actor. He played CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow very well. He is a great actor, he made this movie fun. (On top of that, he is really hott). I really liked the plot of this movie, because it was alive, dangerous and fun. There probably weren't any better actors for the parts than who played them. The effects and time put into this movie was tremendous. Like building the forts, and ships. And all the extras, makeup, hair, costumes, and beards. My favorite part of the movie was when CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) gets to be the CAPTAIN of the Black Pearl. There is so much I could say, but to be simple...This was a creative and wonderful movie that I will watch over and over.</fullReview>

Jonny Depp as Jack Sparrow (Can you say Yummy?) was the smartest choice that they made, as well as Orlando Bloom as Will Turner (also very yummy!) I never saw the film in the theatres, which I very much regret! I bought the DVD last week and I have watched it for the umpteenth time since I bought it.The storyline was great (a little long, but more of Jack and Will for me *grins*).

		<shortDescription>Thanks to Depp, better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this film in the theater, mostly because the premise just didn't interest me much - a movie based on a theme-park ride?? You've gotta be kidding me. Even after many of my friends saw the film and told me it was worthwhile, my hesitation continued. Finally, just the other day, I was overruled at a friend's house and had no choice but to watch it or go home. And it was cold outside! Having now seen the film, I must first say: thank god for Johnny Depp. Because without his hilarious and utterly original performance as the slightly mad and infinitely colorful Captain Jack Sparrow, I probably would have hated this film. Moving like a man who has forgotten how to walk on land, with his unusual accent and flamboyant gesticulation, Captain Jack is a guy you just have to like. But every time the action moved away from him, I tended to lose interest. I don't mean to slam the rest of the cast - they were all solid. And the film's production values are also fine, with excellent special effects and cinematography. But with the exception of Depp's performance I didn't find anything truly remarkable about it, even considering its genre. The film simply belongs to him.Since POTC's release, fans have been suggesting that Depp receive an Oscar nomination as Best Actor. Although I've been a fan of his for years, I couldn't imagine it - not for this (again, a movie based on a theme-park ride??), anyway - but now I understand. The Disney Corporation should be thanking their lucky stars that the man accepted the role, because without Depp, POTC would be hardly worth remembering at all, and an actor who can carry a film in such a way is a brilliant actor indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this film! There are stunning performances from Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and of course the unforgettable JOHNNY DEPP! His character is portraid as a kind, clever, slightly loopy pirate captain and I think he is fab at it. In my eyes he makes the whole film worth watching again and again!In this great, action packed, swashbuckling adventure Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner - Son of Bootstrap Bill Turner - (Orlando Bloom) disembark on a wonderful journey full of danger, pirates and curses, the only thing that makes it worth while for them is their individual "pot of gold" at the other end. For Will, his gold is the enchanting Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and for Jack, his beloved ship, "The Black Pearl", that was stolen from him by his mutanous first mate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)!I very highly recomend this great film for anyone who is up for a laugh and also wants an film that will keep them perched on the edge of their seats all the way through!I give this great film a massive11/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Seas adventures - terrifically Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one fun movie and well, the typically excellent Johnny Depp is absolutely pitch perfect as 'Jack Sparrow', playing him with just the right sense of 'tongue in cheek' and sincerity rolled into one.The premise is simple - there's a ship called 'The Black Pearl' which is rumoured to have a ghost crew, led by a captain 'so evil, hell spat him out'. Elizabeth Swann (a duly beautiful Keira Knightley) gets kidnapped by the crew and her childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sets out to save her, with the help of Jack Sparrow, the only pirate who knows how to get to the dreaded 'Black Pearl'.Cue endless adventures, swordfights, mirth, comic twists and the hunt for buried treasure and you have one of the most solidly entertaining blockbusters of many years. It's aimed at all ages, but with a subtle humour and knowing for the adults.Terrific fun - worth watching and far more entertaining than it perhaps deserves to be, you'd be a fool to miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really do think that the should give Johnny Depp an Oscar for his portrayal of Jack Spa-I mean, sorry CAPTIAN Jack Sparrow. No other actor could have pulled this off with out looking either like a moron or gay. Also, Depp practacally created this character himself, making him a highly unusual cross between Keith Richards and Pepe LePeu. Johnny Depp is the best actor in the world, and Captain Jack Sparrow is perhaps one of the most unusual and original characters to ever grace the movie screen. He stole the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films of 2003 and is the best film of the summer. It features all the perfect elements of a great film: romance, laughs, adventure, action, and walking skeletons. The pirate film genre has been sucsessfully brought back to life due to a great cast. Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightly) is the Govener's daughter in the Caribbean who found a cursed pirate medallion. When pirates, led by the relentless Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in order to break a deadly curse, Will Turner the blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) and the hillarious Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) set out to rescue her. Throghout the dangers of the high seas, there are planty of laughs, thrills and chills. The pirates have a frightening secret that can only be cured from the blood of the child of Bootstrap Bill. Soon, everyone realizes whose blood must be spilt.Orlando, Geoffery, and Kiera make outstanding performances in this film but Johnny Depp is worth the video rental price alone. He completly charmed the audience and made them laugh until tears came out of their eyes. If you love a hillarious, exciting adventure, Pirates is for you.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN REVIEW THE MOVIE Movies about cursed pirates died out and flopped decades ago but this movie is brings new enthusiasm the pirate genre has been looking forward to. This is a great popcorn flick that has really put the Swash back into BucklingThis action/ adventure/comedy is loosely based on the ride at Disneyland. Although the similarities are somewhat few and far between this is probably a good thing as it escapes the Disney marketing attempt feel.The extremely well chosen cast could never be better with Johnny Depp brilliantly playing the light-hearted mostly-drunk pirate Jack Sparrow (sorry Captain Jack Sparrow). He provides most of the comedy in his one-liners, lucky escapes and defiant bragging. The romance is between the kidnapped Governors daughter Elizabeth Swann, (Kiera Knightly) and Will Turner (played wonderfully by man-of-the-moment Orlando Bloom) who comes to her rescue. The typical cursed pirate, Captain Barbossa of the titular 'Black Pearl' (played by Geoffrey Rush) is the all round bad guy shouting traditional pirate phrases. The CG (done by Industrial Light and Magic) is literally ground breaking with cursed pirates turning from skeletal to flesh as they battle in and out of moonlight. This gives both an eerie and astonishing effect.To round off there are action scenes galore with numerous sword fights and canon fire which are amazing and really keep the film up to speed.THE EXTRAS No DVD is complete nowadays without extras. With a full extra disc there is quite a lot to keep one amused for hours. There are three commentaries, which really depend on what you want to get out of a commentary the first is with Gore Verbinski (director) and Johnny Depp, which is surprisingly quite dull mainly thanking various people for hard work. If you are looking for trivia then the partial commentary with Jerry Bruckheimer (producer) or commentary with scriptwriters is for you, but the one I found the best is the commentary with actors Kiera Knightly and Jack Davenport (who plays Commodore Norrington) This commentary is also partial but is the funniest. The partial commentary is something I have never come across before but is quite an advantage, as you don't have to watch the whole film again and listen to people drone on about scenes that weren't really important to them. The downfall I felt to this DVD is the interactive menus which if you just want to get the film to play means time is lost waiting for menus to load. Back to positive and the second disc holds loads of good stuff. The first I checked out was the blooper real with the actors messing up, which you don't quite often get to see. The bad thing about this is that it was only 3mins. There are 19 deleted scenes, which I didn't really feel were very interesting so it just as well they stayed deleted. There are many different featurettes on this disc. The ones I'm liking the most is the Epic at Sea, Diary of a Pirate and Fly on the set which are all on the set interviewing actors etc. which prove very interesting and in depth. There is also `Walt Disney Wonderful World of Color' which shows a bit about the ride for all who haven't been on it. The last line is I think this is a wonderful movie and the DVD really compliments it well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best films I hve ever seen. I went to the pictures to see it five times and if I could watch it again right now, I'd be there! Each time I watched it I got more and more out of it!The first time I watched it I knew that just once wouldn't do it justice. The score for this film was so good! The music just got you so involved! The camera angles and shots were perfect and caught every detail without making it boring.The script was wonderful and just packed with one liners that have now become well known sayings in many households already. The fight sequences were just right, they didn't drag on and you werent left sitting there saying "Oh the possibilities of that fight!"It was also such a well done period film that you didn't feel like it was a different period at all but like you were really there. I don't think I really have to comment on the acting because everyone regardless of having seen it or not knows how excellent everyone in the film was. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were both done up and acted so well that you would not have picked them from any other time, place, or film. Well Done 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has ever been to Disneyland has rode Pirates of the Caribbean. And, it's often everyone's favorite ride, I know it's mine. However, I was excited to watch because it has the 2 hottest guys in Hollywood: Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, and the story appealed to everyone. It has everything: action, plenty of laughs, great cast and characters, and a good plot. Hopefully, if Disney continues to make movies of its attractions, they won't fall short on characters and plot holes. Bring the whole family for this one. Watch for the similarities from the ride: the dog holding the keys in the jail, and the wonderful song, "Yo ho ho, the life of a pirate for me." Dead men tell no tales.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't overly impressed with the movie itself. The characters were interesting, the story a bit confusing, but I love everybit that Johnny Depp plays.Like in previous comments about where Johnny Depp is in films, he is one of the most talented performers I have seen on film. Aside from being good looking (yes I am a guy and yes, I do think he is good looking), he is also a fantastic performer; one who brings real character to his performance and characters.He is always somebody who attracts attention and doesn't need to carry a big gun and blow s**t up to do it.Every role he portrays is delivered with gusto and humor, even if the scene is morbid...figure that out.When Hollywood is looking for action hereos, they just have to look to Depp. (not the highest paying actor in film, but far far better than Jim Carrey)I look forward to more films with Johny Depp in them and woould like to see something that he can direct/write or create.I have never had the luxury to work with him, but hopefully someday I will.By chance, if you do get to read this Johnny, there are several fantastic screenplays that require your presence and you can reach me to find out more about them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates, action and comedy. It made for a good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must start with I did expect it to be better but at the same time did not watch it with any expectations from the storyline. I was actually quite surprised by Johnny Depps performance because I sometimes feel his performances could have been better based on his previous work. Also I knew he'd be speaking with an accent which I anticipated my be very poor like the way he spoke in the 9nth Gate. It was anything but. His character was by far the most likable. Orlando Bloom was decent but I think many not so well knowns could have given an equally good performance if not better. By the end of the movie they try to pretty up his character with his glued on facial hair and weaved in extensions hanging and styled which are so obviously fake and so obviously loaded with hair gel. Hollywoods desperate for sex cymbals I see. Anyway the film revolves around a group of pirates that have been cursed for their greed and misdeeds by a bounty they were paid in cursed gold. Captain Jack Sparrow is out to get revenge and his ship back which the cursed pirates who committed mutiny on him now live their curse on. Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) is the son of one of these pirates that was murdered by his own shipmates and is needed to break the curse. Basically its a story of boy loves girl, girl protects boy and by doing so gets kidnapped. Everyone in the film is after the Black Pearl for one reason or another. There are some great action scenes, a good amount of humor and of course pirates. The special effects were pretty good too and added just that much more to the films plot being carried out. No I wouldn't give it a ten but just for the opening scene where Johnny Depp arrives in the docks it gets a 7. It was a classic Hollywood moment where art, humor and reality meets up in a way we just love to see, and don't often anymore with most films. Worth watching more than once for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean has to be one of the greatest of Johnny depps movies, it follows the path of Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as they struggle to rescue the lovely Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightly) and re-claim the black pearl, once belonging to Captain Jack Sparrow until his first mate Captain Barbosa(Rush) lead a mutiny against him and left him stranded on a desert isle with nothing but a pistol with a single bullet in it. The twist is that the captain of the black pearl (Barbosa) and all of his crew have a curse upon them and they need a gold medallion and a certain persons blood to lift the curse,both belonging to Elizabeth Swan or so they think, and so the love struck Will Turner sets out to save her accompanied by the swish and charismatic Jack Sparrow. excellent performances all round, especially the fantastic accent from Johnny Depp, savvy? 10/10 a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden Globe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So we've all heard enough about Depp's incredible performance in Pirates. I've seen all his films, and while I wouldn't say it is his best (I have a strong affection for Ed Wood and DeadMan), it's still the best performance by anyone in a big-budget picture so far this year. If there was any justice in this world, Depp would get an Oscar because he created this character himself. All he had to go on was dialogue, and out of this he brought to life the incredible insanity of Jack Sparrow. You don't see this type of active creation much in actors nowadays. Anyway, to make this short, here's my prediction: there is no justice in this world, so Depp won't get the Oscar. But, if he doesn't get a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy/musical, you will know then truly that the world is coming to an end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess, at the beginning I was not very enthusiastic about seeing this movie. I wondered "What new thing can be told about pirates?" not to mention that pirates movies were not precisely my main choice, due to terrible flicks such as "Cutthroat Island" (yuck), but then I said, if I'm going to criticize a movie I have to see it, right? OK, so I went to the movie theater with my pals, expecting to see a big waste of money, but, you know what? You can imagine, I LOVED IT! yes, I found it really amusing, but not banal, you know, everything was perfectly synchronized to work, to make laugh, even to scare. I have to say that Mr. Johnny Depp's performance is OUT OF THIS WORLD, fantastic, I'm not saying that his previous films were not superior, actually, some of them are; but I rediscovered Mr. Depp with this film, he is really a comedic actor. I can even suggest the Academy a well deserved award for him. Or for Mr. Geoffrey Rush. AMAZING! he is another great actor who doesn't take himself so seriously, giving his character a special dose of sarcasm and fun. Then, the lead couple, Orlando Bloom &amp; Kyra Knightley (hope I wrote it right), they just do their job, I'm not saying they're bad, but their characters are not really as appealing as Depp's and Rush's roles are. But I must say She is gorgeous. Then, the delirious crew of the Black Pearl, they are simply funny! What else, oh yeah, the art direction, the costume design, the special effects, the makeup; those characteristics that can even be more important than the story of acting (Terminator 3?), but in this movie, they just combine perfectly to deliver an excellent product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A key moment in "Pirates of the Caribbean" comes with our first glimpse of Johnny Depp as Captian Jack Sparrow. He's standing proudly atop the mast of his vessel as it sails into Port Royal, hair rustling in the wind, the score thundering in full galleon-plowing-the-waves mode. Then a couple shots later, it's revealed that Jack's "ship" is a battered dingy so full of leaks that it makes the last several feet into port mostly submerged. The anticlimactic entrance sets the same tongue-in-cheek feel I remember from the Disney theme park ride which inspired the film. It's this sense of fun that saves the movie--if Gore Verbinski had approached the material in all seriousness (a la "Cutthroat Island"), "Pirates" would have been unendurable. As it is, we've got a nice popcorn movie on our hands, where the pleasures are occasionally guilty, but pleasures nonetheless.The "Black Pearl" of the subtitle is a pirate ship--Jack Sparrow's ship, or at least it was before his first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) led a mutiny and marooned him. But not long afterwards, the Black Pearl's crew runs afoul of some cursed Aztec gold, which dooms them to an undead existence (as Jack himself points out, the whole mutiny business kind of worked out for him in the long run). In a rather gruesome echo of "Swan Lake," the cursed pirates appear normal until exposed to moonlight, which reveals them as decayed cadavers. To break the curse, they need a certain medalion and a blood tribute, both of which end up involving the high-born Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley), and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who worships her from afar.Along the way, there's as many chases, escapes, ship battles, swordfights, and general swashbuckling as you'd expect in this kind of film--perhaps even more. It's somewhat unfortunate that the best of these sequences should be the first, a duel between Jack and Will in a smithy. But there are some nice visuals during the climax, with the undead pirates darting in and out of shafts of moonlight.Ultimately, though, this movie belongs to Johnny Depp. He's made a career of playing characters who are slightly odd, but Jack Sparrow is perhaps the oddest of them all. Looking more than slightly seedy and moving as if he's perpetually falling off-balance, Jack has the manic gleam of someone who's very brilliant and/or very crazy. He doesn't just march to his own drummer, he's a rhythm all to himself. That Geoffrey Rush manages to match Depp for energy speaks a lot for his talent. These are two actors clearly enjoying themselves to the hilt, and their joy carries over to the audience. About all the rest of the cast can do is try to keep up with them. Bloom, who has the unenviable task of playing straight man to Depp, manages very well in the young lover role. Looking more rugged and less ethereal than he does in the "Lord of the Rings" movies, he establishes his candicacy as a bona-fide leading man. I also liked the work of Jack Davenport as the Royal Navy officer who's Jack's nemisis and Will's romantic rival. Such a character could easily have been your standard-issue unimaginative stiff, but Davenport fleshes out the part nicely.The greatest weakness of "Pirates" is the ending, which extends the resolution out far longer than feels necessary. But the trip there is a delightful one, delivering laughs and action in equal shares. Drink up, me harties.</fullReview>

This Movie, is, in short, one of the greatest movies in history. it will apply to just about anyone; Cute boys for the prisses, romance for the women, action for the guys, comedy for us middle-of-the-roaders, and a bit of drama, to make it equal. I will admit, the plot jumps a bit, but this is the Millennium, so what do you expect? Either way, the characters are amazing, the plot in general is intriguing, the setting and filming will blow you away. Don't just watch this movie, buy it, memorize it, cuz i promise, it'll be worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ship-A-Hoy My Matey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis Spoiler! Ship-A-Hoy My Matey. As the title states, this is a movie about pirates who are under an ancient curse. Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) runs the Black Pearl with a crew of the undead. Because of the curse, the ship is doomed to sail the Caribbean Sea for eternity looking for the loss treasure. The curse will be removed if they are able to put all the gold coins back into the gold chest. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) received one of these gold coins from his father as a child. However, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) took the coin from Will and has it in her possession. The pirates kidnap her and the swashbuckling action begins. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) helps in the rescue of Elizabeth and the return of his ship, the Black Pearl. The special effects of the battle scenes and the skeletons of the dead pirates were well done. However, the acting of Depp was the biggest drawback of the movie. Depp played an incompetent captain, and I think he was also an incompetent actor in this part with terrible makeup. All the bad pirates played their parts very well, however, you didn't know if Captain Jack Sparrow was a good pirate or a bad pirate. Even though Disney made this movie, this is not a movie to take your kids. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most genres suffer the effects of booms and depressions associated with audience fickleness and the current trend. Only the Action, Thriller and Drama genres retain any sense of stability. Therefore the large ? scale investment in a movie which does not have the benefit of a boom period is a risky one. ?Pirates Of The Caribbean' is an attempt at regenerating the pirate movie with a movie so bold that it even has a sub ? title thus indicating the intent of future development of the concept. The pay ? off could be big or it could be a major loss. The achieved success is a consequence of the producers doing their homework. If it was a gamble, it was a confident one.The elements of its success are numerous, but the one's that got the attention were the story, the acting, the characters and the visual feast. No single element took centre stage and an excellent balance was struck which ensured that audience attention was not diverted by any one element being stronger or weaker at any point in the movie. Bruckenheimer's production style is well suited to a movie such as this and his experience in the production of several Hollywood blockbusters must have significantly decreased the risk factor.The story was a rich one that flowed gracefully introducing new characters at opportune times and providing sufficient obstacles for our heroes to overcome. This was crucial considering the movies length, although this time length is becoming more acceptable to audiences of today who are adapting as blockbusters are now being produced with involved stories which create greater character development. This is good for moviemakers who may sometimes find it difficult to condense stories to the allotted time limit.Suspension of disbelief was a subconscious one since the audience knew that it was watching a story which had the fantasy of a children's book. This is a natural component of stories about pirates since they conjure up an image of outlaws living outside the natural realm. Past stories captured our imagination as we were told of these barbaric beings that slipped out from under the shadows and plundered returning to their dark realm only to return to strike another hapless target. The great expanse of the ocean abound with uncharted territories and riches to plunder accentuated this quasi ? romantic image.The acting on show perfectly set aside each character as an individual who added to the story in their own way. Johnny Depp gave a style to his character that would have been amusing for the younger audience including enough expected character of a pirate so as to keep it in line with the story. As defined by him, pirates would have been something akin to rock stars in their time. This interpretation would have made it easy to be contrived which would have ruined the opportunity created for an original character. This was definitely not the case as the lines were sufficiently sublime and the acting was restrained enough so as to avoid a transparent performance. Let's not forget the assistance provided by the make ? up department in the form of eyeshadow. Which self ? respecting aspirant rock star would not have black eyeshadow? Our conventional image of a pirate was not portrayed here and this task was left to the character of Jeffrey Rush.This characters entrance was tantalisingly held back as the audience were given entertaining clues as to the character of Barbossa. Lines like ?he was spat out by hell' served to create an image of extreme depravity and insatiable greed. When we see him for the first time, this image is smoothly slipped into with restraint similar to that of Depp's. He is the archetypal pirate with which the audience will readily identify. We even have the characteristic ?Aaaaarrr'. As with the character of Depp, there is also originality although more in line with the producers' conception of the character rather than the acting adaptation of Rush. The parrot is traded in for a monkey. This is in tandem with his hyped up image of evil since the monkey looks more mischievous than a parrot. A pirate who is supposed to be the most evil of all must have the most mischievous companion of all.Who also gave a good performance and was consistent throughout. She did not fall into the trap of being too fragile and thus becoming a Scream Queen. Instead she developed into a heroine as she took the battle to ?The Black Pearl'. The originality evident in the characters of Depp and Rush was not adapted here which did not bring too much disappointment since she retained enough presence in their company. Although she looked like a clone from ?Titanic', she gave enough adventurous spirit and was therefore not as fragile as a ?rose'. Excuse the pun, it was hard to resist. The producers were right in casting someone who had a tried and tested look with the audience, but in doing so did not build on the originality as delivered by the leading men.The pirate movies that I have seen in the past all seem to visually fantastic. This one does much to continue this necessary trend. The world of the pirate is something otherworldly belonging only to our imaginations until some moviemakers give us their graphic depiction of this. The sets are at times spectacular in bringing this world to life. This movie does much to satisfy one of the requirements of the big screen which is to take our senses to another level. After all, the big screen is not ordinary ? it is grand. Why use a Mako as a prowler of the deep when you can use a Hammerhead.?Pirates Of The Caribbean' is an enjoyable movie, but it is not particularly memorable. This was probably not the ultimate aim of the producers. Audiences are looking for quick fix panaceas to their daily stress and in depth storylines do not provide this. The movie was aimed at profit ? taking in the short ? term. This means that the movie would have to be devoid of messages, but high on family amusement. This allows the producers to target the mass audience and thus make the movie more bankable. It is important to note that the story itself is not weak, it fact as previously mentioned it is a rich offering many avenues for entertainment. It does, however, fall short of the ideal for the stage that it graces. The grand stage requires a story of greater magnitude, which will entertain as well as teach for generations to come. Notwithstanding this fact, there are at present certain economic realities that the producers are paying attention to. Hopefully the future holds greater prospect for stories down the generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Crap! A great movie based on a bad Disney ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As competing companies such as Dreamworks and Warner Bros. are laying down some new law on the animation frontier, what used to be the king daddy of all animation, Disney, is starting to be a mere shell of its former self, because of the focus on money and selling out rather than quality entertainment. The real success of Disney nowadays is from Pixar (which might defect from Disney) and some live action movies, especially "Pirates". This is a review on Pirates, so on with the review. Since about everybody saw the movie, I won't tell the story. I love the story (which goes beyond the damsel-in-distress quabble that may offset moviegoers at first). I love the effects (especially the skeletons). It blends my favorite genres (action and comedy) in a very good way. I like the acting. There are references to the retched Disney ride that the movie is based on (like the song young Elizabeth sings in the flashback in the beginning ["Yo Ho! Yo Ho! A pirate's life for me!"]). The only sort of problem is that the movie is a bit too overbudget, but that's no big deal, since that does not affect the movie in a negative way. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I give the ride a 0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like action movies,this one's a must-see! I'm a big fan of Orlando Bloom, and I went just to see his performance, but ended up liking Johnny Depp and Kiera Knightley's performances just as much. It's a perfect movie to see with the whole family, it's funny for the comedians in the family; action packed for your son; and if you have a daughter, she will love Elizabeth(Knightley) and may try to imatate her every action! Although, the skeletons mey be too scary for some younger one's, the movie's plot makes the skeletons more funny than scary. When I went to see it, I was expecting a more serious movie like Lord of the Rings, but it is far too histerical to even compare with Lord of the Rings. If you've been to the Disney attraction at Disney World, you will notice parts of the movie have parts of the ride in it, like the jailers trying to get the keys from the dog, or the one pirate sleeping with the pigs. You and your family will love this movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the other comments of people who have seen this movie, and I agree with any superlatives given to the movie, the leading actors, the character actors, the effects, etc. This is one film I will want to see again and again. In fact, I have seen it four times thus far and I can't wait to see it again before it leaves the theaters. So much goes on, it is impossible to catch everything the first few times around.One major contribution to the movie is the fantastic music throughout. Klaus Badelt, who wrote the music, caught the EXACT flavor of each scene with each of his pieces. Even without the benefit of seeing the movie, his music is the epitome of pirates.While I am not a movie critic, I know what I like, and it's "Pirates." Johnny Depp, you are sexy and a master thespian; Orlando Bloom, you are on your way; Geoffrey Rush, be my pirate any time!Ho, Ho, Ho, a Pirate's Life for Me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had serious doubt about a Disney movie based on a funride. The fact that it was a pirate movie only added to that (remember Cutthroat Island, anyone?) More or less forced to watch it, I was very pleasantly surprised. Johnny Depp delivers a performance I think even he will find hard to top. Geoffrey Rush was good as Barbosa. Keira Knightley was brilliantly cast however, playing ms.Swann with conviction and clearly with a lot of fun. Finally, Orlando Bloom. Yes, what to say of Bloom? Good, but as he showed in LOTR, he can do much better then this.The movie itself was very funny, and with enough action to keep everyone's attention focused on the screen. The ladies will adore Depp and Bloom, and the fella's? Well, let's just Keira Knightley can call me anytime, however unlikely that may be.Great effects mixed in with good stuntwork and absolutely superb acting, with Depp delivering an absolutely believable yet over the top Captain Jack Sparrow. I enjoyed it a lot, and can recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a pirates life for me for me a pirates life for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have little reason to fault this film as it went well beyond my expectations. Ok so the original premise is a bit odd...an adaptation of a theme park ride...but the execution of the story is incredible. The story isn't hard to grasp, so all the more time to absorb the characters, scenery and those incredible sets. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is at the peak of his game. The character needs do nothing but enter the scene to shed humour on the screen. If Rolling Stone Keith Richards were a pirate this is what he'd be like I'm sure! Orlando Bloom is always nice to look at whilst Geoffrey Rush is finally getting the exposure and the parts he deserves. The movement back and forth from human to skeleton isn't bad and the detail in the two ships is excellent. I found there not to be a moment where I checked my watch through the film other than when I had to go to the loo...there was a reason for the 90 minute feature...It's a bit of fun, and fun it is. Watch it and enjoy! I wanna be a pirate when I grow up...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do people fight an unkillable enemy? Answer:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one question that keeps popping up concerning this highly entertaining film is, why do people fight so valiantly against an unkillable enemy? Watch it again and you'll discover that no one believes in the curse. Those dutiful soldiers think they're just attacking a bunch of rag-tag flesh and blood pirates. When these scurvy knaves finally show themselves to be half-rotted skeletons, what are the soldiers to do? Lay down and die? Of course not, because if you were confronted with certain death, I'm sure you'd keep fighting in a manic (though futile) hope that somehow you'll live. In this case, that seemingly stupid effort works because of Depp's infiltration into the curse. Remember, Depp never bothered to lift a sword until he joined the curse, then battled away only to divert attention so the curse could be lifted, thus doing away with his mortal enemy in the most timely of fashion. So mateys, thar is your answer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates like Johnny are a new breed. They can singlehandedly bring a long movie to life and instill it with the fun and wit of the original screenplay. My complements to the writers'(Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert) of this fabulously fun, if not a tad long when Johnny's larger then life character (Jack Sparrow) is off the screen, movie. My expectations of PotC:TCotBP were high and low at the same time... the movie had some good actors, but was based on a funpark ride... I found that plotwise it worked just like the funpark ride itself (probably - haven't experienced it my self). Waiting for the next bit did occur quite a few times, but when the next bit came it was very fun. The screenplay and Johnny's delivery of it make this movie really worth watching - enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney managed to make a good movie that adults can enjoy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I have seen POTC in the theater 3 times. And yes, there were those certain parts I laugh at every time. It amazing to think that Disney has finally made a movie that adults aren't forced to see because their kids are giddy over it. I at first didn't comprehend the fact that it was directly related to a ride at Disneyland, and just the fact that Johnny Depp was wearing eyeliner made me countdown the days until it came out. POTC, in many ways, was a completely awesome movie. Hilariously ironic and witty, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are a great acting couple, and the movie all in all gives you mixed emotions. But there are those times when you wonder why it's rated PG-13 instead of R (we can't do that 'what was the pirate movie rated? -- ARRR' joke now, darnit!), and then you realize that it probably would be a bit better if it had more graphic details and more scenes that make you jump in it.This movie was the first actually GOOD movie to come out in a while. I'm just afraid they'll try to make a sequel (like every OTHER Disney movie) and ruin the entire thing. Which, unfortunantly, they'll probably try. Sigh, the life of a pirate lover -- you're never happy with what ya got.</fullReview>

'Good' pirates, 'bad' pirates, british twits, 'chaotic' characters -- other reviewers complained that the movie tried to hard to make everyone funny, but I found it great that this was not a pure black-and-white good-and-evil movie. I *wanted* the black pearl pirates to get their curse removed, while also wanting Johnny Depp to get his fortune, while also wanting Orlando Bloom to get the girl, while also wanting.... well, you get the idea. In short, the way the story allowed viewers to root for everyone simultaneously was very refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best blockbuster of the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the pretentious nonsense that was the Matrix Reloaded, and the disappointments of The Hulk and T3, Pirates of the Caribbean was like a breath of fresh air! By far the best blockbuster of the summer and maybe even the year, Pirates is a return to the good old fashioned adventure films that I grew up with. It also benefits from being one of the few big films of late that doesn't have any wire assisted slow mo kung fu (hollywood - enough already!) Both exciting and funny, Pirates has some great set pieces and a truly stand out performance from Johnny Depp who is hilarious. Orlando Bloom continues to show he could be the next 'big thing', Geoffrey Rush provides great support as the villain Captain Barbossa and Keira Knightley is, well, gorgeous! Pirates, swordfights, ghostships and the walking dead - what more could you want from a film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This definately is one of the best films i have ever seen, and it has been the most popular film by far with many many people each week at the cinema i work at.the film has a unique and engrossing story line, incorporating many myths and themes that were around at the time of the pirates. the story centres around the initial finding of a piece of aztec gold, one of a large number of pieces which make a set. it may sound basic, but there's more to it, as the treasure is cursed, so anyone who takes even one piece of the gold becomes cursed. this is where the story kicks in, as a group of pirates have spent years trying to find all the pieces to lift the curse bestowed upon them. there is so much to summise from the fantastic plot that i won't waste time, and simply say just go and see the film. it's worth it, and besides, i'm not one to give too much away. but my pitiful summary does not do justice to the spot on story.the soundtrack to the film is by far the best music score i've heard in a film for a long long time, (with the exception of Moulin Rouge of course). it's lively, yet superbly classical.it has been fantastic being a projectionist for this film (among others) and I have seen the people coming out of the film just buzzing with excitment, all talking about how amazing it is. It is a rarity in as much as it appeals to all ages, and whether young or old, the reaction has almost exclusively been a huge buzz of excitement after the film. it has been filling the cinema up for every showing every day for the last 5 weeks, and many showings have often received a huge round of applause from the audiences (and that is very rare for a cinema audience to applaud at the end of a movie)if you haven't seen it, then you don't know what you're missing. get to your local cinema and enjoy the adventure pirate style.yo ho!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best adventure movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far I have seen this movie 2 times and I can't get enough of it. This movie is so great, it's so well done, Gore Verbinsky (sp?) has done an outstanding job directing this film, his skills to tell stories and to make them look amazing is shown here. The story is about a curse upon the Black Pearl and their crew, they search the way to get rid of the curse. The characters are very well developed, everybody in the cast makes does a great job portraying their characters. Especial mention to Johnny Depp, who does a great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, his accent, way to express himself and even his aspect is so real! Orlando Bloom does a good job as well, as Will Turner, and of course, the great Geoffrey Rush, one of the best actors at the moment. I just love every single one of his movies, and this one is one of his bests. He is so convincing as the evil captain of the Black Pearl Barbossa, he's one of those villains who are extremly evil, yet charming.The especial affects are unbelievable, it is great to see some pirates become skeletons and suddenly change to their human shape. ILM did an awesome job in this movie. The music is also a key thing in the movie, it's just perfect, it suits to every single scene of this movie. As a summary, I believe this is probably the best movie of the year (Adventure genre that is), this is definitely a must see for everybody, kids, old people, teenagers, everybody will enjoy this movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good old-fashioned, new-age swashbuckler picture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, now THIS is what I would call a nostalgic glimpse back into the films of Errol Flynn! From the very beginning, this movie sets itself up as the ideal old-school romantic adventure movie! I haven't seen a movie like this since the sixties, and I must say, it has been far too long! I had to sit back and just suck it all in, like a fresh breath of salty sea air, the first time I watched it. A delight! That's what it was: Simply a Delight! Alright, enough with the general singing of praise, hm? Specifically, the movie has all the elements of a movie that make it as great as a classic: Action, Character, Humor, and a Plot that's twisted into a pretzel! In the way of the action, what can I say? There's something irresistibly classic about a swordfight! And the fights were handled expertly in this movie! The stunts, too, were exhilerating to behold (Especially considering how little was done with CGIs, you know!). Moving on, the characters were all wonderfully charismatic in their own way! I think everybody's favorite would be Captain Jack Sparrow, the infamous, legendary pirate, portrayed by Johnny Depp! HE makes the movie purely enjoyable, because he is the amalgamation of the main hero and the comic relief! Also, his humor isn't so...blandly profane, as is usually the sad case this day and age. No, he uses the wonderful art of subtlety and sarcasm in all his dialogue, which makes his character all the more charismatic! The other characters include Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom. His character is an appreciable variation on the ever-winning archetype of the young romantic hero. His character is even more interesting when you see to what level his swordsmanship is developed, having trained himself in the art while his occupation requires him to forge the blades. He's the amalgamation of the naive romantic hero and the skilled weapons-master, as offbeat a fusion as Sparrow's. Next, there is the leading lady, Elizabeth Swan, Keira Knightley, whose character is, situationally, the damsel in distress. But she is by no means the damsel who awaits rescue, fighting for herself! She is the problem solver, who conquers her challenges with ingenius solutions. And finally, we have the villain: Captain Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush. His character is the delicious combination of the sinister villain, and the everyday human being! Even as evil, vile, and diabolical as he is, there is something wonderfully REAL about his performance! He has a sense of humor, a sense of vulnerability in certain areas, and even a spirit of personal charisma, despite his grotesque persona and lack of morals. These characters also have intriguing relationships between themselves that make them even more enjoyable together! Turner is in love with Swan, and both struggle with that and the difference in their classes; Jack Sparrow is a pirate and a good man, a paradox that Turner and Swan have to come to grips with; Jack Sparrow and Barbossa have a long-lived enmity; Jack Sparrow and Turner become friends (rather analogous to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker); and Swan and Barbossa have a unique relationship as they are both as high class as the other, despite their affiliations, which makes for delightfully elegant dialogue between enemies! The characters also have their individual secrets...But it would be unfair to spoil the movie for those who have yet to sample it themselves. As delightful as it would be to describe myself, this is one of those movies that, like a fine Itallian dish, must be sampled personally! Now then, the humor! Oh, the humor! Everywhere you turn, there is a small joke thrown in! This is the defining twist that saves the movie from drowning in its own seriousness. It is necessary to make the movie fun (especially considering the macabre nature of the essential story by itself). Captain Jack Sparrow offers the most abundant source of laughter, with his Groucho-esque sarcastic response to anything spoken in his general direction! Also, his very character is as much a joke as a hero! Alongside him are two pirates, and two naval soldiers, who serve as a pair of "Abbot and Costello" comic relief teams. They are the fall down men, who are there for the sole sake of being taunted and ridiculed. A funny movie needs characters like them, for after all, what good is a joke without a butt? Finally, whenever Jack and Barbossa are paired together, it is the perfect Straight-Man vs Slick-Wit routine that never disappoints! Those two have a wonderful chemistry, and you can't help but love them together! Finally, the plot! An elaborately twisted, wonderfully convoluted, and sheerly wonderful piece of writing that is! I can't describe it, to be sure. That would be spoiling it, and I have no intention of that, let me assure you. That would be a crime! Suffice it to say that all the characters are believeably arranged into a spider-web of connections that all tie them to a small piece of Aztec Gold and a pirate ship! The web spirals in twisted loops, but streams unerringly towards an exciting conclusion at the center! What makes it even more complex is that there is as much story that is revealed as history as there is on the screen in real time! It is as twisted and convoluted piece of literature as I have ever seen! I could not find anything to complain about in this movie! Everything was wonderful about it! If you haven't seen this one, I assure you, you are missing a delightful experience that will remind you why you go to the movies at all! Rarely does a movie of this high quality come around, and even more rarely does it capture one's interest for two and a half hours! But this one met and beat all my expectations of a modern movie! This was the easily the most enjoyable film I have seen in a long, long time!</fullReview>

I saw The Italian Job last week, and I didn't think a movie could be more fun, but Pirates proved me wrong. Pirates of the Carribbean was an excellent film. The acting was great, and Johnny Depp performed his best role yet, in the best way possible. I thought Geoffery Rush was also good. It has been a while since a pirate film hit the screen, I would say Hook was the last pirate film I saw, but this was one of the best films of 2003. If you want some fun, then see it!

Geoffrey Rush is amazing... quite the chameleon... enjoyed his snarly Barbosa. Orlando Bloom looks much better as a pirate than a blonde elf. Those smouldering looks he gives sweet Keira gives him some credibility in the acting stakes. His boyish earnestness is lovely to watch. Will he be a James Bond contender? Not yet perhaps...I enjoyed it a lot but that's probably not saying much because I even enjoyed the much derided Cutthroat Island. This however, is a kinder, gentler film... I just took it for what it is... an adrenalin rush.</fullReview>

His english accent is sooooo funny and his lines like, "Stop blowing holes in my ship" and " Im sorry, have i threatened you before" make the film a classic.

Whilst watching it I was reminded of everything from The Evil Dead 2 (If you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking aout) to Tenchu (a great Playstaion game for all you cretins), and from Jason and the Argonauts to Raiders of the Lost Ark. It could have (maybe should have) been directed bySam Raimi - a great director who is up there with the Coens - sod Speilberg and Lucas!!!! On top of this it had Legolas from Lord of the Rings, the bad guy from Tomorrow Never Dies, and that toff from This Life and Coupling. Oh, and the bit where they jump around in the moonlght is the best thing I've seen in a film since Gollum went schizo in The Two Towers. Cracking. Go and see this movie.</fullReview>

The action sequences are quite good, and the plot is great, as many different genres are incorporated, so there's something for everyone to enjoy. This is also very much the sort of film that both kids and adults could quite happily watch together without either being bored. (although younger children might be scared by some scenes in the film.) All in all, an excellent family film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long...but GOOD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get the only two bad comments out first: 1) This movie is just a tad too long. If you cut off about 20-25 minutes - it would have been perfect. 2) To help with the editing, cut the scenes when the humans were fighting the un-dead. After all...THEY'RE DEAD. So, there is really no point in the sword fight in the first place.However, the movie as a whole is really fun. Johnny Depp, as usual, creates a character that is very unique. I was happy to have him on screen throughout the entire movie.Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, and Geoffrey Rush all play their roles in a convincing way.The best part about this movie is that it never takes itself to seriously - and I credit Depp with most of that. As soon as you meet Jack Sparrow for the first time, you get the feeling that this will be a fun movie. And it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie In A Long Time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie. I am not a big fan of pirate movies at all, but some friends wanted to see it so I went. Best $8 I have spent on a movie in a long time. This film doesnt attempt to be a serious, straight-faced pirate movie. It is funny, lots of action, good story, and very funny. It pokes fun at itself by adding old pirate cliches in. Johnny Depp is a good pick to play an unusual, off-the-wall character. And Orlando Bloom, all though I dont think he is God's gift to actors.... like many females do, does an excellent job in "POTC". This would have to be my pick for best movie this year. And it is definately one of my all time favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahoy Mateys! Full of adventure, mystery, and a hint of romance. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl was by far one of the best movies I've seen this summer. Johnny Depp was the ever eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow; Orlando Bloom played the charming blacksmith Will Turner, and Kiera Knightly played the beautiful and determined Elizabeth Swan. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times with the wonderfully choreographed sword fights. No wonder this movie did so good! I can't wait for the sequel! I was very surprised to find out that Disney produced this movie after some unsuccessful tries at few children's movies. This movie is for all ages and a great movie to see with your family and for those guys who have something against chick flicks this is perfect for you. I didn't understand some scenes in the movie and took the time to see it once more; personally I understood it better and wouldn't mind seeing it once more. I would give it 9/10. The only problem was it wasn't longer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you like PIRATE movies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know the drill: Cursed ship, only one can break the curse, his girlfriend gets kidnapped by the undead, has to team up with a pirate to save her, blah blah blah.My two cents worth: I guess the first question on whether or not you should see this movie is; How do you feel about pirate movies? If you're not sure, try this: stand in front of the movie poster. If your reaction is anything other than, "Pirates of the Caribbean! Cool!" then nothing will salvage this movie experience for you. It doesn't matter how much you like Johnny Depp.For those of us who like pirate movies, this is a dream come true. We've got curses! Treasure! Pirates who have been out on that island too long! Funny one liners! Large complex sword fights in ridiculous places! Stuffy British naval officers! (And a plot with more holes than a latticework gazebo, but WHO CARES! It's a PIRATE MOVIE!)Recommendations: If you like this movie, I highly recommend Princess Bride (if you haven't seen it already). The original version (1950's)of Treasure Island is also good, and 20,000 leagues under the sea (it's better than you remember! I promise!) If you're a pirate movie hater (or just a movie on ship lover) any of the versions of Mutiny on the Bounty will do, also recommend the book "True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle" (it's a Newberry award winning 'kids' book, but adults will enjoy it too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is a must see for movie aficionados and for any film student who wants a very well-made, yet also very entertaining movie with artistic value based on a screenplay that is also an excellent study tool. the action scenes are well-choreographed and well-paced, all scenes move the story forward. and all the characters are three dimensional. all have flaws and things they wished they could hide. well, i'm not sure if sparrow had something he wanted to hide, but either way everything in the story telling aspect is well fleshed out.and as for the VFX, the use of CG by ILM is gladly well used. and well executed. thanks to the famous john knoll, the same man responsible for creating the fx in such classic ILM films as T2, and even the new though not so engaging star wars prequels. the acting is superb. and as for the direction? gore verbinsky is a true artist. might i say he also helmed a very impresssive horror film, it's title THE RING has become a household name amongst some of the the more recent films of it's genre. though muddled with plotholes that film is also well worth a look. PIRATES is even better. i might just watch it again in the cinema. or purhcase the DVD. 10 out of 10. and be sure not to leave teh theater 'til after you see a little surprise after the end credits. i ended up leaving the cinema mouthing jack sparrow's words. "THAT'S INTERESTING"...... anyone who leaves to soon and isn't industrious enough to sit to through the credits could be at a loss. once again, 10 out of 10. see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Getting lost in the sumptuousness of it all was easy to do watching the old masted schooners and the fierce hearties that sail them ballet across the screen. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is this summer's guilty pleasure for this old movie buff. Disney Films are still good at decorating legends and fairy tales that delight a child's imagination. Even the child that still remains in a codger brought up on Bambi and Snow White and The Alamo (Davey Crocket version), the Spanish Main etc. etc.These new theaters with stadium seating are an answered prayer for old movie lovers. (I sure do like to see old movies in them.) You can actually see the entire screen from almost every seat, and it is huge, and the sound! My god, it comes from all over the place!! And if Orlando Bloom is not quite Errol Flynn, he makes up for it in earnestness and intensity. A standout in Lord of the Rings, this young Brit has matinee idol written all over him. (Do they still call them that?)So much had been written about Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. But I was not really prepared for the campy swagger, one critic said he sashayed, and by gosh, he did!! But remember his Bon Bon in that Cuban writers story. What ghoulish androgyny and eye-liner! An Ancient Mariner cum Flying Dutchmen in Disney-color, yet. I could not stop laughing. And the special effects and warty skeleton mates. Straining every digital trick yet available. It was a ghastly crew! And the real Dutchman in this patchwork fable, Captain Barbossa, is played by Geoffrey Rush, chewing the scenery and spitting out Elgin Marbles. Also the beautiful young (18?) Keira Knightley held her own among the talent heavy males, to be saved from a boring marriage, willing for Senta-like self-sacrifice.Needless to say, I loved it.</fullReview>

I hardly ever watch movies without comedy in them. And i'll never watch a doom and gloom movie like Titanic with no funny bits. Anyway the acting is brilliant,espiccaly Johhny depp. (whose character in the film is supposed to be based on Keith Richard). All the sword fighting scenes are unbelievable.

		<fullReview>I can tell you this much: I haven't seen a movie so supremely entertaining since... well, since ever! I've seen it six times already, and am planning to see it again soon. The plot was complete (better than a themepark ride-based movie has a right to be), the sword-play was good, and the acting was just phenomenal. Although Orlando Bloom may be eye candy, I hate to admit this, but, he can't act. Keira Knightley plays the damsel-in-distress (although she does a better job of it than most other actresses would). But Johnny Depp completely steals the show! I didn't expect much when I first went to see it, but when he came on screen, I just couldn't take my eyes off him. Not only is Johnny Depp completely hot and very sexy, but he is just hilarious! When I first saw the movie, tears were coming out of my eyes because I was laughing so hard! He makes all the other characters fade away because he has such presence in every scene. Not to mention the accent. I can't believe some people have the nerve to say it was too long, because when I saw it, the time just slipped away and I couldn't believe that it was 2 hours and 23 minutes long! Kudos to the moviemakers for doing an excellent job on making the movie move along at a fast clip.The ONE bad thing about the movie is that it will be a horrible wait for the DVD. But when it comes out, I swear, I will be the first in line to buy it where I live. I give this movie a 10/10. It was simply brilliant. If you haven't seen it, RUN to the nearest theater right now and go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) is absolutely entertaining, totally charming, but annoying at the same time. You never know where he stands or whose side he is on at any given moment. A true character! Will Turner is handsome and sweet, and totally love-struck with Elizabeth. The beautiful couple seem wimpy at first, but soon prove they are tough as nails when the chips are down. Her father and fiance are perfect! Captain Barbosa rocks! Aye matey, an excellent adaptation. I love the action sequences, especially the fencing in the blacksmith's shop. The fight scene on the ship was way cool! The two strange pirate partners are hilarious! Between the one's wooden eye escapades and the two of them dressed up as women, their antics added a bit of humor to the fight scenes and made the grossness of the fact that they were absolutely filthy more bearable. Terrific cinematography and special effects - even the music and sound effects wrapped you up in the time of pirates, heroes, and adventure! I will buy the movie and the soundtrack. Everyone had a ball as we were swept away to a different land and time - what a vacation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought that the pirate genre could be made to successfully walk the gangplank again? And who who would have imagined that producer Jerry Bruckheimer - the guy behind a succession of violent action movies like "The Rock" - would be the man to do it? But here we have family entertainment at its best - non-stop action, lots of humour, effective special effects and great locations (St Vincent). What really makes the movie though is the clever casting.Johnny Depp gives a marvellously camp performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, the most charming rogue ever to stride the decks. Geoffrey Rush, as his rival to command the "Black Pearl", is even madder here than in "Shine". British viewers of the television series "The Office" will find Mackenzie Crook giving an eye-catching performance. Orlando Bloom, after his heroics in "Lord Of The Rings", gives us some more dash and bravery. While young and sweet Keira Knightley, following her freshness in "Bend It Like Beckham", obtains the big break that is likely to secure her a successful career.All this made me a very jolly Roger. </fullReview>

Orlando Bloom plays it straight (kind of) while Johnny Depp creates yet another brilliantly quirky character. The laughs come thick and fast and the action follows suit. Most of the fun is in the character of Jack Sparrow (Depp) whose facial and body expressions are unusual to say the least. This is definitely a film I would recommend to anyone, even those who normally steer clear of pirate films. This is definitely not your conventional pirate movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw the trailers of the film it looked O.K. I wasn't desperate to see it, but my best mate is in love with Orlando Bloom and so i went with her. This movie is not what i expected it to be. Yes it is a bit long and some scenes could of been cut, but the reason why i didn't go to the loo in the middle of the movie was because of Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow. He is probably my most favorite movie character since Maximus(Gladiator-Russell Crowe)appeared on our screens in 2000. Jack Sparrow is funny, drunk,(i think)and charasmatic and steals the show. I thought i would just be staring at Orlando bloom because he is so cute, but by the end of the movie i basically fell in love with Depp and his character. Orlando(Will Turner)i thought was alright, a bit soppy but i still think he is just about his good looks and not his acting ability i hate to say. Orlando's character is very one dimensional and he really only shone when he was interacting with Johnny Depp. Keira Knightley(Elizabeth Swann)played the girl of the film, not much to do, but argue, scream a bit and fall in love. Her role was quite boring and very predictable. I expexcted a bit more from Geoffrey Rush because i think he is an incredible actor, but he did pretty good especially in his sword fighting for a man his age! But Depp is the star of this movie and no-one can take that away from him. His facial expressions and actions cracked me up everytime. This is a great fun film for all ages, its got romance,comedy,action and Johnny Depp!! In the cinema for the past 2 years, we have been dominated with comic book movies, and sequels. Finally we can see something which is different and a lot of fun!! I mean what is so interesting about a man getting angry and turning green!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... this really is the best action adventure film since "Raiders of the Lost Ark".Those were my words as I walked dazzled from the cinema last night, after 143 minutes had fairly flown by. This film has it all:* Eye candy for the boys (Keira Knightley), and the girls (Bloom, Depp, and Davenport).* Smart and snappy writing - very British humour, performed by well-known British character actors (and Johnny Depp, of course).* Direction and cinematography of the highest order. Even the late Sir David Lean would be in love with some of the compositions and camera moves.* Exceptional effects work. "The Hulk" was meant to be ILM's showcase this summer - but the work here simply blows the "Hairy Shrek" away.And as I've already mentioned, it sustains interest for nearly two and a half hours. The action sequences in the final act don't drag at all, by virtue of cross cutting between a number of interlinking story strands.I can't understand why anyone would say it went on too long, because it was such a phenomenal trip.In closing.

		<fullReview>I've seen this a total of 7 times and counting. It's got to be one of the best and entertaining movies of the year.Johnny Depp's performance left me speechless and dying with laughter. Orlando Bloom did a wonderful job of an angsty Will Turner out to save Miss Swann. Keira Knightley was the perfect choice for Elizabeth. She's amazingly beautiful and talented, and held her own next to the two men. I love the fact that she fought and fended for herself instead of just being the dainty damsel in distress. Kudos to the writers for making her character strong.I highly recommend this hilarious movie. This special effects are awesome and it has the perfect mix of romance, humor, and action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible effects, and the way Johnny Depp played Captian Jack Sparrow was so awesome. Orlando Bloom has made me a fan of him in this movie. I didnt think of him as too great as Legolas but his Will Turner attempt was pretty solid. Along w/ the awesome Theme Song which blows so many other ones out of the water, this movie was just simply great. I loved it. I've seen it twice, and I'm planning on going again soon. Definitely one of those movies the second dish is worth the $7. The story was soo cool, and I hope they make a sequal. It's made over $230 million so far. Overall: Good Job Disney, A great movie! Already one of my all-time faves</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this last week with a best friend, and I loved it! I knew this would be good, but it was awesome, a movie that will blow you away. I cannot think of words to match my enthusiasm for this film. It is about a ship of pirates that captures a young woman thinking she is the ancestor of a fellow pirate whose blood can break the Curse of the Black Pearl. But she isn't and the real person embarks on a journey with the slippery Captain Jack Sparrow to rescue her. This movie is Disney's first PG-13 film, which I don't think it deserves, if they had a PG-10, I think that would have worked. Anyway, see this wonderful movie.Rated PG-13 for Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is by far one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a very long time. After the betrayal of Matrix Reloaded I was not prepared to enjoy this film quite as much as I actually did. Perhaps because it was not what I expected.It is not actually a comedy and despite the subject matter it ironically avoids descending into absurdity (unlike the last 3 James Bond films) to get big laughs. It does however have some golden moments, the dialogue is sharp, the story is coherent and believable.What is it then? It is a hard core action adventure and the strangest thing about it is how believable it actually is. I think this is because it offers something more than just great special effects and swash buckling sword fights (both of which give Gladiator and Lord of the Rings a run for their money).The characters have very human and real motivations: love, greed, honour, the desire to be free. All those visceral and primitive emotions that every human heart has experienced at some time lend that essential 3rd dimension to an otherwise conventional tale of high seas adventure, cursed treasure, and, of course, Pirates. There aren't any real surprises but at least you know what is going on.Johnny Depp is just magical as Captain Jack Sparrow but his camp Keith Richards swagger has excellent competition in Geoffrey Rush's villainous Barbosa. Again there was the potential for things to end up being cartoonish but the performances created authentic and interesting characters. Orlando Bloom's love lorn William Turner is just lovely on so many levels. Most of the fun comes from seeing how difficult it actually is to buckle a swash. What ever that is.It makes a change for the Characters and Writing to make the film instead of the effects.It is difficult to find something bad to say to about the film but since no film can be perfect I would have to say the least believable thing was the 'love interest'. But it is perhaps the habit that Hollywood has of putting 21st century females into period films that made her a bit too butch for a well born lady of the time. The fact that she could actually swim is even suspicious.Maybe it was just the air conditioned comfort that made it so good (it was 100 degrees outside at the time) but I am going to give Pirates of the Caribbean *3 pairs of pants.1. it was almost 3 hours long. In spite of its Piratey goodness no film has any excuse to last 160 minutes.2. I did not go to this film to see anything involving a woman. One could have easily done with out the wench in my opinion. The story would have been a bit different but no less interesting and probably much shorter.3. they didn't have my favourite candies at the pick and mix.4. the last 10 minutes or so did get a bit silly. I wont tell you what that is all about but I am sure you will agree a better ending could have been provided.5. For some reason it is affiliated with Disney.Ok I know that is five pairs of pants and I only gave it three but it was about PIRATES and let's face it, that Orlando Bloom is one exemplary piece of buccaneer booty. Huzzah!*please note that the clareangelus Pants scale is all about how bad a film ISN'T. The fewer Pants you get the better it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was without a doubt entertaining. The film held it's own and was not carried by special effects or actors. However, Johnny Depp's performance as the slightly camp constantly drunk Captain Jack Sparrow is without a doubt one of his best. Bloom proves he's not just a pretty-faced, pointy-eared elf, and gives his character a believable depth but was sadly out-shone by Depp.The film's length is just right, I wasn't sitting there wanting it to end, and it didn't cut it's self short. As good as this film was I don't think it wise to do a sequel, the ending it has is good, and trying to get another film out of it would spoil the originality of this one.This is the first pirate film to be brought into the 21st Century and will be a hard one to top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got Me Out of The Couch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I didn't have high hopes for Pirates of the Caribbean. Orlando Bloom speaks in a flat monotone voice, I had no idea of who Keira Knightly was, and I hadn't heard a peep out of Johnny Depp or Geoffrey Rush for ages. Besides, wasn't I too old for Disney movies anyway? After the poor special effects job I saw on Ang Lee's `The Hulk', I was wondering how the people at Disney could pull off pirate skeletons. What I expected and what I got were two very different things. Cursed undead pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Rush) kidnap the aristocratic Elizabeth Swann (Knightly) in hopes of removing the curse that turns them into walking skeletons by full moonlight. Her long-time admirer Will Turner (Bloom) sets out to rescue her with the help of wanted pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). It's a conventional plot with conventional characters, and if I said any more, I'd ruin the whole story. Everybody played his or her roles very stereotypically. The person who single-handedly saved the show was Depp. Of course it looks like he's getting electric shocks to his face, and with all that makeup he might be an exotic dancer in the off-season, but Depp really got involved with his character, and it shows. He's always there to provide some hilarity to an otherwise dry movie. His dueling scenes with Bloom and Rush are easily among the best fighting sequences in the movie. (The rest of the fight scenes were pretty bad) Depp even had a handful of his teeth replaced by gold ones just to look the part. He had to take some out, or risk overacting. Although he'd reportedly like to be in a movie that doesn't involve swords, Bloom is certainly good with them. It's a long jump from a blonde archer elf to a swashbuckling blacksmith-turned-pirate, but he excels at it. All the sword handling he used as Legolas certainly hasn't gone to waste. However, the big fluffy hat with a feather in it that he used wore in the last few scenes looked terrible on him. Disney took a big risk on this movie. This is the first movie made by Disney to get a rating higher than PG. By getting a PG-13 rating, they risked alienating the moviegoers who thought that this movie would be more kid-friendly. The title was even changed from `Pirates of the Caribbean' to `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' in hopes that there could be a sequel. This is also the first live-action movie made by Disney in a long time. It's obvious that Disney poured a lot of money into this project, and Disney and viewers certainly got what they paid for. But this movie does have its downsides. Bloom and Knightly couldn't make a less convincing couple if they had been in separate movies. The movie did stretch on just a little bit too long, and it's hard to create life-and-death situations with pirates who just can't die. Too much of the pirates' conduct is governed by a set of rules, which are more like guidelines anyway, as is pointed out several times in the movie. Captain Sparrow spends too much time in jail, and past events are hinted at too much. Despite the length of the movie and all the rest of its shortcomings, Pirates of the Caribbean has revived a genre I thought was long dead and buried. A genre I thought belonged only to yesteryear. That's all I have to say about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what Hollywood Blockbusters are all about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS INCLUDEDThis film is brilliant! I'm an enourmous fan of films which encouraged you to think and consider parts of life. In the end of it all however, nobody can complain about this typical no brainer hollywood blockbuster. This is a brilliant film with a marvellous script, a stunning turn by Johnny Depp &amp; amazing graphics (keep an eye out for the final fight scene).Every actor in this film gives the film their all &amp; even the slightly infuriating character played by Orlando Bloom comes out trumps in the whole scheme of things. Truth be told though, my favourite character in this entire film is the character played by Mackenzie Crook (Gareth in "The Office"). Crook's evil pirate is excellent, casted perfectly &amp; at times hilarious. It is unfair however to claim he is the only one to provide humour. Every single person in this film provides excellent comedy.As well as excellent acting &amp; special effects in this film, there are many other possitive things. The music is as you'd expect by now, beautiful, the way the film flows is worthy of mention as is the strange feeling at times that you are actually watching a film which was filmed at Disney Land, and for once when watching this film, it finally feels like Hollywood has learnt it's lessons and returned partly to the types of film for which people like Errol Flynn were renowned.Pirates Of The Carribean is a stunning film which I recommend everyone watches. Watch once at the cinema (twice if you feel like it, but personally the only flaw with this film is the daft certificate and it's strange appeal to noisey little brats), and then over and over again at home with a beer or two. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was the best movie of the year. I had to watch this one twice because `I just couldn't resist'. There were so many wonderfully sequenced sword fights and The Black Pearl, a pirate ship, was a terror. Also some other notable ships made the movie interesting, the pride of the royal navy, The Interceptor and The Commodore were beautifully detailed and adorned with the Union Jack. The movie had everything from red coats, blue coats, pirates, ghosts, treasure and was filled with adventure and romance. Johnny Depp delivers a highly entertaining performance as the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom really shines as lowly blacksmith Will Turner and Kiera Knightly dazzles as the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swan. All around brilliant cast especially the combination of Depp and Bloom. Can't wait to see the next installment!</fullReview>

His role of Jack Sparrow is entertaining alone, but he adds a spark of real Johnny Deppness to the character. It's good seeing Orlando Bloom in a movie where he has a larger role. He proves he can handle different types of roles really well (and I must say I think he really improved since Fellowship of the Ring). Keira Knightley shines again after seeing her in Hole and the Princess of Thieves, she's really matured acting wise and made a drastic change for the better. The plot was really cute, and they didn't sugarcoat this film like they do most other Disney movies. I'm really impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp's performance is a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of POTC has been outlined in some of the other comments so I won't rehash that. The film itself does have some major flaws, firstly it is about thirty minutes too long and could easily have stood a little trimming. Second, Jack Davenport's performance is abysmal for what is a small but pivotal role. Geoffrey Rush does ok as do Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom but they all blown off the screen by the mighty Johnny Depp. Basing his performance on early 70s Keith Richards Depp struts around the screen and makes the film his own, he is helped by the fact that he gets most of the film's best lines but nevertheless it is difficult to imagine anyone but Depp pulling this off. It is his most demented, brilliant performance since Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas and one of the best of his career.This film could easily have failed. It is a summer blockbuster based on an amusement park ride and as such normally the kind of film I wouldn't even bother to see, but, it has such a great sense of mindless fun that it proves enchanting. See it, if only for Depp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that they were making a movie based on a ride I thought, "why the hell would anyone even try?". Then when I heard Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp would be in it I was intriuged. These are two pretty impressive actors. I decided to give it a chance and I saw it.Well to be short and sweet this movie was AMAZING!!! I was so surprised, I absolutly loved it. Johnny Depp was fantastic and that's all there is to it. Without him I doubt the movie would have been that great. I can't emphasize enough how great this movie was. The script wasn't so corny that it was unbelievable and characters, such as Jack Sparrow (Depp), made up for any weak spot there might be. It wasn't anything deep but it wasn't meant to be. This is pure entertainment at its very best. This is what blockbuster movies should always be like. I want less Freaky Friday rip-off movies and more Johnny Depp!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of comments on this film ... suffice to say, I liked it. Why? It was fun. It was a costume/pirate/lighthearted/adventure/love/horror movie all wrapped in one. Doing a Keith Richards impression (much better than the switched mom in "Freaky Friday"!) Johnny Depp makes the movie. As his nemesis, Geoffrey Rush chews the scenery pretty well too ... the good guys are somewhat vanilla, but as a fan of the show "Coupling," the British admiral was a fun choice. All the film needed was one good naval battle, and it would have been near perfect light summer fare.</fullReview>

As a piece of entertainment and escapism its probably the best of the the summer blockbusters. You get what you would expect, a fun swashbuckling movie, why expect more?? Johnny Depp is very watchable if slightly hammy but it suits the film perfectly. Its strange seeing him in such a commercial type of film but it is well executed and written. The supporting cast of pirates are well played and funny. Kiera Knightley makes a very attractive laeding lady. Faults: Overlong, a lot could have been cut without making to much to the difference to the film. Orlando Bloom is a bit bland as a hero but i guess whan you are up against depp as his keith richards/david bowie slightly camp best its hard to compete!

		<fullReview>Okay, when I first saw the poster and saw the names of Gore "I turned Ringu in to a movie with lots of loud noises because Americans can not be scared by anything remotely psychological" Verbinski and Jerry "Kangaroo Jack and lots of movies with big explosions" Bruckheimer on the credits, I was sceptical (a variant spelling of skeptical, not related to a septic tank) but as it turns out the movie is pretty good. It is a fun summer popcorn movie and despite some large plot holes, turns out to be one of the better films of the summer (well of the "popcorn" movies).Orlando Bloom is Legolas without pointy ears and with a sword instead of a bow (but the girls dig him so I will not go in to copious detail about his mediocre acting, he fills the part). Keira Knightley is just hot (she would be drop dead gorgeous even without the accent but is on the top of my list with Fleur Saville and Antonia Prebble because of it) and legal (but just barely). Geoffrey Rush is lost in the character, one of the signs of a really good actor, though I have to say that he did not really add anything special that no other actor could have, a shame for such a talented guy. The rest of the cast are also excellent and the dialogue is good and tolerable even at the worst of times.The special effects in the film are excellent, I only wish that all films loaded with special effects would be this good. Special Effects are there to ENHANCE the plot and the acting, not to take the place of it.I am going to finish this review by raving about Johnny Depp because he really was the reason the film was so good. I literally do not think the film would have been half as good with anyone else in the role (well maybe Daniel Day-Lewis). He creates a unique and engaging character and endears himself to you, a hard task for the disowned gay son of Captain Morgan. Johnny Depp has proven once again why he is among the elite inner circle of great actors (well mine anyway, along with Ed Norton, Kenneth Branagh, Don Cheadle, Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Forrest Whitaker, Brian Cox, Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and probably a few I am forgetting unfortunately, my apologies to them).It works best on the big screen, so go to the second run theatre and see it for two bucks for Johnny Depp if nothing else.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp can really captivate the audience, he definitely got me hooked onto the storyline. He's so hilarious in the movie, he's a great actor. You gotta give props on Orlando's part also.

However, Pirates of the Caribbean is fun because it has all the elements working that a good blockbuster movie should have: engaging characters, entertaining dialogue, exciting plot, and good direction.The standout performances are by Johnny Depp, who plays a pirate by adopting Keith Richards's speaking style and mannerisms, and by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook who play pirates with a combination of swagger and comedy.There are some illogical things going on in the movie but it's easy to ignore them when the movie is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp owns this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge Johnnie Depp fan. As far back as _Edward Scissorhands_ and _Crybaby_ he was making risky career choices and carrying them off with his incredible talent. However, although I knew I would be going to see _Pirates of the Caribbean_ the day it opened, I had my doubts. After all, this is a movie based on a ride. Not based on a book, not even based on a true story, based on a theme park ride! And talented though he is, Depp has made some less than wonderful movies (_The Astronaut's Wife_ springs to mind). But I went anyway, because it has Johnnie Depp, not to mention Legolas and the Marquis de Sade. And the movie was wonderful. But it clearly would not have been so without Johnnie Depp. The other actors were fine, particularly Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom. The script was sufficiently quirky that the film probably would have been fairly entertaining despite the overlong and repetitive battle scenes and the overdone jokes between the two sailors (not to mention the overdoner jokes between the two pirates). The special effects were good, the photography beautiful and the music excellent, but it nevertheless doesn't add up to anything more than a pretty good summer flick. Until you add Johnny Depp. His Crazed Queen of the Spanish Main is simply brilliant, and it turns POTC into the best flick of the summer and one of the best of the year. I hear they are already filming a sequel; I have my doubts about that too, having seen XMen 2, Matrix 2, Terminator 3... But then, none of those films had Johnnie Depp.</fullReview>

When you watch the deceased pirates who died during the civil war. They become ghostlike skeletons and they will haunt the villages of england, while they attack.

		<fullReview>Now, I'll admit I loved PIRATES, but it is not without faults, the greatest being, IT'S TOO LONG! Will SOMEBODY tell Jerry Bruckheimer that a feature film doesn't HAVE to be over two hours and fifteen minutes long? A half hour trimmed would have tightened the plot, kept the audience jumping at the climaxes (and not for the bathroom), and increased the revenue, as another showtime could be squeezed in each day.That being said, there is a lot to like about the film. A truly good pirate movie MUST obey certain guidelines: a swashbuckling hero, an equally strong damsel, a truly dastardly villain, a great climactic duel, a romance, at least one major sea battle and city plundering scene, LOTS of pirate lore, and respect for the time frame of the film (NO lapses into 20th or 21st century jargon or technology, for the sake of plot or humor). Hollywood's last major pirate effort, CUTTHROAT ISLAND, had Gena Davis as a distaff hero, which was acceptable (Maureen O'Hara had played a swashbuckler in several 40s-50s films), and Frank Langella as the villain, which was inspired casting...but Matthew Modine was so wimpish a leading man that the romance between him and Davis looked ridiculous, and Davis evolved into a near caricature, to fill the void...and the film descended into present-day campiness, which was the kiss of death.Director Gore Verbinski, and writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert clearly did their homework for PIRATES, and admirably filled each pirate movie requirement. Two heroes swash their way through the film; Johnny Depp is the picturebook pirate, complete with outrageous attire, a braided beard, eye makeup, a drunken swagger, and the best damn' Keith Richards impersonation I've ever seen; Orlando Bloom is the heroic, Errol Flynn-like buccaneer, out to rescue his damsel, and full of lofty ideals. Eighteen-year-old Keira Knightley is the heroine, and while her acting skills are average, at best, she shows a lot of spunk (and cleavage), and positively glows, onscreen. The villain is another inspired piece of casting; Geoffrey Rush, while not as menacing as Frank Langella, has a ball as the snarling yet world-weary Pirate leader. As for the pirate crews (there are two), they are perfect; you have guys with hooks and peg legs, barbarians straight out of MOBY DICK, even a parrot and a monkey as sidekicks, all hankering for rum, riches, and victims to 'walk the plank'. That one crew is all cursed, and reveal themselves to be skeletal, decomposing corpses under the full moon only increases their nasty perfection!The film borrows heavily from THE CRIMSON PIRATE, TREASURE ISLAND, SWASHBUCKLER, Universal Pictures' 40s B-movie pirate flicks, and even a few Hammer horror features of the early 60s, but it all fits together fairly seamlessly. Still, the excessive length would be a fatal flaw, were it not for Johnny Depp's physical and verbal presense. He is the glue that holds everything together, and he is VERY much up to the task! Whenever the film starts to drag, Depp has some bit of 'business' that is hilarious, and keeps things rolling.I won't delve into the plot (cursed gold, kidnappings, a gallows scene...pretty standard pirate stuff), but I will say that you could do a LOT worse than PIRATES in this season of overblown sequels and underwhelming originals.Go to the bathroom before you go to the theater, and ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie once, and I'll not rest until I've seen it again. To make myself more frank, my sister has (rather unwillingly) seen this movie four times in one week, and I'm jealous. I loved Pirates of the Caribbean the Ride at Disneyland/world as a kid, and when I heard about this movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Opening night my whole family went, and we were absolutely enthralled.The opening scene with Johnny Depp is absolutely hilarious, and he makes a wonderful pirate, as, "That's *Captain* Jack Sparrow". He should play a pirate more often. He is a brilliant mixture of funny, strange, and exotic all in one, and keeps on dazzling throughout the entire film. Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa makes an awesome villain, eccentric and quirky enough not to be scary, but when he and his crew turn into a bunch of skeletons, it still was chilling. Orlando Bloom is an adorable Will Turner, showing a funny side but easily acting as a rival to Depp for attention on screen (though the award would go to Depp, he was beyond amazing). I was also very impressed with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann - she was a tough heroine, didn't act like a girly screamer, and was funny as well.The plot is good, the acting great in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Though rated PG-13 (one of the firsts for Disney), I would definitely call it a great family film for the older kids. I wouldn't be surprised if they made further adventures of the Pirates, and the best part is that it wouldn't be a sequel, just the continuing adventure.Go see Pirates of the Caribbean (again) Today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie...Depp annoying *** SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ******I thought the movie was good. I like the connections to the ride especially the scene where the pirates are trying to entice the dog to give them the key in the jail cell.The effects were great. And I thought the story was great too. I like the idea of the damned crew sailing on the dammned ship until eternity. The crew turning to skeletons was a nice touch.Now, as for Johnny Depp. I like Depp a lot as an actor. I think he is a tremendous actor. His acting in Blow was one of the best I have seen. However, I do not like how he acted in this film. I do not like the way Keith Richards talks and acts ( the mumbling doped up dazed rock star ) so why would I want to see that in a movie. And why would I want to see that in a brillant actor like Johnny Depp. Depp patterning his character after Richards was annoying. If he wanted to make the pirate a rock star he could have picked someone other than Richards. Depp's doped-up, slurring, gay blade routine detracted from the movie.I hope there is a sequel but before it happens I hope someone "sobers" Depp up and tells him to play it like Depp and not Keith Richards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been awhile since I have viewed a movie as good as this. For me, I have viewed this movie five times already. This is probably one of Johnny Depp's greatest movie since "Edward Sissor Hands" or "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?". The character he plays (Captain Jack Sparrow) steals the movie with his comedic scenes. Orlando Bloom, who is becoming quite popular in Hollywood (with movies such as "Lord of the Rings" and "Black Hawk Down") also shines in this movie as a young blacksmith who is in love with the daughter of the governor, which is Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth Swann is played by the beautiful Keira Knightley. I believe that this movie is suitable for all ages even for it's rating (PG-13). Be sure, if you do go to the movie, stay in your seats after the credits roll. I give this movie an A+!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, pro performance from Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some pirate movies can be swashbuckling poor so it is a joy to see such a stunner blast it's way on to the big screen. The visual effects are extremely clever specially with the fighting scenes in different lighting at the end. The cast was superb, especially Jack Davenport who started his career in the BBC "This Life" series. The storyline is not the strongest around but it doesn't matter with this film as your swept up with the fighting scenes and the performance of Johnny Depp. You may have notice that Mr Depp isn't on the big screen much and this is due to him carefully selecting the right movie to star in and he is, most of the time, never wrong with his selection. On this occasion his accent and slightly camp/drunkenness style Jack Sparrow character was down to a tee. Orlando Bloom's acting was not the best par from his Lord Of The Rings "legolas" performance. All in all a joy to watch and when it's on general release in the UK from next Friday I would expect it to be a the top of the box office for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admitt, all though I thought the movie might be fun to see, the main reason my friends and I went to see it was for Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. (Is there anything better than watching those 2 sword fight in tights and flimsy shirts? Not unless they're doing it at your door step) but if you're a Johnny or Orlando fan, that alone is a good enough reason to go see this movie. They are both amazing actors and every close up of Orlando (where you get a good look at his eyes) will have you collapsed in your seat. But I was thoroughly surprised at how good the movie was and how much I loved it! Captain Jack Sparrow is a character who can keep you laughing without trying. Captain Barbossa and his crew will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what they are going to do next. Will Turner is very nieve but quick witted and a spirited sort of lad. Elizabeth Swann is just the movies damsel in distress will no real importance because of the way her character is written, but her determination to save Will and Jack is admirable. But this movie is a love-hate kind of thing: either you love it or you hate it. Either way, how will you know unless you go see it? So do just that and scurry on out to a theater near you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was good, as most pirate movies are. And who doesn't like Johnny Depp- what a character actor. (My fiance is convinced every girl has a secret crush on him.) There were some expected Disney undertones: we had the young, boyish protagonist trying to prove himself as a man, the cross-dressing references, and the "Disney Signature Non-Violence" Creed (Not too much blood- just a slice here and there). Here's another interesting thing I've noticed about 90% of all Disney movies: The Female Protagonists have ONLY a father figure. Think back on even the animated ones and you'll see what I'm talking about. All in all, it was highly entertaining and well directed. Be cautious though, if you bring children who are skittish about ghosts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie based off a Disneyland ride, this is a very pleasant surprise indeed. This movie manages to stay kid-friendly without /feeling/ kid-friendly - always a good thing. I know I hate to be patronized. "Pirates" also makes us appreciate pirates again, when it could have so easily failed; when was the last time there was a good pirate movie? I can't even remember, but it doesn't matter because this one is, amazingly, good. Orlando Bloom is de-elfed here, bland but passable as the romantic lead, and Keira Knightley continues to show her solidity as an actress, whether it be here or in the wonderful "Bend It Like Beckham." Geoffrey Rush makes us, if not sympathize with, at least understand where his villain is coming from, lending his subtle touch with emotion to counter every "yarr" and "matey."But, of course, the real star here is Johnny Depp. Let's use a few cliches: Wildly charismatic, explosively talented - any others? Thousands, thousands, because Johnny Depp is surprising us once again with his choices as an actor and his considerable depth of emotion and range. Jack Sparrow is a fascinating character wholly because of Depp's willingness to seize the character and make it totally his own. Wearing inexplicable but attractive eyeliner, swaying and gesticulating drunkenly, Depp says each line with an originality that brings the script above and beyond where we could have reasonably expected it. Mildly amusing jokes are hilarious in his hands; an essential undercurrent of emotion and reality crackles in between his gold teeth and his swashbuckler's boots. He makes this movie. He drags it forward with the force of a hurricane. And that is, for the most part, why this pleasant high-seas adventure is worth the eight bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates Of the Caribbean is one of the best movies I've ever seen. There is a saying in Hollywood that goes out to Adult actors,"Be careful of scenes that include children and animals, because they'll always steal the attention away from you." Well, now add Captain Jack Sparrow,(or Johnny Depp)to that saying. This movie would not have been so wonderful if anyone else had been Jack. Mr. Depp is a truly talented actor, and it shows with evertything he does. From the lines to the simple body language, he made it all his own, and you could tell that this was a fun movie to make by watching the effort in every scene. I hope the sequel is as wonderful.SPOILERS------ To clear up a misunderstanding: Jack IS NOT cursed through the entire movie. Thyat's why he eats and drinks through out the film. Jack was abandoned before the pirates were cursed. If you notice, he's in the moonlight several times in the film, and he doesn't change. That's because he's not cursed. He steals the coin at the end because he knows he's going to fight Barbossa, and didn't want to die. If you notice, when he tosses Will the coin, he slits his hand so HIS BLOOD IS ALSO ON THE COIN. That's what the curse needed, blood from everyone who stole a coin. And even if he hadn't taken the coin, he still would have been cursed, because he doesn't repay the blood.----------------- The movie is quite long, but worth while and certainly entertaining. 10/10 and two thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahoy Maties! Grab your swords and board the dreaded pirate ship, the Black Pearl, and sail back in time to when you were a kid at Disneyland, going through the boat ride, `Pirates of the Caribbean.' Whatever your imagination could have conjured up, it couldn't possibly compare to the wonderment, fun and childhood excitement that the live-action film delivers today. This is, in many ways, the perfect film, because it not only does exactly what it intends, but it does so without a hint of corniness, overdone computer graphics, sappy dialog, or boring plot line.Sure, the movie is just for fun, and you can enjoy it for what it is if you go into the theater with the same sense of fun that you'd have going into the ride at Disney parks. In fact, just about every scene from the robotic namesake ride (that's over 30 years old) is featured conspicuously in the film, causing giggles of nostalgia from the audience.The plot is classic fairy tale formula for a Swashbucklin' Pirate story that involves pirates, fair maidens, a hero to save her, royalty, and an intricate intertwining of relationships that make things oh so juicy. Here, Johnny Depp leads the pack as Jack Sparrow, a lone pirate on the Caribbean Sea, looking for his lost ship, the Black Pearl. It'd been commandeered years earlier by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who'd lead a mutiny against him. For Sparrow to get his ship back, he must commandeer one of his own, so he picks one from the Royal British Navy. But first, he must cross swords with a young sword maker, Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom.In the meantime, Barbossa has his own agenda: to break a curse set upon the crew after they stole ancient Aztec gold artifacts. To do this, they must return the gold, plus spill the blood from a descendant of the original captain of the Black Pearl that pirated the loot in the first place. Through misidentification, they capture Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley, who is subsequently kidnapped. In this scene, Geoffrey Rush delivers a brilliant monologue about his plight as a cursed pirate.At this point, Turner and Sparrow set out as partners to find the Black Pearl: Turner wants to save the girl, and Sparrow wants to get his ship back. Over the course of the film, as secrets are revealed and events unfold, the tension and action builds to a rewarding and pleasingly climactic ending.Essentially, the movie has it all: cartoony sword-fighting, skeletons drinking rum, dream-like scenery that captures the spirit of the dark, imaginary world of pirates swinging between ships, ladies having to walk the plank, and valiant heroes saving them. With the youthful target audience in mind, a more cynical viewer looking for a more intense or less `comedic' tone might be disappointed; similarly, an overly protective parent might be concerned for their youngsters' fear factor at some special effects, but these are all phantom concerns. `Pirates of the Caribbean' as a great mid-summer hit that's sure to please the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert I've seen mixed reviews on the movie. Some are quick to say that it has no real direction, but i noticed some intricacies and subtleties that, although not really bringing the plot together any more (which can hardly be done at all),give the movie a subtle sort of repitition, but not in a boring way. I'm about ready to give some examples of things to look for when you go back and see it, rent it, purchase it, whatever; so if you wish for the movie's contents to be revealed only upon your viewing it, read this no more because i'm giving insight into the movie. When dealing with the captain Barbossa, it seemed that apples were focused on quite a bit. I took it as the apple was sort of a symbol of what he had to get back by breaking the curse. it was the symbol of what he could enjoy being human again. So when Jack Sparrow proposes his idea into barbossa's telescope, he's eating the nice shiny apple. It seemed to be Jack's clever way of rubbing it in and reminding him of why he's there, while also saying, "look what i can do that you can't." And also when barbossa is killed, the apple is there. As he dies, it rolls out of his pocket or something and shows the sort of irony about not being able to enjoy life after the curse because his death soon followed.</fullReview>

In this film, Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner, who likes Elizabeth Swan, a girl who saved his life when he was younger. When she gets kidnapped by Jacks nemisis(Geoffrey Rush), Will and Captain Black Sparrow(Johnny Depp) team up to find the Black Pearl(that's the ship elizabeth was taken to). This very unpredictable and action packed. The fighting scenes are incredible. Johnney Depp is hilarious as half good half bad. This is good casting, also. A Must see to everyone(except little kids because they would be scared). I'm excited about the second one coming out in a few years. I hope its as enjoyable as this one is!

		<shortDescription>Bad trailer...But GOOD Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember once I had this uncanny knack for predicting the merit of a film by its trailer. A few years ago, I was proved wrong with Legally Blonde, a delightful nugget. Pirates of the Carribean, I'm sad to say, deeply misleads in the preview. For one, the trailer showcases, by far, the least funny line in a film full of extremely funny lines. The upper-class British girl smacks a Pirate saying, "You like pain? Try wearing a corset." I'm thinking, "They put that in the preview to whet your appetite? Just imagine how much worse it gets." I knew this movie would do well financially, considering the producer and the cast and the appeal of seeing Pirates swashbuckle once again, I mean, Jerry Bruckheimer couldn't lose money if he lost a leg and was in a butt-kicking contest. So I also knew people would see this movie, a lot of people. But that trailer nagged at me all the way in to the screening, thinking about how many not-funny one-liners we'd endure in the course of seeing all these stereotypes go against type.And then Johnny Depp comes on screen. He is proudly standing in the crow's nest of his mighty ship, and the film is immediately off to the right start in the very next shot. I don't want to ruin it, and maybe the guys making the trailer didn't want to either. There's something to be said for not laying your cards on the table early, like so many movies do in their marketing campaign. It only took one cut to melt down the icy walls I had erected in my critical mind, and I was immediately sold. This movie is by far the best example of comedy, action, and good genre film-making of the summer. I say genre film-making because it is very in line with the classic Pirate archetypes. Except, of course, for Johnny Depp. His performance, sans the brilliant script he's given, would seem anachronistic, out of the realm of possibility for this era and tone of film-making. He'd seem too hip, too funny, too above it all while wallowing in the filth. However, Depp serves as both the audience's ambassador to the story, and the story's greatest asset. In one of the funniest lines in the movie, Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and the first mate are discussing how Depp was betrayed and then stranded to die on a deserted island. When Will asks how he escaped, the first mate says he tethered rope around sea turtles and made a raft. Predictably, Will asks where he got the rope, and then in a fearsome low-angle, Depp bellows, "With human hair...from my back." We cut away immediately to the next scene, and the rest of the film plays much the same. When a movie has four or five truly funny lines or moments, it will milk those for all their worth. Literally, they'll make a running gag. But "Pirates" runs out of room for the old jokes with all the new jokes, making this film nearly a laugh-a-minute action comedy. I say nearly only because of the brilliant action sequences, that are still light on their toes, but exciting too. There are a few running jokes, the biggest being that Pirates are really despicable people, and when we think they'll outgrow their greed and become true heroes, they wallow reluctantly in their cowardice. In one great scene, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth leads the charge to take Depp's loyal crew to rescue their beloved captain. They aren't following. She beckons with the reason that Depp would come back for them. In the next cut, she's rowing alone. "Bloody Pirates!" Depp, therefore, is the greatest pirate anyone's ever seen. He plays every angle, but chooses the heroic when there's nothing better to do. But everyone in the film has their moment of true heroism. They don't do things that seem like the old-hat mode of turning unlikely heroes into heroes. All the cowards in "Pirates" remain cowards, some endearing and some villainous, and all the heroes are truly heroic, even when they have their priorities out of whack. That's why you'll grow to like everybody, because they're all really good at what they do.I will go see the sequel, and I may be disappointed, but at least I won't be disappointed until the movie's over, because the trailer will mislead the uninitiated into thinking it's another Bruckheimer explosion music video, and it is anything but.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Starring Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is a must see movie this summer, and is easily the best Pirate film ever made. Despite its PG-13 rating (mostly for violence), this movie is entertaining and fun for people of all ages. Johnny Depp is tremendous in his role as Captain Jack Sparrow, and depicts this pirate character in a way that no other actor could have. He is truly remarkable. Orlando Bloom lacks the charm that Depp carries, yet he too plays his role well as Wil Turner. Keira Knightley from Bend it like Beckham also stars along with Geoffrey Rush.While the movie is long, 146 minutes, it moves along at a good pace. The audience seemed to get a bit restless only after the movie had climaxed and continued on for another 20 minutes. While I believe the movie could have been shorter, Depp kept my attention to the very end.While many movies this summer such as Bad Boys II, Hulk, and Terminator III advertise with action and violence, this movie has action, with humor and good fun on the side. The cast has already signed on for a sequel. I really liked this movie. If your looking for pure entertainment, with no thinking or worrying, go see "Pirates". It is a painless, sit back and relax movie. ****/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice, I love it! It's reminisent of movies that used to be made that almost all the family could see. I thought all the actors did a good job, but Johnny Depp was outstanding. I've never seen one of his movies before, but he has a gift for comedy. It was a little too long and small children would be freightened by some of the violence and characters when the moonlight hits them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was better than I thought it would be. When I first saw previews I thought "Great, a whacky Disney movie"Johnney Dep made this a great movie. While he was a main character, he also wasn't "in your face" His humour was in the background, and made this movie highly entertaining. He really worked a great character.The only thing I found disspointing was the ending. I won't share details for those who haven't seen it, but I feel it could have been much better had a different conclusion come of Johnny Dep getting away from the noose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003)Again, Gore Verbinski strikes gold as he did in 2002's "The Ring"! Pirates Of The Caribbean was a definite action movie nonetheless. It's great for young kids who's heros are pirates, and is as well a great movie for adults to enjoy too. Johnny Depp does a wonderful performance as Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush does also an excellent performance as always. There is lots of sword clashing, cursed skeleton pirates (including a monkey), stolen gems, and what more could you want! Pirates of The Caribbean has struck gold! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movie of the summer so far....... I gotta love the fact that Johnny Depp was cast as Jack Sparrow in this movie.. He did amazing job, he was ultra hip and ultra cool.. I liked Orlando Bloom in this movie, and I agree that this is a large movie to be carrying on his shoulders and he pulls it off amazingly. I also love Keira Knightley in this film, she is hot =). As you all know, I was expecting to have fun just like the ride and I did.. I think that this was a quirky job from Gore Verbinski, but he pulls it off beautifully and with a wink too.. A definite must-see (in the movie theatres) and must-own (when DVD comes out)....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just my view on Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Movie Rocked. I loved it. Saw it three times so far. Though there were some problems I had. Jack Sparrow seems a little, for lack of a better word, Gay. No wait Lets use the word Flambouyant. It really freaked me out. But it made it cool. Will Turner sounded very much like Legolas from the Lord of the Rings. Not in sound of voice cause I know Orlando Bloom did both Characters. But in the way he spoke. They seem very much alike. Keira Knightley. One Word. HOT. This is the first Movie I've seen her in and I want to see more. Gregory Rush was brilliant. Everytime I see the scene where Barbossa Dies and drops the apple I feel more and more sorry for him. Its weird really. I loved the Special Effects. Just watching the effects that changes the crew into the undead in the moonlight was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the kind of disney movie that made disney a household name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will mainly be echoing what the others have said, but I wanted to be sure and say it too, to add my vote.This movie excels at ENTERTAINING.Without sex, gore, potty jokes, or a single cuss word*, it is romantic, exciting, humorous, and witty. (Kind of in the tradition of Princess Bride, in the sense of it being a true FAMILY movie, only POTC is about 200% more exciting and adventurous, and a bit less cheesy).The movie is 2.5 hours long, but there is not a single point at which I (or any of the friends who watched it with me) felt as though we had been there a long time or as though the plot was slowing down. It wasn't until we left the theater that we realized how long we'd been entertained!The music is great- I have been searching everywhere for a soundtrack or score, with no success.Johnny Depp was perfect as Jack Sparrow, the pirate with a screw loose. I can't imagine anyone else in the role- when I try to, I think "they would ruin it!" Orlando and Kiera are not hard to look at, and each of them has moments that would make the opposite sex weak in the knees.The lord of the rings movies, all our superhero movies, the star wars movies have all raised the bar to a very high level for special effects. However, the effects in this movie WERE convincing and, in addition, they were interesting! Several times, you could tell that the action was choreographed in such a way to show off the effects, and at those times, the scenes were absolutely picturesque - the type that you'd like to put up on your wall.Like just about everyone else who has posted here, I immediately decided, while leaving the theater, that I will be going back to see it again, the $8 per show fee notwithstanding.This is an excellent movie that I will own as soon as it is available on DVD, and I will continue to recommend it to everyone I know.Just see it for yourself!*(The word Bejesus is used, as is the word Hell in the literal sense; that is, referring to the location Hell; I don't consider these cuss words)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasant surprise of the highest order</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My expectations for this movie - or its score, for that matter - were not too high. In fact, let's face it: I expected it to suck very, very hard. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised, nay blown away even. I haven't had this much fun at an action/adventure film since The Mummy. From the astoundingly lush sets and costumes to the beautiful cinematography, to the satisfyingly quotable dialogue, this movie had everything the blusteringly swashbuckling connoisseur could hope for. But what really makes it such a tremendously enjoyable experience is the fantastic acting. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow once again proves that he is one of the finest actors of our generation - boastful, swaggering and deliciously over the top he is never boring to watch. Geoffrey Rush is no less excellent as the dreadful undead pirate Captain LeChuck, who kidnaps the beautiful governor's daughter Elaine Marley (Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley) to undo the curse he and his shipmates suffer from. Also great: Orlando Bloom as Elaine's childhood friend Guybrush Threepwood, a dashing (as opposed to merely runny) blacksmith turned pirate. It's all very much The Mummy meets Cutthroat Island, though done with a lot more skill and panache. My second favorite film of the year so far (after Finding Nemo). I can only hope that Wild Wild West II: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will turn out to be equally superb.As for the score, Klaus Badelt (and six other composers, amongst them Jimmy Doodle and Steve Jabalabomsky) once again proves that while he may not be a very original composer, he is superb at filtering other people's work. He distilled the best of Gladiator and Muppet Treasure Island, filtered out all of the annoying Lisa Gerrard whining and cheap synthesizers, added a bit of K-19, Drop Zone and Goblin (the cue accompanying the initial appearance of the Black Pearl was quite reminiscent of their wonderful work for Argento's Suspiria) and mixed it all up, resulting in a marvelous little film music stew. It's all the MV nutrients without the fats! I might even get the CD, if only for that fabulously re-orchestrated version of the Drop Zone trailer music!Satisfying? Yes. But since this is one of the finest adventure films I've seen in ages, I still cannot help but lament that Silvestri didn't write this score. Or Goldsmith. Or Shearmur. Or Debney. Or Doyle. It would have kicked Cutthroat Island, The Mummy Returns AND Sinbad into oblivion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the Summer!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I felt that this was an excellent movie. It has everything that a movie needs to be great: action, adventure, comedy, romance, thrills, a great plot, great effects, great direction, and a great (not to mention attractive) cast. I know that more than a few people think that the movie is overlong at 2 hours and 20 minutes. I don't mind the length and I don't think that's it's that big of a problem (you'd think since I've seen it four times!). And just think, The Lord of the Rings films are longer than this by 40-50 minutes and nobody criticizes those films on their length. I also don't think the movie would have been as good if they had cut it down. It's rated PG13 for action/adventure violence. There' no swearing except for a few minor words. The skeletons in the movie may possibly frighten younger childen. Anyway, it is an excellent movie, it's a perfect summer film, and it's a great, fun family film. Give it a go, yo ho!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is undoubtedly a hit. WARNING SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING (SPOILER IN THIS POSTING) This movie is a masterpiece that is surprisingly produced by Disney. I'm not saying that Disney produces terrible movies. I just haven't seen a Disney movie with violence like this, or a rating like this in a while. I have noticed that in the past few years, Disney has put out movies that have parts that are directed to the adult viewers. Anyway, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a movie with much promise. It takes the viewer into another time and place that seems so real. At the same time that the film came out, the video game also came out. This move was directed to help the movie, since the game has no correlation to the movie, except that you encounter the Black Pearl and the female lead role in the film narrates the game. Anyway, Depp and Bloom gave fantastic performances. Depp did really well as the witty Captain Sparrow looking to get even, while saving his own skin. Bloom fit his part very well. But Rush did extremely well as the Captain of the Black Pearl. I have yet to see him fit his character in a while. He did well in "House on Haunted Hill." The special effects in this film are amazing. Of course nothing too surprising from Disney. I have to admit that the fight in the cave in the end was very well done. When Rush and Depp are fighting in the cave, they jump from dark to moonlight. The effect of them turning from human to undead was one of the best special effects that I have seen in a long time. Most movies that try something like this, generally have the camera farther back so that they do not have to change the character's appearances as many times as this film did. The pirates in the film were amazing. Each one of them had their own characteristics that were obvious to the viewers. Overall, this movie is a have to see for people looking for a ride that doesn't let go.</fullReview>

I'm not going to re-hash what others have said, so just read the other posters if you want plot lines or the inconsistencies stated (Roger Ebert does a okay job w/ pointing out the stuff that doesn't jive....)That said, I can put up w/ the wacky story mostly because of the strong acting by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. What amazing actors! (Bloom, regretably, was under utilized. One hopes he didn't pass on a more MEATIER movie role for this. Any stiff could have pulled off this role, since Depp and Rush are such SCENE stealers!)One can only hope that the Academy of Arts &amp; Motion Pictures sees the beauty of Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow and give's him a nod during nomination time. Doubt he'll win (but would LOVE to be proved wrong!), but it's finally time this actor gets the recognition he deserves: Depp is TOTALLY an actor's actor!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all the summer movies of 2003, "Pirates" definetely qualifies for the best. I think this film maybe the first good pirate movie since god knows when. It seems like a brilliant mixture of action/adventure/comedy/fantasy/thriller with some horrific pirate skeleton scenes. Now on the acting. This movie couldn't of done too much for Orlando Bloom's career as he is the most boring character in my opinion. Keira Knightley definetely had an interesting character that helped the movie very much. Geoffrey Rush was brilliant, although this movie probably mostly helped Johnny Depp, whose character was Jack Sparrow. Depp was definetely right for the part, and he was just so funny in most of his scenes. This is definetely a movie worth seeing in the summer, as is LXG, Terminator 3, Finding Nemo, Johnny English, and (even though I haven't seen it) 28 Days Later. Here are a list of movies to stay away from: at 5: The Hulk. at 4: Charlie's Angels 2. at 3: Legally Blonde 2. at 2: Sinbad. at 1: From Justin To Kelly.</fullReview>

Keira Knightly does an excellent job as Elizabeth Swann.One thing I really like about this movie, is the actors. They don't just act out their characters, they become their characters, and make you almost believe this story really happened; they take you into the story.The climax is excellent, the actions leading up to the climax are excellent, the special effects are excellent... everything is excellent.

Summer 2003 rolls around and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl gained some of the best reviews for any movie this summer, so alas I thought I would go and see what the big deal was. I have to say Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl really surpised since I don't really go for Disney flicks, but director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have made a film full of action that anyone can enjoy. I have to say that Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa and the lovely Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann all make the film work with their performances. Orlando Bloom is ok in the movie but his role could have been played by anyone. Still a great ride and a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a Disney ride turned into a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On hearing the premise of this movie, I was determined to avoid it at all costs. Then I found out who was in the cast, read some reviews, and decided to give it a go despite the risk of having to sit through a fluffy, Disnified film.Granted, I love pirate movies, and the dearth of good ones lately has left me looking for a ray of hope. This movie has more than redeemed the genre.While occasionally nodding to the popular Disney ride, this film stands completely on its own. The plot, while somewhat convoluted (WHICH ship are they on now?), provided a fun backdrop to show of the story's characters. Geoffrey Rush plays an oddly likeable villian as Barbarossa, the captain of the ghost pirates of the buccaneer ship the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom's naive Will Turner was the sweet and likeable hero (though perhaps not the brightest coin in the chest). Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swan was loveably feisty (she knows how to use a musket! You go, girl!). As Governor Swan, Jonathan Pryce keeps it light enough that we don't hate the character for being a snob--and his encounter with the arm that wouldn't die is priceless. And, last but certainly not least, Johnny Depp plays Mad Captain Jack Sparrow so convincingly he could have carried the movie himself, creating a character you're never really sure is quite sober or sane, but definitely wily and always fascinating. The special effects for the movie were fairly good, especially during an underwater march of the undead pirates. The dialogue in the movie escapes being trite due to the talent of the cast, and instead comes across as familiar but funny. For you action fans, there's plenty to love: Orlando Bloom revisits his sword-fighting talent in several scenes, and Johnny Depp gets to put his athletic talents to the test while jumping and swinging from ship to ship all the way across the Spanish Main. If you're willing to give this movie a chance, I highly recommend catching it before it leaves the big screen. It will still be fun on DVD, but it's worth the price of a ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED this movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the STUNNING success (please note sarcasm) of Disney's "Country Bears", okay I haven't seen it- but do I have to see "Swept Away" to know it's - to put it nicely "Doo Doo?" - The thought of yet ANOTHER Disney film to attempt to cash in on one of it's popular rides didn't fare well in my eyes, then Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush came into the picture- Curiosity sparked, but had yet to flame- then Jerry Bruckheimer- Things were getting interesting, and the trailers and TV spots left me downright hopeful- and by the time the film was over I knew it was the BEST movie I've seen this year, and doubt any other movie stands a chance- I had to go to the bathroom halfway through- but didn't want to miss a scene- Johnny Depp gave, in my opinion, the best performance I've ever seen, the cast was great, the special effects were flawless, There's no doubt I'm going to have to see this in the Theater again- and I can hardly wait for the DVD!I'm absolutely in LOVe with this film! It's all I can think about!The Ma6rix was great- but this movie is unbelivable! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to go to the European premiere of this film , and I thought it was amazing. The special affects are brilliant and Johnny Depp is great, i thought that he alone made the film , as he made his character so unique and he was hilarious (the eyeliner is so cool). I found Orlando Bloom a bit disappointing in the film , as I thought that he didnt put much feeling into his lines, and didnt stand out amongst the other more lively characters .The action is excellent , and the skeleton pirates are extremely realistic and scary. This film overall is excellent , and well worth seeing for Johnny Depp(Captain Jack Sparrow)if anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing that is so big about PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (other than its ten-word title and it's 2 and a half hour running time) is the fact that this is a hit. I mean, a movie about pirates, that has a lot of skeleton guys walking around. It's perfect for the little kids and its not been plunged to the horrid depths of being so stupid that adults (yes, you small minded adults) will even like it. Kiera Knightly is hott (for the guys), Orlando Bloom is a heart-throb for the girls, and Johnny Depp wears heavy mascara. How can this movie fail?Well, there are so many changes in the plot, so many twists and turns-- this is a direct result of the writer not knowing what to do and not knowing where he was going with the script. Nevertheless, the film does have a sort of creepy, moody feel to it that helps it become nostalgic and just kind of has the words "Box Office Smash" written all over it. Granted, half of its audience members are probably people who are just wasting time before THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN comes out, this film still stands on its own. Director Gore Virbinski again returns, getting better all the time. His last attempt THE RING was an extreme hit but many people are getting quite bored with it now (sequel time maybe?). Hopefully Virbinski will only continue his trend of gradually getting better with each new film.The graphics are well done and the film contains several moments of eerie horror and thrilling action sequences. The humor comes in bounds (again, trying to amuse the little kiddies) and Johnny Depp acts very 'action-hero', kinda like Brendan Fraser's role in THE MUMMY. He still does very well. The films stands on its own, has loads of originality and is a hit. It won't stay that way forever though.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have around 2 1/2 hours of free time, and you want to spend your time wisely you should go check out Pirates of the Caribbean. Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) was the one who saved this movie. Seriously, without Johnny I probably would have either fallen asleep or left. Sure, Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) did a great job leaving his elfish persona behind and performing in a role unlike what we have seen him in before, but he really did not make this movie. One performance that I did enjoy, although I wasn't totally blown away, was the performance by Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann). Her character seemed to mesh well with Orlando's character. Plus, Orlando and Keira seemed like they really enjoyed their roles and had fun. Geoffrey Rush (Barbossa) did absolutely nothing for me, and the character the Governor (Jonathan Price) was not up to par with the other actors indeed. All in all, the storyline is pretty awesome. Unrealistic most of the time, it still is fun. I had fun watching this movie, even though towards the end I wish it would have just ended sooner. I was tired. Who can blame me? Also, some of the storyline was pretty predictable. But what do you expect from a movie based on a ride from a theme park?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is a movie based upon the Walt Disney ride "Pirates of the Caribbean". Though it may seem a tad different at first glance, seeing as Disney is creating a movie after the ride when it would be expected to be seen in the opposite order, this film is exceptionally well done. If you enjoy the ride, then you will adore the movie. Almost every scene from the ride appears, even if it is very brief, within the movie (the auction is the only one noticed to have gone missing by two of the three of my party this evening). The song that those who have gone on the ride would recognize appears first and makes a strange yet interesting beginning. The special effects during this film were exceptional and seamless. Not to mention the casting... Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was a perfect match. This movie keeps you guessing the entire time and holds your attention (even if you have found yourself in front of a noisy bunch of teenagers). This film is one of the best I've seen in theaters all year.</fullReview>

Captin Jack Sparrow is a messed-in-the-head rogue Pirate just looking for a new ship to call his own. Will Turner, apprentice to the local blacksmith, but never gets credit for his job well done. Not to mention he has the hotts for the govoners daughter. Elizabeth Swann, the strong willed govoners daughter who would much rather die wearing those damn cured corsets then marry the self absorbed army captin. Captin "Blackheart" Bardossa, the villianous captin of the feared and very cursed Black Pearl. Blackheart and his crew are cursed with immortality. Doesn't sound bad huh...it is to him and the crew. What's being a pirate if you can't die with pirate honor. He needs Elizabeth's blood to complete the anticurse process. It's up to an unlikly team, Sparrow and Turner, to save her life. I love Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom's job in the Lord of the Ring was excellent, I needed to see what else he could pull out of his sleeves. Awsome cast, great plot and lots of sword fighting, this movie gets my two thumbs up and then some. I love this movie. -CSD</fullReview>

Do not bother with the holes in the plotline, as there are more of those than a trainload of Swiss cheese, but rather focus on the fact that the digital engineers at Disney were able to study the Errol Flynn movies and recreate them using the latest in imaging techniques. The result is a mindbending display of scenery and swordfights all acted out with a cast of quality performers, who seem to be plucked right from the pages of what we perceive to be accurate history. It plays right to the imagination, and I loved it. Johnny Depp steals the show as the swishbuckling androgenous pirate, and the supporting cast was selected with an eye on keeping the right mix of wisdom, youth, characterization, and sex appeal.

		<fullReview>So many cool movies come out during the summer, but for some reason, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was one of the films I was most interested in. It just looked so fun and stylish and cool. The pirate theme is too underused in movies. So anyway, I got to see it on opening day, and it was as good as I had hoped. Here's a few reasons you should go see Pirates of the Caribbean, me bucko: 1) Johnny Deep. Ya gotta hand it to Depp for giving his character Captain Jack Sparrow such a unique personality. He fumbles into a lot of bad luck (and jail cells), but is always able to use his charm and skill to get out of it. His body language and style of speech are awesome, which makes for a very memorable character. The rest of the cast is great too, in particular Geoffrey Rush as the cruel pirate Captain Barbossa. But it's Johnny Deep who makes this movie. 2) Undead pirates! With all due respect to Ray Harryhausen's sword-fighting skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts, this cursed crew has to be the coolest bunch of skeletons I've seen on screen. It's an impressive effect when they move in and out of moonlight. Must have been a nightmare for ILM animators, with so much detail... bones and hair and tattered clothing. And then to stick dozens of these skeletons in fights with live actors? Wow. I actually would have enjoyed seeing more scenes with the moonlit monsters. But ye scurvy dogs who don't like too much CG stuff, will be glad to know the movie has plenty of other swashbuckling action that doesn't rely on animated effects. With a running time of around 2 hours, 20 minutes, there's enough time for a little of everything. 3) Comedy. Pirates of the Caribbean isn't an all out comedy, but there's a boatload of humor. Especially from Jack Sparrow and some of Barbossa's bungling crew. I was laughing quite a bit, either from actual jokes, visual gags, or just the absurd situations. It's really a witty script. The story isn't all that complicated, but I liked the way they revealed things as they go, so the plot isn't totally predictable. I hear it's the first Disney film to get a PG-13 rating... I assume because the skeletal pirate violence could give little kids nightmares. But the rest is good family fun so I think this should appeal to a wide audience. So check it out, me hearties. Yo-ho!</fullReview>

Thoroughly enjoyable piece of fluff, that is relaxing and fun. It kind of reassures me that left in the hands of those that know, there might still be hope for the "good old ways" of cinema art. Kinda goes in the face of the ultra sexist, artistically bankrupt, presumptous pieces of summer mindless garbage like, among many, "Charlie's Angels Full Throttle" and "Legally Blonde II". The audience clapped at the end of Pirates, the hall was full and smiles abounded as they left the hall. What better way to say "it worked!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS MOVIE KICKS BUTT - One of the 5 best so far this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I am awestruck. I was just at Disneyland on Monday, so the ride this movie was based on was fresh in my mind. I liked that they worked in the bit from the ride with the imprisoned pirates trying to tempt the dog that holds the keys to their cell.The performances were amazing, especially by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow's introduction was brilliant. Depp was perfect in every way as Sparrow, right down to his drunken swagger. The only one miscast here in my opinion was Jonathan Pryce - he will always be Elliot Carver from Tomorrow Never Dies in my mind. Everyone else was excellent.The visual effects are extraordinary. They aren't overly exploited and they don't look fake, unlike some effects films (can you say Hulk?).Gore Verbinski is one of the most versatile and talented directors out there. Every movie he's made (except MouseHunt) has been enjoyable and entertaining. The cinematography was totally engrossing and beautiful, but for God's sakes STOP SHOOTING MOVIES LIKE THIS IN SUPER-35!!! My parents kept asking me if the movie was unfocused because of the definition loss. SHOOT ANAMORPHIC!!!Anyway....where was I.... Oh yeah, the MUSIC! The best thing about this movie was the music. Produced under the supervision of the brilliant genius Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt's score is the best I've heard on a movie this year.This is one of the five best movies thus far this year, joining the ranks with the likes of The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action-Master-Piece? I never would have thought...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PotC caught me by surprise. The few trailers I had seen for the movie made it look interesting (pirate are neat) but hadn't done much to impress me; they marketed it as an non-stop action movie (not that those can't be entertaining). However, it's so much more than that. Johnny Depp is a highly capable actor (even when he is in some less than capable movies) who can hold the stage well. However, in this film, he utterly dominates it as Jack Sparrow (that's Captain Jack Sparrow). He really throws himself into the character's role and it works with such ease; he comes off as one of the best anti-heroes I ever seen: a swashbuckling and devilishly charming pirate whose charisma makes you root for him the entire time. If the rest of the movie had been terirble it would still be worth seeing for this man's performance. Orlando Bloom works well here (though you still want to think of him as Legolas) alongside Depp. His seriousness counters just as well as his swordplay against Depp's roguish charm. His character is well rounded and good but he comes off more as a sidekick as Depp's acting places him in the background. Geoffrey Rush is an amazing actor. If you've seen the Tailor of Panama or Quills (amongst his newer works) you'd know this. His portrayal as the cursed Captain of the Black Pearl truly reminded me of his performance as the Marquis de Sade in Quills: dark, brooding and disturbingly charismatic. He would steal the show if it were not for Depp's power. Keira Knightley works well as the damsel in distress but she's much more than that in this film. As a newcomer, she'll make a good career for herself. The CGI effects of the skeletons is magnificent. They blend in well with the scenes and, though you realize the use of CGI, it doesn't stand out in the crowd. The cinematography was well done and made the action scenes creative as well as entertaining. The choreography of such scenes was also top-notch and the swordplay was much more impressive than that in the latest Bond film. Too much good stuff can be said about this movie. It is the best movie I've seen this summer and possibly the best movie of this year that I've seen (I still need to check out Better Luck Tomorrow). All in all, Depp deserves an Oscar nod (at least) for this role. It's one of his career's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean exceeded my expectations by far. Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) was in his element as was Orlando Bloom (Will Turner). I expected the movie to be only so-so or even cheezy as it was based on a storyline that was trivial. I was blown away by the wonderful special effects and exquisite acting. Keira Knightley is definatly on her way to a huge career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've actually been reading reviews for this film and have to admit that I'm quite surprized. While I do have to admit that there were some truly worthy scenes and the directing was absolutly superb, I left the theater disappointed.First of all the ending is boring, predictable, cheesy, overplayed and used out in hollywood films today. Secondly, the movie is too long. Lots of people walked out because some parts of the movie were extremely slow and/or kept on dragging on. On the subject of dragging on, this film was very violent for a Disney movie. Now I've got nothing against violence as I'm looking forward to some upcoming violent films, but this violence was pointless and needless and LOOOOONG.Thirdly, the cursed pirates turn into skeletons at midnight and are immortal (awesome) but they are just that and don't do anything special (big disappointment). When I say anything special, I'm comparing them to the warriors in The Mummy who actually had supernatural abilities. These pirates just change into skeletons and attack like you and me. Needless to say, it gets really boring after a while.Forthly, Deep's portrayal of the Jack Sparrow character was odd. In a majority of the scenes, he seemed like he was on some sort of narcotics. The last and final film gripe against this film was the accents the characters used. It was sometimes hard to understand some lines due to the mumbling.Anyway, the worst part of the film occured when it was over. As everyone stood up to exit, the movie received a full blown round of applause and cheers by little noisy children and their parents. Maybe I've seen too many films, but I was disappointed at this flick...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie! I don't go to but 3 or 4 flicks per year. I choose to go movies that are "family friendly" and there are not many these days!Johnny Depp positively nailed this character down. Captain ( and don't you forget it ) Jack Sparrow is a quasi-Keith Richards pirate that Depp used as a sort of "template" for this character. I must say, you could squint your eyes and believe it was Keith.Bottom line for me is to ask the question: "Was it worth the time and $$ to see this? Or wait for the DVD?" Trust me....it IS worth the time and $$ AND I will buy the DVD. Humor. Adventure. Special effects ( VERY good special effects ). Colorful characters. Makes you want to see a sequel TOMORROW! I hope there is one. Really.THE movie of the summer IMO. Call me a tough customer but, this flick won me over. Going back with my wife to see it again tomorrow! I havn't paid twice for a flick....EVER either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl delivers on all the fun, adventure, and witty banter that people want when they go to a pirate movie - but which has been absent from movie theaters for years. This is no Cut-Throat Island (thank God) but rather more of an Errol Flynn-style swashbuckler (sorry, I had to use the word). Johnny Depp's character drives the story, swaying the actions of all those around him through clever - sometimes coy - manipulation of pretty much everyone. The fact that he's a bit off kilter and unexpectedly smart means that he's always half a step ahead of the audience. This makes for a rewarding, sometimes surprising story that keeps us engrossed. While this isn't rocket science, there's no dumbing-down here.Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen better acting in ANY movie than the acting role of Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp in the movie The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Depp does an outstanding job at playing this role. The excitement through out this movie is intense and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Not only is it a good action movie, but also very funny. This is definitely my new favorite movie. I CAN'T wait for the movie to come out. I will watch it everyday!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although critics have blown this movie out of the water, it will still sail. This movie is great. Probably one of the best live-action movies from Disney in a while. And while it may depict some violence....what do you think pirates are all about. The ride in which it is based has been depicting "violence" for years. For the hardcore Pirates ride fans, this movie is loaded with images and ideas from the ride. Instant Disney Classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare movies that captures your attention and keeps it all the way through. The magic of this film is something that makes the rest of the movies (Harry Potter included) seems mild in comparison!Johnny Depp, while not delivering his best performance, was consistently loveable and hate-able. He never fell out of character and he is one I loved to hate.The Pirate ship was truly a masterpiece. The shocks of ghosts surround and hold you close while making you squirm through ghosts and flesh. The pirates are absolutely terrifying when seen for what they are.While I do not recommend this for the squeamish or the faint of heart. It is a family film -- but only if your kids are teenagers!

Yes, I was one of the first to jump on the bandwagon about this movie when there were first even talks about making the ride a film - I love the Pirates ride, it's my favorite Disney ride and all that. When I heard who was going to be in it, I couldn't be more thrilled - I don't think I've ever seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it that I didn't like and Orlando Bloom stole my heart as he portrayed my favorite Lord of the Rings charactor - Legolas. Then the first trailers, even the teaser gave me goosebumps. I began to fear, however, that it could not possibly be as good as I was hopping it to be. I am happy to say that I was delightfully wrong.The story was cleaver, the acting surperb, the effects amazing and I had no idea how funny it was going to be - just the inside jokes (harkening back to the ride) alone were enough to have me rolling in the isles! At no time did this film take itself too serriously (something I am sure reviewers are going to do, a shame really).In a summer full of disapointments (i.e. The Hulk, The Matrix), I am excited and releaved that this is finally out and as good as it boasted.

		<shortDescription>A Pirate's Life For Johnny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in to 'Pirates', I have to admit that despite my outward enthusiasm, inwardly I was expecting a fluffy, cotton candy Disneyland movie. I almost hesitated on seeing the flick, in fears that I would never enjoy my favorite Disneyland ride again. However, adventure I did to the theatre, and exceedingly glad I am that I did so. Aye, the movie was fast-paced, but not 'Moulin Rouge'-so. It was adventurous, surprisingly well written, and the computer graphics were done very well. The filming was consistently done well, from the acrobatic fighting sequence between Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the magnificent shots of the dueling 'Interloper' and 'Black Pearl'.However, even with a great script, excellent plot and wonderful sets to boot, the captain of this fantastic voyage was wholeheartedly Johnny Depp. Playing the cocky, charming scoundrel Capt. Jack Sparrow, Depp unleashes a side of his acting persona that not many moviegoers have ever witnessed: comedy. Depp's varying facial expressions and swaying, seemingly-inebriated posture give him a swashbuckling charisma that captures your attention as he staggers through the picture, even in the company of Hollywood's latest teen-screen idol Orlando Bloom. Depp's genuinely funny with great comedic timing, yet he is also blessed with having genuinely hilarious punch lines to deliver. Reeling around in his three-corner hat, long, beaded black hair, and colorful pirate duds, Depp is a living, breathing replica of Disney's mechanical menaces. In the movie, he is the savior. Although Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and especially new arrival Kiera Knightley do excellent in their respective roles, Depp not only steals every scene he is in, he walks away with the entire movie in his pocket. Whenever the plot drags (and it does, at seemingly the most random of occasions), Depp swings into the picture and delivers the action with a gleeful, devilish grin. He's the lovable rogue Hollywood has been missing for years.'Pirates' opens with young Elizabeth Swann meeting a shipwrecked boy named Will Turner with a mysterious pirate medallion strung around his neck. Years later, Elizabeth (played with a lot of spunk and gusto by Kiera Knightley) has grown up and is secretly in love with Will, now a blacksmith, while her father the governor wishes her to marry a British naval officer. Although a fainting spell lands Elizabeth into the deep trouble, the currently marooned Captain Jack Sparrow, pirate extraordinaire, rescues her from a watery grave. Despite his good intentions, Jack is welcomed with cordial hostility by the British navy, and winds up (by way of Will Turner) in the cooler (Look for a familiar scene around here, accompanied by a classic line by Jack: "You keep waving that bone around, he's never going to come").That night, pirates overrun the port and take Elizabeth hostage. Soon enough, she realizes that she's not in the company of ordinary buccaneers, but in a crew of the living dead, hexed for taking Cortes' cursed gold. The crew's appearance is drastically changed in moonlight, but worse than that, they cannot take pleasure in food, women, or (shiver me timbers!) even rum. To break the curse, they need to return all the coins and offer the blood sacrifice of one person...the child of a former mate in the crew. Turns out, Will's 'medallion' is really one of Cortes' gold pieces. Turns out, it's also in Elizabeth's possession. Now Will must team up with Jack to get back his girlfriend; at the same time, Jack tosses in with Will to get the 'Black Pearl'. The adventure is on.I hate the phrase, "If you see one movie this summer...' but I cannot help using it in this review. Do yourself a favor and see 'Pirates of the Caribbean', it doesn't matter if you're ten, seventeen, twenty-five, thirty-five, fifty, or ninety-nine...unless you have a heart condition. No, it's doubtful you'll be scared stiff by this flick, but you might bust an artery as fifty teen girls scream every time Orlando Bloom pokes his head onto the screen. Or whenever Johnny Depp wobbles across the screen with cunning one-liners. From his gleeful smirks, it's assumable that Depp had a ball making this movie. If you dare to see it, I promise you'll leave singing, `Yo-ho, yo-ho, a pirate's life for me.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Carribean: the Curse of the Black Pearl is amazingly wonderful. It's funny, it's action packed, and although it is a little long, that still didn't hurt this incredible film.Keira and Orlando Bloom did wonderful jobs. Geoffrey Rush was great. Johnny Depp however was incredible. His character was fun and exciting. Depp is so consumed in his character that all you see is Captain Jack Sparrow on the screen. I had heard that he steals the show but that comment doesn't even do his portrayal justice.The plot isn't bad considering the fact that it was created from a theme park ride. It actually has a nice background. The music is wonderful. Hans Zimmer does a wonderful job of complementing the swash-buckling action.But enough of the technical stuff. This is a must see movie for the summer. I can't wait until it comes out on video and besides that I plan to see it again.Bottom line: It has everything. It is a fun epic tale, that takes you into the new world and keeps you laughing and entertained the whole way through. If you love Orlando Bloom or especially Johnny Depp you need to see this movie. If you like action movies, you need to see this movie. If you want a movie that is original and different, you need to see this movie.

Some tremendous spooky special effects and beautiful scenery add to the fun. I'm not giving any spoilers away ,go see it for yourself and enjoy. Great performances by Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush ,Orlando Bloom and the rest. Some of the swordfights are really cool too. Great action and adventure. I do not recommend taking preteen kids to see this movie due to the violence which does get intense at times and watching the undead kill people will give them nightmares.Take your older kids and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my top 5 list of my favorite movies..no joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see this film badly so when I walked in the theater I was already very excited..but nothing could prepare me for HOW GOOD IT IS!....Hands down to Disney who FINALLY make a stupendousely entertaining movie..good move on their part.You walk out of the theater in utter refreshment...and Pirates..will leave you satisfied and worth your 6 bucks, definatley the best movie of the summer no competition. You got it all in one movie..comedy,action,drama,romance...and each genre is pulled off with magnificence. Orlando Bloom is the heroic hottie that proved that he can play more than a blonde elf, and of course I think he's hot property for young Hollywood. The same goes for Miss Kiera Knightly, who is stunningly beautiful and Im looking forward for more of her. Geoffery Rush is of course the perfect bad guy who manages to reach into your heart. HOWEVER HATS OFF TO JOHNNY DEPP! As I've read on here everyone is saying the smae thing Mr. Depp steals the show. Before this movie Depp was OK for me I didn't love but I didn't hate him, however after watching this movie I've grown to idolize the guy. He's ASTOUNDING as Cpt. Jack Sparrow, the eccentric good-guy pirate. He also has these really funny one liners throughout the whole movie that are worth your money just to see him act out. I BOW DOWN TO JOHHNY DEPP for without a doubt providing the best performance of the summer or if I dare say so far this year! Go JOHNNY! GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I have yet to see a bad review on here and believe me if you don't enjoy this movie somethiings the matter with you..:) SCORE:8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp carries this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp carries this otherwise bloated and wordy film. Bloom plays himself, which he also plays in LOTR. Rush is fantastic and Kiera looks like a mix between Natalie Portman and Wynona Ryder, but does a good turn. This shouldve been 30 minutes shorter and the actions scenes are confusing. But Depp's and Rush's performances are so great I recommend this film simply because of them. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl shows that protecting those you love gives you the courage to overcome the things that can cause one to be frightened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the story of how Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) work together to rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the undead pirates that sail on the Black Pearl. Elizabeth is taken from her home when a group of pirates invades the town. She is taken to Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) after she invokes the right of parley. She wears a pirate's medallion that is linked to the curse placed on the crew of the Black Pearl after they stole the Aztec treasure. The medallion is the final piece of treasure, and they only need her blood to break the curse. However, she has taken this medallion from Will when he was a young boy, and it is his blood that they need. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl shows that protecting those you love gives you the courage to overcome the things that can cause one to be frightened. Nothing can stop a person from trying to protect someone they love. Will Turner is in love with Elizabeth and finds a way to rescue her from the pirates that took her. He was unable to get help from the Navy and the man that wishes to marry Elizabeth, so he breaks Jack out of the cell he was held in, and they work together to find the pirates and Elizabeth. I believe the central insight of the film is doing what has to be done for those you love. This theme is shown throughout the movie as Will finds Elizabeth and tells Barbossa that he is the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner and offers to trade his life for the release of Elizabeth. She returns the love of Will and makes a plan to burn all of the rum on the island she and Jack are stranded on. Her father and Commodore Norrington see the fire and rescue them. Elizabeth convinces them to look for Will. She realizes that she is in love with Will, and her father sees this as well. Throughout the film, the motif was used that showed Will had a love interest in Elizabeth. He would always call her Ms. Swann even though every time she told him to call her Elizabeth. Jack also pointed out that Will already had a love interest, and that was why he practiced so much with the swords that he made. The lighting used when Will and Elizabeth are together is also brighter and shows more connection between the two. The love that grew between Will and Elizabeth lead to them being able to save each other from the undead pirates that were looking for the last golden medallion. They were able to overcome the difficult obstacles that the pirates put in front of them and were able to use their love and passion to get others along the way to help them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Code Being More A Set Of Suggestions As It Were</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, to honor the detractors, is it too long? Yes, about forty minutes, with an interminable sword fight you could paint your house during. Is the plot threadbare? Yes, it has a very flimsy plot; please, if you were expecting a deep script, hey, it's a Disney movie. Yet, I own the movie, this and the second one. It is very easy to review it for you with great efficacy. Watch a little of this, do you really like Depp's Jack Sparrow? The swaying, the funny facial expressions, the joyous corruption, do these endear him to you? If you answer no, do not watch this series of movies. For me, I, like many others, start laughing the minute I even look at him. This really is Depp's signature role; he has the delineation down so well that even, when he doesn't speak, his non-verbal expressions and gestures are quite funny. The plot follows the search for Jack's ship, The Black Pearl, that he had ripped off by Captain Barbarossa, played well by Rush, the other reason to watch this movie. Barbossa stranded Jack on the world's smallest island with a bottle of rum and a single shot to kill himself with. This was fortuitous for Sparrow for Barbossa next was brought a chest of Inca's gold by the father of Orlando Bloom. Until every piece of the gold is returned and Bloom is sacrificed over the gold, Barbossa's crew change into skeletons every night. Food, drink and women's entertainment have no effect on their bodies.Yes, I know, it is not Citizen Kane. Again, the stars of these movies are the dialog but above all Rush and Depp. Ergo, if you find them stupid or annoying, don't waste your time. The dialog and casting of this first of the series make it the best. Sparrow often sways about canvassing a room with odd gestures and rotations (Rum) that will make you die laughing. When he is in a sword-fight with Bloom, he brazenly cheats. Bloom gives him a deeply offended look to which Jack retorts a single word: Pirate! Hello? The rules don't apply to me. This first movie is firmly tongue-in-cheek, it laughs at itself, often parodying pirate movies. There are a pair of idiot pirates, as comic relief, one of whom's glass eye is forever popping out and rolling all over Creation. My header refers to tragic Elizabeth Swann, the governor's daughter, who thinks that the Pirate's Code is some sacred codified document these reprobates will honor. She utters the solemn word: Parley. Well, Captain Barbossa, before spiriting her off to his cabin, speaks my header as to why he doesn't give a crap what she postulates as immunity from imprisonment. Yes, detractors, we spend too much time in PirateLand. Also, it is just too long, it drags in several spots; this is a good time to raid the fridge. The climax, the sword duel between Sparrow and Barbossa, will test your patience. In my view, I laughed often at the characterizations and the dialog which is the best of the series here. Be warned, every sequel is a step down from this one. The casting gets worse and worse. Hence, if you don't like this one, save your money. Yes, certain movie companies want you to buy the whole set for a reason. Don't fall for it, they do this for a very good reason. Like Back To The Future, I only own this one; I got the second one for ten bucks. I won't own the last one which is just awful. The effects may be old but they still look good. There are many good bit comedic actors, like the two retarded English soldiers guarding one of their ships. Trust me, don't let them walk your dog. The comedy is all through the movie which makes this close to being as much a comedy as an action movie. Not A Classic But Worth Owning.

		<shortDescription>A Powerhouse Of Action, Spectacle &amp; Humour. Prepare To Be Blown Out Of The Water.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thoroughly fascinating blend of action, adventure, comedy, horror &amp; fantasy, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliantly scripted, skilfully directed &amp; cleverly narrated cinema that paints an interesting portrait of pirates mythology on the film canvas like never before and is also notable for bringing to life one of the most iconic characters of 21st century cinema.The story of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl follows the quest of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow who teams up with a talented blacksmith, Will Turner, to rescue the latter's love, Elizabeth Swann, who's been taken hostage on the notorious pirate ship, Black Pearl, which is commanded by the feared Captain Barbossa and carries a crew of cursed men who were once Jack's allies.Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean brims with an energetic &amp; creative vibe which keeps the story refreshing throughout its runtime, doesn't take much time to get its main plot moving, and with its firm grip on refined storytelling ends up infusing a new life into the pirates genre. The screenplay handles its different genres with remarkable ease and also presents a fine balance between its various elements.The production design team does a stellar job with its period sets &amp; meticulously designed ships. Cinematography makes fab use of its camera to capture each sequence in fine detail, use of colour palette is quite splendid and the expertly staged camera angles &amp; movements make its story all the more captivating. Even the Costumes are pretty much in tune with the depicted timeline, and the work in make-up department is no slouch either.Editing is undoubtedly one of its strongest highlights for it never allows the viewers to settle down, keeps the adventurous tone alive &amp; kicking all the way from start to finish, and paces its 143 minutes of story amazingly well. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff which blends into the narrative quite seamlessly. The background score is composed by Klaus Badelt and is an absolute delight that enhances the whole experience by a great deal with its pulsating tracks.Coming to the performances, Pirates of the Caribbean features an awesome cast in Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom &amp; Keira Knightley and they all manage to leave their mark, one way or another. Depp makes Jack Sparrow completely his own for it's his added inputs only which gives his character a unique look &amp; edge over the others, and there isn't one scene where he isn't the show-stealer. Rush also impresses a lot with his crazy take on Captain Barbossa, while Bloom &amp; Knightley deliver good performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a powerhouse of action, spectacle &amp; humour that's loaded with all the ingredients one requires to make a great blockbuster, which it is in every sense of the word. A work of ingenious craftsmanship that packs in a whole lot of fun, absolutely nails its comic timing, wonderfully balance all its aspects, delivers an entertainment worth your time &amp; money, and is an extremely enjoyable, unforgettable &amp; swashbuckling ride that presents Johnny Depp at the pinnacle of his talents while permanently engraving Captain Jack Sparrow into the annals of cinema &amp; pop culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a sissy for captain, this is a travesty of pirate movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly hate all the Pirates of Caribbean movies because they make a mockery of the complete genre, by the sole performance of 'Captain Jack Sparrow' as ultimate sissy captain. Which pirate in his right mind would ever accept him as his captain? He is the ultimate anti-pirate, and an insult to the spirit of all pirate movies. Without him the movie would at least have some merit, although it still would be mediocre.Rather watch Cutthroat Island with Geena Davis as female captain, she has more balls than Jack. Master and Commander is in a slightly different genre, but has a real captain on the reel. Or even better, watch the Horatio Hornblower series, where we see the development of an honorable midshipman into captain, in a fantastic historic period piece.Still five stars for the decent production values and a bit of a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much ado about nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, this was a disappointing movie. I anyhow wasn't that much inclined to see it, because of the popularity amongst the youngsters: that's invariably a bad token. So maybe I should rephrase my opening sentence. The movie was what I expected, but I'm always disappointed my bad expectations are so vastly responded to. This product is so obviously invented - with the help of some adequate stealing from the predecessors in the genre. To name a few examples: Jack Sparrows bearing clearly is a loan from Sandokan, the head figure of a popular pirate series in the 70's; the stern character of the commodore, rigid and uncompromising as in numerous examples before (the loosening at the end is a bland falsification); the Yankee Doodle type of the father of the heroine; and so on. The movie distinctly was made for commercial purposes, and has no historical traits whatsoever. The Zombie effect of pirates doomed to perpetual half-life is one of the many dispirited genuflections to modern taste and merely augments the mendacious value of the motion picture. I can give more instances of such unhistorical nonsense, but cannot do so without giving away the plot; so I'll avoid that error. All in all, if you like pure fantasy without any pretension of truth ? go see it, when you have nothing better to do. But don't you think things in any respect could've happened this way; life isn't a fairy-tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not remember the last time I saw a Disney film that was as bad as this is. Why do people who have had no acting lessons and are not fully trained actors continually get acting work at the expense of those that have been fully trained and therefore can act? Johnny Depp is proof of point of someone who has absolutely no ability to act whatsoever due to having had no lessons in how to act and is the complete opposite of fully trained and yet he keeps getting work in front of someone who is fully trained! The rest of the cast did rather well with the dreadful script, the storyline was almost non-existent, and didn't do anything remotely new. If half of The scenes where buckles were swashed and cut the rest shorter there still would have been far more than enough swash buckling to suit everyone that went to see the film. At over two hours long half an hour could have been taken out and it still would have been far too long! Johnny Depp's English accent was....well....let's just say it was obvious that it was an American trying to speak in and with an English accent, unlike Kevin Costner when he did Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves! There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING good about this generic pirate film. It had two story lines in it both of them having been told and shown countless times in far better ways numerous times before I wouldn't be at all surprised. OK so I Told a lie when I said there was absolutely nothing good about the film, as there was on thing good about it, the closing/end credits! Once they come on it means, thankfully, this extremely boring, exceedingly tedious film that has been stre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-tched to as long as it can be can now be switched off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching one of the greatest pirate movies ever made (Captain Blood,) I decided to finally give this a try. People are astounded that I have never seen a PotC movie. Nope. Not one. Never. Why? Not interested so much in the Hollywood machine. They do make some good films, and give plenty of regular people jobs, but I'm not a sheep, thanks; I'll stick to watching what I like to watch and if I watch a "Pirates" movie someday then so be it. Well, someday arrived tonight and I must say, I am not impressed. Nope. Not really. Johnny Depp has some funny moments but two hours of him acting like that is too much. And Captain Jack Sparrow is barely a pirate. A leader of men? Give me a break. He's pathetic. There's some good acting from Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport, but Depp's hammyness is borderline mental and helps ruin this movie. And what's with the CGI skeleton pirates? I thought this was gonna be a pirate movie. It's McDisney junk food that's only mildly entertaining at best. I was more bored than entertained.5.3 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl depicts a sword fight between two immortals that lasts for several minutes is really the clincher that the film does not amount to much more than a bit of throwaway nonsense. The scene, wherein it is readily identified by both parties that the futility of their actions can be equated only to their skills in sword fighting in the first place, epitomises just how much director Gore Verbinski is enjoying himself and just how much his audience aren't. For many years, the notion of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object has befuddled physicists; it may very well have to take second stage to the conundrum of what happens when two invulnerable forces do battle to the death. Do not think there is any attempt at solving such a riddle, for the director is merely pleased with the fact he's bringing all of this spectacle to life in the first place. It falls to all the usual Hollywood mistakes and annoyances: visual and oral bombardment consisting of grandeur tracking shots put to a booming score, while the completely ill-judged decision to cut back and forth from harmless comedy to scenes of a massacre represents American event-movie directing at its very worst. Like most of its ilk, it's too long and while there is some heady adventure in there at times, the film is too bad too often to actually get too excited about.There is no secret in the fact the film struggles with its narrative, seemingly desiring to balance the role of protagonist between three different people but only really ending up telling the story of a doomed crew to a series of fancy edits and prolonged sword fights. Somewhere down the line, ideas either ran out or became cross contaminated; the film is quite so evidently in love with its opening act that it hardly seems to want to launch its characters into a quest, while restless audiences will merely crave the opposite. And then there is that opening act, where, for all the errs of its ways and evident mistakes later on, the film starts surprisingly well. Beginning several years before the main body of the text, the film first depicts Elizabeth Swann on board a British galleon during the colonial era spying a young boy in the water. Once aboard, she discovers his true nature in that he's a pirate ? a sworn enemy to those on board but she keeps it a secret out of feeling quite fond for him and not wanting to see him lose his life. As the years pass, Swann grows up into Keira Knightley while the boy matures into Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and they stay loosely connected; he becoming a blacksmith, she already in the rarefied circles of already being a Navy Governor's daughter.As a young adult, Swann is living a suffocating life on this Jamaica-based outpost of the Empire; suffocating in every sense of the word in as much her tight fitting corset apparel is forced upon her just as much as her father's will seemingly is. Played with an ample amount of both sneer and sympathy by Jonathan Pryce, daddy sees fit to remind her that a certain Navy Commodore with a name like Norrington would make a fine suitor. Elizabeth can only wish for something more, something in the form of Turner with whom she would never stand a chance but for her peers. Enter Johnny Depp's rambling Jack Sparrow; a smooth talking, all-action although ultimately unorthodox pirate who doesn't shoot first and ask questions later since he doesn't carry a firearm and is too busy dropping a one-liner on you as he makes his daring escape anyway. Certainly, when compared to the other pirates in the jail cells, Sparrow strikes us as somewhat different; a man who risks capture if it means saving a life but is cold enough to exploit the life if it means saving his own. The initial incident launching everyone into motion arrives when Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain of the damned attacks the British fort and takes Elizabeth, something that forces the previously at-odds Sparrow and Turner into going after her by themselves.Structurally, the film spends too long in the port city of Port Royal before finally launching itself on the gigantic quest encompassing nautical traversing; un-dead enemies and a whole host of fight scenes. Thirty minutes into the actual adventure, we want to go back to Jamaica; where ramshackle characters with problems; desires and feelings played out in an environment brought to screen intelligently and energetically with a rich amount of costume and mise-en-scene for the colonial era when Britain ruled the waves. The film is generally problematic, with Depp and Bloom's buddy partnership not hitting the mark and this ridiculous narrative falling in on itself when further complications arise to do with the banishing of a curse. Once enough is enough, the film begins to outstay its welcome; the score gets louder and things that might've resembled human beings in the early part have become action figures for a child's imagination during playtime. The film is far from terrible and it's made with a boyish enthusiasm, but with the money; design and, some might say, the cast quite evidently at hand, enthusiasm and good intentions are not enough.</fullReview>

I've seen the movie twice and was bored both times... and I really wanted to like it because all of my friends did. The acting might be okay. But I felt nothing for any of the characters or the story. As someone who, again, gave even the likes of Troll 2 five stars, the fact that I was more invested in a bad movie's story than this supposed "good movie" is really saying something. It's a total snoozefest. I honestly didn't find a single scene interesting. Even the Doctor Who knockoff "The Curse of the Black Spot" was more entertaining with better characters and a good story. No thanks. So that's my synopsis, I barely remember what happens but I don't really care. I didn't like it at all.</fullReview>

Such a fake move, only affects and 3d was OK, rest boring and stupid...Also Penelope is sexy and the sword fight sequences were fun to watch but no logic... Whoever came up with a story like this is from another world and needs to understand reality. How can a man get stabbed and not get killed? How can a man simply pick up his sword and create magic like that? Also those mermaids were all wrong...I mean I have heard in other stories that mermaids (even though they don't actually exists) are peaceful and loving... In this movie they are shown as being evil which is completely ridiculous... Doesn't make any sense... Also the background score was repetitive and Johnny Depp has a lot of wrinkles on his face...He looks old...Plus Al Pacino needs to get a new job cuz he looks like a monkey..Overall I wouldn't recommend this film...Even the first film sucked because there is no such thing as pirates and no logic!

		<shortDescription>it would be unbearable without depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>to start I must say I give this film such a low rating to protest against the over topped ratings most people give this movie.true I've seen worse movies, much much worse even. but people are like this is the newest 'mind blowing must see or you'll die' movie ever. what a pile of bull crap. this is just another cheap Hollywood cliché movie. a random selection of action scene's, romantic scene's and comedy... the typical cocktail for big budget movies to lure as much people as possible. the only lights in this film are the kind of old English they speak, the costumes and Johnny depp, otherwise this movie would be unbearable. I'm a depp fan for many years, and i must say he's very entertaining, his performance is nice, but his best ever......????????? éh no. but all this rare positive things doesn't make up the lame cliché things. so for me this movie is waaaaaaayyyy overrated. entertaining if you are an teenager of a child. for an adult maybe nice to see once if you just want brainless entertainment , and forget about it afterwords.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sad indictment of modern mainstream cinema when Pirates of the Caribbean becomes a smash hit. Now that's not to say it's a terrible film ? it's entirely watchable. No, it's just that it's so mediocre.What hurts the film most is the casting of its hero and heroine. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just incredibly bland. They're two actors who although not entirely incompetent (thus denying us the opportunity to laugh our arses off as we point and jeer at the screen) have no serious acting chops. But worse than that they have no charisma. There's no charm, no allure and no sex appeal. I mean, sure Knighley is easy on the eye and I'm sure girls cream themselves silly at Bloom's squinty little eyes and paedophile moustache, but they're almost entirely lifeless ? there's nothing going on behind the eyes. And Knightley's presence is made even more unwelcome by the fact that she plays a prissy, self-righteous, wholesome bore who squeals all her dialogue at a decibel level so great it explodes eardrums. Seriously, Will Turner deserves her. He can look forward to a lifetime of high-pitched nagging and refusal of sex.But Knightley's worst moment (and the film's worst moment) is when she hits a pirate while uttering the following line, "You like pain? Try wearing a corset." You know, because men don't know pain. And because wearing a corset is far worse than having your arm lopped off with a sword; or having a leg blown to kingdom come from canon fire; or having a sweaty, leering, corpulent, well-endowed seadog make you his rear admiral with all the supplies of lubricant run dry. And that cheesy line is made even worse because it's spoken by a woman so weedy, so skinny, so under-nourished that it's debatable that she could pick up the plank she hits the pirate with without regurgitating in exhaustion the kiddie-sized bowl of muesli she gorged on for dinner. Yeah, she's an empowered woman. She's pretty, she can kick ass and she's got a waist thinner than a tube of Pringles. (The politically correct 'empowering' of women also extends to one of the ships being captained by a black woman. I know it's just a kid's film and the mores of today are shoehorned into an earlier time, but couldn't the 'empowered' women actually resemble real women and not be bland model types who either squeal like anorexic harridans or screech a 'talk to the hand' brand of sass that's more suited to Jerry Springer?) But I shouldn't be too tough on Knightley. Bloom's equally culpable. Just take the way he scrunches his forehead and squints his eyes when he has to communicate thought; or when he makes a passionate speech that's about as rousing as a punch in the groin; or when he wetly communicates his love for Miss Swan. If Luke Skywalker is a limp piece of lettuce, Will Turner is a flaccid one-inch penis.And exacerbating the blandness is the casting of Jack Davenport. He's meant to be the pencil-necked Poindexter that does everything by the rules, but he plays his role too well. It's like watching an invisible man. His character is totally devoid of?anything.But if Bloom, Knightley and Davenport are the schmoly trinity, then Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Jonathan Pryce, Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are the quintet that makes the film worth watching (I also like the two dumb soldiers). Enough people have expounded the joys of Depp's Keith Richards-inspired performance, but Rush actually makes me laugh more anyway. There's a fantastic bit during a swordfight where he walks along shouting "Aaaaarrrr!" And he also does the same thing while chasing Knightley. It's a clichéd pirate played with absolute glee. And Pryce is great, too. Admittedly he doesn't get to do much, but he makes up for everything in a moment near the end. After the British defeat the pirates he emerges from the room he's locked himself in and he proceeds to finger wag and shadow box the marauders. It just shows what a good actor is capable of; how an actor with wit and personality can make a small moment memorable.But contrary to popular opinion, the film actually belongs to the duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as a pair of knuckleheaded pirates. Every time they're on the screen the film is suddenly about a million times more fun. And I like the way the two are portrayed as something of a married couple. They finish each other's sentences and get on each other's nerves. And I also like the way the film wryly questions their sexuality. Take the scene where they have to dress up as women as they act as a decoy in a rowing boat. Crook tells his pal that he looks nice and a scuffle ensues. Funny stuff.Unfortunately, though, while some of the interplay between the supporting characters is fun to watch, the action is rather uninspired. And it's not helped by the fact that all the pirates (and Johnny Depp) are immortal. Therefore you have to endure swordfights that have zero tension because there's absolutely nothing at stake. And action seems to take up the entire final third of the film. As a consequence it becomes something of a snoozer. But fortunately the photography and production design is first rate. So at least you get something nice to look at while swords clatter ad nauseam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not really all that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot help but think that this film could have been much better in more capable hands. As others have noted, it runs way too long. Roger Ebert rather astutely observed that somewhere in this 143 minute movie could be a decent 90 minute movie; perhaps he is correct, though we might never know. Gore Verbinski should re-edit this movie for a director's cut and leave out about forty-five minutes; perhaps that would help resolve at least some of its shortcomings. The acting is nothing special, which is to be expected given the way the film plays like a combination of a slapstick comedy and a children's movie. Johnny Depp is a very good, serious actor, as evidenced in "Blow," "Ed Wood," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," "Finding Neverland," etc., though I didn't really like his performance in this film. He does much as much can be expected to develop his character, though I cannot help but wonder if he (along with the rest of the cast) considered this from the onset as simply a paycheck because it appears many of the actors didn't take it seriously and merely phoned in their performances. It doesn't help that they didn't have much with which to work, either. I'm not certain why the principle leads would sign on for two more entries to this series, though money would again be the prime suspect. Action-adventure movies can be fun and entertaining without being shallow and resorting to clichéd tactics as this movie does; the recent Harry Potter and Spider-man movies are good examples of movies that successfully combine entertainment and action with competent, intelligent scripting. Furthermore, it seems to me the makers of this movie could not decide what the target audience for this movie would be, and the result is that it appears to be intended for children, yet is entirely too long to retain their attention and contains entirely too much violence and too many gruesome effects for children. This seems to be a problematic trademark for Verbinski, whose "Mousehunt" (1997) seemed to be clearly intended for children, yet contained some decidedly adult humor. I cannot really recommend a movie that has me wishing it would end halfway through it, which this one did. That is not to say it is bad or that it is dull because it is undoubtedly ambitious and there are moments throughout the film, until the last frames, which show undeniable sparks of energy. Some of the scenes work well and the action is more than adequate. Also, we don't see very many pirate movies any more, so it does have that going for it, you know, which is nice. Ultimately, however, the film meanders about, loses focus and is simply not good enough to warrant a viewing. With two more movies on the way, perhaps there was enough material among this trilogy that would have warranted making 1.5 or even 2 movies from the first the one. I received the DVD as a present, watched it once and must say I am not in a hurry to sit through it again. (However, I might skip to the scenes with Keira Knightley, whose radiance is enough to lift any film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but not much of anything new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Elizabeth Swan is captured by the pirates of the Black Pearl. Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner go out to save her.As you can see, the storyline is nothing new. To add to that, Pirates of the Caribbean had no inspiration, except for a Disney ride, so you can't expect anything extraordinary. The movie, however, does offer some pirate sword-fighting, adventure, and funny lines to make up for that. However, the adventure isn't enough to hold the weights of a close-to-two-hour-experience. The movie is fun, but forgettable to some people, and drags on too much for more people. (like me)6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top 250! I don't think so..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this very clever movie. It's a fun ride and I really did appreciate Depp's unusual character.That said, this is no masterpiece. It is, rather, a very enjoyable and expertly done piece of fluff and a rather long advert for Disneyland. It's basically a lovingly rendered rehash of all the well-known clichés of 80 years of swashbuckler films with a bit of "Sinbad the Sailor" thrown in. This is like Ray Harryhausen (all hail!) would have done had he CGI tools at his disposal.Pirates of the Caribbean is fine entertainment and it's certainly a far better movie than the recent Star Wars efforts. But it's no masterpiece. It pales in the wake of classic swashbucklers like "Captain Blood" (Errol Flynn) or "Treasure Island" (the one with Jackie Cooper and the Disney one with Robert Newton), or even the recent "Master and Commander".Let's put POTC in the "fantasy" category. Within that context I would rate it much higher than within this TOP 250 FILMS category. It is a great fantasy film.As a "spoof" it's not in the same class as "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein" or "Love and Death", but it's very close and a job well done.Good film. Rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Roller Coaster Ride + Outstanding Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I also really enjoyed this movie a lot in 2003 when it was showing at the cinema and I also thought it was one of the best movies of this year. The strange thing is: I ve seen it again on DVD now and it - for some reason I can not explain - rather bored me. It has great actors, fantastic settings, but the story is not more than "okay" (it has some far-fetched useless halfhearted twists in it) and in the end one feels like having seen a teaser for Walt Disney parks ... and that s probably what the film actually is: a roller-coaster ride with some narrative lengths (it s far too long for a real exciting roller-coaster ride).Johnny Depp s acting is absolutely outstanding though (selfironical overacted, rather camp without being really gay). I also believe that Depp himself would not say that it s one of the best movies he played in (hopefully not), but probably one of the best payed jobs he s done (hopefully). Without Depp the movie would probably be quite boring and "cheap" (in the meaning of "cheap tricks"), with Depp it s at least well entertaining and particularly quite funny.At last: this is definitely not a movie one has to see twice. While other movies develop a higher quality after being watched for the second, third,... time this movie loses a lot of quality when seen for the second time.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Johnny Depp walks away with the movie or playfully struts away, to be more exact. He will get you through the first few viewings. Once Depp recedes, temporarily, into the background, you see the work of the good script by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot(Aladdin, Shrek). The script gives us not one, but two pairs of bickering buffoons, a ghost story, a little romance, a little adventure, a lot of comedy, and a pirate treasure hunt. It is unpredictable. This movie might have failed without it's superbly game cast. Geoffrey Rush has almost as much fun as Depp with several good lines. Jack Davenport nails the deadpan British style of humor perfectly and is contrasted nicely by the foppish Pryce. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are not given much to do, but they make the most of their parts. Kevin McNally makes a fine salty dog. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook steal every scene they are in as a couple of silly pirate Abbott and Costello types with Agnes Burnett and Giles New as their lesser soldier counterparts. The real success of this movie is how it takes the old and makes it feel new again.(monkey brings medallion to Barbossa with Jack on it's tail)Barbossa: "Why thank ye, Jack." Jack: "No problem." Barbossa: "Oh, not you, we named the monkey Jack."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of movies about pirates since I was a kid.This is one genre that has been ignored for a long time.So when "Pirates Of The Caribbean" hit theaters,I was one of the first in the queue.Recently I managed to get the DVD and I found the movie even better ,now that I have seen it at home.This is definitely one of the best pirate movies ever made.Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow,who is on a quest to recover his ship Black Pearl that has been taken over by his crew by an act of mutiny.The horrible secret is that his entire crew,led by his rebellious first mate Barbosa(played by the magnificent Geoffrey Rush) has been turned into the undead-neither dead nor alive,because they all laid hands on the great conqueror Cortez' gold,stashed away in a secluded island.They can only transform themselves back into the living if they return every piece of the treasure they stole.By chance,the last piece they need is around the neck of the lovely governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann,played by the ravishing Keira Knightley.The plot becomes more complicated when it is discovered that Orlando Bloom,who plays the son of Depp's old partner,Will Turner,is needed to reverse the effects of the curse.Director Gore Verbinski does a great job,keeping the plot together,while providing the movie with both the old-world feel and the state-of-the-art special effects that make this film a feast for the eyes.Johnny Depp is absolutely incredible as Jack Sparrow-positively one of the best pirates I have seen on-screen.His portrayal of the callous,fearless pirate will surely be remembered for a long time.Keira Knightley has come a long way from her " Bend It Like Beckham "Days.This is one feisty,breathtaking actress who will surely go a long way !Orlando Bloom is good as the young man of honor,not ready to accept the help of a pirate,but ending up being one.The sword-fighting scenes are extremely well choreographed,and the one between Depp and Bloom at the beginning of the film is easily the best.The ILM guys rarely disappoint,and the "undead" effects are spine-chillingly convincing.Geoffrey Rush is his usual self,and that means brilliant.The sea atmosphere is superb-after all,the film was shot on location in the Grenadines and the Caribbean.This is a classic movie,and yes , I cannot help but observe that Johnny Depp deserved the Oscar for his performance.It is he who makes the film work.Work like magic.THIS IS GREAT !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean was a good movie with three story lines blended into one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was a good movie with three story lines blended into one. There was the love story between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, Jack Sparrow's story of revenge towards his former first mate, and the Black Pearl's crew's story of wanting to be free of the curse.The actors all did a wonderful job, Johnny Depp at Jack Sparrow was superb. Geoffrey Rush as the not alive but not dead Captian Barbosa was excellent. Watch his eyes in the scene where he is watching Elizabeth eat. You can see the through his eyes alone how he covets the fact that she can eat and enjoy food and he can't.Johnny Depp is always excellent in his films, and he does not disappoint in this film.There are many links throughout the film, for instance, the two captains are linked from their entrances. Jack Sparrow is first seen from behind sailing into Port Royal on his boat, then the camera shows him from the front. Captian Barbosa is first seen from behind on his boat, then we see him from the front.There are two comical Royal Navy sailors who are never apart, one short and stout with dark hair, and one skinny with blonde hair. There are two comical pirates on the Black Pearl who are never apart, one short and stout with dark hair, and one skinny with blonde hair. This sends a message that sailors are not much different whether they be legit or pirates.When they open the window in Elizabeth's room, you see a peak outside. Remember that peak, it will show up in other parts of the film.It's interesting that three skeletons of pirates are hanging on the way to Port Royal, the first skeleton pirates that Jack sees. Now that's what you call premonition.I certainly hope that everyone stayed past the credits to see the last scene from the film where the monkey takes one piece of gold out of the chest, thus putting the curse back on again.The music is mesmerizing and each section is fitting. When jack sees the dead pirates, the music changes from a rousing pirate theme to a somber theme with a male chorus humming, much more reverent. I bet a lot of people didn't catch that.It's true that this film takes some attention span, those lacking that will not like it. It also requires a good grasp on vocabulary, as there are many words and phrases that some people have probably never heard.Of course, I'm sure we all remember who Cortez was and what he did.Anyway, there is more, but that is all I will write now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently rented Pirates of the Caribbean, and it was a great show. The best thing about this movie is that it was very entertaining, and it is easily the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time. This film has it all - humor, romance, thrills, action, mystery, and suspense. I wish I had seen it in the theater, but the DVD was great anyway.As far as the plot, I honestly wasn't really expecting anything too detailed or deep. After all, this is a Disney film, and one based on a ride at a theme park. However, there are several unexpected plot twists and turns, and it's hard to know which people you're actually rooting for in the film. The characters are interesting and they do some unexpected things from time to time. The plot was much more interesting and enjoyable than I imagined it would be.One thing that really impressed me was the CGI. I'm not a big fan of computer-generated graphics, and especially when they're inserted into live action films alongside human actors. But this was very well done - as well-done as any film I've seen.Finally, a comment about where this movie ranks. Don't get me wrong - this is a very entertaining show, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I rate this film pretty high on my own list, but I'm surprised to see it on the IMDb Top 250 films of all time. It's a great show, but I don't think it deserves a spot among the top 250 films of all time. Nothing against this film, but I would think there would be at least 250 films made since 1940 that would be better than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski directed this film. The writing credits are Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, Jay Wolpert (screen story) and Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio (screen play). It was made in 2003. The stars are Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush and Keiora Knightley. It is an adventure, comedy, fantasy and action film. It is an English language film and the film is set in the USA. Captain Jack Sparrow tries to save a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, from fellow pirates. He hopes that it will give him the opportunity to regain the ship that was stolen from him. We like this film because it has a lot of types of story in the film and a single act of drawing is very nice. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 will come in 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Straightforward Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I really mean it! I have absolutely no idea how this pirate movie manages to enter the IMDb's Top 250 Movie List, but I guess most of you viewers love The Curse of the Black Pearl for some good reasons. However, I don't find it entirely revolutionizing in any sense. First of all, the plot's simply too straightforward in my taste (the script is pretty cheesy and tiring as well) and like any typical Hollywood movies, expect lots of the same old swashbuckling stuff and highlighted special effects without being mesmerized by its overall b-movie context. Aside of these criticisms, Johnny Depp is brilliant as the goofy Jack Sparrow but the rest of the cast is just plain OK. The Curse of the Black Pearl seems to be a no-brainer and doesn't hold my interest any longer now. If you want a quality pirate (or ship) movie, I highly recommend you to watch 'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' instead. It's far better than this dire action movie, for my sake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That rare bird, a decent modern pirate movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirate movies have fallen on hard times as of late. There hasn't been a decent one since the mid-fifties. Attempts to revive the genre have generated a series of expensive flops like Cutthroat Island and Roman Polanski's Pirates. Despite the dismal track every ten years or so there is yet another attempt to get it right. With the latest, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl persistence is rewarded. Though not on a level with Captain Blood or The Crimson Pirate, Curse is still is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that successfully combines modern action with a traditional sea saga.The Black Pearl is a ship with a cursed crew doomed to an undead existence until they return all the Aztec gold they unwisely pilfered. After years of ghostly plundering they manage to gather all save for the one piece currently in the possession of the beautiful Elizabeth, the Royal Governor's daughter. Can her true love, the pirate hating blacksmith Will, keep her safe from the crew's boney clutches? Or does she need the help of the completely loony Captain Jack Sparrow?Sparrow is a hilarious addition to the Hollywood Pirate tradition. He is a seadog sure to strike terror into the hearts of the fiercest scallywag though not because of his dazzling swordplay. Johnny Depp plays Sparrow as if he has downed one too many grogs on the way to the gay pride parade. He flounces, weaves and mumbles his way about the Caribbean absolutely sure that he is the very model of a modern pirate captain. That his adversaries aren't as sure of his seafaring abilities as he is doesn't register in his hazy worldview. Depp's Belle of the Poop Deck routine works fabulously. He gives the movie a pixilated charm but if it's an old fashioned shiver-me-timbers pirate you want there is Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Rush `arrhs' it up for all he's worth and even makes you feel a little sorry for the murderous old sea dog. As Depp and Rush keep the glorious tradition of ham acting alive others in the cast are left struggling to keep up. While Orlando Bloom seems stogy as Will the insanely beautiful Keira Knightley is in no danger of being overshadowed. Her Elizabeth comes across as the most competent character in the movie. You get the feeling she could have sorted the plot out quicker without the blundering help of Sparrow and Will. The rest of the cast is filled with a great assortment of character actors who fill out their colorful parts nicely. In fact, it's safe to say it's the performers who make this movie despite the extensive special effects on display.Curse suffers from the usual modern summer blockbuster problems what with frenzied editing, sloppy plotting and a leaden approach to comic timing. Complicating matters is an out of control sound design. Background creaks, booms and clangs are blasted out of proportion and every footfall thumps like a brontosaurus tread. All this drowns out the actors so potentially funny lines are lost. Art direction is also problematic. For example, the skeletal crew is so stuffed with detail that between the quick cuts and frenzied pace they come across as a perambulating blob. A further drawback is the cinematography. For some reason the normally sunny Caribbean looks as bleak and cold as the North Atlantic. While all this is annoying it shouldn't stop you from seeing Curse. It's a charming movie filled with the sort of enjoyably preposterous performances you rarely see nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's all the praise over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was OK, but not what I call great. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. Johnny Depp is good and has to be since his character carries the film. But, I was expecting to get a lot more laughs out of him, and I didn't. The plot was OK, but not what I call original. Of course, the special effects with the skeleton pirates were great. That must have been a huge part of the budget. I guess since the horrible Mummy 2 and Tomb Raider movies, audiences went crazy over this adventure type of film because it didn't suck like so many recent summer flicks.Also, Rush made a good villian. But, I don't think Bloom or Knightly were outstanding. Anyone could have done those roles. I see they are already planning a sequel. Considering how paper thin the plot was for this one, the sequel will likly be bad like Mummy 2, but make a lot of money.FINAL VERDICT: If you are into the adventure movies, then this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's the script, stupid...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to circumstances beyond my control, I have watched this film three times in the past six months. To be frank, it's taken me that many viewings to get to grips with the plot, and to appreciate that the main star is not in fact Johnny Depp - who seems, albeit understandably, to have emerged as the new Valentino - but the scriptwriter. Those wonderful understated supporting performances, notably by the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of the British navy, were enabled - as was the virtuoso and richly-imagined representation of Jack Sparrow - by their witty and precisely crafted speech. And as for Depp, are we all absolutely sure it isn't his character we've fallen in love with? After all, I don't remember anyone saying that Edward Scissorhands was the sexiest man in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a particularly brilliant movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. I'd wanted to see it since I'd heard about it, it got glowing reviews from friends of mine, and it really stands as a mediocre piece of cinematography. Depp just changes from ship to ship, and any eye-popping special effects are detracted from by fog, silly lighting, and Disney.The story, what little there is, is amusing, but I always felt this little element of wrongness, as if at any moment the main villain would be unmasked and say "I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those damn kids!"I was amazed that I stayed awake the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love pirates but I thought this was a pretty disappointing movie. Sure, Depp was great--he usually is. His lines were some of the best in the film. I did enjoy the boats and sets a lot. However, I did not like Orlando Bloom and found him dull and irritating. Keira Knightley was clearly just chosen as a pretty face, since she wasn't too exciting, either. It's a shame to see someone as talented as Depp paired up with two such inadequate actors. The film itself was long and without real substance. I did enjoy the "cameos" from specific parts of the WDW ride, though. Oh well. I'd watch it again, but probably with the sound off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B Adventure surrounds excellent performance by Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellently made movie except for the script. There is one pleasurable twist, but that is not enough to carry the already predictable plot. Also, there are many lines which detract from the adventure and make it almost as much a comedy. That's fine if done in moderation (in my opinion), but this is done to excess and makes the movie appear more as a kid's adventure flick than an attempt at making a story.This movie is only worth watching to see Depp's performance. Johnny Depp is superb as Capt. Jack Sparrow - utterly convincing. Yet the rest of the cast seems contrived and fail to carry any weight. They act as if this is a "made for TV movie." It could be the directing, but then how would one explain the same directing that Depp received?The mechanical special effects were ok (6/10), while the rest: production, lighting, photography were excellent(9/10) and the computer graphics were superb (10/10). They brought something new to computer graphics - well articulated skeletons as well as the immediate switching between body and bones in different light. Overall, in my opinion, the movie earned a 7/10.-ZafoidPS: A slight node to political correctness occurs in a few scenes thus downgrading the already flawed movie. Definitely see it for Depp.-Z</fullReview>

But somehow, they did it...a thoroughly entertaining film with a surprisingly funny script and great over-the-top performances by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush swashin' and bucklin' their way through this send-up of the Errol Flynn genre...Maybe a little CGI-heavy, but Walt would have loved it...And as for 17-year old Keira Knightley, her pirate ship has most assuredly come in...Some fun DVD extras (short history of piracy---the original Disney ride history)...Extravagant costumes, sets and make-up but the performances don't get buried, and that's as much as you can ask for in this type of film...My only fear is that if this catches on ("Haunted Mansion", etc.), they'll be making a movie about the concession stands at the park before too long..."AAAAARGGGHHHHH MATEY!!!!", indeed!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many things could have gone wrong with this film. (And to hear tale from some of the commentary, many did). I mean c'mon...four writers create a script based upon a theme park ride? This could have all the charm of a film based on a video game like such classics as "Super Mario Brothers" and "Street Fighter."Now to be fair I haven't seen either of those nor ever will, but neither had Johnny Depp at the helm. Much has been made about his swishbuckling here, but I dare anyone to see this and not keep his/her eye on the Sparrow. In the commentary, he and director Gore Verbinski talked about some of Depp's original ideas for the character...including a prosthetic nose. Hmmm, maybe that's where the Keith Richards' idea originated? To see the best use of a faux nose so far, see Vincent D'Onofrio in the excellent "Salton Sea."But back to these high seas, high crime and high entertainment. Look the ride itself had to be made suitably accommodating to put a lot of different butts in seats, and so was this film. But think of all the other action/adventure blockbusters that simply went bust.I recently saw "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" which despite Alan Moore's impetus wound up extremely ordinary. And we had to elect Schwarzenegger as governor just to prevent him from making any more films after "The Rise of the Machines."So for the people who complain about the plot, to make such a popcorn movie, you have to traffic in larger-than-life myths that *need* to be familiar. Lover's need to be separated, one must promise her love to another to redeem her true love. Toss in an absent father (Bootstrap is about as dead as Luke Skywalker's dad was.) Allow there to be a chase and make sure the original chase is after the wrong goal or gal or gal's blood...and your on your way.So the key here, like the ride itself is not in revolutionary twists along the way but an attention to detail as we are moved along. The pirates' code and parley, splendid spectral special effects, the tie-ins to scenes from the ride. Little bits of the dialog..."Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt"..."Welcome to the Caribbean, love"..."Impersonating a cleric of the Church of England..."I want you to know that I was rooting for you mate"..."Cotton, he says you missed a spot." (As spoken by a mute man's parrot and translated by the first mate.)This film is more than clever enough, and looks gorgeous, even on the small screen...though I and you imagined reader should have seen this on the big screen. The use of CGI was less "siege" and more "see." Verbinski largely forsook his first name and avoided egregious amounts of gore.Yes it's as inflated as a Macy's Parade balloon, but its the smaller things that keep this afloat. I'll give it one stars for each of the seas, and hope we don't get half as many sequels...7/10By the way, the DVD I got from NetFlix was only IBM PC compatible for the bonus features. Not only Captain Barbossa is a fan of Apples, raise the flag for a MacIntosh Mutiny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp's withering pirate parody is probably the only reason to watch this swashbuckler update, but he's been better elsewhere and his performance is typical of the film's major problem, namely the slurred, mumbling accents that most of the cast has adopted. It makes for difficult viewing: the needlessly complicated plot is hampered by an inability to understand much of what is going on (although the basic outline is elemental to anyone who's ever seen a film of the genre); you have to strain to hear explanations for the more mystical aspects of the story. It's a very generic piece of work; the director, Gore Verbinski, doesn't seem to have the ability to create any real tension or action sequences that arouse much excitement and consistently allows the set pieces to be interrupted by long stretches of exposition (thanks to a wordy script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio that could have used a few decent jokes). Verbinski chooses to keep the focus on Depp and while Depp is always welcome whenever he's onscreen, he has trouble connecting with the rest of the cast, which, though it includes the incredibly hammy Geoffrey Rush, has nowhere near the acting bravura he has. The remainder of the cast includes Orlando Bloom (who fails to impress after `The Lord Of The Rings'), Jonathan Pryce and Keira Knightley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rather sad since this movie showed a LOT of potential in its beginning, yet soon enough it became yet another kitschy Disney movie.First the good: The performance of Depp was wonderful, even if a tiny bit too ecstatic. The visuals and the sounds were, as you can expect from Disney, amazing as well and reminded me of LOTR visuals somewhat. Also, surprisingly, the movie has also quite a sophisticated story.{ MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS BELOW }Very quickly, though, the movie dropped very low. The scenes became repetitive and dull. I grew tired of all these sword slashings, first with men, then with shields. In fact, there is just TOO MUCH fighting in this movie. It isn't the stunning fighting of Matrix/LOTR though where you grew more excited every minute, it is more like the regular Disney fighting of, "Aww he dropped the barrel and it dropped on the skeleton, ain't it funny folks?". All the fighting scenes are FULL with Disney cliches like this one.{ REAL SPOILERS NOW }In fact, ALL the movie grows to be more and more one big cliche as it spins towards its grand finale cliche end. Starting from the silly sentences (BadGuy: "Say good-bye!", barrel falls on him, GoodGuy: "Good-bye!"), continuing with even sillier sentences that I could guess ten seconds before the actors said them and ending with the super sticky, happy "and they lived happily ever after" end. I hoped they will broke SOME of the sweetness by letting SOMEONE die but apparently they decided to be the STEREOTYPE of cliche Disney movies.Oh well, another 2 hours bit the dust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A BRIEF SUMMARY: Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of the new island governor, is traveling by ship with her father to their new home. The come upon a ship, ransacked and burned by pirates. Suddenly, Elizabeth spots an unconscious boy, Will Turner, in the water. When Will is brought onto the ship and laid upon the deck, Elizabeth spots a gold medallion around his neck. Fearing the authorities will arrest the boy as a pirate, Elizabeth steals the medallion. Years later, when Will and Elizabeth grow up, they share an adventure involving the medallion, an unearthly pirate crew and `the curse of the Black Pearl'. `All opinions are vanity ?' including my own. Well, I guess I better prepare myself to be clobbered once again for trashing a movie `everybody loves'. `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' is most illogical movie I've seen since `Lost in Space'. `Lost in Space' at least had three shapely women in body-hugging space suits. PCCBP has Johnny Depp. Johnny has turned in some really good performances (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Ed Wood,' `Sleepy Hollow,' and, especially, `Don Juan DeMarco') but his loose, effete `Jack Sparrow' is more `Captain Morgan' than Captain Kidd. That is, the rum is doing most of the acting. WARNING: SPOILERS Well, let's see, all the crew of the Black Pearl except Jack Sparrow, BUT INCLUDING WILL'S FATHER, have been cursed for stealing Aztec gold. As part of their curse, food turns to ashes; and, while they cannot die, in the moonlight they are clearly rotting corpses. HELLO! If they cannot die, HOW COULD THEY KILL WILL'S FATHER? If they are really rotten corpses, WHY DIDN'T THEY DIE AS SOON AS THE CURSE WAS LIFTED? I can understand why Will wasn't cursed, BUT WHY WASN'T ELIZABETH? Oh, because she did it to save Will, THEN WHY WAS JACK SPARROW CURSED? Oh, because he was Captain of the Black Pearl; DO YOU REALLY THINK A CURSE WOULD BE SO SELECTIVE? I can understand why the Black Pearl crew became rotting corpses when they were cursed. They spent a period of time suffering from starvation and thirst, but WHY DID JACK IMMEDIATELY BECOME A ROTTING CORPSE? Oh yes, I've heard, `Forget the logic and enjoy the fun.' How much fun is there in an adventure movie where the only mortals you care about are so central to the plot you KNOW they cannot be killed? I enjoyed the production values, the music and the performances, but I never forgot this is a BAD pirate movie. If you really want to have fun watching a good pirate movie, see `The Crimson Pirate' or `Swashbuckler.' If you insist on seeing a bad pirate movie, see `Cutthroat Island'. At least it makes sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the good parts. The film is entertaining with some good pirate action sequences and Johnny Depp does a fabulous job. For a Hollywood pirate action film it isn't too shabby at all.But...that being said there is very little extraordinary about it. Instead it is simply average. The skeleton crew is not very menacing at all - so why did they have to be skeletons? The movie would have worked better with another 'plot' without the curse and just focusing on actual human pirates.The plot is predictable and full of holes. The film could've ended LONG before it did. Most all the roles were cardboard cut outs. There is the handsome hero that is willing to stick his neck out for the girl especially because he isn't encumbered by any societal status. There is the rich suitor that is stuck up and walks so straight and narrowly that he is more robotic than human and thus obviously not the man for the heroine. And finally the heroine that despite living in the past is somehow endowed with all sorts of concepts of the independent modern woman. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adventure for everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film that was created from Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean amusement at Disney World in Florida.Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a humorous, egotistical, unpredictable pirate, who is attempting to catch the ?Black Pearl' ? a pirate ship `with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that hell itself spat him back out'. After saving the Governor's daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) from drowning, Sparrow is arrested as a pirate and taken to jail where he awaits the gallows. In search of lost Cortez gold, the Black Pearl and a motley crew of pirates (led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)) raid the town and kidnap Elizabeth. The blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), in love with Elizabeth springs Sparrow from jail in return for his help in tracking down the Black Pearl and saving Elizabeth.Depp's own quirkiness brings Captain Jack Sparrow to life, continuing his tradition of portraying rather unusual roles. Bloom and Knightly play their roles wonderfully, while Rush, so versatile in his character portrayal, presents himself as an enjoyable ?bad guy' to watch. Pirates of the Caribbean ? Curse of the black pearl was filmed on location around St. Vincent and the Grenadines, providing a spectacular backdrop of crystal clear blue waters and picturesque islands. The special effects were created by Industrial Light &amp; Magic and as usual, blend into the live-action seamlessly. Merge all of this together with the wonderful musical score by Hans Zimmer (who created the music for Gladiator and numerous other films) and you have a really enjoyable experience.Obviously you can't have a film about cursed pirates without a little horror, and although most violence is implied and not shown in this film, this is the first Disney film ever, to be rated PG-13 in the United States, and M in Australia. This film is definitely a fun, adventurous family film, but some children under fourteen may find the occasional scene within this film disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003)THE GOOD:--The action sequences are fabulous and the movie is jam-packed with them. In particular the sword-fight between Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom is very cool, as is the final big fight with all the CGI pirate skeletons facing off against the humans.--Gore Verbinski pulls some great performances out of his very talented cast. The stand out is, of course, the phenomenal Johnny Depp. His performance as Jack Sparrow is oozing with charisma and presence, Depp is just a joy to watch as usual. Geoffrey Rush is very convincing as the man who was rumoured to be so evil that he was "spit out of hell itself". Orlando Bloom is a charming, doe-eyed performer and given more to do than he was in the Lord of the Rings movies. Keira Knightley is babelicious to say the least and also a very good actress (seen also in "Bend it Like Beckham").--The CGI in this film is unforgettable, certainly some of the best work of 2003. The pirates were extremely convincing and looked awesome, I loved the way the movie darted from CGI to real and so on. The big action sequences were filmed with finesse and their effects were also great.--This is a film for virtually everybody. It is popular worldwide among all ages, and ended up for me being the biggest surprise of 2003 (be honest, who expected this film to be as great as it is?). Why is it that it was so popular? Because there is something for everybody here. You've got all the action and adventure on the high seas, a sweet, believable romance, lots of great physical comedy and some good suspense drama thrown in there for good measure. I loved how the film managed to mix all this in without ever losing sight of the plot and where the story is going.--This fun film is based on an adventure park ride, and I thought that director Verbinski and his team do a great job of giving the film the feeling of a ride come to life. A lot of the time I felt like I was in the movie as it was so energetic and involving - especially the scene where Keira Knightley is thrown from dead pirate to dead pirate in our first encounter with the not-so-human baddies.--I loved the score to the movie, it gave a very old-fashioned feeling to the piece and it fits well because "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is an old-styles movie, a throwback to the great, classic swashbucklers of past ages.THE BAD:--The only place the movie cops out a bit is in the way it can be a bit Disney-ish. I hated the unfunny eye-losing pirate, and some of the other pirates were a bit too cliché and supposed to be comic relief when they were really just annoying background characters. I would've also appreciated a bit more gore and on-screen blood and killing, which is probably asking to breach the PG-13 rating, God forbid.RATING:9/10 - Terrific, rip-roaring old school action/adventure that never gets old at 143 minutes and leaves you begging for a sequel.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Bend it Like Beckham (8/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (9/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (10/10) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (10/10) Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think I would like POTC when I went to see it but I couldn't have been more wrong! The movie was pure entertainment from start to finish filled with humor, action, and adventure. Once again Johnny Depp does what he does so well by getting lost in the character of the infamous Jack Sparrow. Depp is sensational, this is why he's the best actor out there right now. Newcomer Kiera Knightley was a pretty face and very good in POTC and Orlando Bloom fit the bill proving his talent past Legolas of LOTR. And of course, Geoffey Rush was just so fun to hate as the grimy and nasty Barbossa, a superb villain, the summer's best villain. Gore Verbinski is on his way with The Ring and POTC, even though he sadly looks not to come back for the 2005 sequel to POTC. This movie is great, forget Cold Mountain and everything else, this film is the best of 2003. The only film I could do this to this to this year. A perfect 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i was at the cinema waiting to see The Matrix Reloaded, a trailer appeared before me for a certain pirate movie. The first thing which went through my head was, oh God, please not another pirate movie, especially one made for the kids during the summer holidays. My fears were confirmed when the Disney logo appeared at the end of the trailer. There was no way in hell I was going to see this movie. Then, people started telling me about a certain guy called Johnny Depp. Now, I have never seen a movie with Johnny Depp in it, so I wasn`t really moved when people told me that he was the best thing in this movie. Anyway, lately a friend and I decided to rent the movie just to see what it was like. I watched it and I must say, it IS a Disney pirate movie made for the kids for summer. However, it is also a very entertaining movie, in parts. I can see why it has done very well at the box offices around the world and why people keep going back to see it. If you haven`t seen this movie, the fact that it is a Disney movie should not discourage you, and the fact that it has pirates in it, well, in all fairness it is one of the best pirate movies I have seen, well worth a try, you won`t be disappointed.</fullReview>

He does his best to hold the movie together, but even his performance couldn't save it in my eyes. First off the special effects weren't all that spectacular. It was cool to see the people turn into skeletons when they passed in and out of the moon light, but when you had a chance to really look at them it was sort of cheesy.The biggest problem with this movie is that Disney couldn't decide whether this advertisement for one of their rides (marketing brilliance by the way, no matter how disgusting it is) should be for kids or adults. In the end, it didn't fit for anyone. It was too violent for little kids with scenes of people getting killed with swords and their throats slit by daggers. It was WAY too hokey for adults. Maybe it works for 13-year-olds that haven't seen the special effects in the Matrix or Lord of the Rings.My advice, don't get your hopes up based on what the majority is saying about this one.</fullReview>

All of the performances are very good, and it adds immeasurably to the quality of the film. The production is also very well done, right up to the great visual effects. However, one let down was the music, which features a pounding quality heard in many Bruckheimer action films.The characters are brought to life with the skill of the "Indiana Jones" or "Harry Potter" movies, yet somehow the overall film seems to be just a few notches of "The Mummy" and "Tomb Raider" movies. Unlike the latter movies, however, it seems a sequel or two could really help lift "Pirates" out of that same category and into the heights reached by "Indiana Jones".The verdict: about as good of a summer blockbuster as could be hoped for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Swashbuckling Bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the first forty-five minutes were very cleverly written, and Johnny Depp is inarguably a scene-stealer in this film. But the cumbersome plot turns absurd, and as soon as all the characters' energies onscreen are diverted toward the task of lifting an ancient curse (culminating in a set of dreary sea battles and chases), I lost interest. Honestly, Depp is probably what made the last half of this overly long film bearable for me.I am disappointed that Disney released such a violent movie in such kid-friendly packaging. There are a lot of callous murders of innocent townspeople here. And to put so much work into producing a film that glamorizes pirates--a word that has little meaning outside of rape, murder, robbery, and destruction--is a questionable endeavor. Think twice before you let your kids watch this one, unless they're already desensitized little bloodlusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B+/A-... Savvy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, that girl, and that guy, and a monkey.Now, before beginning this review, I'd like to point out that this is a Disney movie - yes, the same people who brought us Finding Nemo and Pocahontas. Indeed. So I figured it could go either way, but would probably get bad reviews and bomb at the box office. Imagine my surprise then, when I arrived at the movie theatre and the movie was sold out for the 6:25 show. Who goes to see a movie on a Wednesday night?? So I bought my ticket for the 6:55 show and sat in the theatre for forever, waiting excitedly for the film to begin. Johnny Depp is hot. Seriously. Big hottie. Especially when you add eye makeup, cool hair, a good outfit, an excellent accent and a cool hat. Plus, he was crazy. As evident in Fear and Loathing, he plays crazy pretty well. The CGI in the film was very good as well - people turning into skeletons and all. Well done. I'm not an Orlando Bloom fan really, seeing as I didn't see either of the Lord of the Rings. So I didn't know what to expect from him, but luckily his role was monstrously overshadowed by Depp. The chick in this movie, whatever her name is, wasn't as good. Her accent needed a little work, she made horrible facial expressions, and it seems as though she got all the crappy lines. The plot was classic Disney - one twist towards the end that would shock the hell out of little kids, and they spelled out the entire plot for you as it happens. Sometimes that's good, when.. say.. you're too busy drooling over Johnny Depp to pay attention.. but still. You have to take that with a grain of salt (why isn't it pepper?) because it's Disney. Okay. So overall I'd give the movie.. well.. a B+/A-.. it wasn't amazing, but it *was* hilarious, and there were good fight scenes and good cgi and it wasn't boring, and very very good Johnny Depp. I think it's one of my favorite movies for him (of course, I haven't seen him in many movies I actually like - he favors scripts that make me drowsy just hearing the titles), so that's my final answer. B+/A-. Savvy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the dvd of this movie and unfortunately it left me feeling it was not as good as I had hoped.The film is a bit too long and for periods nothing really seems to happen. At least 30 minutes could have been trimmed to make it a tighter, more thrilling event.Depp is the star of the show, playing Captain Sparrow with aplomb, and is well supported by Bloom, Rush and Keira Knightley, looking very dishy and a future star in the making.The effects were excellent, and the fight scene at the end where the cursed pirates pass in and out of moonlight(and passing from skeleton to full person)is extremely good.It just left me feeling it could have been done a bit better, perhaps with a stronger storyline. Still, I seem to be in the minority, as the film has made a mint and a second installment is on the way next year.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp looks good, but he always looks good. He alone makes the movie, and that's not lasting for the movie, only lasting for Depp. This is a tragic disappointment to those who love pirates. It follows the recent trends of dark ghost stories stylistic eye candy, but underneath it's empty. Someone said to me that it's going to be a classic, only because pirate stories tend to be. Some people can't see the forest for the trees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once in a while, a Hollywood film wins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake; this is a true Hollywood movie, through and through. But it's an entertaining one, to be sure. I was skeptical of its integrity when I learned it was "based" on the Disneyland ride, let alone a Disney film. But again, it does entertain from start to finish and despite moments of cheesy humor, it's serious enough to satisfy those seeking a more "real" approach. For the most part, it's historically correct. Thankfully, they used fictitious characters instead of tarnishing the reputations of true high sea swashbucklers such as Ed Teach (Blackbeard) and John Rackham (Calico Jack).Depp pulls off a convincing character in Jack Sparrow, especially when you think he based the character on Keith Richards (mannerisms, hair and all). Rush also shines as Barbossa, while Bloom and Knightley fulfill their roles fittingly, though their performances are hardly outstanding. This has more to do with the script than their abilities. The cinematography and CG effects are outstanding and very convincing.Another thing this film does pull off well is character development. They successfully illustrate 8-10 mainstay characters (lead and supporting) without bogging the story down or leaving things incomplete. This is quite rare in a film and I was pleased at how well it was pulled off.All in all, if you haven't seen this film, do so. Though you may not be blown away, you should at least be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief showings of skeletal appendages remain the only attribute which make this movie worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!!! The film talents of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush,Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, and Jonathan Pryce combine with a script and some cameras to form a film with very little else besides brief showings of skeletal appendages to recommend it.The film opens onto an 18th century British Naval Outpost in the Caribbean--named with a singular lack of originality Port Royal. Quickly we are introduced to a diverse set of characters: Governor Weatherby Swann, British official in control of the island. His adopted son of sorts, Commander Norrington, whose entire demeanor rejects such a proposal. Swann's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth, who is not only the apple of her father's eye but also that of the icy British Commander. Traveling down a class, young William Turner, an aspiring blacksmith whose lowly sights have been set on Elizabeth since the day of their acquaintance near a pirate ship 10 years earlier (represented in the first scene of the film) but who seems unable to find the words to express his devotion, despite the more than ample encouragement from the lady Elizabeth herself. And finally Captain Jack Sparrow--famed pirate just arrived in Port Royal on a wrecked ship, and whose profusion of jewelry and all other manner of piratical adornments take the conception of piratical "loot" to a whole other level.Beginning with his name, Governor Swann (played by Jonathan Pryce) represents that unending tradition so popular in movies of a perhaps powerful (though in the end impotent) and certainly rather foppish British official who is a sort of watered down antagonist--an obstacle to our heroes, but certainly a removable one. His adopted son of sorts, Commander Norrington (Jack Davenport) is a less foppish and more threatening counterpart to Swann whose militaristic bearing and morals at least earn him a chance at respect. Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the maverick in an otherwise snobbish world of British bureaucracy who nearly chokes wearing a corset and desires a blacksmith rather than an aristocrat to wed, and is in general a vague worry to her father--whose basic goal throughout everything is to get her married to good Commander N.-- and an upset to the Commander himself. Will Turner ( Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom), down a class, is the heart-struck yet tongue-tied young lover, who would, if only a simple way presented itself, take Elizabeth for his own. (A way, we are to assume, devoid of the obstacles Swann and Norrington and the general social expectations of 18th century England, results of near 1200 years bloodshed, treaties, and evolution.) If only a good pirate or scallywag or murderer would show up and threaten Elizabeth...well then Will would know what to do, and those three hours of fencing each day would be worth something. (Well, lucky Will...unlike the majority of cerebral fantasies this dream does come true!) And finally Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed in a semi inebriated, moderately perverted, and certainly deranged state by Johnny Depp who should probably be given a viewing in earlier films, perhaps Chocolat, before an assumption involving the quality of his on screen performances is made. Sparrow is the foil for Swann and particularly Norrington. His constant and ludicrously unshakeable irreverence is intended to make humor of the tight and pompous British, but, with the aid of Depp's spasmodic movements suggesting either foppishness or perversion only centers the viewer's attention on Sparrow's manic behavior and gives rise to a mild detachment from what one is viewing on screen. The main characters dispensed with in all their shallowness, the plot begins with a party at Port Royal, honoring Swann's adopted son of sorts. A scene between Elizabeth and her father which serves to convinces the viewer irreparably that there is absolutely no understanding between them, a scene with ardent lover Will, Captain Jack's arrival at port on a fast sinking vessel, the party, followed by Norrington's proposal of marriage to Elizabeth...who, apparently due to the overwhelming tightness of her corset, faints and tumbles from the ramparts she has conveniently positioned herself on, into the sea below.And then, heralded in by this dubious incident, the plot surges forward full force. An attack on Port Royal by pirates under the command of the evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush in a role which deserves fourth billing instead of second and was hopefully accepted for either the money or publicity), a kidnapping of Elizabeth by those afore mentioned--and then a stunning rescue by Master Will, guided by a slightly reluctant Jack Sparrow, which includes the illegal appropriation of the British Navy's prize ship in the region, and its navigation to a safe port by Will and Jack, where the search for Barbossa and crew will continue. (The manner in which the Navy's prize ship is attained is particularly ludicrous.)Added to the plot is the revelation that Barbossa and crew are actually ghosts of sorts, suspended between the world of death and living, and that this suspension takes its evidentiary form in the transformation of the pirates from flesh to bone. Which allows the sporadic metamorphoses referred to at the beginning of the review between skeletal and human expression--represented in the timely alterations of the pirates' appendages.With such a setting in mind, the plot moves forward for two more hours, and with a script formulated around constant comedy, and fight scenes which live up to about the level of Harry Potter in all their awe inspiring dimensions, the film is less than a satisfying one. At 153 minutes, a good 30 of which could have been removed from the screen entirely, one is in a semi lethargy by the final conclusion when, with the bad guys defeated, Jack escaped from the law of the British navy, Elizabeth safely returned and without challenge or doubt her love to Master Will bright as ever, and Swann resigned to his daughter's fate as a blacksmith's wife and Norrington to his as a bachelor...love triumphs. (At which point one calls desperately for the realism of movies like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, but then with metamorphosing appendages what can be real?)And so we are to assume Elizabeth lives out her life happily as a blacksmith's wife, no longer with a constant supply of income or any real claims to class distinction. However, the movie does not encourage this train of thought, evident by the last exchange:At the close of the film Swann says to his daughter frettingly of Will, "But he's a blacksmith."To which she replies, with a long lustful look at him mentioned."No, he's a pirate!"So, fittingly, ends a film, which is from beginning to end a shallow fantasy. Bravo!2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far the greatest movie I have ever had the honor to gaze upon, and I have seen a lot of movies. Johnny Depps winning personality and talent was perfect for this movie, and Orlando Bloom's career is starting off on the right foot being in both the Lord of the Rings movies and in Pirates of the Caribbean. Kira Knightly also shows incredible talent and should be a promising actress. I'll admit the only reason I went to see the actual movie was because I'm a Depp fanatic and also a big Orlando Bloom fan, and I expected the movie to be boring, because I didn't know what it was about. But i was so wrong, it was AMAZING, and I recommend everyone see this movie. It is good for all people because it was a comedy, love, drama, action, horror, and family movie all in one amazing little package. I saw this movie 4 times and intend to be first in line at blockbuster to buy it. That is all I have to say- oh and vote for this movie-it should be in the top 50, not near the end of the list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I'm not much for the Disney engine but I do have to admit that I really enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean if for no other reason than Johnny Depp's wonderful performance.The film itself is the usual action fair with aggravating editing and impossibilities galore. The effects were very well done and were the first in a while to really make me think "how'd they do that?".A film like this, though, doesn't rely on plot or depth or anything like that. It relies on a feeling of adventure and fun. And darn it all, I had fun. I had more of a good time at this film than any film I can recall in recent memory and think that Depp's performance of Jack Sparrow deserves every bit of acclaim it's received and more.I'm not too keen on a Pirates 2, but if Jack Sparrow is back, I'll be there Maties!!!***.5 / ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler* This was an amazing film with superb acting from Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Geoffrey Rush also delivered an amazing performance, and although Keira Knightley was good, I felt the character could have been used more. The plot wasn't amazing, but definately not far off amazing! The Black Pearl Curse was a new concept and I felt it had been written wonderfully. Johnny Depp, I feel, was put on this Earth to be Captain Jack Sparrow! Orlando Bloom proved fantastically that he can do more than gracefully jump around as an elf, and i think that we can expect to see great work from him in the future. Geoffrey Rush just can't seem to go wrong at the moment, and, for me, he definatley brought in some of the more traditional Pirate feel (with the occasional Ooooh's and Arrr's!). The director and producer (Verbinski and Bruckheimer) have done a wonderful job as have the script writers and actors. A feel good movie that is everything a pirate movie should be and more! A definate 10/10 for me. Something to watch again and again (and again!)</fullReview>

All of the death and violence that you know has to be in a movie like this is so tastefully done it's almost shocking in this day of blood by the gallon. Beautifully filmed and scored, you won't want to leave your seat for anything. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish. Pirates is completely unexpected in it's eloquence and detail. Too many films take their big budgets and blow the film, while this one shows them what they should have done. To say we can't wait until Pirates 2 comes out would be an understatement.

		<fullReview>This was a very good movie. Johnny Depp is indescribable as Captain Jack Sparrow. He brings humor and charm to what could have been a two-dimensional stock character. Orlando Bloom proves that he can do more than just stand around looking pretty and shooting arrows. His Will Turner is dashing and will set many ladies' hearts aflutter. I, for one, look forward to seeing his future work. Geoffrey Rush seems to be having a wonderful time as the dastardly and evil Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley makes a spirited Elizabeth Swann. She is not just a damsel in distress; she gets to take part in the action quite a bit. Jack Davenport was good as the honorable Commodore Norrington. He seemed to really care for Elizabeth, and want her to be happy. In another film, he probably would have been the hero, but Elizabeth had to end up withSPOILERSPOILERWill Turner.The supporting characters are hysterical. The two bumbling British soldiers and their pirate counterparts made me laugh every time they were on screen. I only had two issues with this movie. It got a little too long towards the end; how many battle do you really need? (although I'll admit I still enjoyed it immensely!) Also, Jonathan Pryce was sorely underused. There were many times when his role as Governor Swann could have developed into so much more, but they were never utilized.Overall, this movie was very exciting and fun. A definite for multiple viewings!</fullReview>

Of course, Orlando is a young actor and has done some tremendous work for 'Lord of the Rings', i don't think this is the best we've seen him but he can only get better, and i believe he will. This flick has a great fight scene at the end between Depp and Rush and the score just makes it so energised and keeps your eyes stuck to the screen.

After dealing with her gushing over the male leads and for a few days and constant bugging by my brother to see the film I eventually went with no expectations. I wasnt a great fan of 'Legolas' and Id only seen Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow which was (IMHO) rather an odd film.From the second Depp appeared on screen I was hooked. Orlandos first appearance in the governors house had left me swooning but it was Johnny Depp that left me glued to the screen. Jack Sparrows introduction was amazing and had me in stitches (my condition for most of the film)The performances by each of the main characters was absolutely flawless, the chemistry that played between Will, Elizabeth and Jack was sparkling. The special effects were brilliant and the story was enthralling.I have to say that I left the film deeply on love with both Orlando and Johnny...but more so Jack Sparrow! Johnny Depp stole this film. His performance was faultless and as unlikely as it is he deserves an oscar for this performance - he was flawless!I left the cinema with the film still fresh in my head, and went to see it the next day...and 3 times the week after. I have also already managed to obtain the film on DVD and its already been watched at home 4 times and is in danger of melting! Im even starting to pick up some of Jacks words...savvy? :-) Now thats not a good sign...LOLIMHO I give this film top marks...10/10 fantastic performances from the 4 leads: Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in particular but Geoffrey Rush and Kieira Knightley were on top form too. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last 20 years haven't been kind to the pirate movie genre. Audiences have rejected such forgettable films as Pirates (Roman Polanski, 1986), The Pirate Movie (Kristy McNichol, 1982), and who can forget the one of the biggest flops in film history, Cutthroat Island (Renny Harlin) that sank an entire studio.So when Jerry Bruckheimer, the production money behind such hits as The Rock, Top Gun and Black Hawk Down decided to put his name and efforts behind a big budget summer pirate film, I wondered if he finally lost his marbles, or if director Gore Verbinski had nude photos of Jerry in a dress.Also working against a return of capital was the running time. At 133 minutes, I wondered if a swashbuckling movie could hold an audience captive ? especially the target young ones ? for over two hours.Well, all my thoughts and reservations meant nothing after first screening. The story is rather simple. The movie opens at the conclusion of a pirate attack on a ship and the lone survivor by the name of Will Turner is rescued. A gold medallion around his neck is taken by his rescuer's daughter, Elizabeth Swann, and a band of pirates lead by Geoffery Rush are out to get the medallion and return it to its original resting place, thus lifting the curse set upon them of being undead.In one of the funniest entrances in movie history, Johnny Depp arrives as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and immediately his pirate ways lead him into jail. But when Elizabeth is taken hostage upon the pirate ship the Black Pearl, the townspeople look to Jack Sparrow to rescue her and bring order back to the city.It isn't long before mayhem and sword fights ensue, and it is in the final act that the film has its most incredible visual. The cursed pirates are visible in skeleton form when exposed to moonlight, and in a swordfight between Jack and Barbossa (captain of the Black Pearl), the two battle in and out of the moonlight beams shinning down into a cave. The transformation of skeleton to human to skeleton again in the blink of an eye is movie magic at its best.On paper, the movie had everything going against it. Its running time of 140+ minutes. It's director, Gore Verbinski, who had a hit last year in ?The Ring', but was still new to the fold with only 4 movie titles to his credit. Johnny Depp in a leading role was even a gamble since he had yet to prove to be a box office juggernaut. However, everything comes together in true Disney style. The special effects are top rate, the story is long, but energetic, and the villain (usually the most important character in this genre) was superb. Geoffery Rush gives us the most charismatic villain since Jack Nicholson in Batman. I should note that the supporting cast also does its best with the material. Elizabeth and Will are played with just the right amount of enthusiasm and playfulness, by Bend it Like Beckham's Keira Knightley and Lord of the Rings' Orlando Bloom.If there was once complaint I would say that the humor doesn't come off as well as they would have expected and Johnny Depp, although tolerable, seems like he is trying too hard in his role that was a cross between Errol Flynn and Liberace.But forget its small drawbacks and the history or pirate movies. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a good movie where everyone seems to be having fun.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>*minor spoilers*Pirates of the Caribbean was an absolute FANTASTIC FILM!!! I didn't expect much from a Disney film, and to be honest, I actually went to see the film because Orlando Bloom starred in it. However, Johnny Depp proved to be the best actor in the film, who played the comedic and lunatic character, Jack Sparrow, exceptionally well. Stunning performance by Orlando Bloom as the heroic blacksmith Will Turner, Geoffrey Rush as the haunting Captain Barbossa and Keira Knightly as the strong and independent Elizabeth Swann. It even created a division between 'good' pirates and 'bad' pirates. (I thought they were all ruthless?). Jack Sparrow is a well developed character who even draws sympathy from the audiences (when we're told of his crew abandoning him). He also adds in well balanced comedy, which just makes this character even more loveable. Johnny Depp definitely at his best, and he couldn't get any sexier!The sword fight with the two hottest actors was one of the best scenes! who could resist watching the young blacksmith fighting with the inticing pirate, its a shame they didnt cut more of their shirts off...The Special effects were fantastic, the story was witty and exciting, and although the ending was a little cheesy, it is definitely a fantastic MUST SEE film.Definite thumbs up! go watch it if you haven't already! A perve at Orlando and Johnny is enough to make any girl want to see it!rate 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see a lot of movies, and this one is the best one that has graced the silver screen for a long, long time. This is the perfect movie to go see again and again - whether you're alone, with your parents, babysitting a child, with a group of friends, or your boyfriend; There is something for everyone. The cast is incredible, but hats off definitely to Johnny Depp. I've never been one for the actors themselves; I think a movie is good based on the basic plot, storyline, and if the actors and actresses can pull off a half-decent job of making it believable. But Johnny Depp was absolutely incredible in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow! I am very, very impressed. In truth, until reading all the other comments posted about this movie, I never even realized it was a "long" movie; the time seems to fly by when watching it! The plot is great. Some people may feel it's a "same old" type of story, but there is just something about the film which gives it an edge-of-your-seat excitement and anticipation. Yes, the "good guy" wins, and Orlando Bloom does get the girl, but the outcome is not quite so black-and-white as all that. In fact, certain places throughout the story raise an arched eyebrow in the more detailed observer. For example, has anyone stayed through the credits to see the very very last scene at the very end of the credits? Be forewarned: you will have to dodge brooms and ignore the exasperated sighs of cleaning people as they manouever around you, and yes, the lights will be on, but stay until the last credit rolls. You will see what I mean about leaving it open for something else. I have been on the Disneyland ride, and found it a favorite. I was thus overjoyed to see scenes from the ride in the movie. My personal favorite was the scene in the prison, when the men are trying to get the "mangy mut" to help them escape. I loved thsi attention to detail that reminded people that yes, this is a Disney movie, in case some had forgotten amidst the skeletal ghosts and slashing swords and the figure that results from the beautiful heroine wearing her dreaded corset. There were no holes in this plot that I found. To the individual who didn't think it was mentioned why the blood of Orlando Bloom's character was neeeded, Geoffrey Rush's character explains that each of the gold coins had to be brought back together in order for the curse to be broken. In addition, each of the pirates had paid for their "sins" of taking the cursed treasure with their blood through time. The only pirate who had taken a gold piece, not returned it, and did not give any of his blood to "the cause" was the unseen character of Orlando Bloom's father. Just to clear up any misconceptions. This is an excellent movie, whether you want to see a romance, a happy ending, a plot with a few twists thrown in, an adventure, a fantasy, or anything inbetween. This movie cannot come highly enough recommended. Definitely getting 10 out of 10 rating from me, and that's only because there isn't a higher rating available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp is great, movie is weak (**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An "adaptation" of a ride at Disneyland seemed like kind of a flimsy idea, so I'm not entirely surprised that this overblown entry in the 2003 summer movie season isn't all that good. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a humorously goofy pirate who walks with a constant, drunken swagger. Depp, as always, gives a fun and eccentric performance and gets some great lines in, but unfortunately he's the only thing worth remembering about this movie. The story and all the other characters are a total snooze. Jack is trying to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back from a group of skeletal ghost pirates (led by a hammy Geoffrey Rush) who have kidnapped the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Winona Ryder look-alike Keira Knightley) in order to use her blood to bring them back to life. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is in love with Elizabeth, so he teams up with Sparrow. Bloom, from the "Lord Of The Rings" movies and Knightley, from this year's great "Bend It Like Beckham" are both interesting actors, but the characters they're playing might as well be cardboard cutouts. There is lots of action and some twists in the story, but I found very little of it interesting. In fact, Johnny Depp's likable performance and one-liners were all that kept me awake through the ridiculous 2 hour, 15 minute running time. It's directed by Gore Verbinski, and I guess it shows he can direct a big summer movie, but it completely lacks the small-scale style and effectiveness of his earlier films like last year's eerie "The Ring" and especially the quirky, sadly underrated "The Mexican".And when the army of skeletons shows up in the end, all I could think about was how much cooler it was in "Army Of Darkness". I liked Depp's performance, but in a nutshell, the ride is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing Swashbuckling movies back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is truly an adventure that is worth 4 times the price of admission. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a young blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are after the fabled ship, The Black Pearl, after the dreadful crew lead by Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Will's main squeeze, Elizabeth Swann (played by the lovely Keira Knightley). On the way, Will learns that the Black Pearl used to belong to Jack, who lost it after Barbosa lead a mutiny against him. But, Jack is lucky, because soon after the Pearl was stolen from him, the crew had a nasty curse put upon them. Which makes them invincible, but turns them into skeletons in the moonlight. Not only that, but the crew needs the blood of a Turner (Will Turner!) to break the curse! This movie is an exciting, swashbuckling tale that doesn't fail to entertain you with eye popping battle scenes and asurbic wit. The running time is about 2 and a half hours, a bit long for a summer flick. But it doesn't bore you at all. The entire time your into the story and being dazzled by the action (and beauty of Keira Knightley). Movies like this aren't made...ever! When was the last time you saw a pirate movie? Cutthroat Island doesn't count! Anyway, this movie is one of the best of 2003 and manages to make pirates cool again.RATING: **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was by far the best I saw over my September holiday period. In fact it was probably one of the best movies I have seen...ever!The reasons for this are numerous: Clever casting, interesting story setting, love story meets action..the list continues. I will say that the plot is not particularly extraordinary but that just shows how well the other elements of the film contribute to its overall greatness.Firstly, and most importantly, the cast was fantastic. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were hot!! Not only physically, but their acting was superb. Johnny's character (Capt. Jack Sparrow) was played with such realism, and the humor he brought to the movie made a great film an excellent film. Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightly were also remarkable.The cast aside, everyone loves pirate films. The dark mystery that comes helm with the pirate way of life and the quaintness of the island settlements enriched the film with a glorious setting that is original. There have not been many films based on pirating in the Caribbean, let alone to the standard of this one.The film is also one which all can enjoy. Hot guys for the girls and a gorgeous love story, but sword fighting and skeleton pirates for the guys (By the way GREAT visual effects!). It's also child friendly, a family movie.I have seen this movie 4 times but am not nearly sick of it yet. The movie is not so much great because of it's story but because of its novelty. The witty humor brought by Johnny Depp and the amazing acting along with the audience it appeals to and the fantastic story setting make this movie one of my favorite EVER. I can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie that transcends normal blockbusters to become the best film of the year.(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i went into this movie i was expecting to see an average film. i really only went for Johnny Depp who is one of the best actors of this era, never failing to give a superb performance. but on the whole i wasn't expecting to be impressed. i am delighted to say that for once i was completely and utterly wrong. from the start with Jack Sparrows (Depp) brilliantly funny entrance, to the end, the hilarious fall off the balcony, i was laughing none stop. there is no weak link in this film. the script is brilliant, mixing the right amount of plot without making it too confusing, and with so many witty gags to keep even the most unconvinced viewer amused. the direction is also spot on and the action is great. the acting is also very convincing with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner playing the Errol Flynn number, Keira Knightley doing the damsel in distress come feisty heroine routine and Geoffrey Rush hamming it up with the best of them. however, top honours go to Johnny Depp as, like always, he steals the show completely. his Keith Richards meets Pepe Le Pew character is the funniest and most inspired performance he has ever done (and that's saying a lot) and does not fail to keep you amused and excited from start to finish. his changing character from kidnapping Elizabeth, to seemingly turning against Will and then eventually becoming the hero is interrupted by scenes where he is truly playing it for comic value and does it effortlessly (his fight with Will at the beginning, being marrooned on the desert island and when he is about to be hanged at the end are among the funniest bits in a very funny film). his swaggering, drunken, hopeless yet heroic character is the best thing to come out of films in a long time and will keep you laughing long after the film is over. the only slight criticism would be that it is about 20 minutes too long, yet i cannot think which bits i would have them cut out as i loved every moment of it (and, i ask myself, can you have too much of a good thing.} overall, this film would always have been a success, but having Johnny Depp on board (no pun intended) saved the film from being just another hollywood blockbuster with no heart and turning it into something extraordinary with one of the best performances of his career, leaving the competition all out at sea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography on this film is what makes it outstanding. Whether it's Elizabeth Swann preparing to faint from a too-tight-corset on a parapet, or the tattered Black Pearl sailing in the moonlight, there's always something wondrous to gaze at on the screen. One fantastic underwater shot peruses a school of hammerheads as they drift endlessly through an underwater cove of sunken, ghostly ships. The introductory scene is also stunning, one of the most spell-casting experiences I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. The Interceptor creeping through a mist-shrouded sea, the umbrella floating by, the magnificent horror of seeing a burning merchant ship, and our first glimpse of the Black Pearl as it sails into the fog. This scene alone makes the movie ticket price well worth it... and that's only the first four minutes.As many profession and personal critics have observed, the film belongs to Johnny Depp's memorable performance as "Captain" Jack Sparrow, the single pirate able to elude the curse thanks to his crew mutinying before the gold could be spent. But the other performers shouldn't be overlooked in his hilariously likable wake. In the role of a very strong, independent heroine, Kiera Knightley manages to be both beautiful and spirited without escaping into cliché. Orlando Bloom is more likable here than as the aloof Legolas he's become so well known for; with some excellent action scenes, he shows his unique skill with a blade as well as has the opportunity to carry off a romantic lead with a keen flair. Geoffrey Rush is at his best; being a fan of his endeavors, it was a pleasure to watch him on screen in a very different, very misunderstood role. He manages to make Barbossa both fascinating, horrible, and yet have a shred of sorrow at the end for his passing. Two extremely underrated actors, Britain's Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce, are given the respective roles of Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth's unfortunate fiancée, and her governor father.For once, scriptwriters haven't copped out and given us an easy decision. While being slightly arrogant and something of an egotist, Norrington is also extremely likable, a perfect gentleman, and one might even go so far as to say, the most noble character by the closing credits. Davenport plays him with just the right amount of lethargic enthusiasm and irritation; his scenes with Depp, always wrought with blatant humor, are some of the film's finest moments. Pryce doesn't have a lot to work with, but the audience cannot help but chuckle over some of his humorous traits, such as fighting a skeletal hand for his magnanimous wig. The music is also first-rate, very mood-setting with a certain sense of dramatic tension even in romantic scenes. The film is well worth a PG13 rating, but is never inappropriate for younger audiences. The mild innuendo will go over children's heads (and most parents as well, for that matter -- only literature history-lovers will pick up some of the sly historical jests), the violence is all quite bloodless, and there's virtually no profanity. The pirates are properly frightening and in various stages of decay, extremely cool from a CGI perspective.A movie well worth its praise, and one you simply MUST own on DVD for all its subtleties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can anyone say about Pirates of the Caribbean except that it's BRILLIANT!!From the beginning of the movie, you set sail on a journey through the Caribbean. You can almost smell the air and feel totally absorbed into the movie.The plot is good for a pirates' story with so many twists and shifts and gets you into the story step by step.The set design is very good. So realistic and so rich you see that nothing is out of place, everything is where it's supposed to be.The direction is excellent. The fight sequences were done in a humorous mode but with good skills.The graphics is OUTSTANDING. You can look with the examining eye, you can not find a single moment of inconsistency in the graphics. It took my breath away.The leads (Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Jack Davenport) were brilliant. They contributed positively to their roles, especially Johnny Depp. He was so funny and so in character that you couldn't imagine anyone else doing that role but him (savvy?).In Total...I think that this movie gave Disney a peak that is HARD to surpass. I really doubt if anyone could do any better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is amazingly stunning!!! I have been to the cinema 7 times to see it, and each time see something new, I didnt see before hand!!! The film has a fantastic story line, some amazing special effects, and some comedy to die for!!!. The acting in POTC is fantastic, and Keira Knightley is stunningly beautiful and very funny. Orlando Bloom is a little wooden, but still good, but Johnny Depp steals the show with his characterisation of Captain Jack Sparrow. He has a very strong character, with a great voice, attitude and appearance. Fantastic!!!</fullReview>

It combines action, comedy and romance, which i find is the best kind of film. ok so some of the fight scenes look very choreographed, but the comedy is natural, i havent laughed so much in ages, another reason to see it is that i have just read the shortlist for the Oscars next year and Johnny Depp is up for Best Actor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film is a rousing romp of maritime adventure, it has some problems with historical continuity. Characters seem to randomly inhabit any century from the 16th to the 18th, roughly from the period of Edward VI to George III, willy nilly. The action and characters are everything they need to to be and a bit more ( you can just about smell Depp's Jack Starling.) This film makes me appreciate all those Flynn, Power, Derek and Payne movies which managed to capture the period and flavor of bygone Romantic eras with much greater dispatch and lower budgets.

		<shortDescription>An excellent surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a movie whose trailor was played all day, everyday, as the build-up to the release loomed here in Cape Town. Me, im one for swash-buckling pirates and handsome hero's, so of course i was intruiged and dutifully paid the fee to see the movie, although i have to add that my expectations were sky high, and this is normally a recipe for intense disappointment.But not this day, this movie. It had me from the opening sequence, to the end credits and left me wanting more. i found the entire movie a marvel, the characters well scripted and perfectly brought to life. above all of that though, the humour and wit brought forth by the wondeful Jack Sparrow and counterparts made the film. the chemistry was perfect and this is definitely a movie i would indeed pay to see once again.as mentioned, Johnny Depp was PERFECTLY cast as Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow that is. He melded with this character and there is truthfully none other i could see in the role. it was tailor made and he fit it like a glove. it was also interestingly refreshing to see him in a role that departed from the "Sleepy Hollow" "From Hell" spectrums of the last few years.Orlando Bloom, an actor surrounded with much hype. and i have to say much deserved. He was fantastic, and a wonderful support. Will Turners chemistry with Captain Jack is a marvel to watch and i found myself smiling an aweful lot. and yes, i too drowned in his gorgeously long lashed eyes!Kiera Knightly, the herione is one that i did not care for much. despite her success in Bend it like Beckham, Kiera never really captivated me, but even she had me smiling and praising the casting directors for their choice. she was lovely and a wonderful foil for the otherwise all male cast.there is no other rating but 5/5; 10/10 Excellent, and more inportantly a movie that EVERYONE, adult and child alike would love. something for everyone!!!</fullReview>

Having just watched Terminator 3 and feeling quite despondent about the decidedly dodgy offerings at the cinema, this film has certainly restored my faith. Can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun movie that reminds me of The Princess Bride for it's great fight scenes and Johnny Depp's and Geoffrey Rush's wonderful characters. Though it's not nearly as witty overall, it's full of great lines (most of which go to Jack Sparrow), funny references to Disney's PotC ride, and good visuals. The special effects are keen and not made to scare, though young ones might be wary. The movie can run on a bit, but I really didn't mind (It meant more Jack Sparrow). I've read reviews stating that Johnny Depp is channeling a drunken drag queen in this movie, and that's a good thing. There truly is something hypnotic, sexy, and worth swooning over in the way he plays Jack Sparrow. This movie also encourages kids to eat their fruits... particularly apples. And if none of this has convinced you to go see this movie, then go to see the staggering amount of dental work. I'm not kidding, watch the credits and count the number of dentists who worked on this! Depp's and Rush's mouths alone must've kept several dentists busy for weeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overwrought, grotesque, turgid. At the end they are fighting and fighting, Barberousse (who does not have a red beard) and Sparrow, and we ask why because neither can die. On and on and on and on they go, while elsewhere all kinds of mayhem occurs. This film has a mixed tone - unlike Sinbad: it tries to be a swashbuckler, but must fall into line on the current craze for realistic effects and graphic violence. We watch brutal, winner-take-all-and-death-to-the-loser battles, as the heroes quip and prance, and just out of frame the ghouls plunge swords into the chests of soldiers we have just seen fall. In Sinbad, no one seems to die - and that is fine by me. Johnny Depp swishes drunkenly through his role; Orlando Bloom is appropriately dewy and earnest; the girl is luminous, fiery, resourceful - like every heroine in action films these days. This film fell seriously in love with its main effect: the pirates turn into ghouls under the moonlight. You want to see a great swashbuckler, invite your niece or nephew or the kid next door, and check out Sinbad. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally had some doubts when it came to POTC, and was somewhat pleased when I had to cancel on seeing it. When I did finally get around to seeing it, I was blown away.Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as the roguish, bumbling, half-drunk, handsome ;-) Captain Jack Sparrow. His character is not one we will soon forget.Geoffrey Rush is awesome as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom weren't bad, but I just found their characters to be boring.Coming in at just under two and a half hours, some view Pirates as too long, while other, more obsessive fans, didn't want it to end.So, all in all, if you want a fun, swashbuckling, good for the whole family but you actually WILL enjoy it unlike some other movies who said that too, check out Pirates. You won't be sorry.*****</fullReview>

The 2 hours and 20 odd minutes sailed by ( sorry, bad pun! ) Johnny Depp was superb, the accent was so-so but as a brit i'll forgive him! He stole every scene he was in, he camped it up throughout, I laughed out loud and so did my kids aged 16 &amp; 10. The dvd is already on my wish list and hopefully a sequel will follow.

Not since Mick Jagger in 'Performance' have I seen such lip action.

Her co-star in 'Bend It' Parminder K.Nagra is much the more accomplished actress and her star will shine brighter. Still all is not lost, Miss Knightley could land plenty of roles as Liz Hurley's younger sister! As for Depp...brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has been regarded as the best film this summer in the US, and many IMDb users have praised the return of the pirate genre.With this in mind I went to the cinema and watched this movie, and once again I disagree with the IMDb users and possibly also a lot of critics. The story had a lot of potential with ghost pirates and stuff like that, it is a pirate movie and you can accept things like this, but the movie fails to impress me for several reasons.First of all the cast was not chosen wisely. Johnny Depp is without doubt a great actor, but he is simply the wrong choice for an old pirate. He does not look old, but according to the story he should have been captain on the same ship where Geoffrey Rush was chief officer. The rest of the cast was chosen more wisely, but I never liked Orlando Bloom's character either.One thing that really annoyed me was that almost every character should be funny, it was very annoying and at some points unbearable to watch. First we have some stupid English soldiers, later Johnny Depp has to be funny, and we also have to watch some funny ghost pirates all the time. Suddenly all characters have to be funny, and the ghost pirates are just comic sidekicks in this movie, they are not scary at all. The idea to make the English soldiers stupid has also been seen so many times before, and I really dislike it.If that was all of it, then I maybe would not be that grumpy, but that was not all of it. The whole idea of immortal pirates was actually not good even though I accept stuff like that in this pirate adventure genre. I can ask a simple question, why do people take a fight against these immortal pirates? There is absolutely no point in doing that because the outcome has already been decided. Am I the only one who is asking these simple questions? Hopefully I am not.After having criticised the movie I also have to point out some of the good sides. The movie is well done in both sound and picture. The effects are good and the ships can fascinate most people. Anyway, the movie does not deserve a good rating, because the plot is too thin and all scenes have to be fun, which is a disaster in a 143 minute movie. Beautiful scenes and a few laughs however make this an acceptable picture, which should not be treated as an memorable movie of year 2003. - Rating: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great to see that careful planning, structuring and audience studying pay off sometimes. The audience can at times be a strange beast, and can sink pictures in the same turf where others have been glorified. But Disney couldn't allow this movie to suffer the fate of Roman Polanski's "Pirates" or "Cutthroat Island". First major rule: stick to what you know, and always trust the school of Hollywood - thus, create a buddy-buddy formula, add the love interest, and then create a baddie, or even better, an army of baddies to go chase the heroes. The cornerstones of the typical american blockbuster are all right there, splattered on the screen, just pick them out. Second major rule: give the audience the very thing they're looking for when in the movies - exactly those things that they're not expecting. So assume the pirate theme and adapt it to the 21st century - and then come the bombastic the special effects. These two rules are usually gold, and when you tackle a movie genre that hasn't been touched for almost ten years, it isn't difficult to give people what they want to see. But this apparent ease of thought would trap Disney, so thank God for brilliant ideas - and one brilliant actor. Johnny Depp steals the show right from his unforgettable entrance, and never thinks of allowing some space for other things to provide comic relief. And neither do the filmmakers, and the public. As Jack Sparrow, the gallery of Depp-ish weirdness is complete with a full-on, iconic buckaneer, brilliantly crossing pirate stereotype with pop culture in a performance of rare dedication and method for a summer blockbuster. The result is the most memorable character of the picture, and also the entire blockbuster season. "Pirates of the Caribbean" could be in many ways another flop, but the producers made this movie by studying everything that made the others sink to the bottom. And also did Jerry Bruckheimer, whose "Pearl Harbor" left more bitterness in his mouth than memories in the entire audience. A refined sense of style, bombastic CGI skelletons and a script that only feels muddled when it seeks help in some of the chapters of the "Hollywood book of screenwriting", make this a winner, and one of the best popcorn-munchers of the year. Expect Peter Weir's / Russell Crowe's "Master and Commander", expect "Pirates of the Caribbean 2", and most probably seafaring adventures are back into the silver screen. Ahoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was great fun and just might awaken more interest in the historical adventure film...a genre that has been sadly missed, but as in "Gladiator", when done well is big box office. However, Johnny Depp's rancid Captain Jack makes on long for the likes of Robert Newton, Anthony Quinn, and the pirate heroes of the 50's such as Flynn and Tyrone Power. The "evil dead" type special effects were an unnecessary distraction and the historical continuity was ludicrous. Some characters were circa 16th and 17th century (Orlando Bloom with his Musketeer garb at the end) while the British troops were definitely late 18th century as in the American Revolution. Although I have to laud the intention the results were not entirely satisfying, but I'd like to see more attempts at this kind of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child, Elizabeth Swann spots Will Turner floating unconscious in the water when she is at sea with her father, the British Governor. After Will has been rescued, Elizabeth discovers and takes the coin hanging around his neck (a sign that Will is a pirate). As an adult, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) wears this coin round her own neck and because of this, she is kidnapped by the crew of pirate ship, the Black Pearl who are cursed to sail the seas in a ghostly zombie-like state. Only when the coin is returned to its treasure chest will this curse be lifted. It is then up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with the help of pirate Jack Sparrow to rescue the Governor's daughter.A good selling point of the film is its cast which includes pretty actors Bloom, Knightley and Depp (personally, I don't know what the fuss is about with Orlando Bloom ?to me he is merely a younger version of Antonio Banderas). Depp gives a likeable but over-the performance as the drunk and cockney accented Jack Sparrow and other big names include Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, the captain of the Black Pearl, and Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's Governor father. Also, look out for Gareth of ?The Office' fame as one of the pirates! All seem to be having fun with some acting more befitting to a pantomime than a film. The main problem I have with this film is that the pirate concept holds little interest for me (I am however, slightly amused by the obligatory ?Oooh Arrr's in pirate speak). The main source of excitement is the fight sequences during which we see some good special effects of the crew of the Black Pearl appearing as a combination of skeleton and rotting flesh when exposed to direct moonlight. However, the fighting soon becomes dull and repetitive. Because the villains are already dead, there does not appear to be a quick resolution and as a result, the film is painfully drawn out to well over two hours in length.Young children and those who are intrigued and excited by the prospect of pretty actors romping about and fighting on ships and the hoisting of the Jolly Roger will probably enjoy ?Pirates of the Caribbean'. If you arrive to the cinema in a panto frame of mind, you will have a lot of fun but unfortunately the film left this viewer cold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I was hoping this film would be bad. Never really been a fan of pirate movies, and judging by the trailers, I thought this would be phoney and shallow. `Pirates of the Caribbean' has been receiving mass critical praise since the opening week and I can see why. It has that certain charm about it which is very hard to resist. The plot follows a very familiar outline, but the film comes to life in the swooping visuals and brilliant fight scenes. Essentially, `Pirates' is a B movie but a rather good one at that. While it is immensely enjoyable, is this really a five star movie? It's a big-budget large-scale blockbuster in the vein of `The Hulk' and `Terminator 3' but it hardly pushes the limits of cinema.The movie is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer- the helm behind similarly themed efforts such as `The Rock' and `Pearl Harbour'- so I can't say I'm surprised that there are so many big bangs throughout. Technical credits are top-notch all across the board. The cinematography, in particular, is a huge stand out. The CG work is good as well, but over showy in parts. Case in point is the scene in which Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) turns into a skeleton and then drinks alcohol that we see as if we were wearing x-ray specs. While the animated work for that scene is good, the `It's-the-21st-century. -Look-what-we-can-do' effect comes across in an overtly preachy way. But this part is brief so there's no need to go into too much detail with it.And as your classic adventure movie, there are the three main characters- the hero, the significant other and the hammy villain. Also in there is a jilted lover/ hero #2, but he's perfectly relevant to the plot. Of course, the media are constantly saying `the film has everything! Action, comedy, drama, romance'- virtually 90% of all movies have all those factors. As I said, it all comes down to the action. The cheesy jokes, romantic subplots etc. are okay, but hardly what `Pirates' will be remembered for.Johnny Depp has the charisma and quirkiness to carry the role of Jack Sparrow. Better yet, he makes the role his own. With the offbeat swagger and cheesy one-liners, no one could have executed the role better. And the hammy villain is perfectly portrayed by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, who does this comic-style part just as well as the tougher ones. Keira Knightley (I hate that name) would seem like the perfect stereotype, but her character is well written and she brings life to- what could have been- a very flat performance. But Orlando Bloom seems out of place. His character has no charisma, no characteristics, no quirky one liners. And the lines are delivered without credibility. There's such thing as `playing it straight', but this is more wooden than the plank which he walks off of.And while the closing moments may go on for a bit too long, there's enough treasured moments to be able to forgive all that. And while there is no emotional core that elevates above the level of `a flashy action packed adventure-fest', you probably shouldn't expect one. So if you want an old-fashioned crowd pleaser, you won't go far wrong with `Pirates of the Caribbean'- a film which I'm almost ashamed to say that I enjoyed. My IMDb rating: 6.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Disney adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Average action adventure Disney yarn is watchable mainly due to good performances by Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and the lovely Keira Knightley.It's the tale of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, once captained by the eccentric Depp, whose new captain ? Geoffrey Rush is looking for a pirate medallion that ends up in the hands of Knightley, the daughter a rich governor (Jonathan Pryce). Throw in Bloom as the dashing hero with a sketchy past and a major crush on Knightley, and you've got yourself a special effects ridden harmless piece of entertainment. Downsides are too many silly additional characters, who will only be of interest to very young viewers, and at 143 minutes, its far too long - they could have cut out about half an hour of footage off at least.Nice to see a fairly original idea through, although I hear it is based on a computer game(?) or something (I may be wrong), instead of the countless sequels that have cluttered up the cinemas over the past year or so.?..saying that, no doubt there will be a `Pirates of the Caribbean 2' through, sooner rather than later!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is an expensive film. It looks expensive, and was more than likely expensive to make. It is a film about cursed pirates. It has lots o' CGI effects (my favorite), but fails at using them in any new or interesting way. Geoffory Rush and Johnny Depp (as a high seas Keith Richards) seem to be having a blast, but then again they are being payed a whole lot of money (see note above on film's expense).The musical score, by Klaus Badelt, is carbon copy Media Ventures crap (and to think he replaced Alan Silvestri...), and probably cost a good penny in and of itself. Let's just say that if I didn't have a girlfriend, I would have never seen this film.Okay, the bad points: On a general level I find this film disturbing. It opens the gates of hell and, upon its success, will prompt Disney to churn out colorful products that do nothing more than promote the corporate giant's theme parks (did anyone catch the trailer for THE HAUNTED MANSION, looks good...sigh...). One can almost feel the hairy mouse-like tendrils closing on the jugular of American film. Mark my words: there will be a 'It's a Small World' movie and when that day comes may God help us all. 5/10.</fullReview>

While this weakened my understanding of the film's plot, my 11 year old companion cheerily filled in the details on the drive home.I sympathized with Johnny Depp who, like me, seemed to have just woken up prior to many scenes. While I was clueless as to what exactly was going on, Depp pulled off well his wake up calls and instead appeared to have a brilliant, original take on the plot twists. Move Depp, on probation, into the "watchable actor, sole reason for buying ticket" column.Hollywood producers accept pirate projects at their peril. Maybe it's a challenge match for those with money to spare. Someone today no doubt pitched a TV series based on the pirates in 'Six Days, Seven Nights'. Pirates. Hollywood. Fairbanks. Swashbuckle.

		<shortDescription>A waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from watching this movie. I should first mention that I had no idea what this movie was about (beyond Pirates). All I knew about this movie was that it did great over the weekend. I don't understand where all the comments about this movie being good, and Johnny Depp acting great are coming from! First, the overacting by Johnny Depp was driving me crazy! I kept expecting to see Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy show up on screen. His character had no purpose in the movie! The nice compass he had could have been given to any other character, and the plot of the movie would not have changed a bit. The characters were so shallow, I had no strong feeling about any of them. There was nothing very interesting about the plot either. It was so simple, that reading the one sentence plot outline from imdb.com tells you everything you need to know about it. The best part of the film is the visual effects, very stunning throughout the entire film! Overall, I give this film a 5/10. If you've got nothing else to do, go see this film and watch the nice visual effects. But remember to turn your brain off before the movie starts, or you'll end up with a splitting headache by the time it ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp saves 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'The Mummy'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight up front and that is that I am only comparing this film to 'Lord of the Rings' in terms of its gothic action sequences with the ghostly skeletons. The lighting on these scenes is almost identical to some parts of 'LOTR'. The shadowy cascade of computer special effects mimic parts of 'The Mummy' with a hero and the damsel in distress fully in hand. Other than that, Johnny Depp is absolutely outstanding. His charasmatic and eccentric qualities save this movie and it ranks a 9 out of 10 whenever he is speaking or engaged in the important moments. Geoffrey Rush is also quite good in his role but when the other actors are present, the film comes off as superficial. Directed like a pure popcorn summer movie, it's odd that this really isn't a family film because a lot of the dark moments of horror are definitey NOT for young children. The film also suffers from overlength at almost two and a half hours. The attention span of children and teenagers is being stretched at such a length. This movie is worth a look but that's about it. It makes a good movie as an alternative plan to what you're going to do. Our party was rained out at golf and we decided to take in this flick. To make a special trip out to see it would have been a task and Hollywood is already full of tired stories like this and the search (if there is one by the movie industry) for originality goes on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok over all in spite of being a Bruckheimer film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over all the movie ended up being ok, in spite of the fact it could have been great. But as anyone who's familiar with Jerry Bruckheimer movies knows, lots of scenes ended up being over dramatized, over humored, grossly contrived scenarios, a lot of style with very little substance, and generally for people with low intellect and attention spans.But as someone else pointed out, it should at least be pretty fun for the kids. Johnny Depp's character, while over the top, was still pretty entertaining as a pirate who's got a screw loose, or one sandwich shy of a picnic (which in the movie seems to mean having effeminate mannerisms). All the other characters are mind numbingly cliched.The real stars of the movie, of course, are the special effects. Spectacular transition effects done almost seamlessly. So gather of the kids and head on down to the matinee. If you're an adult, you might want to have a drink first and check your IQ at the door. Trust me; you'll have a better time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good summertainment. Pass the rum.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**If I were given $125 million and told to make a B-movie about pirates, "Pirates" would be something I wouldn't mind coming up with. The flick works because it doesn't quite take itself seriously. Had it been a straight forward movie, boredom would have set in sooner, but the tongue-in-cheek humor makes it endurable.At the core of the askance goofiness is Johnny Depp, who plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate of questionable skills and methods, in a half-drunk manner that can't be taken too seriously. He embodies all things pirate, complete with cliches, sarcastic remarks, and rum. Initially his odd mannerisms threw me, as I didn't quite understand why he couldn't walk straight. But as his character was fleshed out, everything made sense; and Depp's brilliance was understood. He and his character carried the movie, in part because every time Pirates drifted towards over-the-top seriousness, a mere glance or comment from Depp put it back in its proper place. Popcorn movies don't usually supply opportunities for great performances, and maybe there wasn't one written. Depp, however, took the part to a level beyond the movie itself.The rest of the cast ranged from servicable to good. Orlando Bloom finally starred in a movie without his pointy ears, and did quite well as blacksmith apprentice Will Turner. Although he didn't have much to work with in a combination role as both straight man and hero, he filled those roles admirably, proving once again that he has a stellar screen presence.The striking Keira Knightley, in a slightly different role than Bend it Like Beckham, doesn't have much to do as the damsel in distress. But she presents Elizabeth as a step up from the token screamer. Her long figure and bold facial features (Natalie Portman-esque) draw attention as well. She and Bloom make quite the on-screen duo.Geoffrey Rush leads the rest of the cast as Captain Barbossa, the requisite evil pirate and Sparrow's nemesis. He eats up his part, nearly outdoing Depp in the campiness department. Everyone else is competent, looking their parts well, but doing little more.Aside from Depp's performance, the look of the movie was the highlight. The rich and colorful palette of the film enhanced the bold lifestyle embraced by such rogues. The sweeping cinematography, meant to be seen on the big screen, captured the feeling of living such a sea-bound life, providing an experience that truly felt on location.Much has been made of ILM's skeletal special effects, and they deserve whatever praise they receive. Simply designing the skeletons and their smooth movements is impressive enough. But the real accomplishment is the phenomenally fluid transition of the undead from flesh to bone when moving in and out of moonlight. This movie should at least get a look when the Academy Awards come around.Surprisingly for a pirate movie, the sound is quiet during the opening scenes, so quiet that the rumbling bass from the neighboring theater intruded on my screening. But once the action accelerated, the sound did as well. Fortunately it did not reach the ear-splitting levels of previous Bruckheimer fare like "Armageddon", plateauing at a loud but manageable volume, providing a pleasant aural experience.That experience was enhanced by the score of Klaus Badelt. He is clearly a disciple of Hans Zimmer, as the music rings of Zimmer's "Gladiator". It is also reminiscent of "Mask of Zorro". The strings and horns drove forward with the action of the movie, especially during the climactic scenes. Some may find the music over-bearing, but for a movie such as this, it is quite appropriate.As much as I've raved thus far, I rate this movie only 6 out of 10 (still a thumbs up in my book) for a number of reasons. Unfortunately, "Pirates" has a running time (nearly 150 minutes) that matches the titular length. Trimming 20-30 minutes off, mostly at the beginning and end, would have made this film much better, limiting the lulls between action. After the humorous introduction to Sparrow, the exposition was too long. Depp portrayed the part well enough that we didn't need every single aspect of his character explicitly shown. In the last half hour, the battle scenes between the undead and the British, while visually attractive, were both too long and unnecessary. Since the pirates were immortal at that point, shouldn't they have overrun the British more quickly? They could have easily reached the ship later and just commenced the fight when the curse was lifted. The inclusion of a mandatory happy-ending epilogue was fine, but it too dragged, because the writers had to politely wrap up the love triangle.Speaking of which, the whole Elizabeth-Commodore Norrington romance angle should have been axed. Not only did it add length, it overstated the fact that Elizabeth and Turner were going to fall in love. Speaking of needless romantic angles, the ambiguous past between Sparrow and Anamaria should probably have been trimmed too. I'm guessing there was more to it in the original cut, but most of that was eliminated, leaving the small remaining parts out of place.Speaking of out of place, the comedic relief pirates and soldiers, although amusing at first, quickly wore out their welcome. Characters such as theirs are usually present in Disney movies, but in a more 'adult' flick, particularly one already replete with humor, the cheap comedy only annoyingly slows down the pacing.But the biggest problem with Pirates is that for all its positives, the movie still is not truly interesting. It does engage, but does not pique interest. There is just too much going on between too many people to really care about what's occurring. Don't get me wrong. It's an enjoyable film from which you will likely remember a handful of images; but outside of Captain Jack Sparrow, the depth is lacking. Maybe that will be remedied in the inevitable sequel(s)...Bottom Line: Good summertainment. 6 of 10. Pass the rum.</fullReview>

What saved this film from a rating of 3 which it rightly deserved was the amazing acting back Johnny Depp. despite having a badly written character in a badly written film he still managed to make the movie worth seeing again. He was the only character who actually showed signs of life.

Some of the sight-gags from the actual ride are also present, and faithfully re-enacted. *That dog, for instance, was smarter than all four of those prisoners put together.* And, best of all, it's rated PG-13, rather than. . .AHRRRR!

I also did not like the cheesy ending.On the other hand, the hottie factor was definitely high between Orlando and Johnny. Though they both played their roles well, I think the award for best acting in this movie should go to Geoffrey Rush. He was great.I admit the film had plenty of laughs and some of the one-on-one fight scenes were interesting.

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is, quite simply, the best movie [so far] of the summer. Certainly the most satisfying. It has everything you could possibly want from a pirate movie...and more. The perfect blend of action, jaw-dropping visuals and tongue-in-cheek humor. As one would expect, there are numerous, yet subtle references to the Disneyland Park attraction on which the film is based and moviegoers will have fun identifying them. Even the famous song "Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life For Me!" makes sporadic appearances in the film, in fact, the movie opens with it. But it is presented in such a way that it never comes off forced or "cheesy."While Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are all excellent in their respective roles, it's Johnny's Depp's movie all the way. Depp commands your attention every time he's on the screen and clearly he's having fun with it. Very few actors could pull this feat off without going "overboard", so to speak. Only Geoffrey Rush comes dangerously close to fulfilling his destiny as a true pirate and stealing the movie away from Depp. It is an honest pleasure to watch these two professionals on screen together.Summer moviegoers, tired of film disappointments and over-hyped sequels will be delighted by this cinematic thrill-ride. Bring your sword and your eye patch, the swashbuckler adventure is back!NOTE: The PG-13 rating is for mild violence; TV show and video games contain far more graphic violence. There is also no profanity or nudity. However, I dare the viewer to miss any of these with the well-written script!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big conglomerates have pretty much driven the little guys out of business, you know?...Oh, the movie, right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp must work a potent magic on his admirers: by its power he's able to communicate to them, and to them alone, the character he has it in his head that he's portraying. The rest of us have to do a good deal of guessing, since the actor goes only a little way in manifesting his purpose by means of the normal external signs, e.g. facial expressions, body language, tones of voice. Lacking these to go by, I hazard that in this movie he thinks he's impersonating a would-be buccaneer who's generally too drunk, lazy, incompetent, or good-natured to carry off his boasted predations: a role for a W. C. Fields or Wallace Beery, not a performer with the look and the aura of a spoiled altar-boy twenty years past his prime. The star's deficiency might have been compensated for in some measure by intelligent casting of the leading lady; but the one we have here is Keira Knightley, doing her usual, i.e. wanly striking poses for an imaginary photo shoot. The villain, Geoffrey Rush, supplies the color and panache the other two lack; but there's not enough of him to go around. The movie is rather at pains to present itself as a piece of good fun; but for me it was a piece of hard work, all on account of the director (the same one who bumbled up the American "Ring"). He appears to have one virtue: shooting all the script he has, so that all the pieces are there, as they often are not in films these days. But the pieces are nearly all wrong: in the staging, the perspectives and proportions are so far off what one might imagine in reading the script (or any of its published story-izings) that one almost has to revisualize the movie as it goes to get what it's about. And the script, which is a mishmash at best, is confusing in places. The first scene ends with the pirate ship bearing down on its apparent target...and then what? Pondering this enigma distracted me from subsequent developments for a good hour or so; not that they compelled much interest in themselves. I feel a gallon of ill will toward this movie: as a product for sale, which is all it is (it's a lot farther from being a work of art than the amusement ride that inspired), it's a piece of inferior merchandise, with its seams still unfinished. Yet buyers seemed not to see that. Depp's magic at work again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates is potentially a terrible film rescued solely by the talented cast and crew. The plot is as lame as a wooden legged sailor. The directorial kiss of life is apparent right from the entrance of (not so) Able Seaman Depp with a beautifully crafted and acted introduction to the Keith Richards inspired pirate. As is so oft the case from Hollywood a simply shocking plot never stands in the way of the lure of gold. The pirates in this case are the accountants of tinsel town. Geoffrey Rush hams it up in equal measure with Mr Depp and must wonder whether his digital skeletal pirate is as transparent as the plot. Laughing all the way to the bank is the phrase that springs to mind. Enjoy at your leisure but expect to have sacrificed a few brain cells by the time the credits appear.</fullReview>

The gold was cursed and the only way to lift the curse is by retuning all the gold to the chest and paying a blood price. and since everybody stole the gold (the pirates) all of them had to pay the blood price, however, Bootstraps couldn't pay it because he was dead at the bottom of the ocean, so his son (who had the same blood as bootstraps) paid it for him, and the curse was lifted.Now about the movie, i definitely recommend this movie for everyone.

I kinda regret not having seen it on the big screen. I will surely be seeing the next TWO, which are in production at this time.During one scene, he takes a swing at seducing a woman. Having enjoyed watching Depp in a romantic role, I was surprised at how smarmy he came off as when he was making his moves. Even though he is an attractive man, he managed to make himself seem, unappealing? Is that even possible? But it was fitting for his character, which is a testament to his talent, as usual.The plot was interesting, they squoze all the ride scenes in, the effects were REALLY good, and the swordfight scenes are just plain fun to watch. Almost as good as the princess bride. :P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film everyone likes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film, the kids love this film, my parents love this film.Its funny, its action, its tongue in cheek, well acted, well written, well made. Its heaps of good fun, and solid entertainment.I think this comes under the category of a kids film with such a good story and so well told that everyone enjoys it! Its a pirate horror story over-played by the lead roles - who appear to be having loads of fun making the film, that you can't help but love this film.If they ruin this film with poor sequels (like the Matrix .. ugh) heads should roll. If they can keep the quality and story as good (like Shrek, Aliens II..) they'll make a mint - and well deserved too!A film to lift the spirits. Good solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Black Pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film is spectacular because it presents you a new and stronger character: a ship. The Black Pearl inspired me suspense and curiosity. The film gives you the sensation: "I want to be there". The backgrounds are great, Johnny Depp has an amazing facility to interpret a drunk pirate ( how strange..., is it a "casuality"? ). I think Johnny Depp is the best actor in this moment, and I'm so proud to say: "I love I'm". I really wish Vanesssa Paradise to disappear... but we are talking about the film, I don't find enough mistakes to say: "This film is crap". And if it is, well, I really don't matter, I love this film, I love when Johnny says Elizabeth Swan: "Easy on the goods, darling" ( I wish being Elizabeth Swan in that instant ) and finally, I love Johnny Depp. Sorry if I have spelling or writing mistakes, but I'm a thirteen year-old Mexican girl... 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pirates" is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made! Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Jack Davenport, and of course the esteemed Jonathan Pryce, come together to form the cast of this amazing, sea-faring adventure! 10 years previously, Elizabeth Swann mets Will Turner after he is rescued from a burning ship. Fast forward to the present, and Will Turner is a dashing young man (an unbelievably hot Orlando Bloom), hopelessly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth. But before he can declared his love, Elizabeth is kidnapped by pirates, cursed pirates looking for something that they desperately need. Enter Johnny Depp, the mildly tipsy, rogue-ishly good looking, and always charming Captian Jack Sparrow. He and Will set off to rescue the girl, and thus start an amazing journey full of ghost stories, curses, pirates, and of course, apples. Watch for the scene in the treasure cave, where Jack Sparrow, mildly concussed, attempts to beg for parlay... "par..parsip...pplla..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went into the theater to see this film two years ago or so, I knew I was in for a good movie. True, I had been a bit ignorant of the previews at first, and the whole pirate genre didn't seem to excite me much at the time (why, I don't know). But still, I had seen the previews and been to the official website, and had pretty much grasped the concept of the film. But it wasn't until the theater darkened and the opening credits (or, uh, credit) came up on the screen that I knew this would be a genuinely great film. From the opening moment with the fog fading into the scene, I was captivated. Needless to say, I am now a huge fan of this movie. Having seen it many, many, many times, it never gets old for me. In my eyes, the casting was PERFECT, I wouldn't change a thing. Orlando Bloom was transformed in front of my eyes from the blond elf Legolas that I HAD known into the swashbuckling buccaneer Will Turner. He certainly had the looks to back up his acting, which in this film was wonderful. To me, no one else could have played the dashing, yet modest young blacksmith better. Keira Knightley was absolutely beautiful as Elizabeth Swann, and having only seen her in Bend It Like Beckham, she came as a big surprise for me. She acted superbly, and was the perfect choice for such a feisty young woman in this period film. Geoffrey Rush is a new addition to my "favorite actors" list, and his villainous turn as the evil Captain Barbossa was very impressive. He was so gritty and grungy in this film, and just took his role of seedy villain to a whole new level, adding depth and emotion that I never expected. But, I must say, the most impressive character to me was Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed by the infamous Johnny Depp! From the second he arrived on screen, I knew he would certainly be a character to remember, and he was! I still find myself quoting him from time to time, as dorky as that may sound! The director, Gore Verbinski, did an amazing job, and I still can't even begin to understand how hard of a job directing is! And from the commentaries and documentaries I have seen, I respect him so much for his hard work on this film. Jerry Bruckheimer did an awesome job as well, and his special effects and explosions have become well known to me in such movies as this one, as well as Pearl Harbor. Another person I must say did such a fabulous job is Penny Rose, the costume designer. Although costume designers don't get much credit, the costumes in this film were lavish and beautiful, as well as dirty, gritty and very pirate-y. This movie remains forever one of my favorite films, and is so because of all it has to offer. For those sappy, mushy people out there, yes, there is romance. For the gritty, hardcore action-fans out there, yes, there are enough explosions, gunfire and sword-fights to go around. For the Period-film fans, there is enough beautiful costuming and eye-catching scenery to please all of your eyes. And for those pirate fans in general, this is certainly a movie you cannot afford to miss!</fullReview>

I can wait until the next two movies!!!!My favorite part of this movie is where Jack and Elizabeth are marooned on the island.I also think the part where Elizabeth is on the Black Pearl and she tries to stab Barboosa is kinda cool.But i don't like the part is when Elizabeth says yes to Norington! I think it was smart to stand by Will. I like the part where Jhonny Depp and Orlando Bloom are in his house and they have that sword fight.I think the part where Jack is in the house alone and he puts the hot metal rod to the donkeys butt is very funny.It is so cool where Barboosa drinks that red wine. I also think the part where the pirates walk under water is so cool.I really like the part where Will and Jack walk under the canoe!If you have never seen this movie you don't know what you are missing!!</fullReview>

There were a few parts in the movie where I can imagine some people would get confused but I think the movie later explains itself. I think the dialogue was good and the acing was excellent. I really liked the character building throughout the movie and I also like the little characters too. I think the scenery was amazing with all the detail which I think plays an important part in any movie but especially this one. I think that this movie is appealing to younger children because of the whole pirate and sword-fighting theme but older people because the more deeper side of the storyline.

I hadn't watched a movie in several years and I'm glad this was my intro back. The good guys are really good and the bad guys really bad but Johnny Depp manages to be both really good and really bad. His character is what every gal dreams of; a bad boy with a good heart. I found myself wanting to use some of the lines in it in everyday life especially the daring do's. Over all the films ability to draw you in is amazing. Every time I think of it I smile.</fullReview>

Orlando Bloom is brilliant and Keira Knightley is not half bad. The movie was fast paced, had a good storyline and was acted out brilliantly. I loved it!My only thought now is that I was under the impression that the movie had tied up all it's loose ends at the endings.

		<fullReview>While I absolutely loved this movie, and while I have been a huge fan of Johnny Depp's since "Benny &amp; Joon", I must say that toward the end of the movie I found Depp's portrayal a little cloying. Most of his portrayal was GREAT FUN, but toward the end when the Black Pearl and crew arrived at the Isle de la Muerta, his actions and mannerisms got so repetitious that I just wanted the movie to be over. It didn't help when one of the pirates explained his behavior to Orlando Bloom's character.I read later that Depp said he had based his performance on Keith Richard(s). I've spent time around Keith in the past and, while that "wavy gravy" thing he does is indeed one of his mannerisms, he does not go around acting like that every split second. Sorry, Johnny, but your portrayal during the last third of the movie was a little over the top for me.Nonetheless, I eagerly await the second and third installments of "Pirates" -- glad to have the blighters back in my life!!! Watching Keith "portray" a pirate (and Depp's father) should be worth more than one bottle o' rum!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having fond childhood memories of old pirate movies and stories, I was really looking forward to watch this one. I certainly didn't expect some brain challenging epic, but good entertainment. I was disappointed.Many things may be said of old, classic movies, but one thing is certain, they generally had good scripts. What has happened to good Hollywood scriptwriters? Don't they exist anymore or are they all working for TV at HBO? This film has a potentially good story and a completely pathetic script that results in a plot that most of the time makes no sense whatsoever, with bad dialogue lines, and awkward twists trying to disguise as "complex turns". Simple bad writing.At least they got someone witty to write Captain Jack Sparrow's lines. Without doubt, the one outstanding thing about this movie is Johny Deep's character and his rendition of it. It is very funny and thoroughly enjoyable. Depending how you look at it, Deep's performance is either wasted in this movie, or saves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In theory, Pirates Of The Caribbean really could have been a good film. What with Johnny Depp playing the campest pirate ever and a young couple at the centre of it who just want to get together were it for those damn undead pirates and the woman's fiancée. Such inspired ideas however admirable can not salvage this film. Under the hand of director Gore Verbinski, Pirates Of The Caribbean dispenses with character development, comic timing and structure in favour of constant frantic movement and an eagerness make sure that something is exploding, somebody is falling down a trap or Johnny Depp is eliciting a wisecrack every two seconds. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom are hopelessly bland when they should be appealing while the visuals suggest a much cheaper film than its $115 million budget would have you believe. Some critics have noted that Pirates would have benefit from a 45 minute truncation of its running but even in its first quarter of an hour, I found myself getting bored. The script is also weak, with Saturday morning cartoon show level humour and not one inspired moment. The only notable thing about this film is the clever CGI used on the undead pirates and the lenience (and some might say praise) with which critics have graced it.Do yourself a favour and see Disney's Peter Pan instead, it's a funnier, more technically groundbreaking, more artistically credible and infinitely more entertaining pirate film than this two and a half hour bore. It'll probably keep your kids more entertained too, not to mention it being more suitable for them.</fullReview>

It's a fantastic movie. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie.

Depp), great costumes and locations, nice looking effects, humor, cool characters, swordfights, ghosts, romance, great villains. WOW!! In short, this movie is awesome. And besides, pirates are cool!The best thing about the film is, without a doubt, J. Depp's character: Jack Sparrow (sorry, I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow). Depp delivers an outstanding performance, effectively shadowing everyone else, as the goofy, somewhat crazy pirate captain, proving once again he is a great actor.If you expect deep ideas and dealing with important issues you won't find it here, but if you just want to be entertained and have a whole lotta fun I strongly recommend Pirates of the Carribean. I give it 9 out of 10 simply because of the fact that it provides 2 hours of great fun no matter how many times you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another one of those highly over-popular films like the Lord of the rings trilogy. Of the main cast, the only two actors that I liked were Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, but the rest, especially the over-pretty girl, all make me cringe. The people that made the film were obviously intending to make a swashbuckling classic, but instead they made a swashbuckling pile of cow diarrhoea. It is insulting in the memory of such real swashbuckling heroes of the cinema, such as Erroll Flynn. If this film had been made in the 1930s it would have been a million times better without a doubt, basically because it would be entirely different. I am going to get murdered by the entire world's population of women for saying this, but Orlando Bloom is nothing but another one of those really annoying pretty-boys, but, to be fair, that is just the opinion of an ugly teenager who has to go into school each week and watch all those bloody pretty-boys snogging whoever they want, while all the girls look at me and in disgust. But in my opinion, being ugly and being well aware of the fact isn't such a bad thing. It makes you wiser. But that has nothing to do with the film that I am reviewing so why the hell am I talking about it? Anyway this film is pointless and overlong and completely pathetic, and I am pretty sure that if pirates knew that this film was going to be made, they would have decided to become regular bank-robbers. 5/10 (I am giving it such a high score for Geoffrey Rush's sake. You rule Geoff.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is a fine actor. I enjoy him in all his roles, and in fact just finished seeing him (again!) as Don Juan Demarco, an underrated movie where he and Brando interact so well. He also did a fine job here as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate without a ship. Keira Knightly is fine as the beautiful maiden in distress. Geoffrey Rush, one of the great and versatile actors of our time, is superb as the evil and wiley nemesis Captain Barbossa. The special effects are very well done, and the cinematography is beautiful. However, both times I have seen it, I was never able to get into the story, the curse, and the pirates who appeared as skeletons under moonlight. It is a good and fun movie, but maybe more for the younger crowd, as my 15-year-old neighbors and my two young grandchildren enjoyed it very much. I don't believe it belongs in the top 250, nor does it warrant the (so far) 34% of '10' votes on the IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, as 99% of Hollywood's productions, was made for kids and teens, or people who think they are still kids. I don´t want to say it's bad or stupid, it's just...like a floppy, disposable, toy. As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One name strikes contempt into this reviewers heart: Jerry BruckheimerHe is to producing what Ron Howard, Peter Weir, and Michael Bay are to directing; a loud, noisy individual with nothing useful to say. Yet what makes this movie so interesting? Does that question need to be answered?This is your only spoiler warning...There are two types of crew to this movie. There's the crew that plays it straight and there's the crew that either elaborates or plays against the norm. The directing is dull, Gore Verbinski still hasn't made any impression on me after 'Mouse Hunt', 'Mexican', and 'Ring'. He's been getting steadily better in his final products though. Is it accident or serendipity? The production designer and editors join him as the clueless individuals.The ones playing against it all are the writers and photographer. Despite the boring incident that was 'Crimson Tide' (another Bruckheimer effort), Wolski showed talent with 'Crow' and 'Dark City'. Here he creates what 'Goonies' wanted to be. The writers come from such notorious work as 'Aladdin', 'Godzilla', 'Small Soldiers', and 'Mask of Zorro', but this shows an actual interest in their work. Stereotypes are played against (the blood of the virgin doesn't break the curse, Depp's mighty boat, etc.) and Depp makes it work.If Depp hadn't been on this excursion then it would have been like 'Waterworld'--nothing remarkable, quickly forgotten. Since Depp knows this material (and is having a lolly-gagging good time with it), he puts a plethora of energy into it. Everyone else is too busy being serious--similar to Burton's first 'Batman'.That has me interested enough to want to look into the sequel.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

This movie gave me the idea i was looking at a movie for kids of the age of 12 or something... fun too watch at home but not in theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp makes this worth watching...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fun stuff, and I think Depp is definitely the best part about the movie. My major qualm with the film is that it was way too long, this could have been cut down to a 90 minute non-stop adventure movie. But instead it gets a little repetitive and unnecessary at times (fighting the undead?).The second major annoyance was that the fight scenes were shot too close. The cinematography was very fast paced and close up (remember Moulin Rouge?), there are really no long drawn out panoramic shots here. This may seem trivial, but I had trouble following the action, it seemed very rushed and inconsistent.The acting was pretty good, given the fairly straightforward, cut and paste adventure movie script. With the exception of Depp's eccentricity, the dialogue is mainly to advance the plot instead of develop any interesting characters. Geoffrey Rush overacts as normal but is an entertaining villain. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are at times a bit stale, but otherwise do a decent job with the material.Overall, Depp is entertaining, and good swashbuckling action is rare these days. I'd give it *** out of four stars...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates certainly was interesting. In fact, some of the droll, dark humor was very unDisney-like (and enjoyably so). But the movie ran about two hours, and would have been better at 90 minutes. Much of it involved sword fights and plot twists that didn't add much. The plot was like a thread that would be dropped for 10 minutes, then picked up again. Johnny Depp was superb. What a strange character he created. It begged the question, though, of how this goof could have lived more than 20 minutes as a pirate. Finally, and a minor spoiler. if you end up cursed for stealing Cortez's gold, didn't the governor's daughter steal the gold from the unconscious boy? Just wondering. A good movie, which is a step in the right direction for Disney, but undisciplined and meandering. We gave it a 6.</fullReview>

Depp's lines weren't really all that funny and niether was a lot of the other unnessecary comic relief... that is unless you were 12 year old or younger. Which is really what this movie is meant for anyway, the kids of summer looking for a good swash buckling Disney flick so they can play pretend pirates in the back yard with their friends. Nice special effects, decent plot, bad characters and couple of decent fight scenes make for a 6 outta 10 in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you still remember those old pirates movies with Errol Flynn, Walter Slezak or Douglas Fairbanks (Sr and Jr) please forget them because this movie has nothing to do with them not only because the means employed are quite more developed but also because we are not in presence of a mere adventure movie but before a movie which combines in well balanced doses comedy, suspense, horror and of course also adventure and action. The images are fairly beautiful making a pleasure for the eye, both static and action ones. The characters are sufficiently typical and convincing and the stereotyped traits of some of them are aimed at making you laugh. And what about the story? Well as you know the story in this kind of movies is always the weakest part with its usual flaws but we must tolerate it as the necessary conducting wire giving a logical sequence to all the scenes. So if you don't have anything better to do or to watch go see this movie. It will keep you fairly amused during more than two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant, thrilling roller coaster-ride, indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be totally honest...I didn't join the hype and the worldwide enthusiasm when this movie was first announced. I was actually worried when I saw the names of Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer listed together on one movie-poster ! I always looked at Johnny Depp as he is Hollywood's last "rebel" and seeing him in a big budget production ( like the average Bruckheimer film is) would mean we've lost him too. By "rebel" I mean that he chooses the roles he really WANTS to play. For himself or for his Hollywood friends ( like Tim Burton for example ) So, in that way, I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Johnny kept his own personal style and personality in this movie. The big money and the huge hype surely hasn't changed his way of film-making. Pirates of the Caribbean is indeed on of the most enjoyable films coming from the last few years and a must see to everyone who likes an original and well made movie. But I wouldn't go so far to call it a masterpiece already. I even saw they've included this film in the list of "250 best movies ever" here on this website...That may be a bit soon, I guess. I prefer to await its status within a few years whether to include it or not.But hey, no complaints from me neither... I saw it 3 times so far and loved every single viewing. Making a good movie about pirates is some sort of achievement to itself, actually. This topic seemed to be "cursed" to itself ( oh, sweet irony ) because the last attempts of telling a story about pirates all resulted in complete failures. Cuttroat Island by director Renny Harlin was a complete disaster and it messed up the career of Geena Davis. Even the brilliant director Roman Polanski didn't succeed in making an interesting movie about pirates when he tried it, back in 1986. Upcoming talent Gore Verbinski ( his version of the Ring was quite good as well) did succeed and I find this to be quite remarkable...especially when you consider the basic idea behind this film is a roller coaster-ride from Disney Wold.Yes, Johnny Depp is great in it. I said it already and he got lots of praising all over the world for his role, so I think it's not necessary to mention him again. We all know Geoffrey Rush is an overtalented actor and Orlando Bloom is well on his way to build up a great career as well ( not many actors his age can say they starred in 4 of the biggest box office hits of all time, even though 3 of them are part of a trilogy ). I didn't know Keira Knightly yet but she looks cute. In general, I think we can say the acting is flawless. There are also enough fascinating plot twists and funny moments in Pirates of the Caribbean thus it's certainly recommended !! I'd already recommend it if it were for the used language alone !! I love expressions like " Ye'd be lost to Davey Jones' Locker" and several other, typical sayings. But if you really think there's absolutely nothing negative to say about this film, I suggest you stop reading now because I do have a few minor comments on it. First of all there the CGI, I complain about this matter on most modern films, but that's because it bugs me so much. I'm still convinced it's possible to create a visual stunning film without the overuse of computer effects but this movie didn't try to do so. Maybe it's for the best, otherwise many (younger) fans wouldn't have liked it. And I do think this motion picture is a bit like its title...too long. I'm not saying it becomes boring but 145 minutes is a bit long to tell the story in my opinion. Furthermore...no remarks. Off you go...watch this film !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance, you can be forgiven for being sceptical about Pirates of the Caribbean. A movie title taken from a slow-moving, Disney theme park ride in a genre in which Hollywood has failed to make any real imprint onto since Errol Flynn's swashbuckling days. On closer inspection, however, Gore Verbinski's latest offering, penned from the writers of Shrek, boasts an impressive cast and a trailer showing just a glimpse of some the amazing CGI special effects that no Summer Blockbuster can do without. So, did Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean 'shiver me timbers' or did it make me want to run off the nearest plank? I am pleased to report that this film more than lives up to the preceding build-up. It looks gorgeous (helped along by the fresh faces of our disgustingly handsome hero, Orlando Bloom and his, 'bonnie lass' Keira Knightley); it has just the right mixture of romance, action and comedy and is a showcase for one of the most mesmerising and innovative performances this year (move over Errol, Mr Depp has landed.) Probably one of the most underrated and the most unconventional actors in Hollywood, Johnny Depp masters the character of Captain Jack Sparrow and creates a half-drunk, half-insane pirate, delivering the gags with almost perfect comic timing and an assortment of hilarious mannerisms. Alongside Depp, Geoffrey Rush plays the villainous Captain Barbossa, doomed to live as a cursed man because of his greed and piracy. Rush ensures that Barbossa is a genuinely creepy character whilst even managing to evoke a degree of sympathy for him as he wanders miserably through life in a desperate struggle to lift his curse.A script containing every ingredient you would look for in a movie of this genre backs up these superb performances. Without ever taking itself too seriously, Pirates of the Caribbean, embraces all of the old pirate clichés, to produce a cracking story, exciting action sequences and enough double-crossing buccaneers to provide one of the most entertaining two and a half hours I have sat through. The CGI special effects create amazing fight scenes as Barbossa and his cursed crew exchange their human bodies for that of ghostly skeletons as they are hit by the glow of the moonlight. All praise goes to the special effects team that created these seamless transformations. Not just a fun Summer Blockbuster but also the movie that has resurrected the swashbuckling genre, Pirates of the Caribbean comes highly recommended. Yo-ho-ho, roll on the sequel!!! 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Piece of Old Fashioned Swashbucklery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not going to be the best film you see this year, maybe not even this month or this week...but it's refreshing and entertaining all the way through thanks to some smart direction, a clever script, and a delightfully off-kilter performance from the master of such turns, Johnny Depp. Here's the reasons I liked this movie so much:1. Johnny Depp is a hoot. Jack Sparrow is by far one of the strangest yet most endearing anti-heroes ever to grace the screen. You never know if he is drunk, crazy, or cleverer than you. All of Depp's quirks and mannerisms and line readings keep you constantly off guard and entertained.2. Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of some of the biggest film travesties ever ("Armageddon," "Pearl Harbor") actually hired a director who can sustain a shot, control epic scenes, pace a film, and set atmosphere without tricky camera movements or overused special effects (finally a summer movie where the effects aren't wall to wall CGI and actually seem special). By delivering this after "The Ring" Gore Verbinksi proves he is the best for-hire/hack director working in Hollywood. He's into the old-fashioned razzle-dazzle type of film-making, you know the kind that doesn't give you a headache and has some scope and where you can actually tell what is going on in big action set pieces. He can do family films ("Mouse Hunt"), horror thrillers ("The Ring"), and now big-budget action adventures. Though he shows no signs of being an auteur or having any kind of grander scheme to his work, I can't wait to see what he tackles next.3. The film has a bloated run-time (almost two and a half hours) but it's not because it takes itself too seriously or knocks you out with set piece after set piece. You see, for the first thirty to forty minutes this film actually provides exposition and develops characters. What a novel idea! I had almost thought Hollywood forgot how to do that.4. Last, but certainly not least, Kiera Knightly. She's got spunk, she's hot, has a British accent, and some of the most natural acting chops of any young actress working today.It made me forget that it was based on a Disney theme park ride and that Big Jerry B bankrolled the whole shebang. All in all a heck of a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*I had low expectations for this one. A movie based on a Disney theme park ride reeked of desperation. The trailer didn't help me either. "You want pain? Try wearing a corset!" Ah ha ha ehhh. My brother saw it and said it was fantastic. He wanted to see it again. This is a guy who only goes to the movie theater if the movie really excites him. The last flick he saw in the theater was "The Two Towers". So I went with his advice and saw it with him.Upon arriving in the theater, I noticed the crowd was made up of mostly little kids. This was the first warning sign that I was at the wrong movie. Then came the coming attractions. After seeing trailers for "Brother Bear" and "Freaky Friday", I was sweating bullets. I started envisioning a movie in which pirates were singing and dancing to "Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum" while families floated by on rides taking pictures. Happily, the movie surprised me."Pirates of the Caribbean" is a ton of fun. There are three reasons. One, the immense amount of sword fighting action. The movie's motto: When in doubt, add a sword fight. Two, Johnny Depp. He is hilarious as Capt. Sparrow. He was born to play a pirate. I could go for the continued adventures of Capt. Sparrow. Three, the ghoul/zombie angle for the pirates. If they were just normal pirates kidnapping a pretty girl, the movie would not have been half as cool as it was. The special effects were outstanding. Geoffrey Rush was also very good."Pirates of the Caribbean" is one of the best movies of the summer. Well worth seeing. I had a lot of little kids babbling and having to go to the bathroom at my theater. Maybe I need to see it again too.</fullReview>

But as far as the plot goes, half the time it just felt like this confusing mess. And while I loved how Jonny Depp looked in this film, I didn't like the way his character was written. I felt like I was watching Richard Simmons in a pirate costume! I think I would have liked this movie better had it been more of a horror film instead of an adventure movie. I think it would have worked scary. I would have liked Depp's character to have been tougher. I guess this movie is okay if you like pirate films, but it just wasn't what I wanted. I would love to see it redone with alot of horror, but I know I'm dreaming. So, see it for the costumes, but don't expect it to be a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, what can I say.. Johnny Depp, looking like Alice Cooper meets the Scarlet Pimpernell meets Bob Marley and sounding like Oscar Wilde after too much absinth plays Jack Sparrow the overthrown captain of a band of cuthroats. The mutinous pirates are now led by a deliciously ruthless Captain Barbosa played to the teeth by Geoffrey Rush. They are in search of the final pieces of Cortez'zzzzzz Aztec Gold so they can lift the curse of Moctezuma and stop running around in a disheveled pirate vessel known as the Black Pearl. All it takes is some special ingredient and the curse will be lifted and the guys can go around carousing and raping and pilaging and enjoy the whole thing rather than spend eternity as unsatisfied and perpetually ticked-off skeletal spooks. Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith Will Turner who has a bit of pirate in him and wonders why, and Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, daughter of the Governor who knows why. All in all good squash-buckler of a film that has little to do with the ride of the same name save one scene in Tortuga which looks remarkably like the raping and pilaging that goes on in the Disney attraction. The skeletal capuchin monkey was a nice touch. makeup gets high marks, although Depp should be hung for his excessive use of eye shadow and sparkle disco glitter..come on Johnny, who are you fooling?Apparently the music by Klaus Badelt, was a direct RIP OFF of Gladiator, because Klaus Badelt did the incidental music for Gladiator. What did you think Klaus, no one would notice? So if you ignore the music stolen from another film, Pirates is good fun. Not a keeper, but fun just the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was first planning to view this film I must admit my expectations where not that high. After all, the title did give a cheesy feel to the whole thing. However, I must say that within 10 minutes of the film I was completely spellbound by the film, characters, and plot. The fight scenes where well done and not over dramatized, the animation of the skeletons was smoothly done, and the acting was incredible. The most surprising factor was how Johnny Depp played his character Jack Sparrow. Normally I am not a Depp fan per say, I enjoy his work but I don't exactly find myself fascinated by it. This role, however, gave me a whole different view of how truly talented Depp is as an actor. Depp took on a whole different role that even varied in the way his character Sparrow carried himself and mastered it like it was nothing.Bloom was also a pleasant surprise. A few minutes into the film in you completely forgot about the elf and focused on the character in front of us. After seeing Bloom in this film I can honestly say that he is not a typecast and will well be on his way to the top. Rush was excellent as usual and portrayed his role as `a captain so evil Hell spat him out' with such humanity you actually felt a bit sorry for the cursed pirate.All in all, this film is a rare gem to come from behind the Disney vaults. Along with the superb acting the writing, camera movement, plot, and timing was perfect. Not once did you feel the length of the movie setting in like `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' or like watching `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' a third time. Humor, drama, action, and adventure where perfectly balanced out to make this film the movie of the summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've seen it, but at least there's a chance now that it will fall out of the top 250.I even bought the DVD of it because everyone said it is sooooooo great, and I actually hoped that it might be something like a film version of Monkey Island, which might be the best adventure computer game ever made.I was totally disappointed, it was supposed to be a comedy, but only moderately funny, and I dragged myself through watching it (maybe I fast forwarded it, I'm not sure) and sold the DVD afterwards.I really don't get what's so great about it? Just an average Disney story, a well known, good looking actor and a huge marketing hype, so that even all the movie critics and the Oscar jury believe that it is a good move doesn't make it good. If it's not entertaining or contains a great, unusual idea, it could at least have contained some serious message, but of course also didn't - so I just don't get it why everyone likes it.At least I got most of my money back, but I still hope that some day there will be a real movie using the Monkey Island Plot.What I've learned: Never buy a DVD (at least not for full price) just because everyone says it's great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's not exactly true of this overblown, over-budgeted, over-long, and over-praised piece of garbage. I've seen plenty of things that were worse. But this movie, which is somehow at the time of this writing on IMDb's Top 250 page, was something I greatly anticipated seeing in theaters.But I, like so many other fans of genuine cinema, was deceived and betrayed. That is because this movie is just another in a *huge* line of recent (dating back to the '80s) films that favor massive amounts of special effects, action, and star power over any semblance of substance. The special effects are good at certain parts (I like the curse reveal), but you can tell they sucked up *far* too much money. And the action is well-conceived, but a two-year-old could execute it a darn sight better. And star power? Don't get me started-- it's sad to think that Johnny Depp has ever been considered as being in that category. He has no talent, no taste, and no respect for either himself or his audience. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have potential-- but it all goes seeping out of their heads from just being around Depp (watch the movie; I think you can see the leaks!)While not wholly poisonous, this dim and dull "blockbuster" is pretty terrible. This is another high-profile example of the recent cheapening of the American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with some friends at the cinemas a long time ago and I'm reviewing it now because ads on TV about the sequel jogged my memory. I can see now that Curse of the Black Pearl is very popular among IMDb members, especially among females and young people. If you are a young female you are much more likely to think you enjoyed this movie than if you are an old man. That's what the demographic breakup statistics say. I remember being very disappointed with this film and one reason why I was disappointed was because it was so long. I remembered getting up at the end of the film and because the film was so long my butt was aching as if someone had jabbed a needle in it. I am not averse to long movies but this one in particular was just not at all entertaining. The first reason for this lack of entertainment I think is the behavior of the characters. Johnny Depp's character is deliberately crazy. If one of my friends were to act like that in real life I would stare at him and after some time I would ask him, "Man, what is wrong with you?" In this movie, I am consistent with my behavior and badly wanted to ask Johnny Depp's character what was with the crazy behavior, but of course Depp is just acting and I obviously can't talk to the character through the theater screen, so that just left me feeling frustrated. Most of the movie is filled with humor that I didn't find funny at all, but many in the audience obviously thought it was very funny. As with the Depp character the humor was just crazy and weird, but of course humor is very subjective so it's a matter of taste I suppose.Another issue I'd like to bring up are the fight scenes, which I thought were very disappointing as well. The reason is because they were very plain. Usually in a fight scene I like to see something coherent. I want the camera to stay and I want the fight participants to engage in intense, suspenseful, but also aesthetically pleasing fights. The fight scenes in this film don't have that elegance. A bunch of people just get together and the camera cuts and shakes as if we're looking at everything from the perspective of a drunk man.The plot is another sorry part of the movie. That woman (as you can see I'm not good with names) was your typical annoying pretentious woman and at the end when she kisses the guy I actually said out aloud in the theater, "Oh, please!" How clichéd can you get? It's like a fairy tale your parents might read to you as a kid.</fullReview>

Because Will's farther, Boot Strap Bill, was sent to Davey Joan's Locker, after the treasure was taken from the casket, therefore he could not appease the cure for the treasure he stole. Therefore, the blood of his siblings must be used to represent him as the pirates return the gold to the casket and appease the curse. Hope that helps in explaining the plot hole, well, that's how I and my mates saw it.This is one of those rare films I can watch again and again and again, because it is so entertaining!

The storyline is pathetic and boring and dull. The initial action is limp and dull. In fact dull is the key word. Dull and boring and bad and wooden. And how on earth did this ever get filmed. Surely it can't be that hard to make an exciting, interesting and worthy pirate movie in such pleasant locations? The movie does pick up toward the end with some decent fight scenes, and a bit of swashbuckling, but it's too little too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has several good reasons to go and see it:1) It's funny, exciting well worth seeing.2) Its got Johnny Depp. Reason enough. You'll like Jack Sparrow far more than Will Turner, I can guarantee that.3) Geoffrey Rush. Again, enough reason to see it. I wouldn't call him frightening, just scarily cool, dark and ugly. Very different role to the voice over of Nigel the Pelican.If you like him 4) Orlando Bloom... not good reason. He's pretty. Can't say much else about him though. He was better in Lord of the Rings. He's better being silent, elf-like and graceful. 5) Keira Knightley... *shudders*... is better off playing people like Jules in Bend It Like Beckham: half friendly and half bitchy. Bizarre face: she's got a dazzling smile but a really pinched disgusted look the rest of the time. Not the best choice foe Elizabeth Swann.6) Johnny Depp again.7) It's fun. Really. And its got really impressive effects. It might not be the best pirate film to come out for a while, but it enjoyable all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirate lovers have been waiting for a movie like this since the days of `Waterworld' and `Cutthroat Island.' Set in Port Royal, an island historically associated with pirates, and based on a Disney world ride, the movie follows Orlando Bloom as a sword smith with a dark past, who enlists the help of famed pirate (Depp) to rescue the object of his affections (Knightly). To go in more detail would take hours because, unfortunately the plot's long-winded and has more twists and turns than one can keep up with in one sitting. Nevertheless, while Pirates veers into the basic formulas and clichés of any other pirate movie, it does so with purpose and style, to make a quality ride out of a familiar outing. The movie also has some truly original elements, most notably Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow, a name you'll remember long after you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised about the great rating this movie got. It's basically just stereotype and rumination of old themes. It's done in an ok way but there's nothing really special. The effects were up to date as one would expect. And yes, Johnny Depp is a very good actor. But was this movie witty, inventive, creative or... pensive? None. To make it a good movie it should have had some of these qualities. Once the [i]curse[/i] is revealed the plot drags on lengthily. Yes, you know right from the start who is at the bottom of it (after all, you don't cast J. D. for nothing). And yes, the 'love' story with the two youngsters and the evil Brit (the villain is British, how new! [b]yawn[/b]) is genuinely disingenuous. Don't get me wrong, I always enjoy love stories, this one too, and a young'un that fights for his love is always engaging. But they would have done the actors more justice if they'd missed out on [b]some[/b] clichés.I wouldn't watch it twice. As a friend of mine put it 'it's a silly movie'. Come to think of it, I think that's a compliment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Rare This Summer As a Black Pearl.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer where most everything has been little more than shark bait, it is refreshing to see a truly enjoyable blockbuster like "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". A production that is very reminiscent of those old Saturday serials and even more closely the "Indiana Jones" trilogy that dominated the 1980s, the movie is a dominant success by the time it completes its voyage. It is the mid-1700s and the breathtaking Keira Knightley (who has already made a name for herself this year with "Bend It Like Beckham") has been kidnapped by a band of ghostly pirates led by the always dependable Geoffrey Rush. It seems that Knightley possesses a medallion that may bring Rush and his crew back to life. However the medallion is far from one of a kind and it is far from certain if Knightley is even the person they need for their deviant scheme to work. Now it is up to blacksmith Orlando Bloom (who has become an international sensation with "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy) and outrageous pirate Johnny Depp (in arguably his finest role) to save the day. Knightley's uptight father (Jonathan Pryce) and would-be fiance (Jack Davenport) add well-timed comedic turns in limited action. Director Gore Vabinski (who impressed me verily last year with the atmospheric thriller "The Ring") is beginning to show a real knack for handling large productions. Admittedly the film is a little long and suffers from sometimes uninspired writing, but the strong cast and the mind-blowing visual effects are more than enough to make "Pirates of the Caribbean" one of the more likable productions of 2003. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003) ***1/2 Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathyn Pryce, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Damian O' Hare. Rip-roaring adaptation of the Disney theme park attraction (!) about a cursed platoon of pirates haunting the Caribbean in search of gold (and their souls) leading to a final confrontation with the owner of a certain trinket that holds the curse intact. Depp is a marvel of physical shtick and with comic aplomb steals the movie with his unusual choice of vocal (think a particularly cagey Keith Richards) and acrobatic maneuvers from swordplay to flights of fancy. Bloom holds his own as the straight-man like hero out to save the damsel in distress (the fetching Knightley) while battling the raggedly nasty villainous Rush as the captain of the doomed. Fun, fast and a true treat for all audiences that sends-up the genre it clearly embraces and salutes thanks to a witty script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio with Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert; an amazing production design by Brian Morris and skillful direction by Gore Verbinksi.</fullReview>

I know it's not a serious film but actor decisions are and either he or the director made some very bad choices for the Captain Sparrow character. He was so swishy. Who is the hero in this film? No one. I didn't care about any of these people. In addition, this is a two joke movie: 1) Look mom. The pirates turn into skeletons in the moonlight at least 1567 times. Isn't that fun? 2) Look mom. An eyeball has a fork in it and it rolls along the ground and it falls out of that guys face and...Isn't that fun? Nope. It isn't fun or funny or interesting after the first time. And although the combat scenes are well choreographed - ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!! I fell asleep twice. I was sooooo disappointed. I really wanted to like this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" has to be one film I'm addding to my "Worst Films of 2003" list."Pirates" has to be "one" of the oddest, strangest, most over-the-top, far out, blockbuster film's of the summer 2003 lot. For starters, director Verbinski isn't enough of a stylist to pull off the script's delicate balancing act. As he showed with the "The Mexican" Verbinski has problems finding just the right tone between humor and adventure. The film is never quite funny enough to make us forget that dramatically it's pretty slim stuff. With is combination of action, comedy, over the top acting, big sets and one-liners this movie couldn't be taken too seriously for an action film and it so far off the map that it couldn't be called a comedy.For one thing Johnny Depp, who delivers what has to be the strangest lead performance in a $150 million Hollywood production to date, and has to be the only one brave enough to play a gay drunk pirate this side of the Caribbean. Wait until you see what Depp does here. You can't take your eyes off him!! He is funny, crazy and he over takes every single scean he is in. Even Geoffrey Rush is over shadowed by Depps's over the top performance.Geoffrey Rush was great in his role as Barbossa, and it shows what a great actor Geoffrey Rush really his; and how multi-talented he really his even when he sells out to crap like "The Banger Sisters" or "pirates" He can make a really bad role work for him. But it was Depp's film and he ran with it!Keira Knightley, well not much to say except she is a really bad actress and how many times do we have to set her either wet or getting her clothes ripped off with out once having bad hair or runny make-up?Orlando Bloom was flat, his character was a cardbaord cut out of every single character out to rescuse the woman he loves and finds himself an adventure."Pirates" was a bad movie, but Depp's over the top performance was the best thing and the only thing besides the over top F/X and interesting story line that keeps this mess afloat!Yes folks; the story had promise. Real promise. But somewhere between directors Gore Verbinski ideas, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer's ideas the story somehow merged 2 diffrent out looks with no real mediuem. The whole film felt like "Treasure Island" meets "The Fog"!With a running time of two hours plus, "Pirates of the Caribbean" feels terribly flabby, even the over the top battle scenes are so drawn out we start to lose interest.Depp's odd performance should probably make this film live on as a cult classic and become recognized by film buff's as a bad film that we love.One word to describe "Pirates" is "BIZZARE"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, what the hell happened? Yesterday, I checked here to see what people were thinking of this movie, and judging by the comments, it looked like a good movie to see with my girlfriend.Ugh, not even close. I gave this movie a 3 in the vote, and that was for its only redeeming feature, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Without the characterization he gave, this movie had nothing, nothing to hold my interest.The love story was uninvolving. The pirates were kind of cool, and the action was decent. But you know things are going bad when at one point in the movie, you're laughing because the lead actress's lipstick glaringly sticks out considering her circumstances at the time. Set in colonial times, and lacking access to anything remotely resembling Revlon, I couldn't decide to laugh or groan at such poor makeup, direction, and review.The only reason I would recommend this movie to anyone is if someone is a fan of Johnny Depp. He was excellent. But rent it, don't spend your money at the theater for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say `Pirate Movie' in a crowded theater and you're likely to be facing a mutiny or a stampede, and for good reason: the rollicking adventures popularized by Robert Louis Stevenson and brought to life by Errol Flynn have, of late been replaced by overblown soulless drivel along the lines of Polanski's `Pirates' or `Cutthroat Island'. Jerry Bruckheimer and Johnny Depp to the rescue.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is quite likely the unluckiest pirate alive: after having suffered the ignominy of mutiny and being marooned, he finds his way to port in the one town that has a serious hate on for pirates. If that weren't enough to spoil his already bad day, Sparrow is thrown back into the fray when he promises young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) that he will help rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the young woman kidnapped by Sparrow's old enemies. Oh, and there's that pesky little curse to contend with?Let me state from the outset - this is a fantastic movie that epitomizes what a summer movie should be. It features oodles of action ? both in the form of swashbuckling sword fights and big time explosions, is packed full of accessible humor, boasts great special effects (note: not gratuitous), has beautiful and eerie locations, nasty villains, reformed heroes and fantastic performances. Am I making it clear that I liked this movie?Orlando Bloom is solidly low key in his first post `Lord of the Rings' outing, and makes good use of the martial skills he leaned while filming the trilogy. His character is equal parts tragic and noble, and he balances these the facets well. While Elizabeth could be rightly classified as the obligatory damsel-in-distress of the piece, she most certainly is not helpless ? Knightley brings the same determined empowerment that she displayed in `Bend it Like Beckham'. You have to give props to any woman who can act and kick butt while bound in a corset and frilly fluffy dresses (and yet somehow manages to look even more beautiful while doing so ? forgive me, I'm only human?). Geoffrey Rush is deliciously devilish as Captain Barossa the dark hearted scoundrel of the piece, the, who dispenses death the with a smile. You know he's bad just by looking at the man's teeth! And then there's the Depp factor.Johnny Depp could long ago have been a major Hollywood star ? he certainly has the charisma, the drive and enough talent for a few careers ? however he's made a conscious decision to stick with character driven films, which are often only found in artsy or edgy films. Thankfully he chose to tackle this role with the same fervor? Depp is hilarious as John Sparrow, the glib roguish pirate cursed with a streak of goodness and bad luck, who seemingly dances between madness and lucidity. To say that his portrayal binds the film would not be indulging in hyperbole, as he brings all the elements of the story and the characters together. Is that all there is you might ask? Not even close.****Okay, I'm going to give you a warning here ? if you haven't seen the trailers some potential spoilers lay ahead****. The CGI work in this films is remarkable on several fronts: the film does not rely upon them, they are not excessive and they actually enhance the film. The characters' transition from human to skeleton and back (there sequences are rapid and many) are amazingly fluid and realistic. Need more? The swordfighting are beautifully choreographed, the city sets are brilliant, the pyrotechnics in the battle scenes are pure Buckheimer (read: big, loud, and many) and the film is also fit for the youngsters.If you're in the market for a film that will appeal to anyone between the ages of 5 to 95 , look no further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arr, this movie be overrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a slew of classic films that haven't made it into the IMDb top 250, but at the time of writing, "Pirates of the Caribbean" has achieved a comfortable place among the best films of all time - presumably because Kiera Knightley is hot and Johnny Depp is funny, right? I mean, I can't think of any sensible reason.Truth is, this is a fun little potboiler that is way too long (people complain that Harry Potter is padded?) and completely lacking in anything resembling drama. The script has the same cringe-inducing qualities as the average Hollywood blockbuster, including the Mandatory Irksome Catchphrase that is continuously spouted by characters even though it wasn't funny the first time ("they're not rules...more like guidelines!"). If Depp didn't spend the whole movie wobbling and acted brain-fried, viewers would all be bored to tears.I must confess that the sets and costumes are impressive, and I enjoyed seeing the spectral pirates marching to attack the ship. I can see liking this movie - I can even see loving it - but a classic? I think everybody gave "Pirates of the Caribbean" an "8" because it's a crowd-pleaser, and somehow that's enabled it to rise way above where it ought to be in the rankings, which is definitely somewhere below "The French Connection."P.S. Forgive a quick aside about Roger Ebert. I like his reviews of classic movies, but he seems out-of-touch when commenting on recent ones; he thinks "Van Helsing" is better than "Spider-Man," for example, and he labels the third Harry Potter the weakest in the series. Most bizarrely of all, he argues that Kiera Knightley is not attractive in this movie. Does anyone, in the entire Universe, agree with that assessment?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from Johnny Depp's Quirky performance -- always worth watching -- this was a pretty lame attempt at action-comedy. The special effects were of course competent, and the camera work was good, but the writing and plot were thin and amateurish. Perhaps I should not have expected more, given that it's just a Disney SFX vehicle with a bankable lead, but I thought this fell far short of the hype. The apparent premise that some of them were dead and cursed to go on and on ... it seemed to change somehow toward the end, as if no one was sure what the rules really were. It's set up of course for a seQuel, probably even lamer than this one.

		<fullReview>Without Johnny Depp, this basically animatronic mess would have been ignored by anyone with half a brain. But the general reactions to it underscore one aspect in particular: popular films, whether truly good or truly bad, have lately demonstrated that a large component of the viewing audience haven't a clue about what constitutes good cinematic art.While many of us of a certain age look at movies as an extension of dramatic art moving forward in time from Aristophanes to Arthur Miller, just as many if not more of us seem to evaluate them based primarily on the sort of criteria usually reserved for rating computer games and cartoons. Literature and history be damned; if it ain't got visual sparks, it ain't no good.I did manage to stay awake through this one, wondering from time to time what the hell I was doing it for. Depp provided the sole depth, an ironic gem in the midst of a sea of motile muck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you hate to pan, everyone on screen seems to be trying so hard to make something out of the material. Sometimes, even the best efforts can't rescue a plot thinner than the skins of the villains. And therein lies the problem. All the special effects, all the fencing, and ship to ship fighting, can't rescue this film. Given the lack of a story worth hanging a hat on, Johnny Depp does his best to give the film a center, but he is undercut. On one side is Geoffrey Rush chewing scenery faster than it can be built. I keep hoping to see him in a role that requires some subtlety, because I believe he is capable of greater things than anything I've seen him in recently. On the other side are Orlando Bloom and Kira Sedgewick gamely trying to give the film some romance. If only they were given some material to work with. At best, this film is a good way to spend a couple of hours where the alternative is banging your head against the wall.</fullReview>

There's also a lot of bridges that doesn't really add anything to the action (the movie tops 140 minutes), which only becomes an annoyance. Fun for 11-year olds mayhap, but for us a bit older...

Depp created a real character here, no matter how campy he is. Unfortunately, once the pirates invade the port and the story concentrated on them, the film became really tedious and I didn't care about anything. The film should have concentrated more on Sparrow and the two other characters. The pirates, or ghosts, are devices and it's almost impossible to care for them. The story became sillier and sillier and Depp, who's the ONLY good thing in this movie, went missing for long periods of time. Bloom and the actress were pretty much flat.

		<shortDescription>Another Bad Bruckheimer Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing memorable about 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' will be Johnny Depp's usual out-standing performance.I can only hope that this 'Blockbuster' featurette won't do for his acting career what "Leaving Las Vegas" did to Nick Cage's. Remember Nicholas Cage, a quirky, interesting actor who was almost always worth watching, no matter how bad the movie? Then his big moment in "Leaving Las Vegas", and he hasn't done a thing worth watching on-screen since then, including his woefully lackluster performance in Martin Scorcese's 1999 film, "Bringing Out The Dead", where Mr. Cage would only be considered interesting in contrast to John Goodman's typically bombastic, bizarre, supporting-actor overdoses.Now it's Mr. Depp's turn as an actor. Either he will continue to pick and choose his movies based on the merit he sees in them as an actor, along the lines of the late, great, Gregory Peck, and the still living, and equally astounding, Meryl Streep; or, he will pick and choose his movies based on how much money someone is willing to pay him for his 'appearing in' their studio's (insert studio name) production of (insert producer's name and/or production company name) film directed by (insert director's name), and starring (insert actor's name).I am rooting for the uniqueness of Johnny Depp, of course.For a movie as over-produced as "Pirates of the Caribbean" is, with the occasional well-done special effect (which should be a given considering the money spent), and interesting costuming (especially in the 'heaving-bossoms' scenes), some of the 'special effects' come off rather mediocre in comparison to better done summer fodder. The distance shot of the burning Port would have been at home in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds". The underwater skeleton-walking scenes looked like out-takes from "Clash of The Titans".The humor of the movie is also in question, first during the looting of the British Naval Port and attacks on it's citizens by the pirates, with scenes of murder and attempted rape, played on film as quasi-comedy (in someone's seriously disturbed idea of entertainment); and also during the scenes when British Sailors are being slaughtered left and right onboard their own ship, immediately after the Pirates' underwater skeleton-walking scene, although these sailors are mostly being dis-embowelled off-screen so as to further distance us from contemplating the possibility of their deaths, and we are coerced instead into laughing at a Pirate's severed boney claw, clutching for the cowardly Governor Swann's throat. A character foppishly over-played by Jonathan Pryce. Can anyone say "Vincent Price" cheese-ball?The dashingly pretty Orlando Bloom, as Will Turner, barely registers a ripple of a human nuance, rather like observing an interesting wall-paper. Likewise for Keira Knightley, as his longed-to-be-statuette-on-a-pedestal, Elizabeth Swann, the (of course!) Governor's daughter. For a good acting comparison see Kate Winslett in "Titanic". Both parts seemingly conceived by a group of writers discovering cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark religious icons for the first time and attempting to pass them off as feminine Heaven.On screen for an hour too long, with convoluted plot 'twists' packing the wallop of moist cardboard, character actors required to do uninteresting comic 'bits' that might amuse a two-year old, screen-writing that barely rises to a fourth grade school play, wooden acting filmed along the lines of "Stand there and don't move while we shoot the scene", yet another 'typical' Hollywood feel-good ending, and, voila!, this summer's simple-minded Block-Buster movie is completed.On to the usual mass-merchandising, burger chain tie-ins (no matter how oddly far-fetched), and 'direct-to-DVD' sequel(s)! Thank you very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp is the only real treasure here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God bless Johnny Depp, for without him "Pirates of the Caribbean" would be just another empty big budget studio extravaganza - juvenile, bloated and over-reliant on stunt work and special effects. But thanks to Depp's brave and witty performance, the film rises above its own inherent weaknesses to become at least a halfway entertaining picture. He is the real treasure here."Inspired" - if one dares use so lofty a term - by the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, "Pirates" takes us to the never-never land of swashbuckling heroes and shiver-me-timbers foolishness. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who was left for dead on an island by his mutinous crew. Sparrow, captain of the legendary Black Pearl, a ship with the reputation for possessing evil, unearthly powers, has now returned from his exile and is ready to exact revenge on the mates who abandoned him. There's really no point in thrashing out the complicated but essentially simpleminded plot here. Suffice it to say that it involves a diabolical curse, a literal ghost ship with a literal skeleton crew, a feisty damsel-in-distress and enough repetitive swordplay and "avast me, hardy" dialogue to keep the action adventure crowd purring with contentment.For all the care that has gone into the look of the film - the costumes, set design and computer-generated special effects - "Pirates of the Caribbean" would sink pretty quickly were it not for Depp giving his all to keep it afloat. His lisping, flamboyant, over-the-top approach to the character is exactly what this stale little tale needs to lift it above the ordinary. One has only to see Depp mincing around - where anyone else in the part would have been swaggering - to verify what we have known all along about Depp as an actor, which is that he is willing to take risks and explore different avenues when tackling a role, even one as lightweight and insubstantial as this one. He turns what could have been a mere walk-through, check-cashing part into an inspired comic turn. One can only imagine what a boring movie this would have been without him. For, indeed, the story itself is silly and the other characters (except for Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain Barbossa) stiff, dull and uninteresting. But Depp is the real deal, and all I can say is that I hope he received a large percentage of the film's phenomenal box office booty. Like any good pirate, he deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, dear Disney fans your dreams have come true. Your youth can be prolonged. There is an other formula that will turn the average adult into a giggling teenager. I have seen it happen in a big cinema in my city. Mature folk that went hysterical by the dozen as flying cutlery landed in eyeballs. Please man, stop it! Go see a flick to get out of the daily routine, but please stay a bit critical. Just for the record: These words do not sprout from the mind of a bitter person, but from a bitterly disappointed one. Once again a great concept has been completely overdone in the wrong direction. It has been said before and that does strengthen me to discuss it one more. This genre is weirdly annoying 'the portrayal of gruesome (in this case 18th century buccanic) violence combined with Uncle Walts very own vision on slapstick'. What is the message and who is supposed to be addressed? Is made for big children or for small adults? In one way you might say that in works for those you have a good time watching this film. In an other way I would like to take great distance from exactly those people over 18 that reward this flick with anything over a 4. Hereby I do so, bunch of gullible kid souls. I declare I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. My mistake, 'cause I had wrongfully set my sights on something like Mutiny On The Bounty (1962 and 1984) meets Master And Commander(2003).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>8.0 is a much too high rating for this good but not great movie. I like the fact that a movie finally does justice to pirate stories. It's strange that this genre, which sure holds a few adventures in store, hasn't been too successful until "Pirates Of The Caribbean" hit the screen. Anyway, "Pirates..." is just that, a funny adventure in the tradition of "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy". It's got everything: ghost pirates, abandoned islands, a beautiful governor's daughter and a brave young hero (or two heroes that is). The dialog is witty although I feel that it could be even wittier. The direction and the special effects were not too special (nothing compared to Gore Verbinski's great job for 'The Ring'). It was funny to see Steve from "Coupling" and Gareth from "The Office" on the big screen for the first time. They should have brought Jeff in as well! All in all "Pirates..." is a fine popcorn movie and surely the summer's best Blockbuster. I hope that maybe after the success of this movie, Hollywood thinks about turning "Monkey Island" (the classic adventure game by LucasArts) into a movie. Just a thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could their be a more over-rated film this year. While okay in part, I think the main reason behind it's success is the fact that some people take a liking to Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. It has problems classifying what type of film it is. Not enough action to be a action film. Not enough laughs to be a comedy. It has also been put up for major awards, yet it is clearly a blockbuster. 'Its both of these,' you may say. That is not the case as the poor attempts at jokes do not work. Johnny Depp probably deserved his Golden Globe nomination, not his Oscar nomination though. His character, along with everyone elses, is one-dimensional and conforms to stereotypes. Bloom plays Legolas very well to say the setting has changed. the other actors are fairly decent in their roles. A plot that i could predict in my sleep and a boring script prevent it from being good. What could have been a great 90 minute blockbuster has been stretched to 2 and a half hours on a plot that cannot manage it.*1/2 out of ****p.s. It has been hyped up recently. If you have'nt seen it yet, don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a stupid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was about the stupidest movie I have seen in quite awhile. The plot was horrible, the writing was bad, and I was soooo happy when this movie was finally over. What kind of crap was this? It was horrible. Johnny Depp did a fair job, and was the only decent character in the film. Geoffrey Rush. Normally a great actor is absolutely horrible here, HORRIBLE!!!!Why did he do this movie? I will admit the first part of the movie did have some good action sequences, but that is the only good part of the film. The rest of it is bloated stupid fantasy. The concept was real good, a high seas pirate adventure, with sword fighting, sailing and all of that, but it slowly turns into a mess.There are so many films out there to watch, do not and I repeat do not watch this one. It is without a doubt one of the stupidest movies I have seen in a long time. Maybe I have missed something though, this made it to the IMDB top 250 list, I think this movie almost belongs on the bottom 250, but it's not quite that bad. I might be alone, but in my opinion, stay away at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is superb. He makes the movie, hands down, and I couldn't imagine it being anywhere near as good without his magnetic, amusing performance.The film/locations look stunning, and the story is good. In fact, there's very little wrong with this fun adventure - the effects are superb (especially fighting in &amp; out of the moonlight) - but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype (everyone I know said it was fantastic, but I see a lot more films than they do).First off, the pacing drags here and there (not really during scenes, but between the set-pieces). The swordfights (and other fighting bits) are inventive, but let down by lacklustre angles and editing.And in the script, they've tried (a bit too hard) to make comedy duos out of two of the royal officers, and two of the pirates, with scenes that would fit right into a Disney cartoon but only serve to hold up the story in this live action film. And while Geoffrey Rush is always great to watch, he just isn't evil enough.In fact, I think that's the real fault of the film - it's written as if it were a cartoon. For a comparison, it's not as good as The Goonies.But go see it. Johnny Depp = most entertaining performance so far this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the cinema without hearing any reviews at all from any newspapers and without reading the reviews from this website. I came out of the movie thinking it was OK, although would have been much better without all that ghost garbage. It's one of those movies I just forgot about from the minute it finished, it left no impact on me at all.A couple of months later I was looking through the IMDb Top250 list and I was absolutely shocked to see this movie was in it, absolutely shocked. I clicked on it to see if it was the same movie I saw because I simply couldn't believe what I was reading. This? In the top 250? What's my point? Well my point is that I thought the movie was ordinary at best. Maybe it's just me? As soon as the ghosts came into play I was instantly turned off by this unrealistic pointless add-on, so maybe this is what sent me to sleep. If it was the ghosts or not, it doesn't matter, I didn't like it.The script and directing were good, so was Johnny Depp's acting. But Depps character gave me a pounding headache and the movies plot, in my mind, was absolutely terrible. Give me a realistic pirate movie, please, what a waste of talent on stupid ghosts.</fullReview>

This sort of treatment was fine during the 1980's when Indiana Jones and the like seemed fresh and fun but surely young cinemagoers are entitled to something more intelligent in 2003 - such as a plot that makes sense, straight acting and some semblance of historical accuracy. And another thing.. where on earth did Johnny Depp get that accent from? He sounded and looked like an inebriated Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poster doesn't do justice to this movie. It has single-handedly brought the genre back from the dead. Yes, the plot requires actual concentration on the details, but that's part of the fun. The pacing is fast when it needs to be; the camera can linger, too. Depp is a wonderful pirate: cocky, self-assured, disarming, dangerous, single-minded. He flouts the rules and rulers with the aplomb one expects of an outlaw. He brings a particular zest to the role that he skews in interesting directions. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann (see Maureen O'Hara in The Black Swan) is one of the few fully-realized female characters in a genre film. Her bravery and longing for adventure are clearly shown as traits held even as a child. So it's no surprise to see her reject the proper suitor and insist on meeting the pirates personally. Orlando Bloom is pretty, but pale except in one smashing fight scene. Fun, fun movie with great outtakes on the DVD. Go see it; then rent Captain Blood, Against All Flags and the Black Swan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Disney films usually have a moral. Here they stretch themselves in several ways beyond the obvious first-time PG-13 rating. The implicit moral here is that it is okay to steal so long as the establishment is unreasonable. And further that there is a higher justice.What's interesting is how the Disney machine works. They'll exploit any cinematic notion they can to give a thrill if that thrill is somehow tied to increased admissions. Disney has the industry's most advanced lab on these matters: they track artistic notions and cognitive science in quest of maturing artistic notions as fodder for their products. This is no collection of artistic types, but serious scientists, intent on engineering your response.Put those two together and here you have an interesting theft: the wholesale adoption of the architectural camera. We saw it in "Nemo" where the whole thing played with the three-dimensionality of the space. We saw it in the second Harry Potter movie, where they paid lots of attention to the placement of the situation in relationship to the actual building of the school. In Hollywood filmdom, this technique -- always locating the camera in relationship to a wall -- was developed by Terry Gilliam. That explains why Depp works so well with the effect. He knows where your eyes are supposed to come from.Rush has worked on four films that reference the placement of self in space. These two together: the good and bad pirates, are both intelligent actors that can listen to the lab. This is an engineered product, openly stolen from others (like the equally well- engineered "Charlies Angels 2").It's not as clever as "Nemo," not something you will actually remember like "12 Monkeys," not something that challenges you like "Panic Room" started out to be, not as self-aware as "Hulk"s swoops. But it uses the same notions, and uses them well enough to give a good ride. Now that this has entered the mainstream, what's next for real creative types?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sailing with her father as a girl, Elizabeth Swann, is on board when the military ship comes across a wreck from which they rescue only a young boy, Will Turner. Elizabeth hides the boy's medallion in order to hide the fact that he is a pirate, she also thinks she sees the mysterious ship The Black Pearl. Years later Elizabeth is being wooed by officers while Will is a blacksmith in her father's service. When her medallion calls out to another force, it brings the crew of the Pearl to the bay in search of the gold. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Will resolves to go after her. He turns to the only man he knows who knows the black pearl ? incarcerated pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. However how can you trust a pirate's word?I'll be honest and say that I didn't want to see this film ? I had been totally turned off by the trailer. The one attempt at humour in the trailer is that awful `try wearing a corset' line, it didn't get a laugh in the film or on the trailer. However I did go and see it and, after Hulk and Matrix, I was very glad I did. The plot is pretty enjoyable allowing for lots of fights but also enough twists and turns to hold the interest. It doesn't all make total sense but, like the ride it is based on, the film moves on before you have time to think too hard about anything.Unlike those other blockbusters I mentioned, POTC doesn't take itself too seriously. It doesn't make fun of itself either, but it does have it's tongue in it's cheek the whole time. This is seen in the vein of gentle humour that runs through it in the dialogue, action and characters ? the film is basically having fun so it is easy for the audience to get with it too.As every other reviewer on earth has said, the biggest strength of the film is Depp's Captain Jack. Playing him like a drugged out rock star who clings to his half-fame like a life raft, Depp wrings so much humour out of every line, every scene and every little thing he does (`but why is the rum on fire?' being my favourite line). It is a performance that could have been awful but he pitches it just perfectly and stops the film ever becoming anything less than fun. The only downside of his character (who makes his appearance on a ship revealed to be a tiny, sinking boat) is that the film sags a little when he is off screen for longer than 5 minutes.Bloom and Knightly carry the film's more serious core and thus have a less glorious job. Both do well however and are good if not quite stars ? certainly I was surprised to see Knightly with such a big role in a big film. Rush enjoys himself as Barbossa and the crew also have fun. The effects are used just as they should always be used ? to compliment the film rather than be the raison d'etre! The effects are good without replacing plot or characters ? they are well blended into the flow so never bring the film to a halt by their use (although wine flowing through and out of Barbossa is pretty impressive).Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal. Sure it is not a classic film or a perfect one, but it does exactly what a summer film should be ? entertain. It doesn't take itself too seriously and moves a long at a fair pace without ever lapsing into impatient editing or flashy visuals. Having said that, if Depp was not onboard the film would be much the lesser. His exaggerated performance enhances the tongue in cheek feel to the film and makes it a much funnier, livelier and all round fun experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp and Knightley are fun to watch, but it's not the rousing adventure I was expecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ** out of ****I saw the movie in the hoopla of all the hype, when most people I knew were proclaiming this one of the summer's best films. Not unexpectedly, I walked into this one with high expectations, hoping for perhaps another Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or even The Mummy. Walking out of the theater a very long two-and-a-half hours later (actually, more like 2 hours 50 minutes, given the previews and the final scene after the credits) (this movie has way too many double crosses and false climaxes), I'm not even sure if this is better than The Mummy Returns.Based off an amusement park theme ride, a lack of solid plot isn't a surprise. Orlando Bloom stars as Will Turner, a dashing blacksmith who's in madly in love with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, a Natalie Portman look-a-like, except she's much prettier and appears to be a better actress). But when she's kidnapped by a group of ghostly pirates (led by Geoffrey Rush), Turner enlists the help of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who appears a few cards short of a complete deck. Dark secrets are unearthed and it is revealed the undead pirates need to make a blood sacrifice to become human again.It's not that Pirates' premise doesn't hold any potential, the movie does, after all, give us the prospect of an oceanbound adventure, the kind of movies you don't see too often. But Indiana Jones on water, this is not, for it lacks all of that trilogy's infectious sense of fun and thrilling ventures into the unknown (not to mention the smart dialogue and rousing John Williams' score). If not for Johnny Depp's performance and Keira Knightley's beauty and strong screen presence, Pirates might very well have lulled me into sleep.The movie's biggest problem is its generic action sequences. Most of the swordfights are routine, directed without much flair or energy, and their bloodless presentation is just too juvenile-oriented for me. In fact, they all start to look the same after a while, so a little variety would have been appreciated. The film's one semi-creative fight, between Turner and Sparrow, is ineffective since you realize neither are in danger, and the climactic battle, pitting dozens of the undead pirates against the living, doesn't work since the fighting is done by characters I didn't give a damn about.I like the actual concept of fighting undead pirates, but most of the villains are so goofy (especially the one keeps that fake eye), it's hard to see them as an actual menace. And when they are played for laughs, they're not very funny, either (how many times can we see an eye pop out before it stops being funny?). Also, making them former mates of Sparrow's sort of demystifies them (as if their goofy behavior didn't do so already).As a pure adventure, Pirates is fraught with a lot of problems. It's repetitive, the characters keep going back and forth between the same islands and boats, sneaking in and out. The most successful adventures usually get the characters going from A to B to C, rather than A to C, then B, and then back to C, then B, and then back to C (and in this case, even back to A!). I got sick of seeing that island cavern over and over in ten minutes.But Pirates is not without merit. Its singular savior is Johnny Depp, whose introductory scene is so hilarious, I was afraid I'd choke on my laughter. Sure, some of his scenes don't work so well (like when he tries to get those two guards to distract themselves), but he's more often a blast to watch than not, and most of the scenes he's in are pretty enjoyable. I also liked Keira Knightley (almost easily the movie's best piece of eye candy when you compare her good looks with some of the goofy visual effects), who displays genuine fire and feistiness even when she's mostly played as a damsel in distress. Both performers make the best of their parts, elevating the material quite significantly (if Depp and Knightley weren't present, the movie would have gone from middling to bad in a heartbeat).Klaus Badelt's score sounds almost exactly like Hans Zimmer's work in The Rock given a period flavor. It's distracting, I spent too much time wondering in what ways Badelt would rip-off scores from Jerry Bruckheimer films. But at least it gave me an excuse to pay attention to something in-between th e scenes featuring Depp and Knightley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Review: Pirates of Caribbean (The Curse of black Pearl) An action adventure film directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer. Wonderfully drunken performance of Johnny Depp playing a roguish, mildly insane, piratical lead named Captain Jack Sparrow. The Movie also stars Orlando Bloom as blacksmith named Will Turner and Keira Knightly as Elizabeth who is a daughter of Governor of Port Royal. The movie sails along with the ship called "The Black Pearl". The pirates on the Black Pearl captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) are cursed to sail the seas in a state between living and dead. Their cursed could be lifted only after they get the last piece of Aztec gold that every cursed pirate had. Pirates kidnap Elizabeth as she had the last piece of gold. Jack Sparrow teams up with a Will who was in love with Elizabeth to rescue her and to get his ship back from Barbossa. He then steals the ship and forms the crew to hunt down Barbossa. The energetic and entertaining sequences of action produced between the fight scenes between Royal Navy and immortal pirates is another reason to watch this amusing movie.Just like the theme park ride that inspired it, the movie's greatest strengths are its atmosphere and art direction. The best thing about the direction of Gore Verbinsky is the amount of perfection he adds in every frame and in every character of his film. Supporting characters Kevin McNally, Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport had perfectly played their part. Constant pace of action, picture perfect scene, soundtrack and some excellent execution of dialogues can be seen throughout the movie. It is a film that prides itself on lively detail and top-grade craftsmanship, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Audiences aren't persuaded into feeling that they should be having fun but they simply are having fun because the movie is too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curse of the black pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie of the Pirates of Caribbean series. The main character is Captain Jack Sparrow who is the pirates not having a ship. The enemy is Captain Barbossa who betrayed Jack in the past. He has an invulnerable body, stealing the Aztec gold which put a curse on the people stealing those. That is he is put a curse, so he loose the touch and feeling of happiness, but he cannot kill himself due to the curse. And, the important characters are Will turner and Elizabeth Swann. Will sails with Jack. Elizabeth is caught by Barbbosa. Will wants to help her, and Jack wants to revenge Barbbosa, so they help each other and head to Barbbosa. Finally, they can help her and manage to kill Barbbosa. And, Jack starts to sail again. I like this movie's worldview and special effects. The plot is good as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Run For Gold, Go For Jack Sparrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since my family clan has Lore for Piracy, I feel obliged to write this review ... Ha-ha-ha, you got this - it's a joke! My family name is so awkward that wherever I go, they asked me whether I'm a Barbarian or maybe coming from Barbary Coast. Funny thing I didn't changed it for Anglo-Saxon and retained my Armenian denomination. Otherwise, "Pirates of the Caribbean" (2003) is a swell movie but nothing special within the "Swashbuckler" genre. I repeat "Swashbuckler" here, because if we make search with a topical word and we get avalanche of information. Predominantly, from Wikipedia and other sources you get idea for sword and chivalry adventure where an archetype is difficult to choose out of multitude of heroes, from various lands and different historical ages.Now, where are we - Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew. I presume every kid is aware that this is fantasy movie, not based on real persons or events. It gathers the fame of another Indiana Jones franchise; albeit, Archeology here is substituted with Piracy but no specific location or time is pin-pointed. Seemingly, this was originally a Video Game that was adapted for Big Screen. And since I don't want to look stupid (I am too old for Video Games or any other Sport), let me proceed thus. Johnny Depp cashed this Movie marvelously. He is exactly my age but looks some 10-15 years younger. He retained his acrobatic physical shape that we remember as early as "Benny and Joon" (1993). I wish him luck. So much so for the other cast and director Gore Verbinski.I want to comment something on Piracy Lore. That task came not to be so easy. Else, there are lot of facts in Internet but you don't have gold on tip of your tongue. As mentioned, I have huge library but things are scattered here and there. Most of my knowledge came from fiction literature - a genre known as adventure novel. Those marvelous assets in my library were gathered carefully and painstakingly, some 40 years from time. Many of those people in Antiquary Business which I collaborated with are now dead or mentally dysfunctional. But their ancestors continued the Job willy-nilly: here a book nicely illustrated, there a cover with colorful picture. We didn't have computers nor graphic design was available. We were self-made men, product of Technology Age that was at brink of Revolution. You don't have to be President to realize this. Plus, young lions were always around ready to devour, ain't they!Yet, I didn't get to my point and never will. Piracy is Neverland, heroes are like Peter Pan never growing old and living in their dream. Neverland is fantasy world seldom explored. Read the novels from Scottish writer J. M. Barrie and you will find Neverland. It is a world more fantastic than Alice's Wonderland. Have lot of fun ...P.S. If you want more, you can get access at http://www.roman-daventures.com/. This site is dealing with miscellany of Adventure Novels and their Authors. Sorry, it is in French.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God bless Jack Sparrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies I'll rate higher than I really should because it's pure nostalgia for me. I was in kindergarten when it came out, and this film was responsible for an extended pirate phase. Hell, I still want to be a pirate. The aesthetic in this movie is a powerful thing, and the character who embodies that aesthetic is, of course, Jack Sparrow. Oh, Jack Sparrow. I never had a crush on you, but you were and are #goals - a seaborne Mick Jagger swaggering down-ship with a bottle of rum, radiating a good-humored nihilism that even my child-self knew to envy. There's a surprising amount beneath the surface with Sparrow, but ultimately, he captures and complicates the conflict between fantasy and reality that defines this genre. All the other characters are pure period drama or pure fantasy. Sparrow quite literally walks the line between real and myth, and because of it he's the essence of a swashbuckler. The whole Will/Elizabeth story - okay, that's most of the story - that I could do without, and I think I speak for most people when I say Sparrow makes the movie. But boy, does he make it something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best pirate movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is set in Jamaica during the mid-eighteenth century, when the island was controlled by the British. In this atmosphere of danger, the mastery of the seas is disputed by the Royal Navy and the ferocious buccaneers of the Caribbean. The young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a swords-maker, lives peacefully in Port Royal and secretly loves Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), daughter of Governor Swan (Jonathan Pryce), whom he owes his life. Everything changes after the city was attacked by the pirates of the "Black Pearl", a ship on which hang stories of frightening curses. The girl is abducted and Will ends up coming out looking for her, accompanied by Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a permanently drunk and clumsy pirate, who will do with him the most unlikely pair. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other collaborators.This film was a pleasant surprise to many people, as the pirates movies were normally associated with ticketing failures and had such a strong stigma that virtually disappeared from movies for years. So, this movie not only re-popularized the theme but also returned to pirates movies some respect. Let us begin by the actors: Bloom and Keira Knightley didn't surprised me much because they are used to play the good guy roles, they are comfortable with it and they have great talent doing it, not to mention that, even then, Keira showed great interest in historical or period productions. Who truly stole the show were the major antagonists: Geoffrey Rush (who made the villain, Barbossa), is an consecrated, experienced and respected actor, with an unquestionable quality and an excellent diction, but he outdid himself in this film. He looks like a figure jumped out of an adventures book, like "The Treasure Island". On the other hand, Johnny Depp played the perfect antihero, capable of the worst wrongdoings or to demonstrate feelings of great nobility. This two characters, thought outside the box, fit perfectly in the two views that we have concerning pirates: the romanticized view represented by Barbossa and a more historically accurate perception, immortalized by a drunk and sly Sparrow, who enters and jumps of any awkward situation without worrying too much about it. The scenarios are excellent and computerized animation and the special effects team were up to the challenge. I must refer particularly the vessels used, by the accuracy of the reconstruction and these beauty (although I don't believe that any pirate has ever used ships as large and heavy as those). The costumes and characterization were also impeccable and the plot was invented in an original way, trying to escape a bit of the theme "pirates running for a treasure" emptied of attractiveness, crossing it with some more interesting sub-plots.This film is well worth the price paid for the DVD or movie ticket. Besides having established and popularized Depp and the pirates movies, it entertains the public very well, holding our attention until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely the best done of the series. Pretty entertaining if you don't see it too often.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this series has spiraled downward in quality, this first installment was a good place to start. It introduces all of the themes that drive the sequels, even though there is a relatively small connection between this and Dead Man's Chest. The most prominent theme is whether all laws can be considered just which we see with both Norrington's use and abuse of his military position to hunt pirates, and the ambiguity of the pirate code. Less prominent is the theme of selfishness. Jack is easily the most selfish character, but seems to do this for show as a deception. As we learn later, Jack's compass is actually run by people's desires. Even here, the plot is driven by each character's desires and how they cause conflict. And these conflicts are only resolved by selflessness as with Will sacrificing his life for Elizabeth, Elizabeth allowing Norrington to marry her to save Will, the crew abandoning the code to save Jack, and Norrington's actions at the very end. Those aren't great examples, but much more concrete resolutions through selflessness come later in the series.The characters are very well done, both major and minor. All are given attention, personality, and motives in the case of the main characters. The fact that a character with as little screen time as Governor Swann has motives and contributes to others' motives says something. Each character's exposition is pretty much spot-on and fits the situation naturally without involving any dull or implausible "information dumps" about the current situation. Any information dumps come well after we have met and have a sense of each character. It helps that the characters are very likable from Jack Sparrow's witticisms and quirks, Will's blunders and passions, Barbossa's dramatic tones, Elizabeth's ability to excercise whatever power she has over her enemies, and the various eccentricities of each crew. In addition to that, there is no true protagonist, but everyone plays the villain at some point with the exception of Will and Elizabeth. But despite that, there is a degree of sympathy that you can have for each character including Barbossa and Norrington.The plot gets a bit complicated, and it's definitely worth it to stop midway through and run through the story so far with the help of a friend or some other spoiler-free source of information. The most confusing thing about my first viewing was how the curse worked, but once I made sense of it I appreciated the movie more. Even when there aren't action scenes, the story moves along at a decent pace and remains entertaining and interesting. Of course, some of this loses it's effect if you know the story too well, so I recommend that you wait a couple years before re-watching it.In light of modern spfx, some of the visuals are a little laughable, but are still pretty good for the time. The acting was pretty good for an action movie, with Johnny Depp stealing the show as Jack. There is a lot of action with the fast-paced sword duels, sea battles, and the sacking of Port Royal. The choreography is pretty good, and all of the action is exciting and fun rather than brutal. The script was really well done, easily the best of the series, both in it's dialogue and scene structure. Gore Verbinski did a pretty good job directing too.As it's a Disney movie it's geared a little bit for kids, but not too strongly. I certainly enjoyed it more when I was about 12 or 13, but it's still pretty fun to watch now. The PG-13 rating is warranted but it's well on the mild side. I would recommend buying it at some point if you enjoy it and haven't already, especially since you can probably get it used for less than $5. There's potential for it to be annoying, especially if you're looking for flaws and can understand the story. But on the whole there aren't any glaring mistakes. So definitely rent it if you enjoy fun, exciting, and thematic movies. Overall Rating: 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comparative Look at the Series - Part 1: The Black Pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to go back and watch the series as a whole, and comparatively speaking 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' is by far the best in the series. When compared to the other films in the series, this one shines brightest. The plot is quite simplistic when compared to the other 'Pirates' films, but it doesn't get muddled in its own story. It's a love story at its heart, between a privileged daughter of a Governor of one of the many Caribbean islands (Keira Knightley), and an orphaned apprentice of the local Blacksmith (Orlando Bloom). There is a sense of history between them goes back to childhood, and is a very strong bond between both, which becomes the main driving force behind the events in Part 1. The pirates have a real sense of danger about them, and are just as dangerous and evil looking when they are in or out of their ghoulish form. and I think most will be surprised at the level of violence (off screen that is) which this movie contains. The first entry into the series introduces us to the most pivotal character in the series; Captain Jack Sparrow, and is by far one of Johnny Depp's best creations. A perfect blend of heroism, ineptitude, and just a hint of madness. He brought such a unique character to life, and it is very easy to believe that you need to be somewhat crazy to be a successful pirate. From the very introduction to the character to his last scene in the series, you know that there is something off about him. Every single interaction, every little quip has a real sense of improvisation, about it, as though everything that happens around him is more of a nuisance to deal with, rather than a consequence of his own actions. The remaining characters are very much real in this single minded drives. Elizabeth swan as the damsel in distress, William turner as a driven hero willing to stop at nothing to get to the women he loves, and of course Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) who is evil to his core and willing to stop at nothing to relieve the curse upon him and his crew (but mostly for himself). Although shorter than the other movies in the series, this one is by far the best, without stretching the story too thin or becoming to convoluted in plot devices. It is in many ways a cleaner and simpler story. A great film from beginning to end with just the right blend of love, adventure and magic. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney pulled the rug from under everyone when it produced a rated PG- 13 movie about some of the most terrifying men to ever walk the earth. The end result was the birth of an iconic character in Captain Jack Sparrow, whose fantastic lines and perfect delivery made him a global phenomenon. Fantastic supporting performances by Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom as well as the truly menacing Geoffrey Rush give this film an edge no one would have expected. Containing witty dialogue, masterful camera-work and visual effects, one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores (including the riveting theme "He's a Pirate"), and a story extremely quick-paced and exciting, all capped off by Depp's career- defining performance, this film at times gives a stronger adrenaline rush than the ride it's based on.</fullReview>

Though I do despise of Will Turner and his stupid girlfriend, those to were always an obstacle for Jack. I love the bond between Jack and Barbosa, their frienemies. I say I despise Will and Elizabeth because #1: Will betrayed Jack and reported to Cutler Beckette using dead bodies (cruel!). #2: Elizabeth chained Jack while faking a romantic moment and forced Jack to call her a pirate, a title way too cool to be wasted on a pathetic girl such as Elizabeth. There are so many more reasons but those are my main two and if anyone has a different opinion I totally respect that. I actually admire Will for going through so much to save Elizabeth.</fullReview>

Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history.</fullReview>

It has a great actors like Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Jack Sparrow is an eccentric character, as Johnny Depp usually is. The film has moments of all type. There are so great moments of adventure, laughs and, more like a secondary story, so many moments of love between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. I think Will Turner is so brave, because he has a infighting between being a pirate or not, and it wants to save her although he isn't noble. She is so brave too, because she risks her life and lies to protect him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a gem of a movie. It came out of nowhere and with little expectations, reigniting film fans' love of pirate adventures. The fact that it had no expectation contrasts with its sequels, which is why it was probably so successful. You've got the classic pirate villain (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush ? my favourite character of the films), great CGI, and some incredibly witty scenes. Let's not forget Jonny Depp's outstanding, unforgettable and charismatic portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow. It seems he was supposed to be an appealing supporting character, and yet shoved the cliché love plot out of the way and made the film his own. Very little can be said of this film in a negative light. It was clever, witty and sharp. One of the true achievements, however, was that it wasn't too witty and sharp ? it knew its boundaries, unlike the sequels. The seriousness of the situations these characters were put in felt real. Therefore, we cared about what happened to them. Despite my eagerness for the upcoming film, I can't see it topping The Curse of the Black Pearl. In fact, I can't see any pirate film surpassing one of the landmark movies of the past decade, aside from Master and Commander. Great Stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In beginning my review on Pirates of the Caribbean I sat back to watch all of the films back to back in order. I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley, and of course I really like the Pirates films.Now in the beginning cinematically it seemed a bit as if the scene was on a stage in a green screen and it showed pretty badly, yet this is one of the very few graphical/cgi issues that really stuck out to me. Acting within The Curse of the Black Pearl for the most part was great, and of course the cast seemed to grow into their characters more and more as this film started to take shape. I do love how the story starts and unfolds as I do believe at this point this is one of my favorites within the film collection, of course until I get to check out the newest in development film.The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderful movie, it's great for family, it's filled with action, comedy, and a beautiful tale to follow. I love how the characters stories individually began to unfold nicely timed throughout the film revealing the love term development of the Pirates films. The Curse exposed was my favorite part of the movie the graphics were awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?I am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?I often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.Except for this year.Go Jack.And, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge- podge of loosely- connected "money shots" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-beardedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, "You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck- swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.And now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking "overproduced by" credit on the cover-liner. "Bombastic." "Overdone." "Absurdly Stupendous."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will always hold a special place in my heart. Way back in 2003, while on an island (San Juan Island, WA to be exact,) my then- boyfriend and I checked out the only movie theatre on the isle. Personally, I didn't want to see Pirates of the Caribbean, but it was either that or Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde since the movie theatre only had two screens. And while I saw part one of that, I was even less interested in seeing that. So, with only two screens, two choices, we opted for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.Now, this movie had been out for awhile, and everyone raved about it. Still, even with the draw of both Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, as well as the vast positive feedback, I was hesitant going in. BOY?was I wrong. This movie grabbed me from minute one and never let loose. From the incredible score to the excellent special effects ? that STILL hold up today in 2015 to the fantastic characters, this proved to be an instant classic. (To clarify, 12 years later, that statement holds true.) It was extreme adventure, with plenty of action, humor and perfect blend of gray areas for the good/bad guys. Now, the follow-ups, including the 2 that completed the "trilogy" and the stand alone feature?I implore you: DON'T WATCH THEM. I've currently seen this original 3-4x, but the subsequent ones, one time apiece and pretty much despised them. They were FAR TOO LONG and clunky. Granted, Captain Jack Sparrow is a once in a lifetime character, but he should only be enjoyed in small doses, such as this original chapter. The lines were hilarious, the cast/characters great on their own and the action was exciting. The Disneyland ride happens to be my favorite exhibit at Disneyland (even before the movie,) and they took that, plus the awesome Yo-Ho! song to lengths that couldn't be achieved in lesser hands. Again, avoid the sequels and buy this fantastic adventure. It seriously can be stand-alone, and should've. * * *Final thoughts: Of all of our memories together, Justin, this always stands out. Despite not being one of the biggest events in our time together, the time we went to this small, 2-screen, island duplex, will forever be etched into my memory. Thank you for opening my mind to this film and experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant cast, great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I saw it at the cinema with my best friend some years ago. I remember that I was skeptical and I didn't want to go.I usually don't like pirates and adventure stories. But I have to admit that I was very much involved. It was very exciting from the beginning! It's an adventure /fantasy film. What i'm saying is I couldn't get enough of this movie. It was so well done. Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this character. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view. Geoffrey Rush played Barbarossa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people. A great adventure. Well played sword-fighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book. Absolutely recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all Johnny Depp lovers? this film is undoubtedly for you. For all good movie lovers? this film is for you too! Truly this film has something for everyone and is a classic. Keira Knightley plays the feisty &amp; independent Elizabeth Swann, who should become a Disney Princess. Orlando Bloom serves as the teenage girl eye candy, but admittedly he is an OK character although Jack Sparrow (ahem, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) steals the show with his hilarious remarks. The film has a great cast and plenty of nods to the original ride from the Disney Parks. A favorite of mine is definitely Jack the Monkey, Barbossa's immortal pet monkey who was named 'Jack' to spite the human. Personally, my favorite scene is when Jack Sparrow gets marooned with Lizzie."They'll be no living with her after this."In total, this film does not disappoint and is a fabulous tribute to Walt's vision. The cast makes it shine, the sets make it glow, and the breathtaking ambiance of it all makes it ideal for any movie night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard Disney was going to make a movie out of their Pirates of the Caribbean ride, I (like many others, no doubt) thought it was a horrible idea. I mean, how many movies based on video games worked, let alone movies based on an amusement park attraction. What was next? "Hall of Presidents: The Motion Picture"?But to their credit, Disney not only turned out a good movie, but spawned a billion dollar franchise. Thanks to Johnny Depp's great (and Oscar nominated, no less) performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, great direction by Gore Verbinski, and a storyline that is both action-packed, yet whimsical and fun, Disney made an epic adventure that appealed to all ages.Now Disney is finally releasing the first two films on Blu-ray disc, and they're a true delight for any owners of the high def format. The picture is stunningly sharp and colorful, and I could find nothing to complain about. Every scene...indeed, every frame...was gloriously sharp and beautiful in this 1080p transfer. The audio is equally remarkable, with both a 5.1 uncompressed track and a 5.1 Dolby Digital track sounding fantastic. Watching Pirates on Blu-ray reminded me of why I spent money on the format in the first place...nothing I've seen (including seeing the film in the theater itself) matches the experience of watching the film in this format...it's simply incredible.Disney hasn't slouched on the rest of the package either, making this a 2-disc set, with the second disc containing nearly every single extra that was on the 3-Disc standard release (including all the bonuses from "The Lost Disc" in that set). All those features and bonuses are still shown in 480p, but Disney has included a brand-new interactive documentary on the movie disc, presenting it in 1080p as well. This new documentary, entitled "Scoundrels of the Seas" can be watched in its entirety or can be edited by the viewer so he or she can watch a custom-designed version. By selecting an option in the main menu, viewers can watch the film and then click on "coins" that pop up during the movie, indicating topics available in the documentary. If you want to find out more about that topic, click on your remote when the coin appears. If you don't want to know more, don't click. When the film is over, you'll get to see the documentary with only the topics you clicked on covered. Of course, viewers also have the option of watching the movie without the distraction of the coins, as well as designing their own custom documentary from one of the menus, or just watching the complete documentary straight through. The documentary and custom design makes use of Blu-ray's Java capabilities, so users with stand-alone players and/or PS3's will want to make sure their systems are properly updated. Also on the movie disc is an interactive "Jolly Roger" character that will help guide you through the disc; three separate audio commentary tracks (the same three that appear on the 3-disc standard version); and a handful of 1080p trailers for your enjoyment. Disc Two contains most of the 480p bonus features that were previously released on the 3-disc set, including just extras as a Making-Of documentary; a blooper reel; deleted and alternate scenes; an image gallery; and a few "Easter Eggs" for all you pirates out there to hunt down!Just in time for the theatrical release of the third movie in the trilogy, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a reference-quality Blu-ray release that fans of the movie are just going to love. It's a must- have for Blu-ray owners, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film in itself was something else being the first of it's series it did in fact live up to it's potential.Johnny Depp is phenomenal in his part as Captain Jack which was expected. Also Orlando Bloom in my opinion made this movie in his own weird but awesome way. The action is awesome and the suspense is intense. The series couldn't have started out better. I gave this 10 stars because if u ask anyone if they have seen the pirates of the Caribbean they would say of course, not to mention everyone for the most part thinks this series is one to put in the books. My review is simply a thumbs up and if u haven't seen this series yet i strongly recommend you do because these movies are fun for the whole family. I say 10/10. Great movie</fullReview>

The movie was great and i highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of pirates and Johnny Depp. He was BRILLIANT in the movie. Johnny is known for being crazy and having a dark sense of humor and Captain Jack Sparrow is just up his ally. Captain Jack Sparrow is crazy, funny, and he likes his drinks. He's hilarious and a great hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review and its a relatively easy one. POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl is a thrilling introduction to an under-appreciated franchise. The best of the franchise in my opinion with an exciting cast consisting of Johnny Depp at the helm in his now iconic role. The back and forth of Depp and the brilliant Geoffery Rush as Captian Barbosa at the center keeps you intrigued to see who ultimately wins. The supporting performances from Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom as well as smaller characters like Mr. Gibbs played by the believable Kevin McNally makes you feel like you are viewing authentic pirate situations. The visuals and cinematography help bring this film to life.Twists betrayals bar fights pistols and gunpowder fill this enthralling epic. With huge box office success five Oscar nominations including Depp's firs, there is surely no 'curse'on this satisfyingly great adventure pic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start to a long-lasting franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very first "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie was a huge success at the box office and at awards ceremonies. It was no°3 at the box office behind the final "Lord of the Rings" chapter and "Finding Nemo". Also it received 5 Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor for Depp (his first nomination ever) and also an SAG Award for him. That is also why there have been 3 sequels already, no°4 is safe and number looks likely too. The first one (just like 2 and 3) was directed by Gore Verbinski, who kept reuniting with Depp after his exit from the Pirates-franchise. The writing team already worked together on animation classics like "Shrek" and "Aladdin". My favorite part from the script was possibly the "saving the one shot"-storyline and the final shot was one of the highlights of the movie. I was a bit surprised the crew went according to protocol at some point as they seemed extremely loyal to Sparrow initially, but I guess it shows that you can never trust pirates. Thank God Captain Sparrow survived all these dangerous situations early on like the hail of bullets after he saved and threatened Elizabeth Swann or when he almost gets hung near the end of the film. Actually that could have been a nice ending if they hadn't done all these sequels. A bit unexpected, but somehow different.I also thought Geoffrey Rush did a good job with his character (but that's a given as it's Geoffrey Rush), the main antagonist to Sparrow. His death scene near the end was pretty special. I guess they did not plan to include him in the sequels, but they were wrong. Let's see how they bring him back. Another antagonist, the commodore, I was really fond of. I almost cheered for him more than for Bloom's character (just like Sparrow). It was actually nice for a change to see the rival to be displayed in not such a bad light. I found him likable and you could even call him a hero. Knightley did a solid job too and I liked Depp as well. I'm not his biggest fan, but here he convinced me and made me laugh too. He is a very costume-oriented actor if you look at his body of work and Jack Sparrow may very well be his most memorable role. Orlando Bloom unfortunately still does nothing for me. He is all about his looks and little about being a talented actor in my opinion. This franchise started right after "The Lord of the Rings", so they cast him as a crowd magnet I guess. The film is mostly a family movie. Here and there, there is a bit of violence, like ghost pirates cutting throats of Navy officers, but it's all not too graphic or very fast over.Another strength about the film is the music. I am a bit surprised Zimmer was completely snubbed by everybody that awards season as his soundtrack is certainly one of the most memorable from 2003 and pretty much everybody has heard the main theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is a grand action film loaded with memorable characters, swashbuckling and great special effects. It's sure to please audiences and leave them roaring for more pirate adventures (which have been provided in the form of 3 sequels as of 2012). Despite a few shortcomings (the curse itself for example, is not well explained) it's just a lot of fun to sit through and it's good for the whole family (assuming the children won't be too frightened by the cursed pirates and can handle the action and violence). It's got everything you could want in a story: romance, action, humour, friendship, chases, even a bit of horror thrown in too. (On Blu-ray, August 11, 2012)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never thought any pirate related stuff could have been so entertaining !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the movie that introduced the world to the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, arguably the most popular of Depp's incarnations. Though Jack is an important character, the movie mainly seems to revolve around Keira Knigthely's Elizabeth, and her love for the blacksmith Will Turner, portrayed by Orlando Bloom.Elizabeth is kidnapped by Barbossa, the captain of The Black Pearl, and his crew whom once Sparrow had captained, before being left for dead as the outcome of a mutiny led by Barbossa himself. When the governor, Elizabeth's father, and her prospective husband, the commodore, give up Elizabeth as a lost cause, Will teams up with Jack to save his love.And what follows is one of the best action/comedy movies ever brought out by Hollywood; topped with the devil may care character, done to perfection by Johnny Depp.The other best thing about the movie, after Jack, is the superb background score, which when added to the clinking of swords, seems to transport you into the middle of a battlefield. Now for the one star I deducted, mainly due to two causes. Though Orlando Bloom, does his role nicely, I would have preferred someone else as Will Turner. And secondly, the question of Jack's age. Going a little mathematically and comparing his age to that of Will, he would seem to be in his fifties, sixties or beyond.But you needn't worry yourself about it, and seriously go watch the movie, for its one of the best things that will ever happen to you.</fullReview>

The finest scenes of movie, the scene of fighting between Captain Jack and Captain Barbossa Sbaaro in the last chapter of movie, and perhaps what makes this movie also extravaganza of music soundtrack of the film and the performance of actor Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character to where he played a major role in making this character alive</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best pirate film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of those that changed the landscape for film and because of its success the pirate genre is nothing but The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The story sees the undead crew of the Black pearl attempt to lift their curse by kidnapping the governors daughter Elizabeth Swann and her possessions. So old friend Will Turner and the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow attempt to rescue her for their own needs. For starters Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow has become a legendary partnership and the performance is phenomenal and unfortunately for Depp it is so good and legendary it has consumed his acting career, but in this film he is amazing. The supporting class is great as well Keira Knightly as Elizabeth was a good choice as she is passive because of her status and also heroic and aggressive when she needs to be, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner was another great choice as he is a great foil for Sparrow and is possibly the character to connect with most. Whereas Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa is a fantastic Villain and is truly evil and a great fit and foil for Sparrow. Now the one weakness possibly in this film is that the story is quite basic and predictable as it goes but this isn't a huge detriment to the film but stops it from being a 10. The script is phenomenal especially with Jack sparrow but everybody truly gets a moment to shine. The style is also really good with the epic pirates theme song, the stylised awesome fights and the undead visuals. However, the style of some of the comedy is off a little bit but not enough to take down the overall quality of the film as this is a truly fantastic film that will be tough to better for pirate films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Disney brought back Pirates to the modern day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are records of pirates that date back to very early times and there are still accounts of it today. When film began to become prevalent with audiences, there were also several films made that revolved around these individuals. The life of a pirate is one of that many seek to obtain even though most would deny it. Who wouldn't want to sail around the world's oceans plundering with your friends and having a good time provided no rules? It sounds like a lot of fun. Surprisingly, as dark as this particular career can get for some people, Disney is able to portray the fictitious world of pirates where it may not be all fun and games, but it still looks like a blast (pardon the pun). There isn't any element that feels out of place.After a blacksmith named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sees his love Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) captured by a band of pirates, he calls upon the help of a unique ally, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), another pirate. The writers behind the screen are Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. These guys are 2 of the 4 writers behind Aladdin (1992) and The Mask of Zorro (1998) - which has multiple swashbuckling scenes like this one. Each character has an equal amount of development and charisma to make them likable. Johnny Depp of course is the most memorable even though his name is not in the title. The film is directed by Gore Verbinksi who didn't know it at the time but would work with Johnny Depp much more after this movie.Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have good chemistry and look good together as well. The captain in charge of the pirates is Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and he too puts in a good performance as the antagonist to the story. What may be surprising to viewers is just how well the writers were able to mix the violence with comical moments. This is either due to Johnny Depp's acting and rather strange facial expressions or even lesser important characters like Barbossa's men - Ragetti and Pintel. They are definitely not appealing characters but they still portray the charm needed to enjoy what they do or say even if they aren't on the good side. Again, going back to violence, the humor makes it more fun. The style of action portrayed here does involve swords, which feels similar to the Zorro series but is also different because of the settings it takes place in. How many high seas adventures are popular today? Not many. Besides swords, there's also cannon fire and shoot-outs for good measure. Adding on top of that is composer Klaus Badelt's score. Thankfully, Badelt includes themes for Jack Sparrow and the whole story itself. It's very catchy and once you've heard it, you won't forget it. I'm surprised too because although Badelt hasn't made a lot of great film scores, the one's he is remembered for is extremely good. Lastly is Dariusz Wolski's cinematography, which he gets a number of nice big views of tropical scenery although I'm sure a lot of it is CGI. There really isn't anything to not like about it.The characters are likable, the action and humor mix well and the music is quite memorable. If you want to see an updated look on old fashion pirates, this is the original movie to see.</fullReview>

This movie is just PERFECT in every way. Perfect story : Pirates, haunted ship, lot of comic moments Perfect music : beautiful music by Hanz Zimman Perfect actors : Johnny Depp is just amazing playing Jack Sparrow, it's probably the most important part of his career. And even if it's for a "family movie" it's a great one. He gives something very unique and fresh. It would have been so boring to have a "standard" hero like in every other pirates or adventure movies. This time it's almost an "anti- hero" but that we love even for its bad sides which is so fun. Perfect cinematography : Caribbean must be one of the most beautiful place on Earth where I dream to go one day. And the fact that the movie has really been shot in these amazing places give something more to it than if it was done in studios. Same thing for the ships and decors that we can "feel real". Well it's a great movie to watch and re-watch. A huge fresh moment, pirates, sun, sea and rum !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film, A Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films often draw inspiration from literature, historical events and pre existing works, and screenwriters and directors adapt books the theatre and older movies into modern films. Movies have followed this pattern for a long time and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. This being said, however, creativity and demand for original content often causes deviations in patterns, and inspiration will often be drawn from unlikely sources, once classic resources have become dry. Disney has always been creative in developing imaginary worlds and fictional story lines, in many cases adapting them into rides at their massive theme parks. Creating outstanding story lines requires innovative thinking, and in the case of pirates of the Caribbean, Disney did just that. They reversed their typical cycle of adapting rides after movies and instead drew inspiration for a movie from a ride, thus creating Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The theme park ride had been around for some time, and predated the movie by almost 36 years. The content that the ride offered could be easily adapted into a film given that it depicted a historical time period rather than a modern event. Disney easily and adeptly transformed the idea of swashbuckling pirates from a ride into a movie.Simply put, Captain Jack Sparrow takes the movie and straps a jet pack to it, launching it into the ozone. Captain Jack Sparrow's character brings the storyline alive and makes for a truly engaging film. In my opinion, Johnny Depp's portrayal of Sparrow is one of the best performances in any movie and is one of my personal favorites. His eccentricity and peculiar mannerisms as Sparrow make the character incredibly interesting and dynamic. Despite seeming drunk at many times Jack is, in reality, very intelligent. Jack uses his wit to be very humorous and often borders inappropriateness. The fact that Disney produced this film is about as shocking to me as it is to hear that the writers originally thought Depp's performance was terrible when it ended up making the movie. Robert Ebert, a renowned film critic had this to say about Depp's performance, "It can be said that his performance is original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie" (Ebert 1). Ebert follows this statement with assurance that he is not criticizing Depp's performance but rather praising it for its originality and ingenuity. The film is actually graphic in many scenes and has very subtle yet noticeable sexual connotations and adult humor in many instances. This being said it is still able to appeal to younger audiences but might come off as scary to some younger kids. On top of Depp's outstanding the performance the film does a tremendous job balancing out how much of Jack the viewer gets by including Turner, a much more level headed and traditional character. It is also interesting how the characters all seem to be chasing something. Jack is chasing the Pearl and Barbossa. Barbossa in turn, is chasing Turner, while Turner is chasing Swann. This creates an interesting dynamic and constantly keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. The brilliant settings also help make the film great. Despite being only set in the Caribbean, each location is very unique and often exaggerated. For example the island Jack is marooned on is absolutely gorgeous with perfect blue water and white sand while the Barbossa's hideout is jet is black and grim. Another fantastic location comes with the film's depiction of Tortuga. It is shown as a drunken mosh pit of gluttony where barbaric pirates drink themselves to death and fight one another yet this is all shown in a very comedic way. The Internet Movie Database rates the movie an 8.1 out of 10 which compared to many other great films is actually very high considering the highest rating given to any movie is a 9.2. Depp's acting, the other supporting characters' essential roles and the brilliant plot as well as locales make the movie a fantastic film that will set the standard for pirate films for a very long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl released in 2003 is still in the list of the best. The cast includes Johnny Depp,Keira Knightley, Orlando bloom ,Geoffery Rush.The first half of the movies mainly features on Captain Jack, will and Elizabeth. The relationship between Will and Elizabeth comforts the factor of romance in the movie. Captain Sparrow and Will turner together procures a crew with different intentions .Jack wants to get back the black pearl which he was once the captain of. But Barbossa his first mate send him for mutiny. Later the trio fights barbossa and kills him. A curse prevails over the crew of the black pearl including Barbossa.The characters are filled with fun and enthusiasm. Mention not the intelligence of Mr Sparrow. He is intelligent and equally no word is found to describe him. Johnny depp at his best. He is twice marooned on an island where he spends time drinking rum. It is shown that he has an interest in Elizabeth. But her heart is throughout Will's. The second half of the movie breathtaking and nail biting. The last fight between Jack and Barbossa is the best fight scene in the movie. The music is another big factor in the movie. Hans Zimmer is at his best. Jack's theme and Yo Ho A Pirate's Life for me was sung everywhere is still sung. The Visual effects of the movie is equally beautiful as the score. The catchy dialogs at the right moment are remembered.~This is my first review. Please forgive if there are any mistakes. I'll Try to do my best in the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Plagues for Further Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is a brilliant film, being filled with action, adventure, scares and comedy. Johnny Depp plays "Captain" Jack Sparrow as one of his most loved roles. The story line is cool and tells us of some things that happened before the actual events that take place in this film. In my opinion there should be a prequel trilogy to teach us more of what really happened in the Caribbean so many years ago. Anyway this film is just so fun to watch but you really can't get your hopes up with the sequels. When the appalling fourth installment was viewed by myself I really found it stupider than the rest and just lacked in all details this film perfected. A fifth installment is scheduled for 2016 and will go by the name: Dead Men Tell No Tales. That title was rumored also to be the title of the fourth film but indeed it wasn't. With this upcoming sequel, I hope it is much like this and can retain balance to this film franchise. Thee only bad thing about this film is that it plagued all further Disney live action films, it sets too good of an example for other films to beat, The Lone Ranger for instance. Anyway this is Davorin Lonac wishing you farewell and if you enjoyed this review please check out my other ones for more fun...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walt Disney's beloved theme park ride comes to life in the hilariously entertaining comedy-action film, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Pirates stars Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley with a supporting cast of Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally, and Zoe Saldana. Set in the picturesque 18th century Spanish Main (part of the New World empire), Pirates of the Caribbean delivers an exhilarating adventure that will keep the viewers coming back for more!The film opens with young Will Turner (Bloom) being rescued from a ship wreck by Captain Norrington's (Davenport) crew as they are sailing from England to Port Royal. Young Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) is present and discovers a medallion on the unconscious Will. She steals it, fearing he is a pirate. Eight years later, Elizabeth, who just happens to be the governor's daughter, has become quite the beauty and has captured the attention of both Captain-soon-to-be-Commodore Norrington and the all-grown-up Will Turner. Elizabeth is secretly in love with Will, however, she is unable to profess her love due to his lowly status as a blacksmith. Elizabeth's life is further complicated by the arrival of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow who after threatening Miss Swann and crossing blades with Turner, is thrown in jail. To make matters worse, a band of pirates lead by Captain Barbossa attack Port Royal and abducts Elizabeth in search of the medallion she possesses. Desperate to rescue Elizabeth, Will enlists Jack's help, who only agrees to help in order to get back his beloved ship, The Black Pearl, stolen by Barbossa. With this unlikely pair, a damsel in distress, a villainous crew of pirates who aren't all that they appear to be and plenty of sword fighting, Pirates leads its viewers on a swashbuckling adventure with an explosive finale. Gore Verbinski does a fantastic job at directing this film, engaging the audience from start to finish. With contrasting scenes of light and dark, choppy angled camera shots and breathtaking panoramas of the Caribbean islands and sea, Verbinski puts the audience at the center of the adventure. After all, Pirates is based on a theme park ride, and the movie is nothing short of exciting. For example, during the epic ship battle scene, Verbinski alternates low angle, close-up shots of the ships' bows pitching in the waves with high angle, long shots of the whole ship and its crews fighting. He also uses a plethora of close-up cannons going off and guns being fired in succession with facial expressions to convey the intensity of the situation, providing an utterly thrilling sequence of scenes that creates a vicarious experience for the audience. Above all else, however, is the impeccable performance by Johnny Depp. Borrowing mannerisms from rocker Keith Richards and adding his own drunken- inspired flair, Depp is convincing as a seasoned pirate with a vendetta on a no holds barred quest. Depp reaches deep into himself to bring Captain Jack Sparrow to life, completely immersing himself into his character and capturing the audience with his bad-boy charm and devil-may-care attitude mixed with his feminine swaying walk and "guy-liner." Balancing Sparrow between villain and hero, Depp enchants the audience into sympathizing with Jack. Much of Depp's brilliance as Sparrow is conveyed solely through the body language of Jack. Even when he has no lines, Depp's Sparrow engages the audience through quirky facial expressions and woozy bodily movements; even when he is an observing character he keeps the attention on him. Perhaps Depp's most crowning moment comes when Sparrow is marooned on an island with the beautiful Elizabeth Swann. Depp manages to play off Jack's unrestrained interest in Miss Swann without offsetting the audience who has already invested in Will and Elizabeth's love for one another, and when Elizabeth burns all of his rum, Depp brilliantly portrays Jack's baffled rage in what may be the funniest portion of the film. Although a great movie by itself, Depp elevates the film to epic status. All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderfully entertaining film that is great for all ages. Classic and original all in once, Pirates of the Caribbean is not your average pirate epic, but a fresh and captivating story with traditional underscores. This film is a must see for anyone who enjoys an action packed, adventure with lovable and endearing characters and larger than life special effects.</fullReview>

One night town is attacked by Barbossa and Elizabeth is caught because his aim is the golden medal. Will asks Jack for help. They go to Elizabeth's rescue.This movie is so exciting. There are a lot of thrilling scenes in this film. Everyone will be able to watch it with eager anticipation. My favorite character is Will because he is so brave and he has strong feelings for her. I was surprised to watch that Barbossa and his underlings are living corpses. My favorite scene is jack's fighting scene because he is so cool and he is good at swordplay. Lastly, I think all casts' performance is very nice and good . This movie is really worth seeing.The ending is happy for everyone. This movie is so interesting. This is one of my favorite movie.

		<shortDescription>Popcorn-flick at its BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1996, the movie "Independence Day" by Roland Emerich proved that entertainment films, which usually come out in summer (in other words, summer movies, the ones that only serve for a good popcorn) could have a high quality in various aspects from the very story, script and performances. And Gore Verbinski and the writers of "Shrek" (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) with "Pirates" proved that once again in big! "Pirates" has everything that a summer movie needs to be pure entertainment, from the romantic story of the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the beautiful daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). That begins to go awry when the weird pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) appears in Port Royal and soon after him the cursed crew of the "Black Pearl" led by the cruel Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).Like I said, from romance to comedy and action, everything that a popcorn film needs. But thanks to Verbinski, everything can go much higher and better that we expected. Since the beginning, the film presents a superb script with a good, flowing and entertaining narrative (surprising for a entertainment film), that goes from memorable phrases to intelligent humor, and the plot really takes something pretty serious without exaggerating as other films have tried and failed. But it's not just comedy that elevates the film, is the "tone-change" that the film has: in scenes between Elizabeth and Will the film seems to have a dramatic tone but never gets to be boring or dry; when Barbossa and his cursed crew appear everything gets dark and kind of scary. But thanks to Jack Sparrow, at all times we have a really good and funny comic relief.The film also contains a superb direction of Verbinski in all scenes, giving the film also pretty adventurous moments when you see the great and vast Caribbean, and also epic moments of action that range from fun choreographed chase-sequences to epic battles between pirate's ships against another. Ah, speaking of pirates, Verbinski seems to have grabbed almost all the clichés of pirates and thrown in the movie: one speaker parrot on a pirate's shoulder (no, neither Sparrow or Barbossa, one seems to have something against animals and Barbossa has a annoying monkey); dirty teeth and horrible breath; the favorite drink of any pirate, rum; and the British navy with elegant gentlemen leading them against pirates, and much more! Now the performances, even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have a good romantic connection in their characters, their acting doesn't shine much in this movie (they shine much more in the unnecessary but great sequels that the movie had). Perhaps the reason for this is the superb Geoffrey Rush, that perfectly embodying the spirit of a Pirate since the evilness to the "aarrgghhh", OR the highest and memorable point of the film that is the EXCELLENT performance by Johnny Depp as the unforgettable Jack Sparrow. His performance was so weird, so fun and so good that it cost him his varied roles in films like the weird and funny guy."Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" can be one of the several examples that entertainment can simultaneously be VERY fun; well written; well-acted; well directed and contain a luxurious soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, "Pirates" is entertainment and popcorn-flick at its best and much more! 10/10</fullReview>

Comes close to recreating some of the bigger-than-life wonder that we experience at the movies in our childhood. Depp is a fey, hilarious wonder.Argh! This be an awesome movie! It's a fun adventure with plenty of humor, well done special effects, and great acting. Bummer that this is the only one that doesn't suck in the series. "The Curse of the Black Pearl" is not a flawless film; there are some plot points that don't add up. But it's very unique and makes good use with what the genre has to offer.Here -- in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high- seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural -- Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Curse of the Black Pearl is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's such an entertaining film, I've seen it many times and I still thoroughly enjoy it every time, the story and characters are all executed very well and we are never really sure where the next scene is headed, which is great to see in a movie, you never really know what's going to happen. My only problem is that they tended to hold back on the scary moments, just when the film starts to feel like a bit of a horror and it's sending a shiver down your spine, it would make a joke or do something to completely lighten the mood of these scenes, which I do understand because it wanted to be as kid friendly as possible, but these parts would have a much better effect had they been more thrilling. The cast are of course a major part of what makes this film so great, there is excellent chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush is unrecognizeable as his character, but the star of the show is, without a doubt, Johnny Depp, it will come as no surprise with a character as flamboyant and likable as Captain Jack Sparrow that he manages to steal every scene he's in, certainly one of the most beloved movie characters of all time, for all the right reasons. Action packed, thrilling and also quite funny, I would recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. Will Turner must team up with wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save the governors daughter Elizabeth Swan from a gang of pirates that have become cursed by their ship, the Black Pearl.Best Performance: Johnny Depp</fullReview>

The acting of Captain Jack Sparrow is so astonishing that i forgot he was an actor not a daredevil pirate captain. The movie was full of fantasy but it didn't have any negative affect of me. The costume, graphics and specially the language was used is so perfect that it seemed i was watching a video clip from the great pirate era. the story out line was something very new. i don't understand why it was rated only 8.0! it deserves more.

		<fullReview>I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously.Johnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.</fullReview>

Watching this, however, changed my view on movies. The amazing story is well written and directed. The amazing soundtrack makes you want to move, and makes you feel as though you could take on an army while the theme plays in the background. The amazing humor that makes you laugh without pushing it on you or even seeming intentional at times. The amazing actions scenes that are even better coupled with the soundtrack. Everything about this movie is simple amazing.This is the only movie I've ever seen that I can say I don't have any major complaints or criticisms of. Whenever I watch this movie, I can't help but smile and laugh. I've seen it so many times I have to hold myself back from reciting the parts of the script that I've memorized by heart.I can recommend this to anyone of any age any day of the week. It's quite easily established itself as a timeless classic in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean: More Than a Kid's Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean has become much more than a ride at Disney World: Gore Verbinski has transformed this children's ride into a summer blockbuster. From the eccentric character of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), to the sword fights, and of course the romance, this movie has something for every moviegoer. Verbinski has created a classic that incorporates adventure, fantasy, and romance into a film that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.This tale of adventure centers around the bizarre character of Captain Jack Sparrow, who's crew, years before the plot begins, planned a mutiny against him and left him on an island to die. Ironically, the crew of the Black Pearl later became cursed, and the only way to lift the curse lies in the hands of Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley), daughter of a Governor. When the crew captures Elizabeth, her oldest friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with Captain Jack to save her. The story that ensues is full of energy and an ongoing sense of adventure that will keep you captivated through all 143 minutes.The key performance of the movie belongs to Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, he brings his crazy pirate character to life. From Depp's mannerisms to his wild antics, his offbeat humor shows off his likability and diversity as an actor. Captain Jack is impossible to predict and will keep you guessing what he'll do next. His character brings a fun sense of unpredictability and comic relief to this film, making Jack Sparrow nearly impossible to dislike. Now what is a summer movie without a little bit of romance? Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom) serve as this movies love sub-plot. Their love story is a classic fairytale: a poor boy falls for a girl who is out of his league, while a wealthier, more affluent man is courting her. She is kidnapped, so the poor boy goes to save her and they fall in love. While their love story is a predictable one, it doesn't necessarily take away from the plot. Elizabeth isn't your average damsel-in-distress; she is an intelligent, independent woman who often times saves herself as well as others. While the romantic aspect of this movie is relatively foreseeable, Knightley and Bloom do a fantastic job at keeping the audience interested in this storyline with their incredible chemistry.Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that is a must-see on the big screen. It's visually remarkable, from its battles set on the seas surrounding the Caribbean, to the "living dead" beings that are the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, this movie is so action packed that is might even make you feel sea sick watching it in the theaters (but not really). This timeless film will be loved for many years to come, and it's adventurous plot will have you on a ride for it's entirety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good Captain Sparrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- With so many options to experience a movie from IMAX, 3D, surround or on a regular TV the options are overwhelming. I can now say I have been spoiled and can never go back. As part of the SuperPOPS! Concerts Series, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra played alongside of a full screen version of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. First the Friday night I attended on this two night series was packed; you simply could not fill another person in the room. This Pirates series revolves around the adventures of Captain Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who has a good heart but a mischievous spirit and a heart of a pirate. The kind Captain Sparrow simply wants to recapture a ship so that he can lead a team of merry men on the high seas. This is the problem; he crosses paths with wily Captain Barbossa who steals his ship the Black Pearl. Unbeknown to Sparrow the Barbossa crew has a curse that can only be removed from the blood of a living decedent of a pirate. With maiden Elizabeth Swann in the mix, the British fleet gets in the mix lead by a charming Commodore Norrington all to make a fun witty old school pirate tale. At first you think that the presence of a full orchestra will be a distraction but Conductor Richard Kaufman quickly took command of the ASO and they seamless blended into the background and you are transformed to a magical journey to the high seas. Simply a fantastic experience to see these artist in full swing and the only, I mean only way to see a movie. Coming up December is a full schedule of holiday treats, do not miss out to hear this music loud and reignite the spirit of the season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of The Caribbean: The Curse of The Black PearlWhen I first saw this movie I had no idea what to expect as I have never really took interest in action pirate movies. It turned out to be a pretty good movie with comedy, action, and a little suspense and romance thrown in. I was beginning to take a really deep interest in this movie about 1/3 of the way through. The actors were really experienced and really got into character. If the actors didn't get into character as much as these actors did or, weren't as experienced then the movie would not be as excellent as it is. They really drew me into the movie. I felt that once I saw the first movie I had to watch the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Series because the end of each movie left me hanging and I needed to see what was going to happen next. I felt the cast did a good job in keeping the viewers hanging at the end. All the main actors played their roles well so it made me feel like I actually know all the characters. Johnny Depp did an excellent job in playing the pirate; Captain Jack Sparrow. It was like he was made to be Jack Sparrow his personality and everything. The director made the right choice in casting Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He acted the part as like I knew Jack Sparrow, like I have met him in reality when he is just a fictional character in a movie.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and or comedy. The actors transitioned from action, to comedy, to romance all very easily. They showed that they could play the part with ease. Yes it does take a while to get the part but, these actors made it look so easy based on how well they played their part. On the other hand there were some parts where the actors could have gone deeper into the part of their scene. For example during some of the fights there could have been a little more suspense. Though some fights they did a good job in building up suspense. The actors throughout the movie did a good job in keeping the viewers wondering what was going to happen next. It kept me wondering through out the whole movie. I enjoyed how they kept the suspense going too. The movie was not another cliché pirate movie either, it was something different and new. In conclusion I really enjoyed the whole movie. The director and script writer did a good job in filming and putting the movie together. I enjoyed how they paced it because if they wanted to they could have shortened the whole movie. The special effects on the movie didn't make the movie look bad either, they did a good job on adding them into the movie too. "Jack Sparrow: If you were waiting for the opportune moment, that was it." This quote means to me that you have to take the moment whether it is a good time or bad. People think all pirate movies are the same, but they are not. After watching this movie would you consider this the same as all other pirate movies?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an adventure fantasy film based on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney theme parks.It features Johnny Depp,Geoffrey Rush,Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley together with Jack Davenport,Kevin R. McNally,Zoe Saldana and Jonathan Pryce. It was directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The story follows blacksmith Will Turner and pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as they rescue the kidnapped Elizabeth Swann from the cursed crew of the Black Pearl, captained by Hector Barbossa. When Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Swann is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Captain Barbossa and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner, the young man who loves Elizabeth despite the fact that she is promised to another, sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of swashbuckling ship captain Jack Sparrow. Together the two chase after The Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and crew aren't your average pirates. Cursed to remain between the living and the dead, Barbossa and his men look like skeletons when basked in the moonlight. When it is revealed that the only thing that can break the curse is Elizabeth's blood, Jack and Will are faced with a race against time and a battle against the undead to save the Governor's daughter.In this Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons, oddball comedy, a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural has Johnny Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. He's hilarious as he gives his loosest and looniest performance yet and it is spectacular.Entertaining, exciting, and engrossing with a genuine feel of adventure along with excellent performances, this is truly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie as much as I love the sequels as well. A very great beginning, though I must admit that regarding the special effect's and action sequences , they improve later in the following sequels. Nevertheless, the film is great. The plot is twisted and catchy, the action sequences are great also, especially the battle between the two ships later in the movie, the actors are very talented, they made each of their character unique and lovable, and last but not least the score is amazing and draws perfect with the epic scenes, Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer did a perfect job.An awesome movie, surely worth watching. Gore Verbinski did a fantastic job. Johnny Depp portraying the funny and a bit lumpy captain Jack is beyond amazing and hilarious the same time. Geoffrey Rush portraying the cursed and twisted captain Barbossa is surely the best performance I've seen. Orlando Bloom plays the perfect knight in shinny armor for our Keira Knightley's though lady character. And also, although they play "small" character's, Lee Arenberg's and Mackenzie Crook's Pintel and Raggeti are by far the most hilarious little villains in the movie.This being said, like I mentioned earlier a great beginning for what will be an awesome series from that day forward. Congratulations to everyone who contributed in making of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will firstly say that after seeing the trailer and previews for this film I had serious doubts. I was afraid that the producers would just try to cash in on the original's success, and forget about any content.I was pleasantly proved wrong. This is the most fun I've had in the cinema in the longest time. I can't remember the last time I was so entertained.Although it is a bit slow at times, and a bit predictable (although fun in it's predictability), it hardly lets up and continuously entertains.If you loved the original, you will DEFINITELY love this film. The ending not only makes you laugh, it makes you think "What the hell?" and will make you eagerly anticipate (major understatement) the third installment.There are some great lines, the same fun characters, an inventive and fun story, and some brilliantly staged action sequences.In summation: SEE IT! See it on the big screen. If you miss it, you will surely regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blacksmith Will Turner teams up with eccentric pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.Disney movies personally suck. They only once were good but stuff nowadays just lost all of it's magic. The whole movies that can live up to it's full power is Pixar. Then in 2003, this happened. The Curse of the Black Pearl is the first installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Haven't seeing the sequels as of yet, this one is truly a gem. The action sequences (for one) are completely breathtaking. You'll actually care about the characters and everything that's going on. The acting is pretty good too, especially for a Disney movie. Johnny Depp plays a drunken pirate, and a good one at that. He deserves every one of his awards. Then we come to the score, which is AMAZING! It increased your adrenaline level and it is really unique. I have never been fascinated with pirates or anything, but this film is just awesome, and every aspect is amazing. As of now, I'm getting ready to watch Dead Man's Chest with entirely HIGH expectations! And listen to the tag line, you'll be blown out of the water! 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best movies often start with several strikes against them. I'm thinking of starting a list: Top Ten Movies That Should Have Sucked But So Didn't. This movie will be on it. The only reason I saw it at all was that we had a teenager girl around the house at the time it came out. Look at the facts: It's based on a Disneyland ride. The "babe" is a scrawny, sneering plastic surgery nightmare. There are pirates in it---the kiss of death (along with hot air balloons). Those factors would normally be enough to sink any movie, but not this one.Depp is magnificent---worth the price of admission all by himself. He's created one of the most memorable and quirky characters in movie history in Captain Jack Sparrow. Rush is magnificent, too. His snarling, insouciant West-of-England salty dog is the distillation of every such pirate in every such movie since Treasure Island. (Their sword fight, by the way, is one of the best in any movie any time.) Bloom holds his own without intruding, and so does Knightley, I grudgingly admit, although I couldn't get past those swollen lips with the thigh fat squirted into them with a hypodermic needle. Why don't they just tattoo a mouth on their face and be done with it? Unless you hate fun or get creeped out by ghoulishness (and I'm not talking about Knightley this time), you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer looked like fun, and we'd been on the ride, so we decided to go and see this pirate movie.The eerie opening was effective, and this was followed by some mild intrigue and romance as Orlando Bloom's apprentice swordsmith clearly wished to romance Keira Knightly's governor's daughter. And then Captain Jack Sparrow arrived, in one of the best movie entrances anywhere, any time, and the film took off.It had a strong story, lots of eye candy, humour, action, knockabout slapstick, excitement, swashbuckling adventure, a dramatic and memorable score, an eclectic cast on top form, terrific special effects, lots of nods to the theme park ride, a cracking script, and a fabulous central performance from Johnny Depp.Completely unexpectedly, it turned out to be one of the best and most entertaining family films of recent years.Superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, "The Curse of the Balck Pearl" is the best movie from the original trilogy. Since the creators consider "On Stranger Tides" a reboot, I won't mention it except for this time.This film is about a blacksmith in some Caribbean island that tries to get his beloved one back from the pirates who kidnapped her. In the process he teams up with the eccentric but very likable Captain Jack Sparrow. We find out later that their stories are connected somehow to the mighty ship "The Black Pearl", that used to be led by Sparrow before Barbossa and the rest of the pirates took it over in a mutiny.One of the best aspects of this movie is the plot, is not simple as you might expect from a Disney movie about pirates, it's really original, with the correct amount of adventure, romance, action and fun. I wasn't excited about this film when it came out, but when I caught on TV years after its original release, I was blown away. At this point, I watched all the movies from this series and liked all of them, but this is far superior than the other two.It has some kind of magic, I was really excited when I was watching it for the first time, it made me feel something, and that is the reason why this one is better than the other two (They were not bad, but I think that they didn't match this one). It has many positive sides, like the outfits (I don't know if they were historically accurate, but they looked great nonetheless), the breathtaking scenarios, the dialog, and obviously, the actors.Every actor was great. Bloom was convincing as the reluctant pirate, Keira was charming as Elizabeth, and she is beautiful, and the rest of the cast was great also. An special mention goes to both Rush and Depp who were extremely good in their roles as Barbossa and Sparrow respectively. Even if Rush plays the bad guy, is likable as a character because he was both funny and evil, and had a strong presence on screen. I won't even try to spend words to say what everyone thinks about Sparrow, nobody could possibly play that role like Depp.But not everything is perfect in this movie. One of the negative aspects I found were some "funny" lines that felt out of place and little forced. On the other hand, it was a bit long for my taste. There are also some mistakes in the plot, but they weren't big thankfully.I recommend it to everyone because is really entertaining , it has great actors in great roles, and it was like a real adventure. You won't be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean" is one of the best adventure franchises of the recent years. It is a incredibly funny and exciting combination of adventure, action, fantasy and comedy, with excellent results.The performance of Johnny Depp is magnificent, and his character (Jack Sparrow) is one of the most memorable and fascinating (And also funny) characters of all the history of the cinema.The rest of the cast was incredible here, too. All their characters were great.The special effects and the music were excellent, and create a great atmosphere of adventure. It is epic, exciting and enjoyable."Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" was a perfect beginning for a great trilogy, and it was one of the best adventure flicks of the recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best action/adventure films in the last decade. It is an adventure film, with a lot of genres involved. There is a handful of fun action, a lot of funny dialog, and some character development for the drama. It is an all ages movie. I think this is Johnny Depp's best role. The supporting actors are also up there in performance. This is a first of its kind being very unique in many ways. Its all about pirates on the seas and hunting for treasure and the like, nut it puts a whole twist into it with the funny side remarks and the family adventure style. If you enjoy watching fun effects and beautiful scenery and like a good old fashioned adventure film, this is definitely for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Pirate Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the opening to a very good franchise though this is the best one of the series yet(I heard really good things about #4). The only other pirate movie I saw before this was Hook. Hook should not even be compared to this. Sorry, Mr. Spielberg! Johnny Depp, in my opinion, turned Jack Sparrow into the Top Ten list of all-time acting. Savvy? Elizabeth Swann, daughter of a governor, was kidnapped by a host of feisty pirates. Now her lover Will Turner join forces with Jack Sparrow who used to be with those pirates to rescue Swann.This movie has a little of everything here. There's plenty of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. I didn't want to see this movie when it first came out, but I was forced to. I'm glad I did. I rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a pirate film worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when Johnny Depp plays a pirate? Genius! Not only was his character charming, funny, witty, and incredibly entertaining, but it really made the film. Besides him, POTC will take you on an adventure that I can promise you will enjoy. The feel of the film is light hearted and is at times, very funny. Many consider this to be a movie just for kids, not so. From the moment the film starts it is absolutely captivating. Defanatley worth your time. The plot will not bore you, and the film is all around, fun. As one of the makers of Pirates said, "you can't go wrong with Geoffry Rush and Johnny Depp", and he was right. Of course its unrealistic, and it romanticizes piracy, but its fantasy. If your a free spirited person I think this film will fit you well. It deserves to be called a classic, and though Disney has swayed toward the cheesy side of things lately, this movie isn't at all. So go out and see this movie, savvy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood needed to lift curse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comment is to point out something that viewers may have overlooked concerning this movie. As Captain Barbosa said, anyone who removes even a single piece from the chest will be punished forever. The curse can only be lifted when all the gold coins are returned to the chest and the blood repaid. I would like to point out that when Will Turner dropped the coin with his blood on it, and the coin with Captain Jack Sparrow's blood on it, into the chest, that that is when his father died, that is, if in fact, his father was still at the bottom of the ocean. For the almost 10 years prior to that, his father was not dead. The only way they could have needed the blood of Bootstrap Bill to lift the curse, was if Bootstrap Bill removed a coin from the chest and in doing so, he would have become one of the cursed and as such he can't die. It was right after that that he was on his way down to Davey Jones locker, namely the bottom of the ocean, thanks to Captain Barbosa. I think that most people that see this movie will get the impression that he died then but he most certainly was not dead. He can't die until the curse is lifted.The fact that he was not dead for the 10 years prior to his son dropping the coin in the chest makes me wonder what he was doing all that time, so I think that maybe...I can't wait for the next Pirate movie to be released.For years I always said that the best movie ever was "Kelly's Heroes." Now, it's "Kelly's Heroes and "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" that is the best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handsomely Produced, Exciting And Amusing Pirate Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of mutinous pirates, led by the villainous Barbossa, have been cursed to sail the seas as ghosts until they return every last gold coin from a stolen Aztec treasure chest. Their former leader, Captain Jack Sparrow, is seeking his revenge upon Barbossa and the return of his ship, The Black Pearl. The pirates kidnap the Governor's daughter, who possesses one of the coins, and the scene is set for a heroic rescue ...Here's a movie first I think - a film based on a theme-park ride - but Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is a tremendous action-filled pirate adventure in the classic style, with plenty of sea-dogs, cutlass waving, treasure-hunting, unrequited love and general swashbuckling. There is a lot of good-natured mugging by the likable cast, but Depp steals the show as the lovable Jack Sparrow - bold and dashing but also downtrodden and dubious, with a wonderful Cockney accent and too much mascara. Verbinski balances the film beautifully, keeping the story rolling along nicely, with action, scares, comedy and romance in equal measure. There are several terrific set-pieces; the swordfight between Depp and Bloom in a smithy, a moonlight sequence where the pirates are revealed in all their ghostly glory, a great bit where Depp and Bloom steal a ship but get caught by a faster ship and boarded and then steal that ship, and a great escape-the-hangman's-noose scene at the end. There is a wonderfully rousing score by Klaus Badelt, great visual effects by John Knoll, and Jerry Bruckheimer's production is lavish. Everybody should enjoy a good pirate movie from time to time, and this one is terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a Ho Ho Ho Hum.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean" (2002): Once in awhile I ignore my gut instinct, and see a film I KNOW deep down is junk - just to prove I was right, I guess - and I did it again, here. There's something about how the "buzz" of a film travels. Water cooler time-kill. Three beers chit-chat. Stumble into one another quickie-advice. THOSE films are usually ones I do NOT like. T.V. ads have a vibe to them also, even when the stars are those who've done great work before. If it's a "crowd pleaser" - which "Pirates..." was - I should always go with the odds, and avoid it. This thing was hardly fun, hardly witty, hardly anything. It dragged and dragged...and dragged...dragged along under it's own tedious weight. Depp is a slightly gay pirate who knows lots of others with bad teeth. There are two soldiers who take the brunt of silly jokes (the Laurel &amp; Hardy quotient). Special effects and action are required to cover a lack of story while entertaining the small mind, and required "twists" are there to "surprise" same...all this and more added up to nothing satisfying. It's a Disney (NON-Pixar) product, and couldn't be more evident in "McPirates of the Caribbean".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean wasn't the best movie I've seen, but it wasn't the worst either. If nothing else, it was just plain escapist fun and a swashbuckling adventure ride. It's more style than substance and pretty much just captures your attention because of its cool effects. The plot itself is pretty much nothing spectacular or very surprising. Even though the movie has great actors like Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush, I kept on getting the impression that each of them could have somehow done better. Especially Orlando Bloom who didn't really seem to be making much of an effort. I'm told that there's a sequel in the works - two, in fact. So either the producers are leaving room for improvement, or just looking to make a quick buck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to say, that I did not expected anything special from this "movie of Disney production". It is not a very best piece of art, but it is piece of art. I think, and I tell it to everybody with which I talk about films, that film is a kind of art. It is in essence a theater piece fashioned with modern digital effects and sounds and music. It is art and it is hard to say, that it is just good or bad. But shortly: this movie is family movie and story is very simple. Characters are not preciously described, but every "holes" are counterbalanced by Johny Depp's acting (and Rush). Without Depp it would be a little boring movie, but with him it is fun to see it even twice or more. In this category (family "fairytale" movie) it is very amusing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a very good movie. I seen a little after it came out in theaters. It was a well made film. Will Turner, is the son of a pirate who hid a treasure. One of the pirates is now looking for the hidden treasure and find Will Turner, who they think knows where his father hid the treasure. They meet Johnny Depp's character, Jack Sparrow, who we find out has his own interest in the treasure. So he uses Will to get there too. At the end, they all end up finding the treasure together at the same time, and of coarse the good guy wins. So Will, and Jack both split the treasure before going back to England. I encourage anyone who likes these kind of pirate movies to go see this.</fullReview>

Throughout the entire movie I was hoping he would just die. The whole thing was a bit over the top and overdone. Johnny Depp was great, though. Johnny Depp is always great. Too bad it's movies like this that make people realize what a great actor he is.

		<shortDescription>Starring A lovable feline pirate ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw rented this movie for the first time in the middle of 2004. It's kind of a silly movie, and it's extremely violent in parts. We had hoped to show it to our young children but the violence was too great after the first 10 minutes so we shut it off and watched it later ourselves.What kept me watching this entire movie was Johnny Depp. He does an absolutely awesome acting job of playing a cunning but effeminate / feline pirate. half the time he says something his mannerisms just crak me up inside. in the movie he is definitely a heterosexual but there is something just slightly effeminate / feline about his performance that is very amusing. i don't know why this fascinated me so much, but his personality and character were just really irresistible and i kept wondering what he would do and what he would say. it's not often that you see a movie that stars a lovable effeminate / feline pirate. And yes, I'm male too, so this was quite a surprise to me. Anyway, the movie rates about a 6, but johnny depp's performance is a 10 ( by the way, were there any other actors in this movie ?? I didn't notice any of them - Depp stole the show ). Go see it if you haven't seen it, it's a silly movie but its fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a entertaining, light, shallow movie, you've come to the right place. Pirates of the Caribbean's blend of comedy and action works wonderfully creating a truly fun movie to pass the time. The cast, for the most part, is great, especially Johnny Depp, who turns a interesting character into wonderful, show stealing one. This contrasts with Orlando Bloom, whos character is already boring compared to jack sparrow without Blooms acting adding to it. Yes this movie is one of the most entertaining movies i've ever seen, but it is little more. While Depp's character is memorable, i can hardly remember the details of the plot any more and the movie has little artistic value. If you want to see johnny Depp, I can suggest What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Edward Scissorhands, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as some alternatives, but if you're just in the mood for a movie that lets you sit back and relax, look no further than Pirates of the Caribbean.</fullReview>

I'd recommend it not just because of the incredibly sexy main character (Jack Sparrow), but because it has something for everyone. The younger kids can laugh at the slap-stick humor, the adults can laugh at the ever-present eunich references made by Depp, and the teenagers can laugh at everything and anything. (I speak from experience) Depp's performance in this role is one that only he could pull off. Had anyone but Johnny been casted for this role, I think it's safe to say this film wouldn't have done as well as it did.

This doesn't really way too much on the film, as the only thing which is the same is the pirates and the Caribbean. the story is not too bad, it involves pirates -- which is no real surprise. I was not expecting to see anything other then pirates, and lots of ships sailing and shooting at one another. The acting is pretty good. Johnny Depp does a great job of moving like a lizard as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom also does well as Will Turner. Kiera Knightley is....well....Kiera Knightley. Geoffrey Rush also does very well. The special effects are pretty well done. The transformations of the pirates as they go from human from to Skeleton is pretty well done. All pretty convincing when it comes right down to it. I do have one real problem with the movie, when Jack is revealed as a ghost pirate. It is never revealed how he can walk in daylight. Or why he is even a ghost pirate. Maybe they were trying to leave a cliffhanger ending for the sequel, which is apparently in the works. All in all, this is a pretty good movie. If you love action, you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I finally got around to seeing this because I continue to hear such rave reviews and decided they can't be all wrong.Turns out, I was wrong: this movie bored me bored me bored me. By the time the movie was half-over, I began waiting impatiently for the smallest sighting of Johnny Depp - any scene he was in was incredible: his acting was genius, his costume was perfect, and his Captain Jack Sparrow consumed him. During his appearances, the scenes were understandable, sensible (for a quirky Pirate movie), and extremely entertaining; I laughed aloud almost every time he was on screen.Unfortunately, if he was not involved in a scene, it was guaranteed to be confusing and boring. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were the only actors whose lines could be understood the first time listening, I felt. I saw this on DVD with the convenience of the life-saving remote control to rewind when I couldn't get it. How did theater-goers manage?? Everyone else spoke too fast! I found myself rewinding many of Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom's lines, along with a few of the pirates. What's up with that? Why the frenetic spewing of lines? Depp's and Rush's words flowed from them as though part of their being, their essence. Masters, they are.The story unnecessarily twisted back and forth - trust or don't trust, honesty or dishonesty, honor or betrayal - it went from one extreme to the other like the audience was in a secret attempt by the writers to break the Guinness Record for yo-yoing. Too much work for the audience, for too little payoff, I say; it was exhausting. I am guessing that the ride in the park is similar: back and forth and back and forth, just to the point of breaking "the fine line," you know, when you are just about to throw up? Now that I think of it, the actors' quality of performances yo-yoed from scene to scene as well. Up with Depp, down with Bloom. Up and down, up and down. It could have ended far sooner than it had.And the special effects, while impressive programming for video games and home entertainment centers, also did nothing for me when substituting skeletons for fleshy humans in this movie. I found the graphics an answer to the laziness in not using real humans in makeup and costume. They looked incredibly costumed and made up as human pirates, why not try the same technique for the immortal pirates? I thought it was kitschy and a cop-out.Johnny Depp outperformed everyone in this movie, including the writers and director. Other than Rush, the only others who performed on nearly the same level were the two goofballs trying to prevent him from docking, and later holding the flag during the execution scene.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to review such a popular, blockbuster film as Pirates. Basically, Depp's acting is terrific. So is Geoffrey Rush's. Bloom makes another appearance in a big movie, but both his and Knightley's characters are fairly shut out due to Depp. Some great dialogue; the script is absolutely hilarious. I have to admit I loved the costuming and makeup (it's unfortunate that all its Oscar nominations occurred during the year of Lord of the Rings). The music is also wonderful, fitting the adventurish theme perfectly. Although the story has a couple flaws and there is a fair bit of Hollywood predictability, the movie counters this with humour and good storytelling. All in all, the first pirate movie of its kind - modern, funny, and adventurous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is in my opinion one of the best movies ever made. Johnny Depp plays the always drunk and extremely funny Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom Is the slightly shy very hot blacksmith turned pirate William Turner. and Kiera Knightly is not your typical damsel in distress Elizabeth Swann.in the movie Elizabeth is captured by the fiendish captain Barbosa who years earlier stole captain Jack's ship and crew. then William and Capt. Jack team up to go save elizabeth and get the ship back, add an ancient curse and a bottle of rum and you've got the best pirate movie I've ever seen. It has just enough of everything to keep everyone interested.overall i give it a 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Adventure movie EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, Johnny Depp's character is the best in the whole movie. The thing that probably makes him the best is because of the things he says and his attitude to his environment and his facial expressions. It's his character thats makes the movie a great thing to watch.Secondly, Orlando Bloom's character is also awesome. Ladies who like him will be pleased to know that we see a lot of him in the movie.The movie has a good plot and it is fun for the whole family to watch. No matter how many times you watch Pirates of the Caribbean you always discover new things. The sequel to the movie should be as good as the first.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't already watched this fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) - 6.5 / 10Johnny Depp is simply this films saving grace. He plays a brilliant pirate captain, who, after leading his ship astray was mutinied and walked the plank. His composure, facial expression and emotion all captured the character perfectly. The role of Captain Jack Sparrow couldn't have been cast better. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were both very average. Bloom is destined to become the next Adam Sandler, playing one character ? and playing it poorly. Geoffrey Rush was quite decent; however was no where near up to the level he's previously reached in films like Shakespeare in Love.The special effects were pretty too look at, but style-over-substance is never a good way to go about making a movie ? and it seems this is the route Gore Verbinski has lead 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. At 143 minutes the movie was far too long. The slower sections felt as if they dragged on for hours, and the action sequences were over before you could batter an eyelid.'Pirates of the Caribbean' is watchable, and entertaining, but not brilliant, or even near-brilliant. Depp makes watching Pirates worthwhile but I'm generally not a fan of a film that's held on the shoulders of one great performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi I love Pirates of the Caribbean, it's so cool and Johnny Depp is so hot. Yum yum! I like the bit where Jack says "But, why's the rum gone" it so funny! I think the graphics are amazing, i like the skeletons they're scary, oooohhhh! It's a fantastical movie. I am doing an English presentation on it, i got lots of information from this web site, thank you IMDb, hopefully I'll pass, but probably not. I can't wait for the second one to come out, I hope it is better than the first although sequels are rarely better. I hope whoever watches it enjoys it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything is good except Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is exactly the kind of story I'd wish to see when I was a kid. Action, horror, lady to save, and so on... SFX are good and surprising. Acting are good (great Geoffrey Bush !) except for Johnny Depp and his character.His character : a teenage-looking pirate who is SUPPOSED to be an old friend of the father of a man. But the son (Will Turner) looks older than him ! Unbelievable ! And more : this kid-pirate is supposed to have been the great chief of the worst pirates of Caribbean, twelve or twenty years before ! Sorry, I can't swallow that !It's clear : Johnny Depp is really too young for this part ! I know, it's a sex symbol. But what for ? He's not the one who got the girl at the end ! I think a more mature man (like "Jack Nicholson" for example) would be a better choice.And what about his make-up ? He looks like a "transvestite", he just missed the lipstick. That's a bad choice, again.To fight all these bad choices, this poor Johnny overacts loudly to gain credibility. But in vain !So, for those who can forgets an enormous casting mistake, the movie is pretty good. For those who thinks that a casting mistake can sink a movie, avoid this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try it...you may love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, just get it! Chances are good you will love it; if you don't you will still probably consider it to be good entertainment for an evening. I recommend buying the DVD because you will want to watch it several times. I left the theater with a smile and a feeling that I had just seen something special. What fun! What an Oscar-worthy performance by Johnny Depp! While I was waiting for the DVD, I watched or rewatched most of Johnny's other films. This has been rewarding, because I have found that they are generally well done and interesting. And Johnny IS a great actor! These movies aren't "blockbusters"; I suppose that's why it didn't seem like he got the recognition before Pirates. I especially enjoyed Benny and Joon, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Donnie Brasco. Johnny deserved an Oscar for Pirates because he created a unique character and brightened a day (or many days) for millions of people. I check these reviews from time to time and I can see that many other people have similar thoughts and feelings. But I am compelled to add my comments, because people still keep questioning why some of us love this movie! Number 1, Johnny, an outstanding performance by a uniquely talented man, but there are other reasons to like or love this movie. The other performances were good, too. (Orlando, Keira, Geoffrey, and dozens of others in smaller roles) The plot was not boring, had not been done before. The first time you watch it you may think it doesn't make sense. So watch the DVD a couple of times, then watch it with the writers' comments. That will help a lot. If you still think it's a weak plot...well, that's OK. You'll still enjoy the spirit, the music, the dialog, the makeup, the swordfights, the ships, the monkey, the treasure, the island, and the references to the Disney ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'd like to say I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't know what to expect when I went to see it, but it really entertained me. It was one of those swashbuckling stories with a hint of comedy that are very rare nowadays (or at least very rarely succeed in what they are trying).*SPOILERS WARNING! SPOILERS! BACK AWAY IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE FILM!*I'd just like to make a comment about the previous comment: There is no plot hole about Jack Sparrow being affected by the curse. He didn't suffer from it all along. Before the end fight with Barbossa Sparrow takes one coin from the treasure chest, thus stealing from the treasure and becoming affected by the curse! He only does that so that he is "invulnerable" during the last fight. When he is done with the coin, he tosses it back, thus getting away from the curse. He was only under the curse at the very end, not during the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colourful, noisy,rumbustious adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt this is Johnny Depp's film. As Captain Jack Sparrow he shows once again what a versatile actor he is. He bursts forth on the screen as a wily pirate character full of tricks such as distracting his adversaries with non-stop chatter.His swaggering walk unsteadied by a little too much rum and his flippant manner endear him to us immediately. He seems to fear no man, and despite his unkempt appearance has a way with the women too.Johnny Depp has a mammoth task. He is on the screen most of the time. The success of the film largely depends on his performance. Never once does he shirk this responsibility. Indeed he seems to enjoy every minute.The battles at sea with cannonballs flying through the air bringing down masts and rigging and gouging great holes in the decks are a triumph of set design. Wooden ships are very inflammable and lend themselves to some dramatic moments with everything aflame amid noise and confusion. There is almost too much to watch at one sitting. It is just as well because the story is pretty thin.The film especiaslly in the sword-fighting episodes is reminiscent of some of the early serials that once excited us at the Saturday afternoon flicks. Despite clash of steel on steel not much blood is apparent among the roguish-looking pirates who all look as if they need a hot bath. The make-up is right on target, a real credit to the artists.Much of the time Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa has to act with a monkey sitting on his shoulder. An excellent little touch I thought as it added to his nasty character. I could not take my eyes off the monkey. He stole every scene for me.If we may judge from the almost endless listing of credits, a lot of work was put into this production. It's loud and noisy and lots of fun and will be especially appreciated by those who grew up on pirate stories, and as in all those stories it's the good that triumphs over evil in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Snorebuckling Cruise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I probably shouldn't be writing this, having only watched half the movie. It was so boring I had to either turn it off or succumb to slumber. The only thing that captured me was Depp and his odd posture; is he supposed to be gay? He is a somewhat magnetic presence, but is allowed to mumble his lines to the point that he seems dubbed. The female lead, whose name escapes me, is about as interesting as a half brick. The whole thing is just too contrived.Perhaps it picks up in the second half. Despite well staged action sequences and good production values, there is something repetitious and routine about the action. You never for a moment lose sight of the fact that you are watching a movie, a Disney movie, much the same as the TV pap I loved every Sunday night as a child: The Disney Show (or whatever name it carried at the time).Anyway, since I rented this epic, I am going to try to finish it tomorrow. I hope my first impression, from the first nine hours, whoops, one hour plus, will be reversed. If so, I hope I'll be allowed another comment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok- this movie was good. Seeing it at a 10:00 PM showing- after about the 5th fight you've kind of had enough, but still... action movies can either flop or do awesome- and this movie did awesome. The cast was pretty good- and it was a good story- based on the Disney ride in Cali Disneyland. I did like it, but I don't understand why everyone is obsessed with it!!! What is it, a 3 hour movie? It's kind of long- not a movie that I would watch 100 times... unlike Titanic... but everyone has their opinoins. Another thing- why was Johnny Depp JUST getting noticed for this movie?! Hello!!!! Who has ever seen What's Eating Gilbert Grape or his many other movies that I can't spell right?! Those were very good roles he played- and they're already a couple of years old- some more than others!!! This role Johnny Depp played was funny, but it was just, like, this is not his best role!!! He was nominated for the role of Jack Sparrow?! Come on! I like Johnny Depp a lot- always have- but this role was just... blah. Also, why was Johnny Depp suddenly a major heart throb as soon as this movie came out?! I've known about him for a really long time- he's always been cute! Gosh- it's just annoying. A lot of the girls who went to that movie were there to see it because of Orlando Bloom. Then, when the movie had been out for awhile, all of a sudden there was a new hottie- Johnny Depp- or so it seemed... Sorry, but this just doesn't make any sense. Well, anyways, this is a pretty exciting movie. I'm glad a Disney Movie did so well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Complaints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not thoroughly impressed with Pirates of the Caribbean, as I had heard several glowing word-of-mouth reviews. I have to admit that Johnny Depp's performance was quite hilarious and was the best thing about this movie. One complaint is that the movie is way too long. They could have easily chopped 30-45 minutes from this film without sacrificing anything. Another complaint is the level of violence. I am a horror fan, and certainly am not against violence in the movies. However, the impression this movie gives prior to watching is that it is a Disney-esque film. I think the PG rating is too leniant and the given the stabbings, shootings, and blood that abound in this film, they should have raised it. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FUNNY MOVIE...good for laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested to watch The Pirates of the Caribbean after knowing that it had Orlando Bloom in it (I'm not a big Orlando fan but I wanted to see how he acted outside 'LOTR'). I can tell you one thing- man I laughed my head off...especially when Bloom and Depp take over the ship. 'Gentlemen, do not panic. We're taking over this ship!'. Depp was really good and had a cool costume on. Orlando was also very good...looked different from Legolas but had only a few lines. However, one thing I did like was that the Director did try to keep things looking old without anachronistic additions and everyone did speak in British accents...and not to forget...Pirate accents as well...'Aaargh'. 'You've got to start believing in nightmares...you're in one!' . It wasn't scary as I would have imagined; the skeleton scenes and all were funny and honestly they didn't deserve an oscar nomination for special effects (Matrix Reloaded did). However, the film is great to watch when you're in a mood to watch some funny acting by Depp. Great acting by Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp and yes...also Orlando Bloom. I will watch it again if I have the time. Dunno if I will be able to watch it many times though. Good movie if you want to laugh quite a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keira Knightley as Winona Ryder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a composite of every action fantasy pic made since . . . well, since The Goonies. Every scene was purloined from some other movie. I must admit, I was slightly stumped trying to remember where I had heard, "Jack, Jack," before, but then I recalled the 1976 version of King Kong, and Charles Grodin's appeal to Jeff Bridges' character: "Jack, Jack . . . ." I was amazed at the resemblance of Keira Knightley to Johnny Depp's old flame, Winona Ryder. When Johnny's tattoo is revealed, I half expected it to reveal "Wino," not some reference to the East India Company. (You do know that Johnny altered his "Winona" tattoo to read "Wino," don't you?)You know, this movie does nothing more than overload the senses. In fact, it's an assault on the nervous system. This is what movie making has become.This movie made Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes look like Citizen Kane. This movie ranks in IMDb's Top 250. Sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family rented the DVD of Pirates last night, but I had to stop watching half way through because Johnny Depp was so bad. What was he trying to do ? He seemed to be playing it partly as a 'fop' (slightly camp) with an accent that was someway between a bad English accent and a bad Australian one. It is one of the worst performances I have seen in a movie for years. After reading some of the reviews on this site, where they say he deserves an oscar, well all I can say is that they must have made two versions of the movie, one where he is great, the other where he is awful, and we rented the one where he was awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who hated this movie must have something wrong with them...The snobs who only watch "films" can have a ball tearing it apart, but I think it's great.I'm a huge Depp fan. Seen every movie he's in- and I mean EVERY movie (not just the typical "I've seen Edward Scissor Hands and What's Eating Gilbert Grape so I'm an expert" thing...). I've had to search high and low for some of them, but I did. I'm a huge fan. That being said, I admit that I was very skeptical when I first heard of Pirates coming out... I smelled perhaps another 9th Gate or something. I was saddened. BUT- I do happen to love pirates in general, and I will always see a movie that he makes, so off to the show I went.And I was utterly and amazingly ecstatic. It was a GREAT movie. Yeah, yeah- so it was FUN instead of heart wrenching. Sometimes that's good- certainly it doesn't mean it's BAD just because it isn't a drama... or even because it doesn't fit into a particular genre. As billions of people have aleady said, Depp steals the show. His character is ridiculous and great. The music is really wonderful. Costumes are fun. Jokes are fun, on high and low levels. I really loved the effects of the pirates in and out of the moonlight. I'm really surprised that so many people have called the plot as a down point. I think it's neither overly simplistic nor convoluded. I thought it was clever- a twist on a typical story line. After all, we're talking about pirates here- certain things HAVE to be involved (treasure, ships, swashbuckling...). And we're talking about Johnny Depp also here- so there has to be some oddness to it as well. I think perhaps people who didn't understand the plot should pay a bit more attention...I'm a person who gets uncomfortable in theater seats VERY quickly, and even so I could not believe how quickly the movie flew by. I wasn't bored once- a sign that the movie is more than a stupid thrill-getter. I actually saw it multiple times in theater (I kept having to BRING people ;)), and own the DVD. I couldn't believe it was over 2 hours- it REALLY didn't feel like it. Sometimes, I think people just like to complain for the sake of complaining.Definite good entertainment. Excellent on several levels. I think my only complaints would be that- 1: I felt Orlando Bloom's character was a little "meh". There either wasn't a lot of depth, or he was over-emphasizing what I considered unimportant attributes. 2: I wasn't thrilled with Keira Knightly, and I'm not sure why. Didn't severely dislike her performance, but it didn't blow me away, either.I would have to rank it as one of my favorite movies... which also means I really hope they don't do a sequal.</fullReview>

There is a sense of get ready to take off for one wild ride, but the movie drowns in its own over-the-top intentions. Before it's over, it's like watching "The Mummy" - idiotic, paper-thin plot; constant, jangling action scenes with no core; terrible chemistry between Bloom (he makes Keanu Reeves look like William Gillette) and Knightley; and those silly skeleton special effects! And the dang thing goes on for absolute ever!Depp has been much better in much better things, but Geoffrey Rush and he are the ONLY things above water here. This film joins "Pirates", "The Pirate", and "Hook" in the crappy pirate film list. It's only worth about 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Sparrow Became Cursed at the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch it carefully, you will see that he picks up a gold piece before he begins the fight with the Captain so Sparrow cannot be killed either. Being part of the original group that was cursed, but never having held one of the gold pieces, the curse kicks in when he takes a gold piece. You may also notice that just before he shoots the Captain, he tosses his gold piece back to Will Turner, who completes the ending of the curse. Thus the Captain is mortal and therefore killed by Sparrows bullet. This was a very good use of the rules by which the curse is acquired and lifted. And I thought Sparrow was a spacey kind of guy, but apparently figured it out quite nicely. (Good writers!)Neat trick, eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got around to seeing "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl". Rented the DVD and watched it while doing the laundry. You know what? I found myself anxiously waiting for the wash and dry cycles to be finished, so I could have something really fun to do, like fold clothes.Okay, so the 17th-century period costumes are nice, and the photography occasionally interesting (though at times I felt more like I was seeing a rerun of "Survivor: Pearl Islands"). And the moment when the heroine has her first fainting spell, because she simply can't breathe in her whalebone corset, was hilarious. But that was the only time I laughed.Other than that, "Pirates of the Caribbean" was a snorefest. I would actually rate it the most boring film I have seen in the past year. And that's saying a lot, since I usually go to the cinema twice a week. The tale of a ghost ship and her skeleton crew goes on (and on) for over two hours, and frankly it is two hours too long.Boy, am I glad I didn't pay full admission to see "Pirates" at a theatre. That would have been "avast" mistake.As Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp is mildly amusing with his beads and braids and kohl-laden eyes. But even his highly mannered performance wears thin fast.Depp's parting shot in the film is "Yo-ho!" I would amend that to "Yo-ho-hum!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curse of the Curse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this movie with no expectations other than enjoying a mildly amusing romp on the high seas with cutthroats, scalawags and beloved rogues. What I got instead was a jumble of noise, special effects and long, boring stretches of interminable action. I guess I'm getting too jaded for this type of thrill-ride, cartoon-like picture, and it depresses me. Johnny Depp nominated by an Academy Award? Now I think I know why he always looks so somber at the last two awards ceremonies he's attended. He's probably realized he must be in a dream and it can't possibly be true, and he is sitting there in dread of waking up. Anyway, about the time the curse manifested itself and Captain Barbarossa's crew turned into ghosts, I began thinking about my list of household chores to do the next day. How can an audience, even those under 20, experience the vicarious thrill of impending menace from a bunch of comical skeletons dressed in tattered pirate gear who are immune to death? Who cares to watch dueling ghosts plunging cutlasses into each other with no ill effect? Boring. Pirate movies are by their very nature a far remove from reality, but still?once things became supernatural I lost all interest. Scenes of skeleton pirates dueling with each other belong in a videogame or perhaps a Silly Symphony cartoon of the 1930s. I think future reviews on IMDb should require the viewers to post their ages since I can't believe this movie appealed to anyone over 30. And can't we have a crowd pleaser without stereotypes, and wall-to-wall noise? One has only to look at the pacing of such classic pirate movies as `The Sea Wolf' or the first two versions of `Treasure Island' or even the silent `The Black Pirate' to see how it should be done. Dialogue peppered with token British and pirate slang rang hollow and it was all just too cute. Perhaps I've lost touch with what constitutes entertainment today, but I also think what used to be solely the realm of animation has inappropriately been conscripted into live-action just because technology and economics allow us to do it. What a tiresome exercise this was, and its only claim to immortality will be how well the special effects hold up in ten years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit..when I first saw the trailer I thought it was one of those good pirate, bad pirate movies..but I went to see it only because I have this "thing" with pirates. So, as I'm watching it I keep wanting to know what would happen next. Johnny Depp really brought out his acting skills in this movie. The whole drunk drinking walk was very cool and his jokes--hilarious.I give this movie 4 stars in my personal reference.Good movie, I could watch it again. What I really liked about it was that the music played so well with the movie. I love the music. So...piratey :) Argghh.</fullReview>

( which i heard is going to be very funny) Keira Knightly plays Elizabeth quite well and Geoffrey Rush is outstanding. If you haven't seen the movie you definetley should.

		<shortDescription>Rant at the poorest film in decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utter rubbish - this is just a rant as there is little worth mentioning. Poor acting, directing, editing, no plot worth thinking about and the lowest production values of any film made in the last 50 years. This is especially noticeable in the timing between the actors - surely its a case of snipping a few frames. Is Johnny Depp impersonationg David Bowie? This really is a stinker as many TV &amp; Radio critics have bent over backwards to emphasise. There are other bad films which are almost necessarily bad due to financial limitations and the lack of the modern technical advances (that guy in a bear suit with a fish bowl as a helmet and flying saucers on strings). They however have acheived a cult staus, this is just drivel, this is not bad it is awful, actually bad at being bad, which I guess is mediocre or something. Don't watch it. Don't even watch it to see how bad it is.On reading other opinions here I can only assume (as I have for a while) that many people here are hyping the films, probably on request from secondrate US producers.That guy out of the office is in it and looks promising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say Johnny Depp is amazing in this movie is an understatement. He is remarkable...from his slight, drunken slur to his swagger. How he changes his voice to play Captain Jack Sparrow is the stuff awards are made of. It never falters. His screen presence is everything in this movie along with Geoffrey Rush'. I've love Edward Scissorhands to From Hell starring Johnny Depp...but this is the icing on the cake. I really hope they DON'T make a sequel unless someone takes the time to write one that's really good...and then if Depp doesn't do it, it's pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this recently &amp; was impressed by (some of) the acting, dialogue &amp; special effects. J Depp is prominent mainly because O Bloom's acting is very weak. The film's much better than most Disney fare &amp; might actually be spoken of in the same breath as 20000 leagues under the sea. Some of the humour appears to be aimed at adults and practically all actors at least attempt non American accents (except for Zoe Saldana, who presumably couldn't manage one). All things considered, it's a good Disney film (but it's still only a Disney film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp is insane.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely has an actor created a character as memorable as Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. I, admittingly, was reluctant to see this film from the previews and the glimpses of Sparrow we caught there. He seemed too cartoony, too silly, and not like a character I'd wind up liking. In the film itself, however, not only does it work, but Depp alone is half the reason to see Pirates.That's not to downplay Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley, they play their parts well and feel natural in all their roles (I especially like Barbossa's twisted sense of humor - Rush had a lot of fun as a pirate captain), and seeing Rush and Depp share a scene was interesting since both characters were incredibly well played and the two play off one another particularly well.This is one of those movies that walks a dangerous line of being too serious with silly material and simultaneously being too silly with serious material (if that makes sense); however, Verbinski and the cast know when to be silly, when to be serious, and how to have fun with their production. The film knows exactly what it is and what its doing (when its doing it), making it a perfect movie to sit back, suspend disbelief, and enjoy the ride.Obviously, it also offers plenty of references to the Disney ride and other pirate films to catch for the remotely observant viewer.The film marks, Klaus Badelt's third solo Hollywood score, and thank you Hans Zimmer for inviting this talent to the states. Though the Pirates score reminds me of a number of previous film scores, that is by no means a complaint - he's infused it with enough personal touches and introduced enough new material to make it distinctly his own. Like the movie, it's fun and intense at the same time.In short, sure the film has its share of inaccuracies and reasons not to like it . . . but Pirates has such strong points and is enough fun to watch to stop caring about such minute details. If you can't have fun, go rent Black Hawk Down . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was a very bold move for Disney to base a movie on a ride that generations of people have loved and stood by. However, the move proved to not be dissapointing. It is the most quoted movie now at my school (the the drama department, go figure), and a movie that people have stood by. The plot was origonal, the casting was incredible (Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush), the effects were outstanding and consistent, the music was great, and best of all, the sword fighting was great and taken seriously. As a fencing student, I paid close attention to the fights, and I was glad to see the movie pay attention to form and footwork instead of just looking for a thrill that came along anyway. In my opinion, this is one of the better moves that Disney has made in filmaking as of late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I was expecting something much more from this film. I had been waiting for it to come out on DVD so I could buy it and see it on my 57" widescreen. It took me two starts to get through the picture as the first half hour for me was disjointed and didn't make a lot of sense as to a plot. After seeing the whole film I have to say that it reminded me a great deal of what you would expect in MTV videos. Johnny Depp? When he first came on screen I thought he was drunk. He acted throughout the whole film as would be expected of a person who had about a 2.0 blood alcohol level. His speech was always slurred and it certainly appeared to me that he chose to play his character as though he was drunk. It got to be a little irritating.I did enjoy the film and will watch it again, no doubt, and can recommend it. However, it seemed to me that they just attempted to cram too many segments than was necessary into the film in attempting to constantly perk your interest. It was almost as though there were two films edited together in the time space of one. Perhaps when I sit down again to see it I will know what to expect and will not be jerked around so much. Good film, but certainly not one of my 100 favorites.</fullReview>

I just finished watching it and now I see what I was missing. The action, the effects and the best performence of 2003 by Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow which should get him an oscar nod. I stress the word should because it's highly unlikely but never the less he should. I was stunned how fast moving the story was it seemed to be quite fast for a 2 hr plus movie. The whole 2 hrs though was an exciting ride with thrills and chills. The effects could give Return of the King a run for there money I think.

		<fullReview>Before I begin I would like to ask what the heck "tedg" was talking about in his posting for this film. He/She spent their entire review talking about camera positions and then had the odd idea of putting the phrase "Spoilers herein" at the start of the message. What exactly did you ruin, tedg, the camera angles? And why did you compare this film to 12 Monkeys and Panic Room? How are those movies similar in any way in which you could compare and contrast them? And how exactly does one "steal" another person's camera trick? That's like someone doing a donut in their car and then being accused of stealing the maneuver from the original creator, Daryll Dwebster Donut. News flash: you can't get a patent on a camera trick. Maybe a camera, yes, but not a trick! If you feel like explaining yourself, e-mail me . Title the e-mail, "tedg's reasoning on his/her PotC:CotBP review."Sorry, just felt like rambling there for a second. Now, on to the review! While I enjoy this film quite a lot, I have to question why everyone went stark raving mad over its arrival. Sure, I have no problem saying that Pirates is a very entertaining swashbuckler, but does it really need to be on a critic's Top 10 list this year? The film may be of good quality, but there are other, better movies out there which may need the acclaim. I'm not saying my opinion is definite, mind you, but just putting it out there for debate reasons.Johnny Depp's performance is excellent, I'll give him that, what with his flamboyant interpretation of the character giving the film a big spark, but everyone on the planet has discussed him to the point where anything I say will be moot. So as for the rest of the film, I give it a definite thumbs up. The plot is well developed, the characters are appealing and believable, and I liked the gradual progression to the film's big climactic ending. However, I felt at times like it was almost too long. The recent Lord of the Rings flew by pretty quickly for me, but for some reason this film seemed to drag at certain points, as in where Jack Sparrow and the female main character get stuck on an island together. This isn't a major complaint, however, and I guess it shows how Disney was allowing the film room to grow.All in all I think it's a very refreshing change for Disney to release a film like this. With a PG-13 rating which comes with boatloads of action and mild-violence, Pirates gives the usually squeaky clean image of Disney a nice dark side. Hopefully the sequel won't disappoint, and Disney won't force the filmmakers to dilute the action so that more kids will come to watch. I would hate to watch a dumbed down pirate movie with a PG rating, as it would just feel wrong.Cutthroat Island this ain't; a great pirate film which champions the genre back to respectability after many major flops. 3/4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Yo! Ho! Ho! A pirate's movie is not for me!' I always said every time I watched a torturous pirate film. In fact, the most pleasurable live pirate episodes I have experienced were the ones where some of my compadres seized their mate's stunning girlfriends in several happy hour watering holes. In fact, that can lead to pirate `eye-for-an-eye' warfare where it turns out too difficult for friends to patch things up. Anyway, back to pirate films. I am astonished but glad to report that `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' has broken the curse of horrendous pirate flicks. The film is based on the Disney attraction ride, and the movie does not derail from its voyage of cinematic cleverness. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a charismatic pirate who is on a quest to regain his old ship `The Black Pearl'. Johnny be very good with his oscar-worthy performance as Sparrow. With this work, Johnny has paid his Depps I mean debts to those critics who have condemned him for not selecting roles in more commercially appealing films. It is one of the best acting pieces of the year! Co-star Orlando Bloom is blooming into a star with his role as the Blacksmith on a quest to rescue the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann. Speaking of which, Keira Knightley?s breakthrough performance as Elizabeth was also commendable. Geoffrey Rush as the evil pirate continues to demonstrate his scene-stealing ability to portray scoundrel antagonists. Director Gore Verbinski provided just the right touch of Goreism for it to be a Gore candidate as the best film he has directed. `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is the pirate film for me! So guys take your hoe hoe hoe (sorry ladies) to watch this jewel and you will see that this pirate film is for you too. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard so much about Johnny Depp's performance in this film that I had to see it just because I am a fan of Johnny Depp. And he didn't disappoint either as Captain Jack Sparrow aka "The Swishbuckler". And others in the cast were fine as well including Geoffrey Rush even if my reaction was "what is he doing in this fromage". As the love interests Orlando Bloom was fine and Keira Knightley while no where near perfect was okay.But folks at the end of the day this was pure fromage. Fun but fromage nonetheless. From the moment Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) entered the scene and stepped off his sinking boat onto the dock all you could do is burst out laughing as you knew this was, well, pure fromage. And if course it didn't stop there to the Pirate with the glass eye, Geoffrey Rush playing the baddy to the hilt, all of the sword fights and while the Pirates changing into skeltons and back again was pure fromage it was well done at least especially the final battle scene with Depp and Rush. Topping the list of fromage was the Pirates den which looked like well something you would encounter at a cheesy theme park. Of course it was based on the Disneyworld Pirate theme park so what did you expect - realism. Okay this wasn't Academy Award material but Johhny Depp's performance might be and at least it was fun should save this piece of fromage from the Razzies. See it. But folks don't take this fromage too seriously. IMDB top 250 material this ain't despite its current score. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score: 8.6 (out of 10)`Pirates of the Caribbean: TCOTBP' has got to be the most fun movie to come out of a studio assembly line in quite some time. Saddled with the arduous task of stringing together a movie based on a ride at Disney World, the `Pirates' crew has come through better than anyone (including the suits at Disney) ever expected. It captures the spirit and fun of the ride, but with a storyline that stands alone and reputable stars like Johnny Depp &amp; Geoffrey Rush willing to go with all of it's cartoonish lunacy. The movie is joyously hollow, escapism without pretension. The script is cheesy, but intentionally so and smarter in it's themes than it may first appear. It has a formulaic love story, which it all but ditches for the more interesting. In this case that's the flamboyant anti-hero Jack Sparrow.Director Gore Verbinski slides smoothly into the roller-coaster popcorn action genera but, as with `The Ring', he breezes over crucial plot points as if we already know the rules to his universe resulting in a few moments end that unnecessarily tax the mind at times when I just wanted to sit back and enjoy it. Verbinski seems to be having to much fun as the movie draws out it's ending as if it can't get enough of itself. Between Depp giving a performance better than this movie probably deserves, and the delightful visual effect marvels of seeing skeleton ghosts (a novelty that wisely separates this from the commercially dead Pirate Movie), `Pirates of the Carribean' gets the job done in a slick way. A nice summertime lark and a terrific musical score to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most violent disney movie ive ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAJOR SPOILERS*** When I first saw the commercials for this, I immediately noticed that Orlando Bloom was in it (I'm not a fanatic of his, I just think hes ok) and my friend absolutely loves him and as soon as I mentioned this 2 her she said she had to see it. I wanted to see it because based on the commercials I first saw on TV made me intrested in the plotline and I put it on my list for summer movies to see. As soon as I saw it was rated PG-13 I was releived, for I knew it wouldn't be some babyish fairy tale. But as soon as I heard Disney made it, I was shocked.Overall, I thought this movie was great. The plotline was fantastic, The special effects were good (even though you can sort of tell the skeletons were made by a computer) and I had never even heard of Johnny Depp before this movie now I say he's awesome. Obviously Captain Jack Sparrow was my favorite character. I watched this with my friend a few days ago and it was her first time seeing it and she was confused throughout the whole movie (especially with the matter of the question "Who's side is Jack on?") but by the end of movie and you finally see what Jack's plan was, you'll be thinking "This guy's good!" I really like characters who have a sense of humor and shows it every time they speak. Jack Sparrow has that kind of personality. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) was very pretty and I liked the fact that she wasnt a stuck-up rich girl from the 1700s or whenever that movie was. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is an awesome swordfighter. (my friend only saw this movie because the guy she likes is named will and as soon as i said that she saw it less than an hour later.) She really liked it when Will and Elizabeth kissed at the end but she said my mother intruding ruined the magic in it (you wouldn't know unless 1. you knew my mother 2. you were there).And as usual in a Disney movie theres an overall lesson at the end. I thought this lesson ("The right course sometimes requires an act of piracy") was a rare one I've ever seen Disney teach because thanks to Lizzie Mcguire (says in a baby voice): "We must always follow the rules and do the right thing" is nearly always the message. And because its Disney's highest-rated program (which I CAN'T figure out why) its highly influential, so i thought that lesson was a nice surprise.Awesome movie. Highly recommended. If you saw this movie then figured out what company made it, you wouldn't beleive it. I didn't at first. There's no real guts or gory or anything like that but its incredibly violent. There are a lot of battle scenes and someone is killed every 20 or 30 miniutes. There's even a bit of sexual parts in there as well as some good swearwords that I would have NEVER expected someone from Disney to even know about. NOT a regular Disney movie that you would want your 5-year-old kid to see.If you're looking for adventure in this movie, there's a lot of it.Comedy fans will see a little bit of what they want, but nothing really hilarious.Pretty good if you like historical fiction.Plot twists are everywhere in this movie.It's even a little bit of a horror movie, or at least for my friend it was. She screamed her *** off when the skeletons came on the screen.Will and Elizabeth aren't Romeo and Juliet but there's a little romance in there.People looking for excitement will not be disappointed.Not my favorite movie, but a close second to "The Matrix". I give it 9/10. This is NOT your regular Disney movie.</fullReview>

He really fits the part and can really bring out the point he's trying to make of the character. Out of all the actors that I know of, none of them could have fit the part better or even near as well as he did. Orland Bloom was okay, I think that (unless they wanted him to be like he was), they could have found a better actor.The special effects were awesome, the costumes were awesome, and the make up on Johnny was the best! The accents were great, but a few of the actors (the cursed crew), could have been a bit better, a few of them didn't always have the accent. But it was kind of hard to tell.

		<fullReview>I've got to admit this is one of the most disappointing films I saw this year. It was nothing more than a two hour pantomime, featuring some credible acting talent. Has Depp been watching the BBC's "Stella Street", as he has an uncanny likeness to Keith Richard's character in the show. He's probably the best actor in the film as well. Bloom was wasted. Rush was surprisingly not evil or nasty enough. The supporting cast was decent enough including some stand out performances from the British actors. The only people I can see enjoying this sort of tosh is children and underdeveloped adults.Can they be making a sequel. Please God no save us the pain.a generous 6/10, mostly for set design/costume and special fx.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a little upset by the user comments I found here -- it's just a bunch of fans. I figure, only comment here if you have something real to say... "Ohh my god Orlando Bloom." "Oh this movie is so good because Johnny Depp is soooo hot"... That's not telling anyone anything. This movie caused such a god forsaken frenzy because of Johnny Depp -- when in reality, no, it isn't very original, Johnny Depp acts like he's queer and has a speech impediment the /whole/ time, and the only thing that made it worth seeing is that it was, at some parts, visually appealing. I would have liked this movie more had it not been so overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that this was coming out, I rolled my eyes at the title-- great... Disney trying to make yet more money on things they had well-established in Disneyland. Yeah, fine, whatever. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is a fun little ride-- not fantastic or amazing, but enjoyable. Johnny Depp is amazing in characterizing this pirate-- is he drunk? Is he crazy? Or is Jack Sparrow just pretending to be that way? He keeps up the act through the entire movie, which is a feat in its own right. So sit back and be entertained. It's not earthshattering, but a good little pirate adventure for a couch movie night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I expected, but still a great flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others here have said, Pirates of the Carribean is one of my favorite Disney rides. When I heard that they planned on turning it into a feature film I was intrigued. I hadn't seen the first Disney attraction based movie "The Country Bears," which was probably a good move on my part because I've heard it's a pretty awful film, and might have made me want to steer clear of this one. After seeing the theatrical trailer when I went to see "Holes," I knew that I had to give it a shot. I didn't get a chance to see it in the theatres, and now that I have seen it I wish I would've found some time. Before watching the DVD I was hoping for a compelling adventure in the same vein as other great pirate flicks like "The Goonies" and "Muppet Treasure Island." After watching it I...well, read on to find out what I thought.Plot: A young woman is kidnapped by a gang of pirates who just happen to be the crew of the infamous ship called the Black Pearl. A local blacksmith who was rescued by this girl years ago, asks wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to help him rescue her from being sacrificed. To make matters worse, these bloodthirsty pirates are cursed and will be difficult to defeat.The good:Top notch performances from the cast, especially the four leads. Great special effects and fight sequences. The plot is nothing new, but the script was definately written with care. A powerful musical score. Awesome costumes and set design.The bad:The film is a tad overlong and the pace drags at times as a result of it.Not one of Disney's greatest achievements, but still solid entertainment. Fans of swashbuckling flicks shouldn't be disappointed. Bring on POTC 2!My rating: **** out of ***** </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pirates Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl may be a long winded title but the movie is no such thing. It was a good revision of an old story. Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) first seems to be a terrible pirate but as the movie progresses the character proves very clever. He maneuvers himself out of several hairy situations and assists Will Turner ( Orlando Bloom ) in rescuing Miss Elizabeth Swann ( Keira Knightly ) from the evil Captain Barbossa ( Geoffrey Rush. )The storyline is nothing extraordinary. Will Turner loves Miss Swan but cannot express it because of her status. When she is captured by Barbossa he pursues them in spite of the immanent danger. It is loaded with adventure, lots of sword fighting, explosions, and savvy pirate lingo.What set the movie apart are the interesting special effects. When the cursed crew of the Black Pearl encounters moonlight they appear as skeletons. One scene which stands out is when they are walking under the sea as an army of skeletons. It was a clever approach by director Gore Verbinski.There is a great deal of humor in the movie. Barbossa has a very sinister sense of humor. Though he is supposed to be the bad guy, it's hard to hate him. Jack Sparrow seems half-baked throughout the entire movie. It makes his character more comical and thus easier to like. It's the kind of comedy befitting the movie. If it had been portrayed as a horror film it would have been a complete failure. The comical mood added to the adventure makes it an excellent watch.Another good feature of the film is that Miss Swann is a take action kind of girl. She's not the stereotypical damsel in distress. Of course, she must not be too masculine and there are times when she's screaming her head off.Will Turner is a character who attempts to remain in the good graces of society. He first refuses to accept the fact that his father was a pirate. Through the course of the film he becomes more pirate in character. Him coming to grips with his pirate blood is a major aspect of the movie. It is his blood which will lift the curse off of the Black Pearl.The end of the movie is nothing out of the ordinary. The bad guy dies, good prevails, the hero gets the babe, and the witty underdog gets away. Still, the movie maintains elements of excitement and its comedy masks the familiarity of its storyline. Though it is predictable, it's a good movie to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok to narrow down the effects, wathc the movie and take jack sparrow out of it... doesnt work at all well. the movie revolves and makes good, with one character,Captain Jack Sparrow. now the others round off a good cast... but what story is there. i love pirates, the ride, and more faith in this movie then anyone. i remember hyping this to death, and staking my life that this will be THE MOVIE of the summer and of 2003. no one would listen to reason. i said look bottom line, johnny depp and orlando bloom, what girl doesnt like them. pirates, who doesnt like em. a fun adventure it will dominate. only response i got, "i dont know its based on a ride..." well yo ho, turns out i was right again, but wrong in the sense how much personally i would like it, has the themes i would use, but it really goes nowhere throughout and is back and forth. so while the atmosphere and sparrow are to die for elements, and the best to watch. the rest of the movie suffers, from stereo-typical plot points. there's no rush involved, and you could walk out of the room, and come back later, and despite the cast moving around for awhile, you'll come back and be in the same place.... trust me it happened. oy. but nice try i give them, adapting a ride, just you could of done a billion things, and dont see how they settle. lucky us, for Captain Jack Sparrow was there to save the day, whether he wanted to or not, savvy?</fullReview>

I can only imagine how much more entertaining the movie must have been in the theater.Even though I had already heard enough positive comments about "Curse of the Black Pearl", I must say that I had not expected to enjoy it as much as I did. It had almost the perfect proportion of comedy, romance, adventure and. . . . surprise.The special effects, visual and sound were great (and I'm sorry I didn't watch it in the theater). I'm not sure if I will actually get the DVD (I only watched it for the very first time last nite), but I am quite tempted.Anyway, I also just found out that there is going to be a sequel coming out in 2005.

		<shortDescription>Hey, I tried</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in with high hopes. I admitted that Keira was hot. I even watched it a second time when it came out on DVD. But it's simple - I just hate Pirates of the Caribbean. I tried not to. But I do. Everybody else likes it - why can't I? I don't know, but I just... I don't. To be frank, this movie is boring. Strange, I know, because there are constant fight scenes, but something about them makes them less than entertaining. Take the fight scene in the blacksmith's shop. There was all kinds of peril and stuff, fighting on rafters, ducking under things, fighting on a cart, but it just seemed so cliched. It felt as though I'd seen it before, and I knew what'd happen next. The fact that it was an overly long fight scene didn't help matters much. This was the case with most fight scenes in the movie - they're not really outstanding in any one way. Nothing really surprised me. And again, so incredibly LONG. A fight scene should keep itself fairly short. Take the subway fight scene in the original Matrix - how long was that? 3 minutes? 4? And it kept away from cliches pretty well too. And then, after three or four minutes, the fight scene was over and we were on to a chase scene. That's the beauty of it - in a movie theater, people want to see lots of different locations and variety. Even if a fight scene isn't cliched, it doesn't do well if it's really, really long, and Pirates seemed to miss that. Also, I maintain that this movie is roughly 37 hours long. It was like they had 120 minutes worth of plot, but enough film for 143 minutes, so they just said 'what the heck, do an more with the zombies and an escape scene too'. There were bits all through the movie that could have been cut out to make the movie less of an ordeal to go through. I'm not knocking long movies - Pulp Fiction, Chinatown, those movies were justified in being long because they would have sucked were they not long. Polanski didn't say 'what the hell, throw in some action scenes here' and Quentin didn't give Jules a love interest because they didn't need that, just as Pirates didn't need that escape scene on the end. Maybe I just dislike this movie normally, and then hate it because everybody else likes it and I feel cool when I go against the flow. Or maybe I'm just different. I don't know, I just wish that I'd never wasted my time on this movie, that they wouldn't make a sequel, and that they'd show the marching band half time show on televised college football games rather than cutting away to a bunch of people talking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but hugely overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw POTC at the cinema and wasn't that blown away by it to be honest. So I rented it to see if maybe I liked it more second time around, seeing as how everybody seems to rate it so highly.But no, I still think it's overlong, unfunny and...just average really. It's not the worst film ever, but it certainly doesn't deserve the 'best film of the summer' taglines either. There's too much talk and not enough action IMO, and the leads are pretty to look at, but utterly bland in the acting stakes (Bloom and Knightley have all the sexual chemistry of two wet towels being thrown together). And Depp is just annoying. What's so 'brave' about a performance that basically comes down to pretending to be drunk for the entire movie. Brave? I'd call it lazy if anything. And I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, before you beat me with clubs.Cutthroat Island however, is a much better pirate movie IMO. Hell, all the best action in POTC is stolen from this very movie (the monkey, the ship-to-ship firefight, characters getting trapped in the hold before the ship blows up).Don't get me wrong, I liked POTC, but can't help but feel it's hugely overrated, especially compared to the bombastic action in Cutthroat Island. I hope POTC 2 is an improvement</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just about everyone I know who saw this flick when it was initially released, raved about how funny it was, how campy the actors were, how engaging the story was. For some reason, I didn't see it until it was released for rental. Good move on my part because I only paid $1 to see this film which was clearly worth only 50 cents. How disappointing! What a fine cast -- Depp, Pryce, Rush! What a lousy screenplay! A few laughs, yes, but more out of embarrassment for the actors and the lines they had to mutter, than the fact that the content was actually funny. I know I am clearly in the minority here as a sequel has been announced! Yipes! So perhaps I missed something. Maybe so. I'm thinking it could be that I am cursed to watch over-produced, special effects cotton candy cinema. I could lift the curse, however, and it's quite simple: Avoid movies like this.</fullReview>

It's a formula he's used since Top Gun and it's obviously very successful but I've always felt that we the audience are just treated as mindless idiots.I need more than that. I need more than special effects, more than loud music, more than a cliche plot and dialogue and this movie has all of the above.Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom...Guys, what were you thinking? They must have been thinking $$$$ which is fair enough I 'spose. When the most "successful" producer in the world asks you to appear in a film, how could you resist.It's a formula we've all come to expect: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. Boy kills a few special effects ghosts along the way. Yawn!I rate it 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

The camera pans around some much, I felt sea sick! (Hmm, maybe that was to get you into the picture or perhaps, it was just the movie? I can't really tell!) It was almost an uncongenial task to sit and watch the damn thing! Johnny Depp's character was as shallow as he is, with an array of crappy one liners, and inept, supposed, pirate dialect. He sounded like an arse pirate, with his trademark, "th" with "ff!" "I would like to go wiff you."So, to wrap this up, "Ay lad, venture into this wiffout a friend!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't even bother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched PoTC on my friend's birthday, and honestly, the money was rather wasted. Most of my friends went to watch "Orli", and unfortunately, we do not see his valor such as the role of Legolas in this movie. Rather, as my friend (who went to watch Johnny Depp, not Orlando Bloom) said, "He looks like a sick puppy who was kicked in the ribs". I also felt that Will Turner pretty much gets to do anything he wants, because he's a hero. So not. So if you are going to watch your Orli, don't bother.Johnny Depp, on the other hand, showed a wonderful performance. Wild, funny, and a bit crazed, he acts as a "gentleman-Pirate" who can't live without rum. He is probably the only one who upholds the dignity of this movie as a movie. He's a typical pirate, rather in a slight lewd way, his drunkenness, and his crazy acts.Captain Burbosa acted as a typical bad pirate, but he strongly reminded me of Captain Hook from Peter Pan.Elizabeth Schwann... different story. She acts as a typical Mary-Sue, a pretty rich girl who gets abducted and turns a warrior and marries her love. Wonderful. Congrats. The end. This typical "Hero-girl" storyline might make viewers puke. Between Will Turner and Elizabeth Schwann, a world of 'I love you, you love me' unfolds, and they dramatically "gets over the difference of class" by dumping poor Captain Norrington. Although Keira Knightley is a good actress, there is little doubt that this role is messed up.Action scenes are so muddled that I don't remember anything except skeletons dancing or some other similarity, which is ridiculous. If you love Johnny Depp, go and watch it. Otherwise, see other movies that worth spending time and money on.</fullReview>

Depp's character was by far the most interesting in the film with a lot of penash and a spark about him which entices the audience. POC would have stood alone as a good film without Depp's captain sparrow, but with it it has managed to become a fantastic film which has managed to stay in the UK charts since August... proof enough that you should go and see it, if you're one of the 4 or 5 people who hasn't yet...This really was a pirate's life for me. yo-ho-ho</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much when I walked into the theatre to see this movie. I mean - it's a movie based on a ride for goodness sakes. But they actually manage to pull off making something that is a lot of fun to watch and manages to be a spoof of other swashbuckling movies as well. Johnny Depp is particularly good in his lunatic role of Jack Sparrow. He definitely makes the movie with his nonchalant air of cool confidence while at the same time - messing up a good percentage of the time. His make-up was a little overdone - but his character itself is so odd, that I found I forgot all about his makeup about five minutes into the movie.The sword fight between Sparrow and the young blacksmith is all one could hope for in an all-out acrobatic and elaborate duel.It's not a masterpiece by any means and the movie suffers from some predictability. The second half of the movie isn't nearly as tight as the first half before Sparrow and the blacksmith steal the boat in pursuit of the Black Pearl. Overall though, it's much better than the average modern flick out there involving swords and ships - especially considering the original premise.</fullReview>

I love everything about it and it still entertains me after more than half a dozen viewings. There's incredible swashbuckling action, hilarious tongue-in-cheek humor, and delightful performances all around. The star of the show is the always reliable Johnny Depp, who turns in a career best performance as the seedy but lovable Jack Sparrow. He takes turns chewing scenery with Geoffrey Rush, who is perfectly over-the-top as Captain Barbosa. The supporting cast is great as well, but Depp and Rush leave them in the dust. If you haven't seen PotC yet, do so. It's the most fun you'll have from a single movie this year, and probably many years for that matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, that's pretty much sum it up. This is an entertaining summer movie. A thumb up for Verbinski and/or the film editor that decided to keep the running time more than 2 hours. It allowed for character development and interaction. Quite engaging at times and the cgi usage was effective and precise.Plus you have gorgeous casts and big budget. Everyone had fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent action/adventure film that has a secret weapon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been to Disneyworld or Disneyland so going into this film I had no idea what this movie based on an amusement ride was going to be about except for the fact that it was going to have pirates in it. And lots of them. After seeing this film, I still have no idea what the correlations between the ride and the movie are, but I did come to one solid conclusion: Johnny Depp is an unbelievable actor.Without Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow, this film probably would have still done very well. It's a fun, reasonably well-done swashbuckling film that has a `cute' lead actor (Orlando Bloom), a `cute' lead actress (Keira Knightly) and Geoffrey Rush, a very good actor (who has unfortunately made some, shall we say, `interesting' career choices in the last few years) as the main villain. Plus we have a lot of sword fighting, perilous moments and an undead monkey ? all elements that will bring the kids in droves to the multiplex. Myself, I had no interest in seeing it really ? mainly because I figured I would either A) embarrass myself by laughing at the pirate-speak, which never fails to set me off, or B) engage in said pirate-speak myself, thereby embarrassing both myself and whoever was unlucky enough to drag me to see the film in the first place. I could not ignore the buzz surrounding Johnny Depp's performance however, which ultimately is what got me into the theater in the first place. He is *so* incredible as Jack Sparrow that even a subtle facial expression or use of body language was enough to make me laugh out loud. I have long respected his career since he eschewed the mainstream `hunk' roles that he seemed to be genetically predisposed to doing after his stint on 21 Jump Street in favor of more avant garde fare, but this particular performance solidified my opinion that he is one of the best actors we have in the industry right now. I remember hearing that he had taken this role last year and was disappointed that he seemed to be jumping from his independent/obscure film repertoire in favor of commercialism, but his inspired performance will without a doubt get me into the theater to see the sequel(s). In terms of the direction, I had absolutely no problem with Gore Verbinski's approach. I found it to be atmospheric and evenly paced, and the special effects were impressive as well. Conclusively, a good movie ? with Johnny Depp, a great movie.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have one word: Pirates rock.I've never thought much about pirate movies, maybe because most of them are so alike. But occasionally, movies comes up that changes your mind completely, and I think that this movie is one of them. It's amazing! It's got action, humour, a brilliant cast - everything. And I actually think that the regular cliches worked! So maybe this isn't 100% original, but it's great! The twist with the curse made it so much better... Hooray for the Pirates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got to see this film, somewhat belatedly. Had heard/read a lot about it, and I wasn't disappointed - it's very funny and Johnny Depp walks away with it as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast includes a lot of very fine actors - Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Mackenzie Crook as well as Orlando Bloom (Legolas-on-a-boat) and the easy-on-the-eye Keira Knightley. It's all done with great gusto and gives the impression the whole cast were having a ball. Definitely worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent family movie, nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't watch Hollywood blockbusters much, and I just have to say films like this are the reason why. I'd probably rate this as an above decent family, with some decent special effects, which is understandable considering the budget they had. It didn't really titilate me, despite an originally gripping storyline. An hour into it, and the film quickly turns into comedy, with ghost pirates dying in comedy moments and pretty much no seriousness whatsoever. I understand these kind of films aren't coming across as serious, but then I argue what's the point? Originally it reminded me of one of my favourite movies from childhood, The Princess Bride, but in the end it didn't live up to the promise. Cut the gore out and you have a decent family movie, but don't bother if you're looking for anything more. Alternatively you could watch The Goonies which is one of the best pirate movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the script is barely above average, acting OK and the special effects are very well made. The person who did the casting though has to get some extra credit. Bloom and Depp complements each other perfectly, giving this movie the little extra that actually makes it something to watch out for. Sometimes quite funny, but I suspect that they will not pass the test of time, and a second watching of the movie might not be quite as enjoyable. The action scenes are of good quality, about what you'd expect from a modern movie after watching the remake of Zorro starring Bandeiras/Hopkins. Don't go to this movie and expect to see something new though, the parts have all been done before, and most of the time better than what you'd get here. The combination is new though, and as the genre of swashbuckling isn't very common in modern movies you will find some fresh elements still in this movie so I'd say that if you enjoyed the aforementioned Zorro (which I rated 9/10), you'll find this a pleasant experience. My vote on Pirates of the Caribbean: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...judging by high ratings on Imdb. But still watchable enough that 2,5 hours goes by pretty fast. On the other hand, this movie will soon be forgotten, why? Well, for the story itself, i believe. It provides already seen stuff: a love story (a terrible part of the movie, since you can't feel any chemistry between Will (lousy play by Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (a mediocre play by Keira Knightley), pirate duels (some of them way too long) and a simple story (meant for kids and not so intelligent adults), without any twists. On the other hand, there's Johnny Depp, which is the main star, what he proves by great acting. With a slightly more capable director and screenwriters which could change the script and made it in a love story with Jack &amp; Elizabeth (heh, like in Beauty &amp; Beast), this movie will certainly gain some points with more demanding viewers and become a classic romance movie. Too bad, since the sound part is also great.Since it's not a classic, but somewhat between, only (but still good)7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swashbuckling fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will likely not earn critical acclaim. It isn't the type of movie that earns Oscars, or Academy Awards for best acting, though it has some very good acting. There is not a deep plotline where everybody suffers that attempts to cater to artsy critics that have no idea what a movie is actually for. It is not even very historically accurate in details.Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is just plain fun. It is a roller-coaster ride, with attractive guides and a wicked sense of humour. It is an adventure and something of a mystery that is a coming-of-age story as well.Many people have already commented on the terrific job done by Johnny Depp, so I won't go into that performance other than to state that from his entrance to his exit he is fun to watch, and as effective as Tim Curry has been in similarly flamboyant roles.Orlando Bloom does an good job in presenting a character that takes as much from Captain Blood as it does from The Princess Bride. His character is the young sidekick that is driven and drives the story.If you are looking for the next Amistad, Amadeus, Schindlers List, or story with a deep underlying meaning, look elsewhere. If you want to recall the feelings you had when you were young and going to a movie was something you looked forward too, see this movie. This movie was written to entertain, and in that, it meets it's goal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save this for a rainy day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read reviews of films in various newspapers and magazines, you will eventually notice trends in writing styles and points that are made in the discourses of the reviewers. In short, when they find something they think sounds important, they all focus on the same topic, and in a manner which seems meant to show off their petty vernacular skills, they make sophemoric quips and plays on the title of said flick, and/or gobble up several pages of the calendar section with mindless tripe that doesn't really get the reader anywhere. Not that a film critic really serves much purpose in the world, and thus shouldn't be taken too seriously, however, it is the fact that they are given so much attention for their interchangeably identical opinions that they should be avoided at all costs. Their recurringly similar reviews quite literally ruin movies, for they build an impression of a film before an individual has even seen it. In some cases this can be a good thing, i.e. advice to avoid a surefire disaster, or something like that. Yet when said impression is not met by the actual viewing of the film, disappointment inevitably ensues. This really only concerns films that would have been a nice little surprise, where one walks out of the theater and says, "That was just a fun movie." People who read film reviews don't get that pleasure anymore, and so, when a reviewer says, "i wasn't expecting anything, and this turned out to be enjoyable, the audience then goes into the film expecting something that they otherwise would not have, and then, don't enjoy the film as much. This was the case with Pirates, where there was such a deluge of reviews claiming that this was a terrific, fun summer movie, with a bravura performance by Johnny Depp, that by the time one actually saw the movie, it seemed dull and pointless. Been there, done that sort of feeling. I say, damn the reviewers for taking what was a nice little movie, and blowing it into something that it wasn't, so that it seemed like an umpteenth viewing of Star Tours up on the screen. You new everything that was going to happen, every quirk and eccentricity, and so, it wasn't new, fresh, or really anything. In short, I advise people to ignore reviews, and see a film for themselves first, to determine what they want to think about a movie. This would probably have been a nice little diversion, so I would recommend it, if only on the grounds that one carries no expectations into it, so that they are not disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved the pirates' genre but I must admit a strong dislike if it comes to Disney. However, Johnny Depp starring in a Disney movie? I was somewhat intrigued... Had Depp finally succumbed to Disney or could it have been the other way round? I gave the movie a try and was (massive understatement ahead) truly rewarded. This movie is sheer fun to watch! The cast acts joyfully but most of them pale into insignificance compared to an absolutely stunning Johnny Depp who's got all the good lines and acts OTT yet wonderfully. Sure, there's been a lot of nagging about historical incorrectness and inconsistencies (Port Royal's destruction was mentioned before). For instance, the "Dauntless" probable role-model "Victory" was launched no sooner than 1765 and had never seen the Caribbean... But that's real nit-picking. If you permit yourself to see this little, colourful gem as a fantasy-film with an amazing soundtrack rather than a historical pirate-movie (which could never had been its aim), you'll have a good time and lots of memorable quotes to get on your friends' nerves with... Savvy?I give it a meagre 9/10 due to the aforementioned minor flaws and an overdose of slapstick comedy (the two couples of stupid English soldiers and pirates). Surely this won't stop me from watching it a fourth and fifth time until the broad grin on my face will have to be surgically removed. 20/10 for Johnny Depp, and I'm NOT exaggerating!</fullReview>

When I say ordinary Bruckheimer production I mean a action movie with great specialeffects and no story (The Rock is an exeption). Pirates is a typical Bruckheimer production with allot of action and specialeffects but the story is not so good. But Pirates is a perfect adventure/action movie alá Indian Jones (but not so good though) and a perfect movie for a movie night with your friends. But they should have skipped the two stupid Pirates.

The fighting scenes (which 99% of the time never interest me in any film) seemed particularly pointless here given that the enemy couldn't be killed.As said several times the two pairs -the 2 pirates &amp; 2 guards (English too- there was a surprise) were pathetic characters. That was the biggest problem with the film it tried to be funny &amp; failed and couldn't seem to make out whether it wanted to target itself at kids, adults or everyone. Consequently, with such a laid back plot, it became difficult to keep concentration with the plot, who was cursed, why, how etc etc.Still, it was an ok story, had some good scenes, kept me reasonably interested and was acted well.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with a negative attitude. I always have my doubts about big budget action films, despite the great cast. I had also seen Verbinski's The Ring, and I was not very impressed. However, I was impressed with this film. It was full of laughs, which gave the appearance that it wasn't trying to take on the plot completely seriously. The action scenes were good, and most characters had fairly witty lines and were well acted. The only problem I have with this film was the way the characters held together. We were shown to constant double-crossing, and people that rescued each other, then betrayed them. For example, Jack Sparrow (played by Depp) seemed to have only thing in mind. But then, in the next scene, he was saving someone else (by the way, I'm being especially brief as I don't want to give away any spoilers to the people who have not yet seen this movie). Apart from this small problem, this movie was very good, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good action-packed laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absurd story, but a fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to some reports, Pirates of the Caribbean is not a movie about a band of pirates seeking to raise an Aztec curse by some mumbo-jumbo ritual, or the heroic rescue of a beautiful maiden who has fallen into the cursed pirates' hands. Oh yes, the cursed pirates, the Aztec ritual, the rescue and all that rubbish are IN the movie. But, fortunately, they're not what the movie is about. Pirates of the Caribbean is really about white canvas sails and creaking cedar hulls, gleaming cutlasses and flintlock pistols, sailors' tattoos and golden earrings, sun-spattered islets and towering Caribbean cliffs, moonlit seas and driving storms. It is not about any particular pirates, but about the aura of pirates, their atmosphere. And if you love the pirate aura, as I do, you'll forgive the picture the preposterousness that it wears on its sleeve.The best thing about Pirates of the Caribbean is that the actors and the crew show real love and affection for the screwy B-movie they are making. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Geoffrey Rush all look like they're having fun, and director Gore Verbinski's shots look like he loves watching the scenes he's making, lingering on the pirates and the ships and the islands instead of hustling them on and off. This movie is much better than such dreck as Die Another Day, not because it's any smarter, but because it lacks the air of cynicism, of contempt for itself and its audience that mars productions like Tamahori's. Die Another Day was made by people who didn't care a flying fig for espionage or intrigue; Pirates of the Caribbean was made by people who loved piracy, adventure and the sea. The scene where Captain Sparrow finally swings aboard, caresses the ship's wheel like a long-lost lover, and murmurs, "Bring me that horizon," is inconceivable in a typical heartless summer blockbuster; most action filmmakers wouldn't be caught dead expressing such embarrassingly sincere emotion.This is not to say that Pirates of the Caribbean deserves comparison with the handful of real classics that have also been summer blockbusters, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars. Those movies had stories; Pirates of the Caribbean has a muddle that passes for a story. Just because Verbinski's movie is better than the average summer fare we get nowadays does not mean that it's great art, or even good art. But unlike most movies about which people say, "Don't think about it, just have fun," Pirates of the Caribbean actually IS fun.Rating: **? out of ****.Recommendation: Lovers of pirates and the sea must catch this one in the theater, but others can wait for video.</fullReview>

This guy is marvellous, and in this rollercoaster-ride of a movie he delivers his best acting since Edward Scissorhands. The rest of the cast also does a graceful, wonderful job, and Keira Knightly's strikingly beautiful close-ups should be reason enough to watch this cinematic gem. Featuring a lot of memorable moments, witty quotes, hilarious laugh-out-loud scenes, exciting action sequences, cool sfx and beautiful visuals, this movie is all about FUN. There's never a dull moment, and you'll be wishing for more when the end credits roll. All movies should be like this very well-made adventure. Among a slew of mindless (Charlie's Angels 2), disappointing (T3) or just plain bad summer blockbusters, Pirates really shines. Can't wait for the DVD. ****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit to enjoying this film in spite of my self. What makes it even more fun, though, is the many innacuracies and errors, the most important of which I list here for your irritation/amusement.1. The date. Much of the action in this film takes place in Port Royal, a city that was utterly destroyed by an earthquake and abandoned in 1692. However, the fire-buckets on board of HMS Dauntless are inscribed with the royal monogram of GR, which indicates that the film must take place before 1692 and after 1714, when George I came to the throne.2. The punchline of one of the jokes is "You've clearly never been to Singapore," which is entirely understandable as Singapore was not founded until 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles, after whom business class on singapore airlines is named.3. The Rank of Commodore. Captain Norrington is 'promoted' to Commodore, even though this rank does not exist at this time, except as a stopgap, temporary appointment when a captain is given temporary command of a squadron.4. Flags. Letting the Commodore inaccuracy slip, they failed to properly denote Norrington's rank as none of the ships which he commanded ever flew the broad pennant that indicates that a Commodore is aboard. Also, if the film is set before 1692, then the British engisn is incorrect, as the combined scottish and english flag was not introduced until 1707, although to be fair they do get good marks for displaying correct commissioning pennants5. The ships. Though I have no complaint against the pirate ship as a harmless fantasy, the ships of the Royal Navy, in particular HMS Dauntless, are from at least 50 years after the film's period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie about two weeks ago in Germany and I must say this movie is great! If I think of the acting of Johnny Depp I am really stunned, he is sooo great, although his way of speaking in this movie is better in english is his output marvelous. I think I don't have to say anything about the story because it was a simple hollywood-like story, with its ups and downs and with its happy end, but the film was here and there really funny and the special effects are really good too! Orlando Bloom was really good too and I think you will see more movies with him in the future. The only question that stays for me is that I really don't know why it is important that Mr Bloom has to give his blood, there is not really an explanation, but who cares - the movie was so good that you can forget about this faux pas. Go and see it at your cinema because the effects are not so good on a standard tv set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Carribean is one of those summer films where you can have a fun time. It is nowhere near a masterpiece, but it doesn't have to be. Johnny Depp stole the show as Jack Sparrow, and Rush was excellent as the villian. The visuals are very good, which adds to the experience. Keira Knightley is a pretty face, but she has yet to show her real acting abilities, she sure didn't show it in this movie. Orlando Bloom was pretty dull as well, he didn't really have anything to do other than follow Depp around. Overall, a fun film. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Spoilers***I didn't expect much of this movie, and neither, I assume, did a lot of people given its origins. I was dragged to the movie with a group of friends, and I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, and definitely not the most memorable, it was amusing and enjoyable in most places. My biggest concern, though, was the plot holes - if the pirates, once cursed, couldn't die, then how come Orlando Bloom's father was killed by the other pirates? Also, how did he come to be on the ship at the beginning of the film? I didn't think that the plot was thought through, and while the film was fast paced enough for an audience member not to have to worry too much about these errors, I would have rathered a greater amount of continuity in the story. My other concern with the film was the portrayal of the characters of Elizabeth's father and Annamaria. I felt that Elizabeth's father in places was trying to be a comic character, such as during the climax of the film, whereas other times you were expected to take him seriously. Jonathan Pryce is a great actor, and I thought it was a shame that he was stuck in a part with no personality that served either to spell out the feelings of other characters or to give the audience comedic relief. I also would have liked further development of Annamaria, the token black woman on the otherwise politically incorrect, white-male-dominated Interpreter ship. Her only lines seem to be either to make assumptions which are wrong, or to yell at the central characters. There was no real feeling in her character. If the producers had really wanted to be politically correct, they would have served better to either discard the character altogether or make her a more rounded character, rather than inserting her as a prop merely to keep the minority groups happy. Criticisms aside, I though Johnny Depp gave a fine performance, which was quite surprising considering the last movie I saw him in was "From Hell". "Pirates" is an ok movie, not the best release this year, but it will serve as good rental material. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

This is the first time we have felt so strongly about a movie to see it this many times or write a comment about it.

If this movie was 1 hour and 30 minutes, or possibly 1 hour and 45 minutes, it would have been ok, but the story was drawn out way to far, and it was very slow.

		<shortDescription>One of the best pirate movies made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I already loved this movie before I saw it. I didn´t know it was made because of something in a Disneyland, I just saw it for the movie´s sake. I love pirate movies, also like Cutthroat Island and all those great movies. So I wouldn´t want to miss this one.I think Orlando Bloom is a bit sad in his role, he´s not very interesting or anything, he´s just being himself, almost like when he played Legolas. As for Keira Knightley, she played very good, but we knew how it was going to end when the movie began and she found Will Turner. Geoffrey Rush is great as the "evil" pirate, Barbossa, in the movie, but they never seem to fail that role. And for the best character in the movie, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, he´s got his best role ever. He´s just perfect as the pirate who´s always a bit drunk but still knows just what he´s doing. Fun sayings from him, and his character makes the movie great. He is the reason this movie is so great, and I´m not just saying this because I like Johnny Depp. Other great things in the movie is Barbossa and his men, when they turn into the dead pirates in the moonlight... they look really... real, but somehow they still manage to bring in a bit of humour, so I won´t call it horror.So I recommend that you see this movie if you like a REAL pirate tale, and you´re not afraid to cross blades with a pirate like Jack Sparrow...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE Johnny Depp fan, but now I am even a greater one. He totally rocked in this flick! What an awesome performance by all involved. The two "goofball" pirates were hilarious and perfectly fitting! I have seen this movie "12" times! I plan on seeing it a few more times before the DVD comes out! I have seen almost every "Depp Flick", but this by far surpasses them all! The movie would sell itself by the score alone! Man, what an awesome soundtrack! This truly was a family movie without gore and bad language. It was not a horror flick, or designed to be scary, just entertaining, which it was! I have always been intrigued by Pirates, and fascinated by stories of the sea and such. Gore Verbinski and Disney... "WOW"! Besides the characters, the special effect artists need recognition as well. Man, what awesome computer work! Too cool! It was absolutely incredible! The fight scenes where they transformed back and forth so quickly was Great! I have a neat idea for a sequel, maybe I'll call Disney! lol! Thanks from our family to all involved in the Best Picture, of all times!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...pure entertainment.It has to be said: The plot is thin, so thin. Sailing to an island, returning from there, sailing back... The last line which completed the romantic part was just hilarious and felt like some pulp pirate story a la "The Maid and the Pirate". I saw it coming from miles, and I kept repeating "DON'T SAY IT! PLEASE DON'T SAY IT!"She said it.The action wasn't over the top at all (comparing T3, for example), and there was clearly more space for better effects. There isn't a single scary moment, even the introduction of the curse (when the pirates showed their true faces) looked more like a musical to me. Nobody in the audience ever jumped. 50 zombies, and not one single scary moment. Hmm.What a great movie!Honestly, forget all the contra points. Johnny Depp carries the movie from one laugh to the next, his acting is just one big feel-good-smile. Every time he disappears from screen, I just wanted him to return. Without him, it's a below-standard one. With him... Oh my god.(And I'm not even female! :) I loved him in Sleepy Hollow, but this one tops it easily (the acting, not the movie - SH is way better in plot/thrilling/etc.)It's not pulp fiction, and surely not fight club, but I can promise you 120 (okay 100, taking away 20 minutes without Depp) minutes of pure entertaining. Just expect a comedy, and it delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendously entertaining pirate movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit it - I had some prejudices about Pirates of the Caribbean - the Curse of the Black Pearl. I was in a belief that it would be either a pretty scary children's movie or a boring sword-clanging movie with Orlando Bloom as a stupid pirate.But, as usually, I was proven wrong.The movie was hilarious, exciting, unique, adventurous and romantic all the same. While there were serious and exciting sword fights and attempts to take over Captain Barbossa's crew, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) always appeared as a comic relief and easened the atmosphere a bit.One of the best things about PotC was absolutely it's smooth and clever dialogue. I had probably one of the best laughs ever in movie history while watching this pearl of movie industry. PotC was funny, but not too funny so that it would have ruined the movie's adventurousness or scariness (yes, it was scary, occasionally. Or what do you say about a skeleton-monkey?).Jack Sparrow is definitely the coolest pirate there is. And he wouldn't have been much if it wasn't for Mr. Depp here. Johnny did an amazing job playing Jack Sparrow and I must say, as a big Johnny-fan, that this was his best role so far.Luckily the name refers to the fact that we might get a sequel - the movie didn't make it too bad on the box offices...Overall this was a very entertaining movie in every way. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...at most, a fun movie. Without the presence of Depp, this would have been just another summer movie. Which in itself, is a testament to the prerogative of "the actor". Unfortunately, the director was unable to develop what JD had given him. What lay behind the facade of Sparrow? What drove him? Where did he come from? Did he like girls? And so on... As for the bad guy - too benign to be fearsome. You can't be subtle as a pirate in a pirate movie and Geoffrey Rush was perhaps a little too unwilling to assume the absurd. Our dashing hero was nice - not much else to expect from such a role. And the closest our heroine ever got to lustiness was a brief moment of pretense on the island with Sparrow. The commodore was a nice touch - beautifully understated by Jack Davenport. It was not too often that the British admiralty was painted in a good light when up against movie pirates. The movie also looked like it was shot on a back lot at Disney. The computer generated opening scene of the approaching ship was particularly unrealistic. But that said, I will probably see it again on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Possible Spoilers I went to see this film towards the end of the Summer, and by myself. The boys sitting behind me kept flicking popcorn into my hair because they recognised me and they didn't like me, the seats were too squashed, the lady in front of me seriously needed lessons to be classy, and the popcorn was totally duff despite the fact that I paid 5 dollars for it. So you wouldn't expect me to like `Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl.' I wasn't expecting to like it. I only went to see it because Johnny Depp is one of my favourite actors, Kiera Knightely is one of my favourite actresses, and the people on IMDb said it was good. But I did enjoy this movie. The two hours I spent in that cinema was one of the best two hours ever spent in my life. Now.about the movie. Don't expect an Oscar winning performance from Orlando Bloom, because you are so not going to get one. He is, to be perfectly honest, quiet average. But Johnny Depp is hilarious, Geoffrey Rush proves to be a great actor once again, and Kiera gives a fine performance to rival hers in `Bend it Like Beckham.' The story is that will Turner and Jack Sparrow have teamed up to save Elizabeth Swann, who has been captured and is aboard ship on the Black Pearl. When I first read the synopsis, I said, `I'd rather watch `Signs.' Oh, how much I take that back. The story may sound totally goofy, but trust me, it gels fantastically.I am so going to get this movie when it comes out on DVD. Along with an eyepatch so I can be a pirate (joke.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn fine swashbuckling film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For about 30 years now I've been a fan of Pirate films, from Captain Blood and The Black Swan to even the Muppets Treasure Island I've pretty much enjoyed most pirate films I've seen, even Polanski's Pirates was worth watching to me. POTC is so far and away one of the best Pirate films I've seen, it has all the elements of the classic Swashbucklers made in the 1930's that so many folks have had a hard time emulating. Depp and Bloom reminded me of 21st century versions of Errol Flynn and Tyrone Power. They had charm, humor and a sense of fun and pure enjoyment for what they were making. Not so serious that it felt heavy like Cutthroat island, which was decent but still lacking in the pure escapist fun that the original films had. I think that is why this film is so good, Mr. Verbanski was able to give us a true sense of the world of Hollywood Pirates. I mean who'd want to see real Pirates? They were dirty, nasty, brutal murderers and had very little sense of adventure that you see in these films. Remember folks, this isn't history..it is fantasy! Hurrah for Disney, they've produced a film that sounded ridculous at first but became a true reminder of the Swashbuckling adventure films of old!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Whole Hell Of A Lot Better Then I Was Expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*So, I don't really like pirate stories, and the idea of a movie based on a ride doesn't blow my skirt up either, and i'm not one of those guys who just sees movies because they're movies, i love movies, but, i don't have time to see everything out there. So, why is the hell did i go see this one? My friends Justin said that he felt that it was going to be the best movie of the summer, and i figured what the hell, i'll just go see it, if i'm gonna be an actor, i prolly won't act in movies i like all the time, so, it'll be a good excercise.There were flaws in it. The scene where Depp gets swung around the wooden poll, it is very obvious that it is a stunt double. Also, pirates that can't get killed fight on and on with their swords. But, all of that crap is ok, because, this is not the type of movie that is suppose have everything be flawless and to always makes sense. This is suppose to provide a good time, and that it does do. It would have been nice if some of the problems weren't there, but, they are a non issue just because of the sheer energy of the film. Depp's charecter and Depp himself also do this movie alot of justice. Depp's charecter, Jack, is a perfect example of a charecter that that does not need to have an arch, but can still be interesting threw it's dinamic. Jack doesn't change in the movie, your perception of him does, but, he doesn't, he's the same robber baron that he was at the begining. His performance of the role is also something to behold because he plays it with incredible comic timing and with sparking originality, which saves the part, because, as i said, it has no arch, Depp adds the dinamic.All in all, a good flick, i suck at deciding what number to give films, but, i think this is a pretty solid 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie, (because I missed the 20 first minutes the first time)I saw it twice... and I did not get bored. All good ingredients are there to make a very good entertainment: a lot of actions, jokes, loves, suspense ("not so much": may say some... but it is not a thriller!), good story and also very good actors. Johnny D. is excellent as usual (I am a fan), and also Geoffrey R. Costumes, pictures are also good. The love story of this movie does not take the whole parts, but only give a lovely touch to this action movie. I did not give 10 out of 10 for that movie because the 10 minutes end are a bit too much "American cliché", with the exception of Johnny D. who is definitely a great actor. One of the best Pirates movie I have ever seen (Technology and special effects help a lot, but what will be the life if we refuse all new technologies?!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming but fell short of great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is reminiscent of virtually every Hollywood blockbuster I've ever seen. It did its job: charmed the charmable, roused those appreciative of trite, forced humor, wooed those susceptible to petty, undramatic romance, and overall, won people over by general appeal and advertisement rather than by substance. Granted, a lot of people like that sort of thing. And frankly I should have expected it. But I went in expecting something a bit more riveting, involved, and overall, something that perhaps would take itself seriously.I was looking for more of a period action film with its own aspects of fantasy that remain consistent and serious (Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to mind, though that's not technically a period action film, it falls into the category right up there with Braveheart, Last of the Mohicans, Gladiator, etc. and still has its fair share of humor). I was interested to see how this would be done. The trite humor and cleches in the beginning, I thought to be something that would pass. Then I realized that they were to remain and then I of course saw the wonderfully comic CG skeleton pirates! And said to myself, "oh, it's one of these."So I'd just like to let everyone else know, this is a Hollywood blockbuster and nothing more. Don't expect it to stick with you for long or to make you think about anything. Also, the plot twists just got annoying after a while. However, some good points: Geoffrey Rush and especially Johnny Depp in some roles that they obviously enjoy, and can overact wonderfully with reckless abandon! Great job by the two of them, very entertaining. Especially when Barbosa grunts, simply, "ARRRR!" The action is superb, with some brilliantly choreographed sword fights and wonderful effects throughout. Plenty of eye candy and humor for the whole family.I'd hardly call it great cinema, but it was certainly fun. Go into the theater in the mood for a fun movie and you'll probably enjoy it much more than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rating: *** out of ****. When I saw the Pirates trailer, I thought it would end up being a decent movie. It was a solid fun for the summer where I have been underwhelmed and disappointed by some movies. Pirates is nothing revolutionary its just fun.The acting is mostly good. Johnny Depp delivers one of his best performances as Jack Sparrow, he is funny and just entertaining to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also very good as the bad guy. Orlando Bloom is fine. Newcomer Keira Knightley, while very beautiful, is just plain bad here.Director Gore Verbinski does a decent job directing here. This is not his best film nor his best directing. I think he was much more successful with The Ring. Pirates is visually well made. Great Costumes, Good Visual effects, and nice sets. It may not be a great action movie, but its solid fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels like it was intended to be an animated film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I must admit, I went in to see this film with rather high expectations, but I was aware of the danger of it being overhyped and tried to watch it as openminded as possible.That being said, I still cannot deny that it has left me dissappointed. When I heard it was supposed to revive the pirate genre, show some awesome specialFX and would feature J.D. as a pirate, I half expected a dark and erie story that would keep me at the edge of my seat and make me mumble "woooow" every now and then into the bucket of popcorn I am holding on to.Well... none of it came through. Don't get me wrong, I did find it entertaining, but all throughout the movie, I kept thinking that I watching a film that was meant to be animated and reminded me strongly of former disney antics, just that (thank god) they didnt break into sing every now and then...The story is barely more than ok, slimly suits the audience of 12+, the characters are flat and stereotype, the Fx are awesome but sometimes not put to use too well I feel - the zombie pirates didnt really scare anyone at all - and the humor was often flat and failed to hit its mark more than once...It is a sunday evening film for entertainment, even of the family sort, but certainly not what I would spend the saturday night start-off money on... I'll give it a 6 out of 10, barely missing a 7, and it is 100% absolutely NOT the best film that came out this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I tried to explain the reasons why I liked/disliked the movie without letting out any spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Pirates this afternoon and to be truly sincere, I liked very much and I don't think that I would change 1 single bit from the film.I liked the fact that the action started immediately. MAYBE there were some parts (small ones but) that were slightly far-fetched but the result was good with them. The film length was just right not too short, neither long - 1 point in favour. Another thing I liked about the film was that some parts were predictable and others weren't. Also, I think that every action had a purpose and wasn't done just to fill in time. The actors were very good. Johnny Depp was hilarious. So were certain lines. Another good thing about the film was that humour was spread here and there not all in one go. One point against the film was that I wasn't exactly sure why the blood was needed to lift the curse. Either it wasn't specified or else I was too busy admiring Orlando Bloom and missed that part. (For those who haven't seen the film - sorry if I seem vague or senseless but I don't want to give any information on the storyline.) You will find fight scenes galore which I really enjoyed and there's this particular scene when the pirates step in and out of the moonlight which I really loved. Film summary: mixture of pirates, romance, action, magic and luck. By the way, Jonathan Bryce has a very very funny scene and we simply couldn't stop laughing my mum and I. My advice is that this film is definitely worth a try. In fact if I have the chance I would certainly go see it another time. Congrats to all the cast &amp; crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the movie reviewers must have had bad days when they saw this movie, because their opinions are cranky and don't make sense! Pirates of the Caribbean is a blast to see, if only for the old-fashioned swordfights, romance, witty comedy and hilarious acting by Johnny Depp. Depp totally steals the show with his clueless swagger and drunken one-liners. Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom also perform relatively well, although I think Knightley's show in Bend it Like Beckham was better. Orlando plays a classic shy-but-determined romantic, which works well for him, especially since (fortunately for all the Orlando-lovers) he has more lines in this than in both of the Lord of the Rings movies combined. The movie as a whole is a good way to spend some time, and a ticket worth paying for (which can be hard to find sometimes). I absolutely recommend people see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True to the ride I guess. I think we all wondered what the plot of Disneyland's ride was, considering there never was anything it was based on (yet it was one of the COOLEST)Plot: First you wait in line. Then sail through lovely seas of the Caribbean. Then there's a skull saying something mean to you, your boat falls down and splashes. Things get dark. Then Pirates happen.Like Disney's family ride, you get great scenery, you get some thrills, spills, and some good honest humor, particulary with Johnny Depp's crafty swaggering character. Bloom and Knightley fit in nicely when it comes to the tale of a damsel in distress and her true love saving her. Rush commands his army of pirates well with a matured manner, yet he can still be quite evil. What really deserves some credit is the Special Effects and the Pirates themselves. We get a good gathering of savages and thieves, giving the ride lovers what they wanted. Good swordplay and great ship battles, what more could you want? A less sappy ending I guess. I mean C'mon!Bottom line: It has Hollywood branded all over it's filthy tooth smile but it delivers what one would want out of a Disney Pirate movie, much like the ride (before they took out the pirates chasing women).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just returned from my first viewing of POTC - Sooooooo hilarious, all my nerves are still aching from laughing.A very clever mix from the best bits and pieces of "Captain Blood", "The Sea Hawk", "The Black Swan" and "The Crimson Pirate" (the carrying of the small boats under water for cover, and disguising extremely ugly pirates as women to distract the attention of the soldiers from the main action), and bits from the Disney ride, like the prisoners trying to convince the dog who has the keys to their cell with a bone to hand them over. Also Captain Barbossa as a skeleton drinking wine resembles a figure at the ride, who is rumored to be a reverence to Errol Flynn, who apparently gave Walt Disney the idea to the ride in the first place. And there is also a nod to "Troy"...Kira Knightley is as least as graceful and witty as Olivia DeHavilland was in her pirate days, opposite Errol Flynn.Sword training with the elves has certainly left a mark on Orlando Bloom, and his moves resemble Errol Flynn, not much of a surprise as he has got his major training from Bob Anderson, who had brushed up Errol's movements for one of his last pirate movies "The Master of Ballantrae". Not to forget that he has become a really good actor, and a very handsome one too. But I still kept looking for the pointy ears ...Johnny Depp is over the top, not as something between Keith Richard and a French cartoon character, but as a mix between Ozzy Osbourne and Robin Hood, with a hint of Burt Lancaster's artistic skills and humor as Vallo in "The Crimson Pirate" thrown in for good measure ...One of the best movies I have seen for a long time, and certainly one of the best pirate movies I know - and I know pretty much all of them!I'll see it again tomorrow.

		<shortDescription>Terrific, tongue-in-cheek, almost a filmed "Secret of Monkey Island".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a tough choice - see an already proven but maybe repetitive "Tomb Raider" movie, or the "Pirates". I decided to try something new, for a change, somewhat prepared for lots of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley yawn romance, just spruced up with a piracy theme.I couldn't be more wrong.The moment I saw Jack Sparrow - excuse me: Captain Jack Sparrow - played by Johnny Depp with surprisingly well placed black eyeliner, I knew that this time a secondary character would steal - excuse me: commandeer - the screen. And a heck of a job he did at that!Of course there's much more. Based on a Disney theme, this movie features most extraordinary swordfighting action which is... precisely timed with the music! Remember the old days when Disney movies had almost every move of every character accentuated by musical instruments? This film takes this technique a step further: it's not only separate instruments, but a wonderful full-blown orchestrated sound track keeping in sync with the clashing swords, jumps, kicks, dodges and parades. Think "Dance Dance Revolution" in swordfighting terms, if you wish.And, there's more. Crazy dialogue lines, again mostly by Captain Jack Sparrow. Good special effects, featuring a merry skeleton crew (pardon the pun, but I'm surprised they didn't place THIS one in the movie! Or did I miss it?). Hilarious and ridiculous plot twists and quirks, ranging from loading cannons with silverware (fork missiles, anyone?) to sailing on the top of the mast (when the rest of the ship has already sunken).That it's not very complicated? It doesn't have to, it's a family swashbuckling movie. That it has a happy ending so sappy that it oozes? So what, movies created for simple entertainment have to have happy endings. That it's full of cliches? That's the stinkin' point, ye landlubbers! Avast!But speaking of Monkey Island in the summary above, for the non-gamers of you, there is a series of games under that title, about the adventures of a would-be pirate with a ridiculous name of Guybrush Threepwood, which alone provided tons of fun as no-one could pronounce it properly. The games are packed to the brim with piracy humour... and if I ever see any of them filmed, I definitely want it done the Black Pearl style.It's been a long time since the last good pirate movie - which, in my opinion, was Polanski's Pirates - but it'll take even longer than that to top the "Pirates of the Caribbean". Definitely a new standard has been set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really was a very enjoyable film. The special effects were brilliant, the acting was good and it was well cast.The one thing that made this film though was Johhny Depp's excellent performance as Jack Sparrow. He didn't act the character, he WAS the character! Although Orlando Bloom gave a good performance too, the film wouldn't have been half as good without Depp.The only negative thing I can say is the ending was a little weak, but with the rest of the film being as good as it is, it's easy to overlook that!I took my 12yr old to see it and he loved it. I'd recommend this film to anyone looking for good swashbuckling entertainment and a good laugh (and to all Johnny Depp fans!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone is to receive praise for this movie, the competition is tough, but our leading man is defiantly our number 1#! When you think about the memorable characters that you associate with Johnny Depp, for example Edward Scissorhands, Edward D. Wood, Jr. and Inspector Fred Abberline to name just a few, you see him create a character to which you will always make a connection.Captain Jack Sparrow is a character to whom i would have never linked to Johnny Depp, but following his performance in The Pirates of the Caribbean: The curse of the Black Pearl, i can see no person to parade this character in his full potential better than Johnny. A very good actor to bring a very good character to life.Not forgetting other actors and actresses in this film who also made it one to remember. Geoffrey Rush, Captain Barbossa makes you believe this truly is the maddest man to move a mast! Demonstrating a character who has determination and the will to put up a good fight to get what he wants, be warned, never mess with him.Once again, we see Orlando Bloom make the girls smile as he puts up his sword and proves he is worthy to grace an action movie set with whatever weapon you got! A fine performance!Finally, we have Keira Knightly, who proves, just because she is young, she can still take on Hollywood. Few films can make you cry with laughter but at the same time make you fear what is coming. That, i believe, is one of the reasons to which i must applaud this film.My film of Summer 2003!</fullReview>

And also this wonderful and beautiful Keira Knigthley, who plays like an "old hand" but is only 18! years old. (ok, only is the wrong word, because she is older than me)And Orlando Bloom also does a good work, but all other actors are put into a shadow by Mr.Depp. I also think that it is a good story, because of all the turnings the movies is exciting.I really hope that there will be some movies in the next time which are nearly as great as this is, savvy?

		<fullReview>If ever there was a summer that needed a film like Pirates of the Caribbean it was the summer of 2003. For all their merits as entertainment, the likes of X2, The Matrix Reloaded and Hulk were all fundamentally serious affairs, treating their subject matter with a sober integrity. Pirates isn't that kind of movie. Pirates has only one agenda: fun, fun and more fun. It's the kind of tongue-in-cheek, flight-footed family movie that will almost certainly be premiered on BBC1 on Christmas Day in a couple of years, and will soon after be making regular appearances in Bank Holiday TV schedules for years to come.It has so much to recommend it - the old-fashioned swashbuckling action, the sparkling gag-filled script, the gorgeous coupling of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, the stunning CGI - and yet it's easy to pick out its strongest point. With a performance that deserves an Oscar nomination (but of course he won't get it), Johnny Depp - as the roguish, ambiguous, enigmatic Captain Jack Sparrow - doesn't so much light up the screen as burn a hole in it. Keith Richards is the obvious basis for his characterisation - all lop-sided tics and mockney accent - but unlike the wrinkly axeman, Depp looks fantastic. Never before has a man with a plaited beard, dreadlocks and permanent eye shadow looked so damn attractive. His forays into big-budget territory may be few and far between, but there can be no doubt that the guy is a proper Movie Star.It would be a lesser movie without Depp, but that's not to say the movie relies on him. It's like saying that Indiana Jones would be a lesser movie without Harrison Ford, purely because he's so perfect for the part. Pirates stands worthy comparison with Spielberg's archaeological trilogy. Director Gore Verbinksi (returning to the family-oriented mood of his earlier Mousehunt after the grisly The Ring) makes light work of handling multiple characters, a fairly complex revisionist plot (in this pirate movie, it's all about putting treasure back), judging the scenes of the supernatural just right so that they scare the kiddies without giving them nightmares, and allowing even Geoffrey Rush (with the toughest task of the four principals as the cursed villain of the piece) to camp it up and have some fun. Leave your cynical, adult self at the door, because for sheer uncomplicated entertainment value, Pirates of the Caribbean is the best movie of the summer, if not the whole of 2003.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Spoilers) A frightening lack of enthusiasm displayed by (nearly) all involved...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers!)First of all, let me make clear my attitude towards all things piratey: I *love* them!!! I own (legal) copies of all four Monkey Island PC adventure games, played "Pirates!...Gold" for quite a while and even liked the near-universally loathed "Cutthroat Island", as well as 1991s "Hook". I also approached "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" with appropriately low expectations, as one should every comedy/action/adventure movie. This was just going to be good, low-brow fun on an otherwise wasted sunny Saturday afternoon in August, I told myself.And yet I was *completely* disgusted with this movie! (Much to my own surprise). And what's worse, I felt I saw my own disgust mirrored in the bored, lacklustre performance given by most of the actors concerned (excluding Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, who did a fair job with the material they were given), as well as the poor quality of the costumes and props (especially the magic compass, the Inca chest and the other riches in the treasure cave). Much of this movie looks as if it was actually *shot* on some location in some Disney amusement park.Johnny Depp's make-up looks completely ridiculous, while he walks around like he is either a monkey, drunk, or blatantly gay. Neither of these qualities is completely believable for a pirate (not even non-stop drunkenness). It's as if Depp took one look at the script and decided to pretend it was all a grand rehearsal he only had to recite his lines for and look hazy.What is worse, Geoffrey Rush (playing Depp's antagonist) appears to have adopted a similar stance towards the movie. The only times his character comes across as even remotely menacing or even scary is when he turns into a skeletal zombie. And that's not something you can really credit the actor for, I feel. To all those who do not share my opinion on Rush's performance here, ask yourself this: When the girl with the coin is taken aboard the Pearl for the first time, and you see the group of pirates standing in front of her, could you have guessed which one of them was supposed to be the captain before he is introduced as such? Me neither. I supposed the real captain was sitting in his cabin somewhere and she would have been taken to him. Compare this to Dustin Hoffmann's portrayal of Captain James Hook in "Hook". There is no way that anyone could have mistaken him for anyone but the pirate captain, even if they had been unaware of the (Disney rendition of) the Peter Pan story.The British army captain is portrayed with appropriate stiffness, I feel, but that's still not much of an acting accomplishment. The British governor is also adequately portrayed, but is too trivial a character to really improve the movie much.Then there is the god-awful plot, which keeps dragging its anchor all over the place. The main surprise (the story behind the curse and all) is given away fairly quickly, and the eventual outcome is fairly predictable. Even the trick with taking a coin to become invincible could be seen coming a mile away. Then there is Depp's youthful appearance in the movie. Taking into account the plot point that the curse was put into place some 10 years before the start of the story, Sparrow would have looked *even younger* when he was captain of the Black Pearl. A mere teen boy! While the rest of the crew looked *exactly the same* (i.e. fairly old) back then because they have been preserved by the curse in the meantime. Sparrow would have looked terribly young to have been captain of the crew the way he looked during the movie, let alone 10 years before!Logic takes a (distant) backseat in this movie. The whole point of Jack's ship attacking the Pearl *knowing* the crew was invincible was beyond me. It might have been to damage the ship, but that didn't play any part either during the rest of the movie. As it was, this was just 15 minutes of meaningless filler. Likewise, the decision by the Pearl's crew to surrender once they had lost their immunity from wounds was perplexing. They were all going to be hanged anyway! What's the point of surrendering, then? The British soldiers fighting on upon first realizing the pirates were immortal was odd as well (as was the length of the fight, given the advantage the pirates had as long as they could not be harmed).As it was, there was not nearly enough plot to fill what felt like almost 3 hours. A lot of going back and forth for no good reason, plus goofy decisions made by the characters, filled a lot of time better spent otherwise (as in not watching this film!).As for the humor... why bother including it if you won't try to make the jokes as funny (and in-character) as possible? About the only one I liked was the one at the start when Sparrow confidently steps off his sinking ship onto the walkway. The rest just seem improvised (the slapping joke with Sparrow's exes, the interminable eye-joke with the one-eyed pirate). Maybe an accomplished comedy writer could have been included in the writing team to ensure more and better jokes?The comedy takes away from the horrifying feel arguably intended by the skeletal scenes. Perhaps it would have been a good idea if the writers had made a choice between horror with the occasional moment of relief and comedy with some horror elements (as portrayed in the "Monkey Island" adventure series). As it is, the writers seemed to be going back and forth. Sparrow should have been either a copy of Guybrush Threepwood, or a competent pirate with a sense of humour. Not kind of both at the same time, since that just doesn't work.Many of the action scenes convey the same sort of bored indifference portrayed so fittingly by many of the key actors.Oh, but the SFX are gorgeous, of course. Scoring the only points I can give this godawful excuse for a fun summer action/adventure movie. Makes me wonder if the people doing the SFX had somehow been isolated from the rest of the process of making the film, since none of feel of the rest of the movie is present in the skeletal scenes.The verdict: 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really a well done movie with a great (yes, great)over the top performance by Johnny Depp. Unfortunately it's also a little too long. It seems like they were having so much fun they didn't want it to end. And, of course, once again the damsel is not in distress, but fights the ghostly pirates without fear - though Sigourney Weaver she's not. Highly recommended for light summer entertainment that may become one of Disney's top grossers of all time (it's already in the top 25 of all time box office movies).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly one of the best movies this summer. After the pirate-franchise was dead for so long it's really refreshing to witness its revival.Although there are many differences between this and the older pirate-flicks (more action, more funny situations and humor, undead, disney-production, etc.) it still gains a top spot among the best.There was not a minute I felt bored, Johnny Depp's performance was outstanding and completely new and unexpected - but still fitted perfectly. The more or less predictable ending (a bit trashy but fitting) might be the unique weak part of the film.The worldwide success is justified in every aspect. This movie truly earned the crown of this summer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The casting is good it works. The scenery is good. The special effects work well too as they are used to support the story and are not a gimmick unto itself. The music however is a bit awkward. The theme tune is fine but it is repeated incessantly and in the major fight scene where you are trying to follow the swordplay and effect and characters it is totally wrong. The music is distracting and doesn't follow the events on the screen, as it should. It breaks the scene down and distracts, which is a great pity.A great movie, go and see it.</fullReview>

We all laughed our butts off. Johnny Depp was at his best in this movie (not to mention his sexiest). He plays Captain Jack Sparrow with a zest that cannot be matched. I especially loved when he said, "Welcome to the Caribbean, love." That was one of the best lines of the film. I voted it a ten, and recommend it for those who are considering seeing it.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie so much I demanded we went to the cinema to see it again. Mainly because I love Johnny Depp so much. But the movie itself was spectacular, even though I am not too fond of pirate movies, this one is an exception. I could watch this again and again and again, all day. The casting is great, I couldn't imagine the characters being played as anyone else. Johnny Depp plays a wonderful Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom also plays his character with great style. One of the things that struck me were the costumes, they had a great appeal to me, although they were quite simple, I found I quite enjoyed studying them. The film has a mix of comedy and action, the main comedy lines coming from Johnny Depp. I found the storyline quite gripping and the action scenes had some wonderful effects. Overall, it was a spectacular movie, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations was fairly high when I went into the cinema to see this one. I love Johnny Depp and he is one of the best actors Ive ever seen, so this movie was a failsafe just because of Mr. Depp. And just as I expected the movie was AWESOME! Johnny Depp have never been better. Maybe in "Fear and loathing in L.A" but otherwise he is born to be a pirate. He has the coolest appearing with his dreadlocks and black makeup and a sweet dialect that fits his role very well. Orlando Bloom is an extraordinary actor too but not aswell as Johnny though. Together they make a hell of a team. Jack Sparrow as Depp's character is named is hillarious. He is really funny. One bad thing about the humour is that more people then depp is supposed to be funny. Too much humour is never good and since they are not funny enough they could just be normal and leave all the funny lines to Johnny Depp. My rating on this one was 9/10. It was maximum entertainment!</fullReview>

Johnny D. has Mr. Richards' chops down. And for a while this and Geoffrey Rush's, also over-the-top, Barboosa were enough fun to keep the film interesting.

I think special effects are being used way to much these days and movies are way to dependent on them.

		<fullReview>This film is a lot of fun, with great (over)acting from Jonny Depp (in his most attractive role yet) and Geoffrey Rush. It is a fairly simple story but with everything you could want; plenty of swashbuckling, zombie pirates, a lovely heroine with lovely eyebrows, Gareth from The Office, and Jonny Depp.Orlando Bloom still can't act and clearly really wants to be as cool as Jonny Depp, which he is not. And there is nothing cool about elves fighting the enemies of Middle Earth with extreme sports, such as surfing down stairs on a shield. However, a film like this doesn't require much acting from the hero - he just has to stand there and look good, which he does.The best pirate movie since A Muppet Treasure Island.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having only seen the film once I am not sure if what I'm about to ask is on the money or not, but I digress:In the scene when Rush and Depp are fighting just before Bloom is headed to the chest with Cortez's gold we see Depp prepare to toss the coin he stole from the chest to Bloom so that the curse may be lifted. In a very swift motion Depp slices into his own hand and grasps the coin before tossing it upwards to bloom and after Bloom drops both coins we clearly see a line of blood on each coin. Are we to think in some way that Jack Sparrow and Will Turner are in fact related? What could be the relation as earlier in the film it is stated that Bootstrap Bill Turner had but one child?

Its excellent story and wonderful selection of actors and actresses has drawn in many people of all ages. What makes this movie so good is it's never ceasing action, which was brilliantly choreographed. Its musical score is quite good also. It might just seem that is the best movie ever made, or that it can be shown anywhere to anyone. But it is obviously not the greatest movie, nor can it be shown to whoever wants to watch it. Let me remind you that this movie is PG-13. This is because of its crude humor and intense fight scenes. This is why only people that are teens or older should watch it, hence PG-13. Other than that it is an excellent movie which deserves being watched more than once.</fullReview>

This movie is based on a Hollywood formula which has been done so many times its a travesty it appears in the top 250. You have : the kidnapped daughter which is the sole reason for the adventure, the father who wants her daughter to marry the high status good looking but with zero personality and slightly dim witted character, the poor and low class hero who is hopelessly in love with the rich and noble 'princess' but who is too shy and too aware of his social inadequecies to admit his love for her, the obviously choreographed fight scenes, especially the one in the smithy which is absurd, endless pirates fighting (who btw cannot die because they are immortal) and unknown military fodder who you don't care about anyway because they serve the 'evil' english establishment, the awful awful awful and did i mention AWFUL ending where of course the hero gets the girl because suddenly the father and the antihero have grown a new personality and have discovered what compassion and morality mean..... i mean can this plot be anymore predictable and cliched ? I think not. A pitiful 2 out of 10 stars for Johnny Depp and the CGI effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that one leaves the theatre wanting to stay and watch it all over again. PotC is one of those movies.Excellent cast. Johnny Depp makes one of the best, if not the best, pirates ever seen on the screen (I'd throw him in the same boat as Dustin Hoffman's "Hook"). Capt. Jack Sparrow is one of the most memorable characters in recent years. Orlando Bloom was actually better at Will Turner than Legolas (so far) in LotR. Keira Knightley was surprising. Being a very attractive woman in a pirate film, one would expect her to be either a helpless bimbo in distress or a sultry seductress. Nothing could be further from the truth on both. She was proper, respectable, and played both a damsel and a fighter at the same time. Geoffrey Rush makes for an excellent villain, one you just can't help but like, even though you hate his guts (well, bones in this case). The effects are superb, especially that of the fights in and out of the moonlight (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll know when you see it). The music, well, WOW. This is the best soundtrack since Gladiator and possibly even better. Perfect mood setting.All in all, an excellent and fun film that's both enjoyable, full of action and adventure, GREAT music, and can both make fun of itself yet still take itself seriously. On this rare occasion, Cap'n Bruckheimer and his scallywags get an A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my subjective opinion, the best action-adventure-pseudo-historical movie since Kevin Costner's 'Robin Hood, The Prince of Thieves'. There are numerous similarities between them: both treat historical truth rather loosely, both are packed with humour and both are thrilling to watch. Even though everyone knows how the story will end.Johnny Depp is excellent in this movie and steals (commandeer, nautical term!)the show. Orlando Bloom is so handsome it hurts and - he can act. Maybe he still has bits and pieces of that cool, elvish charm, but he sure looks better non-blonde. Keira Knightley prooves that not every girl in a pirate movie should scream and run around with no purpose (save the purpose of falling in the arms of a leading male). Geoffrey Rush is demonic but one can feel pity for him. And the monkey Jack is the best. Really.One may nag, that the plot is a bit conventional, but that's the way it is; it doesn't spoil the fun. The sea battles are - on the other hand - totally unconventional. Shooting cannon with forks and knives aspire to one of my favourite scenes... Of all movies, altogether.Not to mention a corset scene... All corset scenes, actually. It may be a little far fetched, but does it not remind You of a scene from the 'Titanic'? And 'Gone with The Wind'? Having in mind that the script came from the men who gave us 'Shreck', I am not surprised at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair example of the pirate genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This acceptable example of the swashbuckle genre passes an enjoyable afternoon. However, only Johnny Depp's original interpretation as the cynical pirate captain gave it any depth. Nothing else excited old the grey cells.Nice effects, including a convincing set of ghostly pirates.I should have liked to have seen Knightley's character, for the sake of humour, a bit more caricatured, more girlishly excited about pirates, (edging towards Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth in Blackadder) which would have made her a better foil to Depp. And Jack's new crew should have been allowed to get more into their characters, not dragged in from the actors' bank with ten minutes rehearsal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the greatest movies this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie because it was one of those movies where you can't just watch a little bit, if you start it, you have to finish it. I would recommend it to anyone, except for little kids; it does have frightening scenes in it. I really liked the special effects, how the people changed from `human' to "skeleton". I like they used some bigger-named actors in it. I have already seen it 5 times! I'm a little bit crazy!You could tell all of the characters personalities very well, including Captain jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. I liked how you almost could read the characters mind, but they would turn around and do something totally un-expected. It was very well directed. Like in most movies these days, there if some type of love connection. It's the feeling of you-will-she-pick kind of anticipation. To me, and probably most people who saw the movie thought it was kind of obvious who she would of picked, but the movie was great all the same. I have nothing to say about this spectacular movie that is negative, except that I didn't like Orlando Bloom's hair! I love this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is excellent when you're grading for entertainment, not quite so much if you're grading for artistic content- some feel that the plot is too complicated, the movie is too long, or that the writing is bad. But this movie doesn't make any claims at being a great work of art. It's a movie for fun. The amount of eyeliner on Johnny Depp should have told you that.Speaking of Johnny Depp, his performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is excellent and ever so swishy, and while the plot doesn't make perfect sense, it showcases Captain Jack in all his glory.This is entertainment that's actually entertaining, and besides, it's a pirate movie. An attempt at artistic glory would just distract from everything good about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is without a doubt the best movie of the summer. I emmencley enjoyed watching this film the 6 times I went to see it. Even though I went to see this movie an insane amount, it never got old nor did I enjoy it less than the time before. The only other movie that might(and probably will) beat this film will be Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, which, coincidentally, also stars the young, very talented and future major star Orlando Bloom. That sexy star has a very very bright future, esspcially when he co-stars with phenomonal actors like Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, Vigo Mortenson, Liv Tyler, Eligha Woods, Josh Hartnett, and so on and so forth. Anyways getting back to Pirates, This movie features a wonderful acting job from Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush. They both were cast wonderfully for the parts that needed to be played. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and well we already see a lot of Geoffry Rush. Peace to all my homies on the S Island!!! I love you Orlando!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blows Other Summer Out Of The Water...The Best of 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first experience with pirates was turning on the TV one weekend afternoon when I was little and watching a classic Errol Flynn flick called "Captain Blood". This was very exciting to watch and it held my interest throughout the picture. Basically that wasn't the first time I was interested in pirates. Pirates have been scene in movies and TV shows for years,and the shows I can recall were shows based on Saturday morning cartoons and those thrilling Saturday afternoon matinees that were shown from the 30's and 40's on television,if there wasn't anything else to do. Basically,the last "pirate" movie that was okay,but did it every suck was the overrated Geena Davis vehicle called "Cutthroat Island",and from then on I really lost interest in the pirate genre and so did Hollywood for a while.Until now........................."Pirates Of The Caribbean:The Curse Of The Black Pearl",maybe the best the finest pirate movie to ever grace the screen,and it is done in the grand tradition of those classic pirate movies of the past and it also goes back to those classic standard Disney fare that hasn't been seen in ages,and if Walt Disney himself were living today,he would be proud. This film is the first ever "PG13" rated feature under the family friendly/family oriented Walt Disney Pictures and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and it its one of the biggest thrill rides of the summer.It has everything you expect in a grand adventure/action packed flick: action,intrigue,romance,humor--all on a grand epic scale that is not to be missed! It's full of old-fashioned thrills and spills. It has classic Hollywood glamour as well---not since the likes of Errol Flynn- men sporting pencil-thin mustaches and women wearing tight corsets,not to mention fantastic special effects all around courtesy of the full advantage of 21st Century cutting edge technology that gives it the marvelous touch,thanks to the crew at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic along with that special Disney touch.Best of all,the filmmakers didn't shy away from putting all of the elements to make this a damn good flick,in other words, to make a pirate movie,a pirate movie and to stand out like a pirate movie. People walking the plank, Pirates grabbing ropes and swinging onto other ships,Pirates searching for buried treasure and others including a pirate who has a talking parrot on his shoulder,and another one with a glass eye and another one that yells out...."Aaargh"!As far as the acting goes,this film belongs to Johnny Depp. It is the reason to go see it. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime looking like the smidgens of classic actors Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks,Jr. "Pirates Of The Caribbean" is a terrific and satisfying popcorn picture that aims to please and has per se,kicked out the summer competition of 2003 at the box office.The scariest scene but also the best FX scene in the whole movie: When Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) and his crew transformed into walking undead skeletons in the moonlight---this is surely Oscar material here,and I'm so glad that Ray Harryhausen is still alive to see this movie! This scene is scary and maybe too intense for the younger ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>encounters some rough moments but overall a nice ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the most commercially successful pirate movie after the days of Errol Flynn, "Pirates of the Caribbean" pairs blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with unscrupulous pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Along with a ragtag team of pirates, they must battle a band of the world's most notorious pirates aboard the legendary "Black Pearl" ship led by the cursed Captain Barbossa, in order to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the daughter of an English governor and Turner's love interest, as well as to reclaim certain honors and possessions that were once Sparrow's.The film is lavishly produced (it's backed by Mr. Bruckheimer, what else do you expect?) and we have a flamboyant production design. I like how Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom exchange banters with each other and with the rest of the cast, and those swashbuckling skills are well displayed. We also get some decent performance from Geoffrey Rush but I really would want to give credit to Keira Knightley who did a marvelous portrayal of Elizabeth Swann. She's got the looks, the spunk, and the appeal; plus she's probably the prettiest English actress I have seen in a while. So does this mean that "Pirates" goes for an absolute smooth sailing henceforth? Not really. Sure there are sword fights, ship adventures, and the whole pirate-movie shebang. Also, the leads' charisma and diverse natures work together, and here the story itself is more than good enough to stand in its own right. "Pirates" has all the elements I am looking for in a typical summer film and I commend it if only for the entertainment value. But while the character ambiguity of Depp and the on-screen presence of Knightley make the whole outing interesting, the film steered a bit towards being a ho-hum. It is more like an overstretched theme park ride that seems enjoyable at first, but then eventually becomes tiresome. Or maybe this is one case where I expected too much that it left me quite unsatisfied.So I guess this depends on what your expectations are. Sure, it had its shortcomings, and it wasn't as good as it could have been, but I know this is certainly what majority of moviegoers are looking forward to these days. If so, fine. Just like Barbossa, we are parched with thirst for a good summer movie and this could be the one that could break the curse and quench that thirst. So go on and sail into the movie. You know you want to.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best laugh Ive had in ages....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is just a bit of fun and its the kind of fun that doesnt resort to complete stupidity like the POLICE ACADEMY series. I was laughing every 5 minutes and I saw Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp in a whole new acting light....Orlando (Will Turner) really expresses himself in this movie rather than the flat character Legolas in Lord of the Rings. Despite that, Johnny Depp steals the show hands down. Playing the completely insane pirate, Jack Sparrow, he pulls off the role very well. That first fight scene between the two was fantastic...Of course I cant dismiss Geoffrey Rush. Im not a big fan of his (Ive only see him in LES MISERABLES and thats only because yummy Liam neeson is in it). I loved his character Barboosa though....If you want a serious film, dont bother. If you want a laugh, than what are you waiting GO SEE NOW!!!H xxxxxx</fullReview>

Action-packed and full of adventure, this film lacks not in action, nor in comedy, and keeps you asking for more until the very end. Certainly a treasure for a moviegoer looking for adventure, comedy and a little romance. A family film, which takes you back to when you rode the title inspiration, the ride in Disney World/Disneyland, for the very first time.

Johnny Depp is absolutely fantastic - his character 'Captain John Sparrow' is a screen masterpiece. Great first scene where you see him standing on top of a mast, and you imagine that it's some big pirate ship and then the camera pans out and it's a tiny little rowing boat with a small sail that is sinking. Not an intellectually demanding film, but 2 hours of sheer fun and escapism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp, I'm male and I love you. Yes, this is how great he is as Captain Jack Sparrow in this Disney adaptation of a Disneyland ride.The first time I saw this film was on a bootleg copy in Thailand so it wasn't the best experience, what with missing half the words to fuzziness and general rubbishy quality. What I saw though made me realise that this was one film I couldn't miss.When I got back to Bangkok (still in Thailand) I went to a Thai cinema to go see it which was great because the seats were leather recliners and you got food delivered to you! My sister and I settled down and prepared ourselves for the next 140 minutes of swashbuckling fun.In my eyes this is Johnny's film. Without it Pirates of the Carribean is just another Summer moneymaker, with him it becomes a classic. Everything about his character is pure entertainment, from his funky looks to his drunken stagger.Speaking about his funky looks, I'm so getting dreadlocks when I'm older. I reckon with a dab of eyeliner, a bandana and a pirate's hat I'll be quite close to Jack Sparrow.Anyway, I'm talking rubbish now so just go see this great film.</fullReview>

Sorry, most of the "funny moments" were already showed tons of times in other movies, how about some creativity?The music was fantastic though, really, just like film music should be: taking, and then again not overwhelming.Not a movie to see in the cinema / theatre, but maybe for a rainy day at home, if there's nothing better to see on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney needed a winner and they got it with Pirates. It was an exciting movie and Johnny Depp is fabulous, as usual. I'm also amazed at the range of Orlando Bloom. Being a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies, it took me a few minutes to get used to him being someone besides an Elf.The movie progressed quickly, except for the "stranded on the island" scene, and I rather enjoyed picking out the similarities between the movie and the theme park attraction - there were several.A must-see for ALMOST all ages. Some of the skeleton scenes may be a bit much for small children. They even startled me at first.All-in-all, a very enjoyable feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This pirate movie is,although pretty good,not even close to the pirate classic "The Crimson Pirate" with Burt Lancaster and Nick Cravat. There is even a scene in PotC that is completely ripped off from that classic,the scene in which Captain Jack(Johnny Depp)and his "mate" Turner escape from the soldiers by walking under water in a boat.Still,it makes for a pretty good movie with some fine effects and fights. 7/10PS:Don't go away right after the movie has ended,but see the entire credits for a surprise at the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should get an oscar for the best entertainment value. It was fun, it was funny, it was clever and it had a lot of action. It had a few minor "bugs" in it, but when you're enjoying a movie this well, you barely notice them. As always Depp was perfect in his role, it was almost like he was born for that role, or the role was specifically written for him. The other actors were also great in their roles. I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I only give 10/10 to really original or somehow special films. But if you want a movie that is very enjoyable, go see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fabled as being the fastest and most powerful ship on the seaboard, "The Black Pearl" reigns terror on all ships it encounters. With its legendary Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of scoundrels damned to scour the world with the gold of Cortes, accursed gold, which, if possessed leaves one as a mere shadow of a human; a skeleton, invulnerable, yet unable to enjoy the benefits of humanity, even when in human form. It is this quest that brings them to a mooring town in the Caribbean. Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) the young governess who possesses the final gold piece, which holds the power to restore the pirates of The Black Pearl to their former human selves, is torn between love with a blacksmith , William Turner (Bloom), whom she had rescued as a child, and Norrington (Davenport), a Commodore, and friend to Swann's father, Governor Weatherby Swann. Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow (Depp), a seemingly inept (and somewhat gay) pirate, is captured and prisoned.The plot thickens when the governess (and the coin) are seized, and brought to the resident island of the pirates; an island which can only be found if you have been their before.Sparrow and Turner league with one another to save the damsel and defeat the pirates of the Caribbean...Brilliance in itself. Johnny Depp recovers from his recent slump and comes out with an Oscar worthy performance of the renowned, yet inept pirate Jack Sparrow. He retains a somewhat drunken stupor throughout the film, yet still is able to fully form a complex character. Bloom too was good; He far outdoes his previous role of Legolas Greenleaf, in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. His usual somewhat boring demeanor in films is actually erased from his role and actually allows me to respect the man.Geoffrey Rush was a disappointment though. Since his Oscar winning performance in "Shine" he has not really pulled off a good role, sadly enough. This was just another confirmation of this slump... Hopefully soon he will yet again find his niche.Other than this, all the other actors played exceptionally well, and provided a good 143 min of film.I definitely recommend this film to anyone, as this is not only a swashbuckling film, but a comedy, romance, and to some horrific... Though the skeletons were really quite humorous, and the monkey remained cute... Anyways, four fingers and a stub out of five.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>please someone explain a major piece of this movie to me! *spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi, My boyfriend and I just finished seeing "Pirates of the Caribbean," and afterward we both realized we had no idea why the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl needed the blood of either young William Turner or his father in order to lift the curse. We have many speculations, but none of them quite seem to add up, such as... Perhaps because Bootstraps, as one of the cursed pirates, gave one of the coins away to his son, so when the coin is returned his blood must accompany it, but he's at the bottom of the ocean somewhere, so his son's blood must take its place. However, that would mean that every pirate would need to shed his own blood every time a coin was returned that the particular pirate spent, and mostly the pirates are just skeletons (although they do seem to occasionally bleed)? Basically, we think we must have missed some major step in the movie, but I spoke with my sister who's seen "Pirates" twice, and she seemed just as baffled. Someone please enlighten me, and fast! Thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Does Not Fail To Entertain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly impressive and truthfully I fully expected a similar outcome since the teaser trailer!I wish to begin by thanking all involved in creating this wondrous movie that really blew me out of the water! The story was drenched in such detail, which was explained thoroughly by dialogue that actually interested me all the way through the film! The acting was superb at its least and delivered the tale so well I could believe that these characters and story were actually real. Starting with my favorite actor, Johnny Depp. In every movie, no matter how horribly rated by critics, he was always commended on his performance! This one, he throws his audience another character out of his vast onsemble...and I cannot get over how cool Jack Sparrow turned out to be! He had the most tasteful lines, reactions, and whatever else I can't think of right now for the comic relief. Then, the youthful, but talented Orlando Bloom brought the role of Will Turner to life just as he did Legolas in "The Lord of the Rings," acting as the hero and playing well with Johnny Depp's insane, Capt. Jack Sparrow! I wish I could expand on the inspiring acting abilities of Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush as well as others in this amazing swashbuckling pirate film because everyone involved made this summer blockbuster possible! I'm positive that missing just one person from the crew or cast or anyone who worked, even the less valued jobs on this hit would not mold it into the astounding, not to mention critically acclaimed, and appreciated by audiences everywhere project that it has truly become!Great Job, and I am eagerly awaiting for the DVD experience, and a possible sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What are people complaining about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the film came out, I was looking forward to it purely as a fantasy adventure, where I could switch off for a couple of hours and just enjoy.There is always a danger with a film such as this, which is heavily hyped as a great film, that it won't live up to that billing. Lets face it, if it isn't great, you'll be disappointed. So when a highly regarded UK critic called this one of the worst films of the year, I was somewhat reassured. The balance had been restored!And I'm glad to say that this was a really enjoyable night out. There is no way that you can take the subject matter seriously (just watch the trailers), so accept it for what it is.... a very well made (though slightly overlong) Saturday Matinee film. Gruesome baddies, a wisecracking hero and two innocents that stumble into the story and end up saving the day.I thought all of the main players did a fine job. No-one will win an acting Oscar for it, but they will draw in the crowds. Go see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice now, and have to admit the first time i went to see it, it was because Orlando Bloom was in it. But I went the second time because i enjoyed it so much. The actors all fitted their roles perfectly and it's great to see a cast containing lots of Brits. Every actor/actress fitted there part superbly; Geoffry Rush plays your traditional pirate with lots of energy and Orlando Bloom makes the ladies swoon over him as the young Will Turner. Of course for the men there's the beautiful Keira Knightly. The crew of the Black Pearl all put 100% into their roles, especially Mackenzie Crook, and gave the audience the creeps. But it was Johnny Depp who stole the show as Jack Sparrow, he didn't have to say anything, just his body language and facial expressions could steal a scene. His English accent may not be totally accurate but it doesn't matter because it fitted his character perfectly. He successfully plays the lovable rogue, because by the end of the film everyone has, well, fallen in love with him. The film may be long at over two hours, but you never get bored because there is always something going on. Lots of swashbuckling sword fights and great special affects make this a must for any fans of action-adventure movies. And of course, girls if you don't fancy all that action and fighting theres always Orlando Bloom!</fullReview>

Orlando is the brave cute nice guy, and always fun to watch. but it's Johnny Depp who steals the show. even though he was dressed awfully (like a real stinky pirate) with golden teeth and two plaits in his beard and walking around like a some drunk dude, he still has this magical glamour around him. he still looks so damn handsome when he's putting on his (black bad teeth) smile. and of course Geoffrey Rush as the perfect evil man. further the special effects are pretty well done. the fight between Depp and Rush in the cave with the moonlight is really cool. I think that because of the wrong advertising a lot of people have got the wrong impression of this movie. they think it's is some sort of bad freaky horror film, but in fact it's an adventure with first-rate humour.</fullReview>

There's lots to like though, some quirky dialogue, sometimes much funnier than expected (only when delivered by Depp though, reading the quotes on IMDB well... i guess Depp deserves even more credit for this film).Summary: long film felt an hour, so can't be bad. Would have loved some more marooned-island-drink and less moonlight-skeleton-fight, and a more memorable ending... it wasn't very memorable generally really, all i can think of now (same day) is two turtles strapped together. But it felt good and made me + nippers laugh, so 7 or 8 out of 10. (I wonder how good this *could* have been with a better *story*! It's not very original to ask for more plot and less special effects, sorry).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A toothsome romp; Hollywood's answer to Monkey Island</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a longtime pirate fan and amateur pirate scholar. I went into this film expecting a great deal, and I got it all and more. Outstanding performances from everyone, beautiful special effects, excellent direction, and not-too-visible Bruckheimer. The only issues I had were as follows:1. Keira Knightly is too...modern-looking, I suppose. She didn't sit quite right with me in this role. I would have cast someone who looks less like every other hip young thing. I would have liked someone a little more unusual or remarkable; less cookie-cutter 90's starlet. She did a decent job, however.2. The music, while decent, was not up to snuff with the rest of the film. At first they had Alan Silvestri, then Hans Zimmer, and somehow ended up with Klaus Badelt, who's not a feature composer at all. He does fill-in music, and it sort of showed. I would have preferred a riotous Zimmer theme like we had in MTI, or maybe even a Goldsmith. Again, this is a very very minor point that I'm not going to quibble over. My vote is 10/ 10Those of us who played the Monkey Island series waited so long to see a decent pirate flick. The much-maligned Cutthroat Island had the swash, and Muppet Treasure Island had the charm, but not until Curse of the Black Pearl have these ingredients been combined properly. No longer will the spat-upon swashbuckling genre be relegated to cheap parody and jokes about Errol Flynn. Bloom was a perfect Guybrush, Rush a gorgeous LeChuck, Knightly a fair Elaine, and Depp is (as always) without compare.I will be spending more of my hard-earned money to see this at least once again. Well done, Hollywood! Now let's see what you can do with Peter Pan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the ride so thought the film should get an equal chance to impress, and it did! The basic story centres around the Black Pearl and it's crew,captained by Barbossa brilliantly played out by Geoffrey Rush, searching the world for certain gold medallions and a sacrifice to bring them back to the land of the living but with Sparrow, that's Captain Jack Sparrow accompanied on this adventure by Orlando Bloom , it is not going to be that easy. The casting was a breath of fresh air using talented actors that might not be well known to some film goers who played the deadpan humour perfectly, an english thing, and you had no feeling that they were out to upstage each other, an american thing, and was impressed at how they all seemed to relish their parts. The effects are superb, especially the seamless swapping from walking dead to salty sea dog scenes. ILM never fail to get it right, or are they real??? The only thing I couldn't quite get to grips with was Johnny Depps' accent, it was border line Tommy Cooper, an english thing, and gave the impression he was drunk throughout the movie, a pirate thing(?), however, he played the part with such an off the wall air that he did enough to impress. I would have liked to have seen a few more 'real' pirate scenes given their apparent notoriety. I recommend this film for high sea adventure and subtle humour and some good old fashioned sword play without a lazer in sight! One word though, for those who leave before the credits end, never understood why, there is a final scene that is amusing and possibly leaves a 2nd film in the pipeline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp has done it again *10/10*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp proves himself againPirates of the Caribbean is one of the most well-done, cleverly-executed films I have seen in a long time. The first of Disney's movies to be rated PG-13, it entails swordfights, curses, skeletons, theft, and a drunken party on a deserted island. The word `rape' is mentioned once, though not quite audibly enough to be heard if you're not listening for it.While I admit, Orlando Bloom's (Lord of the Rings, Black Hawk Down) character is a lot wishy-washy, (through no fault of his own), one has to keep in mind that this is a Disney film, and he carried himself well. Rugged blacksmith Will Turner is a brave, romantic hero, who proves himself willing to die for the woman he loves, despite the fact that she is promised to another man. You almost don't notice how common his character actually is in Disney films.Elizabeth Swann, adeptly played by Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Star Wars, Episode I), is one of those rare `damsels in distress' to actually put her brain to good use. Elizabeth (who bears a striking resemblance to Winona Ryder) is well versed in naval jargon, and at one point even makes the commands in a pirate attack on the ship she is on.Geoffry Rush (Finding Nemo, Shine) portrays the fearsome captain Barbossa, of the cursed Black Pearl. He, his monkey, and his curious affection for apples, commands respect from anyone who dares to cross him, including the lovely Elizabeth Swann. Surprisingly intelligent, Barbossa finds loopholes in every contract, (not unlike a modern-day lawyer) and can be trusted to not be trustworthy, as so eloquently put by his arch-rival, captain Jack Sparrow.Johnny Depp, (Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Edward Scissorhands), however, who has again and again proven his genius to worldwide audiences, has done it again. Captain Jack Sparrow absolutely made this movie. I can't help but feel that without Depp, the flick wouldn't have carried nearly the same weight. Given only a minimal script, Depp was told to create Captain Jack as he saw fit, and he has utterly outdone himself. Modeled after the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, captain Jack Sparrow completely dominates the entire film. Every word he speaks is insightful, accurate, and absolutely hilarious. And, as with Orlando Bloom, his looks certainly don't hurt.One must of course take into account, more than just the actors. Behind every outstanding movie, there lies an equally outstanding crew. As one example, I direct you to producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Pearl Harbour, Black Hawk Down, Enemy of the State). Also we should applaud score composer Klaus Badelt (Pearl Harbor, additional music for Gladiator), director Gore Verbinski (The Ring, The Ring 2), Depp's stunt double, Tony Angelotti (Mask of Zorro, doubling for Antonio Banderas), Screenwriter Ted Elliott (Shrek, Mask of Zorro), and makeup artist David DeLeon (Star Trek: Nemesis). Judging by the pounds of eyeliner Depp sports, while still looking amazing, DeLeon is a talented makeup artist, as anyone who has seen Nemesis will vouch for.This film is a must-see. It was funny, exciting, romantic, mysterious, suspenseful, and many other genres all at once. Guaranteed to suit anyone's tastes. Kudos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was about 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is getting rarer to see these days with all the arguing between studios and directors about which cut of films we see in theaters. The movie wisely does not ever take itself seriously, as pirate movies have been done many times before far better. The granddaddy of them all is The Sea Hawk, 1940, with Errol Flynn; there are subtle tips of the hat to this film in Pirates Of The Caribbean, such as the "sea monkey." The Crimson Pirate, 1952, with Burt Lancaster is a close second; there is a real nice ode to Burt Lancaster &amp; Nick Cravat in this film. Tyrone Power in The Black Swan, 1942, is also very good. There have been very few pirate movies made in the last 20 years and those that have been made, well... which may be why audiences are welcoming this film so well this summer. Johnny Depp doesn't hurt either to get the targeted demographic into theaters. Orlando Bloom doesn't have a lot to do, playing second fiddle. Geoffrey Rush is almost choking on all that scenery he chews on. Jonathan Pryce plays his part appropriately as the really important person, who is an easily duped oaf. Keira Knightly is ravishing as the girl that needs ravishing. The funny inside joke about the corset scene is that she is extremely rail thin; I would be willing to wager the costumers had to construct a corset that had to appear to be pulled tight around her as none probably existed in real life. I thought the plot about the curse was pretty lame, but it was consistent with the overall preposterousness of the goings-on. It also served as an excuse to provide the real neat special effects, which are obligatory in any "A" budget film these days. The soundtrack contains a jolly good rousing score, which could rival the best of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. I suppose it's asking too much, but I would have loved to see more odes to the pirate movies of yesterday, such as those I mentioned above. For those of you that don't know what I'm referring to, see the above mentioned films. *** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nefarious &amp; scariness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lusty loud and funny pirate tale. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is an unlikely ally of Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. He is so funny with his loose antics, and wild scary appearance. They battle together against the most treacherous pirates led by Captain Barbossa, in order to save the lovely Elizabeth, played by Keira Knightley, the love of Will's life. They recover the lost treasure that Jack wants. A clashing of swords between Will and Jack reminds me of milder sword fights in 30s films with Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. An exciting film with good score, but it is scary and may be too much or too long for little kids. As a big kid, I enjoyed it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't like pirate movies, but this one is great!!! The special effects are not the important thing in any film, but I have to say that they are fantastic, when the pirates are under the moonlight, fighting, and they look like skeletons and then like people... that's sooo amazing!the plot is not very original. I mean, a lot of films are about a curse and a treasure, and romance,... but this movie has humor, very good action, (not just explosions and special effects) and romance, but not the boring one in my opinion.The actors play very good their roles. In special, Johnny Depp's character is very well played and it's very very funny!Well, in my opinion is a very good film. THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the few that disliked this movie, i thought it was one of the best things i have seen this year. There hasn't been a good pirate movie for years.Of course, the idea of setting this on a theme park ride seemed like an odd concept for a film, i thought it worked rather well indeed.I enjoyed the story, the effects, the costumes, the script, the lot! I give my thumbs up to the producers, designers, director, scriptwriter, all of them.I also have to say that the casting for this film was great.Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom and the rest of the cast gave great performances. However, i thought the best performance came from non other than Johnny Depp himself. I just loved his character, and it is safe to say, he gets most of the best lines in the film. And he plays him so well! I was a moderate Johnny Depp fan before the movie, and a great deal bigger fan of him now. I hope he continues making such great movies and acting to such a good degree of talent.The special CGI effects of the cursed crew are also great to see. As they shift in and out of the moonlight effortlessly, so do the effects, keeping in time with the actors performances all the way through.Truly, and enjoyable, entertaining, swashbuckling, fun packed movie.Although i could say a huge deal more about this film, i won't. I'm going to leave this squarely up to you. However, i do recommend you try to see this film if you can. If you're a fan of Orlando or Johnny, then see it just for them.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best fun I've had at a summer movie in a very long time! Johnny Depp gives a bravura performance as wacky and unpredictable Captain Jack Sparrow and is a joy to watch. Geoffrey Rush and the rest of the cast look like they're having a blast, and all the energy translates into a lot of fun. There are plot problems, of course, but I thought they were minor, and some dialogue is a bit ruff, while there are times the scene could have cut out sooner. But overall, this is a swashbuckler of a good time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Pirates of the Caribbean was a great movie. I thought Orlando Bloom was very brave and heroic, just as he is in Lord of the Rings. I thought Johnny Depp was brilliant for playing such a funny character, and I almost cried when he got stabbed by the pirate :'(, but then I saw he turned into one of the cursed pirates, and I was shocked! Kiera Knightly is a beautiful woman and she is a great actress. She was very awesome throughout the movie. That's what I think of the actors. And now, about the movie itself, I thought was the best (in my opinion). It's so funny and cool. It's a great movie for everyone, especially kids. I wanna see this movie again and again until it comes on dvd and video!!! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scenes, I realised that this film was going to be something special. Having been disappointed by such films as T3 and Bruce Almighty, it made a change for a film to live up to it's billing.The special effects are stupendous, and used to move the film along, rather than carry a poor script. The end fight sequence moving between the shafts of light is superb.There are many laugh out loud scenes, and at no time does the film slow down. Well paced and well written, I can only hope that any future sequel is as good.Recommended for all the family, this is a definite 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and frolics on the high seas with Cap'ns Depp and Rush. High summer camp but not quite the masterpiece it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp and co shiver their timbers, hoist the mains'l and buckle their swashes in this jolly romp on the high seas.The, frankly, bonkers plot sees much toing and froing and double double crossing as Jack Sparrow tries to reclaim his ship, the semi-mythical Black Pearl, now captained by Barbarossa. He in turn is hell bent on lifting the curse on him and his men by trying to recover an ancient Aztec coin belonging to British Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann.Depp steals the show as brain-addled pirate, Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush hams it up as Jack Sparrow's nemesis Barbarossa but lacks the true menace of, say, Alan Rickman in Robin Hood. Keira Knightley is the spunky love interest, Elizabeth Swann while Orlando Bloom once again dons tights for his action role as her unrequited love.The other standout performance is that of Jack Davenport as Keira Knightley's fiance. British viewers will know Davenport as Miles from the BBC's This Life. Here he returns to form as the sneering, preening, supercilious Commodore Norrington after his shot in the BBC's lamentable 'comedy' Coupling.Strangely, the action scenes are leaden, lacking the panache of the Errol Flynn-like movies of yesteryear. These needed better editing and, in fact, the slow second act could have done with some judicious pruning, easily losing fifteen to twenty minutes off the running time.However, all in all, great fun that rises head and shoulders over the rest of the summer's disappointing releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a few months ago i stumbled across the poster for this little ditty. and without a second thought, lumped it down to being rubbish. so months later when it comes out to rave reviews, i was suprised to say the least. a good pirate movie? never. but i went to see it. and what can i say, i enjoyed it immensily. a good old fashioned pirate yarn for the modern audience could be difficult to get off the ground, but this film has everything a story needs. drama, intrigue, scares, action, and most unexpectedly, comedy. this movie is as funny as it is adventurous. the script on paper may not be so funny, but the actors add their own humourous invention to it. with johnny depp stealing every frame he's ever in. with his drunken swagger and delivery of lines, he becomes the king of comedy. the most refreshing character seen in years, and by far the most memorable ting about this picture. with decent support and a thrilling storyline pirates comes out storming. a tad head scratching at times due to lots and lots going on on screen. but the overall enjoyment of it seems to blot all that out.oscar nom for johnny depp? lets hope so</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that Pirates was an awesome movie it had plenty of adventure and action. Ok so maybe it was a little lengthy, but so your seeing a movie, you should expect some of your time to be wasted. Of Course, Johnny Depp was the most experienced actor there, and Rush, and he did carry the movie a little, but besides that it was altogether a great movie. I've seen it six times now and counting but thats only because it was a good enough movie for me to see 6 times in a row. But all of the chicks out there have to agree Orlando and Depp were hotties!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun film. It's the first time I've seen Depp do a crowd-pleasing lead. His Jack Sparrow is pretty much standard Deppian posturing which really works for me, but I was surprised to see it as the centerpiece of a Summer blockbuster. Between Scissorhands and Fear and Loathing, he always seemed to me at least as smart as the script, but in this case he pretty much soars above it and delivers his lines with a real relish for camp.The rest of the film was sorta okay, which is saying a lot since I generally loath the work of The House of Bruckheimer. Like a lot of other 2.5 hour braindead epics, this one could have edited down for time. It's not Bergman for heaven's sake - the characters beyond Depp's and Rush's (and theirs are all style) are almost cheap cardboard cutouts. The advantage of stock characters is supposed to be economy.The story is excellent compared to general summer fair, especially in this summer plagued by stories ripped from comics, old TV shows, reality TV, and, in Bruckheimer's other Summer film, a bunch of cop show cliches mashed together. It's not so complex a story that 2.5 hours is necessary.If producer Bruckheimer has a signature shot it's either 1) that much overused A-Team stunt explosion in the middle ground while a person is catapulted away from it in the fore, arms and legs kicking, or 2) special effect shots THAT NEVER END. In almost any Bruckheimer film there is an effect or stunt that makes you say `wow' and you want to see it again, like the melting heads in Raiders of the Lost Arc once did. With Bruckheimer you can count on seeing that effect over and over and over again during the course of the film until every drop of techno magic is drained.The shot of the undead pirates walking on the ocean floor was great. It is exactly the sort of imaginative storytelling that has been lacking in many recent blockbuster films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[I saw this in the theater, YMMV]First off, I have to say I am a fan of the ride at Disneyworld and looked forward to the movie. Although there were four or five different parts of the movie I remember from the ride, the movie is not just scenes from the ride strung together inchoerently. Instead, we slowly learn the story of Captain Jack Sparrow. For a movie aimed at teenage girls with the inclusion of Orlando Bloom and a feel-good fairy-tale story ending, it is suprisingly good.Finally, I have to say that I was suprised at the end of the movie to see this was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. If I had known that, I would never have gone. He makes terrible, over the top action flicks like Days of Thunder, Bad Boys, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon and Blackhawk Down. And in retrospect, his grubby fingerprints can be seen in the overly-long action sequences. The cute computer trick of having the actors move in and out of the moonlight to look whole then like a skeleton is neat the first five minutes of the final fight. But, as in all Bruckheimer movies, the action for action's sake is dragged on far too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to watch Pirates of the Caribbean I really wasn't expecting much. I had heard about its success in the US, but the movie didnt really appeal to me, I was never "into" pirates when i was young, and I don't tend to like films set about 200 years ago, I usually find them slow and boring. However, was I pleasantly surprised. From the moment the movie started, till the moment it ended, I truly enjoyed myself. Not a single moment of this film was boring, and although the film is slightly long you barely notice it. In fact, I have seen this movie several times, and i still didn't find it even slightly tedious. Its got all the qualities of a top movie: fast pace, excellent script, excellent actors, excellent set, excellent action and excellent special effects. The acting was superb. Needless to say, Johnny Depp stole the show with his hilarious rendition of Jack Sparrow, however I think all the actors and actresses were great, and I mean ALL of them, Bloom, Knightly, Rush, and even the smaller parts were perfectly played. There was not a single poorly acted part in the whole film, contrary to pretty much every other summer film that has come out this year. Therefore, I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. The reason why it doesnt get a 10 is because, Pirates Of The Caribbean is not a deep, meaningful story set out to send a serious message to the audience, etc. all that stuff. Its just a really, really, really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Its out there to entertain the audience, and it does a flawless job in doing so. Films seriously don't get as enjoyable as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is seriously the best movie I have ever seen! Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is completely brilliant, incredibly sexy, and hilarious! You can't take your eyes off the screen when you see it, and I loved it so much that I saw it 4 times already! And after all, it is over 2 hours long, so you get your bang for your buck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirate movies are afloat again....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a big fan of the Swashbuckler movies,and like Jonny Depp, so rushed off to see this one as soon as it opened. Basically people, if you are only going to see one film this summer, POTC has to be it. It's exciting, funny and action packed, with a wonderful cast. But the stand out performance has to be from the wonderfully unorthadox Jonny Depp. He could have played Jack Sparrow like any other dashing rouge, but in true Depp style, he adds his own unique characteristics and make Sparrow a wonderfully funny, charming (and lets face it girls,damn sexy)character.In every scene he's not in, your just waiting for him to come back on screen. He steals every scene he's in. This film is just whats needed after the overblown self important junk thats come out this summer. POTC is a great way to spend a couple of hours. It didn't even feel that long to me.....FAB!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp saves this shallow piece of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's based on a theme park. What can you expect?Nothing much. And I didn't expect much at all.And it was worse than I expected.Reasons:Endless sight gags. No depth. Predictable. Monotonous sword-fighting scenes. Too long. Pretty much like every pirate movie ever made.Things that save it from being a Gigli:Keira Knightly. Johnny Depp!!! Geoffrey Rush (One of my favourite actors), who didn't get enough screen time.Some good acting, but just horrible otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparrow is in, Stifler is out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dragged to see Pirates of the Caribbean, and I agreed to go only because I figured no matter how awful the movie is, Geoffrey Rush always gives a good performance and Orlando Bloom is easy on the eyes. After that show, I wanted to watch it again right away. I settled for the next day. Since then I've seen it four more times and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. I have never, ever been this enchanted by any movie. I resist action/adventure movies, I cannot stand any movie that involves a knife/sword/blade of any kind, I especially don't like Pirate movies and prior to this, was not a fan of Johnny Depp. This movie has become a very distinct exception and I encourage anyone whose film style prefers Sleepless In Seattle to Indiana Jones to give this movie a chance - don't miss out on a wonderful time.I live near Disney World and the ride the movie is based on is one of my all-time favorites. For those of you familiar with the ride, I am happy to report that the film captures the whole spirit of the ride: a good story and told tongue-in-cheek. For latter quality, we can thank Johnny Depp for that. I remember thinking that the words "Walt Disney Pictures" and "Johnny Depp" do not sound right together, but after seeing this I realize just how important an actor like Depp is to Disney right now. For me, he brought that element of magic to the film that recreated the magic of the theme park ride it is based on. Had Disney insisted on a more conservative actor or performance, this movie would have definitely been lost to Davy Jones' Straight To Video locker.All the peformances are good but Depp's performance is by far the most memorable, interesting and scene-chewing of any film I have ever seen. And I personally think it takes a lot of talent and possibly true madness to upstage Geoffrey Rush. Keith Richards, Pepe LePew, Dudley Moore's 'Arthur', drunken Dean Martin - every description of Depp's performance is adequate in giving some kind of an idea of what to expect. A new standard has been set! To illustrate what I mean, after living in Captain Jack Sparrow's adventures for awhile, I went to see American Wedding. Somehow, post-Sparrow, Stifler and his (mis)adventures seemed kind of... boring.If there are a few bad things I can say about this movie is that it is so much fun, such an original character that I generally have been bored by every movie/performance I've seen since then and b) it's going to be a lonnnng hard wait for the DVD and sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all, GREAT cast, Unstoppable action, Perfect dialog and perfect plot. And the MUSIC! Just spectacular. It was refreshing to see a movie of this caliber make it so big WITHOUT blood and guts and sex and foul language! It is just an awesome movie in all regards. I have seen this movie 5 times! Johnny Depp absolutely steals the show (I love him!) as Captain Sparrow. The actor who plays Captain Barbosa...was excellent as well. This movie is for all ages and I will buy it when it comes out on video for sure...it'll be right next to other 'classics' in my collection including A Beautiful Mind and Fiddler on the Roof. Just spectacular in every way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Going Back for a Third Helping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Pirates of the Caribbean' is one of those movies that don't quench your thirst with just one viewing. You have to go back several times, just to keep up that same happy feeling you have when you leave the theater. I still haven't had enough of it, myself. But I've only seen it eight times. And it's the best I've seen in a long time.First off, the cast is better than excellent. Never once at all did I feel another actor/actress could have done a better job than the three main characters. Keira Knightley depicts the beautiful Elizabeth Swann, a gorgeous young woman who still manages to *use* the brain she was given, unlike too many damsels in distress on the big screen. Orlando Bloom is coming into the acting world with flying colors. He portrayed Will Turner in a way that every teenage girl cannot help but fall in love. Will is an extremely rugged blacksmith, and yet a hopeless romantic all at the same time. Many people take his `I would die for her' line too lightly, mostly because of its overuse and the fact that it directly precedes another of Johnny Depp's hilarious comments as Captain Jack Sparrow.Speaking of which, Johnny Depp completely stole the show away from anyone within a ten mile radius. Every line that left his lips split the entire audience's sides, even if it was not meant to do so. I have to admit, I had never once seen one of his movies previously (I'm not a fan of most strange/gory movies), but after watching his performance in `Pirates', I will never doubt the man. He *was* Captain Jack Sparrow. I never saw Johnny Depp anywhere on screen. Only Jack, from his most comical walk and slurred speech, down to the blinking of his eyes. I would LOVE more than anything to rave about Geoffrey Rush's performance as Captain Barbossa, but I am at a loss for words (and space). All you need to know is that he is the definitive pirate of this movie.Of course I could go on and on about the realism of everything: sets (stunning), costumes (brilliant) and make-up (just look at Johnny's eye-liner). But what blew me away almost as much as the outstanding acting was the score. I've always been a lover of Klaus Badelt, but the music in this movie alone was a huge reason I HAD to go back and see it again. My wallet thanks me for buying the soundtrack instead. The music reminded me much of The Lord of the Rings music (also tremendous score) even though it sounds nothing like it. But Mr. Badelt captured `piracy' itself in this music and it'll be stuck in my head for a long while.The film did seem to run a bit long, but it was worth it to see the characters in that extra screen time. It is oh so good to the last drop. No one I've met has regretted going to see this movie and I recommend it to everyone. It is action-packed, very comical, and is worth seeing over and over again. If you enjoy every element that makes a great movie, Pirates of the Caribbean is definitely for you.My rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want to be a pirate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has probably made its way to my personal 10 best of all time. It is light hearted and funny yet has a few moments that really make you think (like Jack's two line summery of what the real rules of life are). The acting, costumes, dialog, and special effects are all first rate. This is the sort of film that you will want to see again and again. Depp and his excellent portrayal of Cpt. Jack Sparrow pretty much makes the movie, though Rush's Captain Barbossa was simply amazing. This is simply one of those magical films where good actors, are combined with an excellent script and solid direction. This one has classic written all over it.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie the summer was waiting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Pirates of the Caribbean, all I can say is "wow". This movie is the first in a long time that I have walked out of saying "That movie was awesome." Usually it is "cool, not bad, pretty good". I was wondering when I would see Pirates again, I loved it.It has been criticized mainly due to its sloppy direction and unnecessary length. Both points are justified...it is a wee bit too long, and the entire film felt somewhat choppy. However, these are both minor and forgotten when the action begins and Johnny Depp takes the screen. Depp is spectacular, and dominates the screen when he is present. His costume and makeup are unbelievable, and fit perfectly with his character. Geoffrey Rush was not bad at all in his role as the pirate captain, but I could not help feeling as though Orlando Bloom was somewhat out of his element.I feel this movie is what the summer needed, it is a terrific film. The plot is somewhat shaky and doesn't hold up throughout the entire movie, but it sure is entertaining. Even if it is not your favorite genre, Depp's performance makes the price of admission well worth it. Very, very fun movie.9 / 10</fullReview>

Just as I was getting interested, I looked at my watch and an hour had already passed. This overly long exposition makes the movie drag.Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush playfully ham it up perfectly. And it is nice to see "Legolas" (of The Lord of the Rings films) have more screen time. Orlando is too cute.I hope that the Disney folks will shorten the next one considerably.</fullReview>

Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley expertly portray their characters, as well, with completely believable performances. The writers deserve praise as well; I've found quotable, amusing lines in every scene. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys good, clean fun (very little gore, very little language, and all of the romance is clean!! It's barely PG-13...

If anybody thinks she was bad its not because she was "the girl" in the movie. The special effects were beautifully done. I loved every part of the movie and i dont think any thing could change. Jack Sparrow must be the best one in that movie. I didn't see this movie because i was into pirates, because i always hated them. But because it looked awesome.

		<shortDescription>Solid gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: **** (out of *****)Every year has a hidden treasure, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is 2003's. When I saw the name of Jerry Bruckheimer attached to this a few months ago, I expected a no-brainer. Well, I am very happy to confirm that all the positive advance word you'll have heard regarding the film is true. Hulk and T3 are both solid but leave you with an empty feeling. Pirates doesn't. The writers of Shrek, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have come up with a believable pirate story that is full of wit and one-liners, never taking itself seriously while not being obviously camp. I guess you could call it your typical story of saving the damsel in distress from the pirates, except there's a major twist. Pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is jailed for several crimes he committed on an island in the Caribbean governed by British governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Later, when a group of "evil" pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) capture the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) tries to rescue her (well, he's had a crush on her since he was young?). But he realises he can't do this on his own, so he helps get Sparrow out of prison in exchange for the pirate's help. Both are soon to find out that Barbossa's motives for capturing Elizabeth are more complicated than expected.Pirates differs from your average blockbuster in three ways: One, the script may not be a work of literature, but it never cheats the audience's intelligence. Two, patriotism and manipulation are not overdone. And three, the visuals are good, but they don't take centre stage.If Pirates wasn't a little bit too long, it would actually be almost perfect. Still, there are many things about Pirates that I can't praise enough. One of these is the fine cast. Johnny Depp's slurred Cockney accent may cause some of the film's fine one-liners to be missed, but, with a performance that is almost as camp as it is cocky &amp; energetic, his importance to the film cannot be underestimated. Nearly everything revolves around him, and he doesn't let the proceedings down.He doesn't overshadow everyone else though. Geoffrey Rush is suitably menacing and chilling, while the youngsters don't disappoint either. Orlando Bloom has built on the strengths that we saw in the Lord of the Rings films and shows that he is more than capable of handling more singular roles. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth doesn't fall into the category of being too tough or too weak, instead a nice mixture of both. Knightley finds the perfect way of playing her character, and it doesn't hurt that she looks great as well. British comedy fans will spot Jack Davenport of Coupling and Mackenzie Crook of The Office (playing a pirate with a CG-"eye"; you'll see what I mean when you watch the film), neither of whom are out of place.Pirates has many nice touches. Several scenes that you think will finish `by the book' suddenly become more compelling scenes or battles. Pirates keeps you hooked because something good or great always happens when you least expect it. Plus, even if stunt doubles were required for some of the swordfights, that doesn't prevent them from being entertaining (although I personally preferred the ship-to-ship battles). And, for those who care, there are some clever nods to the film's theme park inspiration.This film has single-handedly restored my faith in the Hollywood blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Summer's Summer Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be well the summer movie of the year. The audiences at least seem to prefer it to Terminator 3, or Matrix. I saw it a few days after the release here in Israel, and the theater was much more populated than with the previous summer movies, and the reaction of the public was more sympathetic. I think the reason is that the film does not pretend at all to be more than it is - Disney-level entertainment. When you enter a Disney park you leave out any big cultural experience expectation, you get in childhood mood and enjoy the ride. Do the same with 'Pirates', and you may enjoy it. Backed up by some decent acting, and with special effects that will fight for the Oscar with the Terminator stuff, the film is decent entertainment - probably some of best you can expect from the US studios this summer. 7/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pirate life for me? No, thank you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's ultimately very romantic to be a pirate, it appears... Or so dear Keira, oops, Elizabeth, would like us to believe. She read a lot of books about it. And she can kick everyone's butt too, even though she wears the painful corsets from time to time. Actually her dialogs and behavior reminded me of another sea-located movie's heroine. Which was just as improbable and illogical as this one. Every minute Keira was on screen, i was afraid she'd burst out into another Freud discussion. Thankfully, she didn't, and, i guess, Gore Verbinsky thinks now we should be grateful at least for this.OK, OK, Gore. We've got it. Thank you.As for her acting - did anyone notice that in her previous movie, Bend It Like Beckham, the critics praised mostly her co-star and the actual heroine Parminder Nagra? Didn't it ring the bell of warning to no one? And look who's now hot in Hollywood! The irony of being blond... Apparently it's not all that tough as Reese Witherspoon would like us to believe.The same goes for Orlando Bloom. Don't get me wrong. He's cute. He knows how to move in the frame. He knows sword fighting and he knows to shoot arrows and wear a blond wig and pointy ears gracefully (not exactly in the same movie, but you've got the point ;)). He may be the most intelligent and thoughtful human being on Earth, i don't know him personally. But his talents ON THE SCREEN are unfortunately restricted to the ones mentioned above. He's given his share of pretty amusing lines and he fails to deliver them to amuse the audience, except for his fans (who were absent from my screening). With his each new movie the directors try to find the acting talent beneath his clothes, so he becomes less and less... erh... burdened with costume detailes (check the set pictures from Troy). Maybe they've become pretty desperate. The next time they'll try to look behind his Troyan skirt, i guess. I won't mind, surely ;).The less said about the poor Governor and Commandor - the better. The same can be said for the rest of the cast with 2 exceptions, the special effects, which left me totally unimpressed (though one good point - they didn't overshadow the movie, but, alas, there was not that much to overshadow). The direction and cinematography were decent, but nothing worth crowing about. The fights were OK, i guess, with some actually funny moments (the forks were priceless). Though some showdowns were staged simply for the sake of staging (like the duel between Sparrow and Turner with the tagline "let's try to do this shtick, sounds impressing").But the main problem of the movie is that it simply overstayed its welcome. At least half an hour could've been left in the editing room with a couple of the unnecessary turns (not twists, just turns, back and forth, like a dog after its own tale). And the ending... OK, i'd better stop right now. Oh, mine...But to the only 2 BIG (though not big enough) pluses: Depp and Rush. They were great. Simply put - great. But, considering their reputation and the previous work, it didn't surprised me. I only wished they were given more screen time. The rare actors which, while having a ball with the camp they have to be in, can share their fun with the audience. And make this camp way more deserving than it has any right to be.Ultimately The Pirates isn't a really bad movie, mostly because of those two wonderful talents mentioned above, just not a particularly good one.And this summer, as i see, we don't have much choice. It's a pity we don't deserve better. And the thought "Come on, it could've been worse!" doesn't help. IMHO, of course...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not for me. If you base this movie on other pirate movies such and Cut throat Island or Treasure Planet, then think again. This movie rocks. This summers movies have been abit light on the plot but this one is great. All I have to say is go see it for yourself and enjoy. Of course there is the obvious reflection to the Disneyland ride, i.e. the song. Johnny Depp give another great performance. It is will be as memorable as Edward Scissorhands and Benny and Joon. One thing for the Disney studios if they make a sequel, please don't ruin a good movie with a piece of garbage sequel like the Robocop series or Speed 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love pirate adventure and Curse of the Black Pearl seemed to have it for the first half hour or so... but as usual, Bruckheimer's bloated action sequences with little substance or credibility quickly became exhausting. Johnny Depp's performance is stand out. The rest of the cast is outshined by their costumes and makeup(Geoffrey Rush by his teeth). I could talk about the basic lack of interest created by expositions and explanations given for every motive... but I do enjoy pirates and the 18th century fare so I give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I have been on the ride 'Pirates of the Carribean' at both Disney World Florida and Disneyland Paris I was very intrigued to see this movie since it is an adaptation of this classic ride.It is absolutely great! Its nice to see something original for a change rather than yet another sequel or 'superhero' movie. The sword fighting sequences are wicked and the special effects of the cursed pirates add a great eeriness to the film. All the cast are great but Johnny Depp probably steals the film in his hilarious portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow.This is a 12A in the UK and pretty suitable for everyone although I wouldn't recommend taking a child under 7 as they may find some of the scenes very distressing. Don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little bit skeptical when my girlfriend and I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean...not being a big summer movie fan, I braced myself for huge explosions with very little plot development and intelligence. But I was greatly surprised and genuinely riveted to the screen, especially to Johnny Depp's performance. Had anyone else portrayed Jack Sparrow, the film would merely have been OK, but Depp gave the Captain a swagger that few could achieve. He walked, talked, and handled himself like a rock star (like Keith Richards on a boat!) and provided humor not in fart jokes or lewd behavior (generally the type of "comedy" seen in summer movies) but in style and voice inflection. Is it an Oscar caliber film? The answer is no, but Pirates will still provide good, funny entertainment this summer season to those who want to turn off their brains for a few hours and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl the second week it opened. The theater was packed, which I found unusual since the last movie we had gone to, The Matrix: Reloaded, was completely empty except us. (I figured out why by the end of each)I had little interest in watching this movie going into the theater. I figured it would be all action or boring plot.I'd have to say this movie was just the right mixture of action, comedy, love, and fantasy, to make viewing a very pleasurable activity for all ages. Johnny Depp is great as a pirate, and the character is deep enough to make me wish both leading men "got the girl" at the end of the movie. Too bad there's only one leading woman.The authenticity of the dialogue, look, and feel of this movie is about 5/6 believable, but that's close enough. The special effects are pretty cool and they aren't overpowering the whole movie which is good. I thought the casting was very well done also.The slight twist at the climax of the movie was almost unexpected.I just don't feel the father would have reacted that way at the very end. Not in those days he wouldn't have... public hangings were a family event... But it does give the movie a somewhat happy ending.I went in thinking I would review this movie about a 2 out of 10, but once I started opening my mind to it, I came out rating this movie 7.5 out of 10.At least one good movie was made this year!</fullReview>

Johnny and Orli are just fantastic -- what hot blooded girl *couldn't* just watch them for two and a half hours? Not to mention Johnny's spectacular acting in this film -- he was brilliant. But it *was* a good movie. The script was wonderful. The dialogue was absolutely fabulous, so quick and witty. The film was also visually stunning, a real tribute to new movie-making technologies. As for the sfx, I need only point to the underwater march. Two very difficult elements -- cgi underwater and cgi skeletons, mastered simultaneously. Overall, I think this is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It certainly outshines the overhyped Matrix: Reloaded and gives X2 a run for its money. And neither of those movies had Johnny or Orli. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie is excellent. I thought it would be good, but I was happily surprised to see that it was excellent. I went to see it b/c of Orlando Bloom who is also in Lord of The Rings movies. But I must say that Mr. Depp stole the show. The directors and actors did a wonderful job. What a great story. I hope to see a sequel or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glorious return to a lost genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people may be unfortunate to remember the 1995 Geena Davis/Renny Harlin disaster "Cutthroat Island," a bloated and stale attempt to revive an old sub-genre, that of the swashbuckling adventure film. Long dormant after Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks hung up their tights and rapiers, the genre was due for a comeback. Now, much like "Moulin Rouge!" and "Chicago" revitalized the sleeping form of the musical, pirate films have been rediscovered in the form of "Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl."At a British colony in the Caribbean, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter to the governor, is being wooed by two men: the proper and stoic naval officer Norrington (Jack Davenport) and the unassuming yet sincere swordsmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). But courtship has to wait when the infamous pirate ship the Black Pearl, headed by the vile Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), invades the colony and kidnaps Elizabeth. Will's only hope to save her is to free the Black Pearl's former captain, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a dangerously unstable and hardly trustworthy fellow. Things are further complicated when it turns out that the pirates have all been cursed for stealing Aztec gold and that moonlight reveals their true state: that of rotting corpses.This film is wonderfully entertaining. All of the performers give fantastic performances, from Knightley's strong-willed and curious Elizabeth to Bloom's resourceful and determined Will. Plus, it's great to see Bloom without elf ears. The best performance by far is Johnny Depp, giving one of his wildest and strongest performances of his career. His Captain Jack is half-way between Keith Richards and insanity (which may not be too far), an amalgamation of swishes, slurred words, and blustery bravado. Depp just doesn't steal every scene he's in: he robs it at sword point.The director has a hand for sweeping adventure, as well. Gore Verbinski is best known for directing the supremely creepy "The Ring," and some of the moody hand that guided that film is present here, as well. But Verbinski knows how to handle the genre and his actors very well, everything coming together in a strong wind that sweeps the audience along with it. The movie is full of characters but never overcrowded. It is swarming with details, but it is never tedious. The script, like the film, hearkens back to the witty repartee of early swashbuckler films, which may sound laughable on paper but makes perfect sense coming out of the characters.The most striking thing about the film is the CGI involved in rendering the skeletal pirates. While there are several scenes of fully-skeletal pirates, the most impressive use of this effect is during a fight in a cave, where the pirates dart in and out of moon light with only part of their bodies transformed. After the offense to cinema that was "Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones" and after seeing the fantastic effects WETA pulled off for "The Two Towers", I had lost faith in Industrial Light &amp; Magic's ability to inspire wonder. They have outdone themselves on this picture.Despite the entertainment value of the film, there are a few minor drawbacks. At almost two-and-a-half hours, the film is slightly long and could easily have been trimmed down by 30 minutes. Similarly, several minor characters, such as Zoe Saldana's black female pirate Anamaria, are intriguing and sadly underused. These are minor complaints, however, and they do not detract much from the overall enjoyment of the film."Pirates of the Caribbean" is sure to inspire other directors to helm their own voyages into swashbuckling adventure. Here's hoping that they all turn out to be as thrilling and enjoyable as this one. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Whether you're a fan of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, comedies, or action, You're sure to love this movie! Johnny Depp delivers the comedic role of Captain Jack Sparrow, as Orlando Bloom delivers the role of Will Turner, a blacksmith in love with a wealthier young woman, Elizabeth Swann. This movie is packed with comedy, suspense, and excellent acting. It's a must see for all movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I have seen this year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am a 44 year old male who cannot ever remember seeing a pirate movie that I liked. It is an engaging movie with good direction, writing, costume and special effects. The near 2 1/2 hours fly by with good pacing. (Watch all the credits because there is a surprise at the end.)I would not say that I am fanatically attached to anyone involved in the production. I would say that it should be nominated for best costume and special effects. Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance but he is unlikely to be nominated for a film of this genre. It is the first Disney film that I have liked since the Lion King and undoutedly the first nonanimated film that I have liked by Disney since I was a child. My wife also enjoyed the film and our adolescent daughters did not think it was cool to go the film with us, but I would suggest that it would be appropriate for most all children over the age of 10. It is a far superior form of entertainment compared to its namesake theme park ride!I doubt that the Haunted Mansion can rise to this level when it hits the screens at Thanksgiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect Summer movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to love this movie. When I knew that this movie was coming into theaters I knew I was going to love it just because it's a pirate movie. This movie is what every summer movie should be about. It has action, a lot of laughs, a cute adventurous story and settings, and lots of fun. The characters are just lovely, and Johnny Depp is just too hilarious. It was worth watching this movie just because of his character and the way he transformed himself into "Jack Sparrow." This priate is such a genuine guy. He is smart and funny, and above all good looking. He made me laugh every time he said something. This movie is so much better than Bad Boys II which I thought had a really stupid plot. On top of that, it was too dragged out, and even though some of the scenes make you laugh, they are way too exaggerated to the point where you stop laughing and wonder how easily amused the rest of the audience can be just because they sound like they are talking like to gay lovers in a public record store while being filmed and while the rest of the people in the store are watching them. Well, anyway. Like I said, the cast was terrific, and this is now my favorite adventure-movie. The fact that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie helped in the creation of such a daring vision of a priate movie. I don't think there is one action movie that I do not love by this guy.Pirates of the Carribean had spectacular special effects, and the landscapes that they chose to film on were just too beautiful. And Keira Knightley is just one smokin' hot brunette. She has the most beautiful face in the whole wide world. I would have given anything to have been Will Turner at the end of their adventure.</fullReview>

He steals the show and you leave wanting more of him.

		<fullReview>It's pure Disney. A family fantastical adventure. That does not mean it is a good film. It's okay. There is plenty of spectacle and color. Johnny Depp is fun but needs more material to work with. He had a great character but the script held him back. Geoffrey Rush had the same problem; not enough material to explode off the screen.If you have ever been on the Disney Theme park ride Pirates of the Caribbean then you can see the spin off. The dog holding the chains as well as the prisoners sticking their heads out the bars. Novelty for sure. There are some beautiful shots of the ships. The ghost ship, The Black Pearl was beautiful to gaze upon with it's black torn sails and hull looming in the fog. The film is full of edited fight scenes using quite a few close ups. It's all for fun and the audience seemed to enjoy the yarn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the best movie I've seen this summer (well, this and Finding Nemo.) I came into it just to see Depp's Keith Richards impersonating, and I took a lot more out of it than I ever thought I would. Fun, fast-paced, with interesting characters and a good storyline. What more could you want from a summer movie? Honestly, it doesn't feel like you're sitting in a theatre for 2 1/2 hours. It probably could have been cut down by half an hour here and there -- but the movie never dragged on or was boring.The acting was great! Johnny Depp was incredible as always! Geoffrey Rush was very good, and Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom had great performances also. The movie has everything -- action, adventure, humor, romance. Not to mention nice special effects. I was particularly impressed that the movie wasn't sexist, either. Keira Knightley's character kicked butt alongside everyone else, and even the guys in the movie were held hostage at one point or another.I can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting the only good part to be Orlando Bloom. Instead, I got the best plot for a movie since... well actually since Lord of the Rings, but that wasn't too long ago so it might not mean anything;) What I mean to say is, Pirates of the Caribbean is fabulous. It is truly what the word action packed was made for. This movie is entirely unpredictable with false endings all over the place. Whenever you think the movie is about to end, it surprises you in ways unimaginable. To add to that, the casting was fabulous. Johnny Depp was the star of the show, portraying the crazed "Captain Jack Sparrow" ("That would have to be the worst pirate I've ever heard of"). For being over 40, Depp was very good looking as well;). Geoffery Rush was perfectly casted as Captain Barbossa of the Black Pearl. He created a perfect mix of a villain and a poor tortured soul. Keira Knightley played the part of Elizabeth Swann wonderfully. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook were incredible as the goofy pair of pirates Pintel and Ragetti, respectively.Okay, now onto Orlando Bloom. While I love him dearly, he is clearly not cut out for the hero role. He plays a much better sidekick. Still, he played the part of Will Turner to the best of his ability, which is still remarkable. It is very obvious that playing the elf Legolas in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy has made him a much better actor. Whenever there was a fight scene he pulled out the Legolas moves he acquired while filming the trilogy. There's also the added bonus of him being so hot!:)Having seen this movie 3 times, I hope you will take me as a credible source, and go see this movie. At the very least, rent it when it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean has totally became one of the best movies of the summer for many reasons.Johnny Depp was definitly the best choice to play Jack Sparrow, and the performance from all the actors was astonishing. The sets and visual FX where outstanding,... ILM should definitly get credit in the next academy awards. The movie is very entertaining. It has out of this world action and a rich love story. The pirates' performances are truly fantastic, giving the movie a sense of what pirates were really like.The plot is overall fantastic, even though the movie is based on Disney's theme park ride. but the movie truly sticks to the origin of the story. Anyways, I truly recommend others that haven't seen it, to go have a good time watching this movie.It is a blast. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS is entertainment!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I have read some reviews from some 'highbrow' critics, punching holes in the storyline, commenting on the FX and length of the movie, sniffing at the 'over the top acting' - well folks, I normally don't enjoy movies at the theatre, even sitting through them at home when they come out on DVD is torture, (I can't sit still that long!) I am NOT a young female fan who went to see the 'hotties', I have never been a Johnny Depp fan, I usually HATE Disney movies, and I, like many, thought the Pirate film genre has had it's day. So it was only a family birthday party that got me to this one in the first place.Well, I am sure glad because I have never enjoyed anything so much in years - the acting, the scenery, the story, the costumes - all great fun! I have seen it several times since and every time I see something I missed before - and some of the so-called storyline holes and unexplained things make sense once I saw it again. This was great entertainment, pure and simple, and although I don't know if I will like Johnny Depp in anything else, he was THE MAN to play Jack Sparrow. I heard he was given free rein (although reluctantly at first) by the Powers That Be to flesh out this character - that was their best decision because Jack Sparrow stole the show. Geoffrey Rush WAS the way I always picture a crusty old Pirate Captain, he did a great job.From 8 to 80 - enjoy this hilarious romp - I didn't expect the humor but it works great! And although I am sure the pompous imperial wizards of Oscardom will not recognize this flick for anything except maybe costumes - the music was excellent, Rush deserves a nod, and Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar for this character's development. Awesome job, buddy!!</fullReview>

He's great.Kneightly is a sweet slender surprise as the girl, Legolas there does a decent job but does have a block of wood edge to him that he might wanna work on. Of course you have Geoffrey Rush chewing the scenary as the Pirate Barbossa-he was about the best thing here along w/ Depp.You don't get much into the characters or plotting, save for what's essential for the flick to work, you enjoy the swashbuckling and F/X, heck it's a good summer flick, a retro hit ala 'Mark of Zorro' and the like.*** outta ****.

		<fullReview>A pirate's life for ME! This movie was truly a FUN ride! Okay, enough shouting. See this movie; it works on all the great movie-making levels. Depp was magnificent - as naturally anyone would imagine that knows his work. I'm jealous I'm not him, but that's between me and my therapist to work out. Bloom shows just as much skill in his craft as in Lord of the RIngs, and it always seems to work for him that his characters are masters of their trade. He just has that look of wisdom beyond his years... I guess. Knightley... quite a different role than 'Bend it Like Beckam' but also a good strong female role. And she succeeds to be the damsel in distress that can kick some butt. Disney delivers as only it can and WATCH for some scenes from the actual disney ride. Brought back those childhood memories from my favorite in Disney and now this: my favorite DIsney film. I wasn't sure if i was going to mean that, but I really do. I just hate it when people build up a movie, getting my expectations so high, so I'll try to restrain. Great cast. Smooth direction. Disney elements (music, fun, and plot). And Jack Sparrow ROCKS as the pirate character in this film. 10 out of 10 for this MUST see.thank you</fullReview>

Granted the movie is a little long, but all of the time is well used, and there for an inportant reason. Poor Orlando Bloom was a bit out of his league, but fantastic none the less. Keria Knightley is fantastic and so is Geoffry Rush. There is not one thing I could say about this movie, but GREAT! I was entertained the whole way through, and Johnny Depp kept me laughing.

		<fullReview>Just saw it last night and I've got to say, what a fun movie! Lots of humor and adventure, an interesting (if at times overly-convoluted) plot, and an over-the-top performance by Johnny Depp, who unquestionably carries the film. I have heard that Depp consciously modeled his performance on Keith Richards, remarking that pirates were the rock stars of their day. Well, it works like gangbusters! The support is good too, though nowhere near Depp's level. And the female lead is certainly easy on the eyes. The special effects, particularly as regards the ghost pirates, are good as well. Overall, this is the kind of film you can just sit back and enjoy, without having to think too much if at all. And well worth the time and money at a first-run theater. Hell, I had so much fun watching it that I didn't even mind the blatant Disney commercialism underlying the venture...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the ohter reviewers who said Johnny Depp made the movie. The rest of the cast put forth mmemorable performances. I give it a 7/10 but without Depp I can see it possibly garnering a 5 or 6. I liked Keira Knightley in "Bend It Like Beckham" but she didn't do anything for me in this one--though she "looked" stunning :) Orlando Bloom need something. Maybe more engergy or a enthusiasm, I'm not sure.Some of the fight scenes got a little silly but for the most part they were concise and not too drawn out. However, one idea did strike me as odd. If the bad pirates could not be killed because they were undead...then why didn't the good characters help them lift curse, thereby taking away their "powers" and making them mortal? Anyway, if you like the big screen see it now. If not, wait for it to be on cable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good surprize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firsth thing i thought when i first heard when about this movie was that this will be just a usual action. Action like those we watches every week. I saw many movies for pirates before. When i firsth saw it... It was much better than i expected. I gave it 8/10 cuz it was predictable at moments. Fight scenes mostly, and some of them was too long (that scene with Will and Jack in Will's working place for example). Music was excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hot actors, strong woman, great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was by far one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. Orlando Bloom is so hot, even with long hair. Not only that but he is a great actor with an even better future. Johnny Deep was great as Jack Sparrow and I loved his representation of a pirate. Orlando's character, Will Turner, is the perfect man. Sweet, caring, kind, passionate, strong, dependable, his own man, and a skilled craftsmen and swordsman. If only I could find a guy like that. I was really impressed that Keira Knightley's character, Elizabeth Swann, was portrayed as such a strong and independent person. Usually female characters in movies set in this era are displayed as weak and in need of a man to save her from every little problem. And while Elizabeth did need some rescuing she didn't just stand by and wait for it to happen. She helped in the fighting and even at one point even did the rescuing of herself and Jack. This is a great movie that left wanting to see it again even as I left the theater. This is one movie I will definitely buy as soon as it is released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New Classic Voyage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is a swashbuckling adventure in the flavor of the Golden Days of Hollywood. It took me back to the days of Errol Flynn in "Captain Blood." It had plenty of the high seas action, just enough creepy mystery and a healthy dose of contemporary humor. I agree that Johnny Depp stole the film with his memorable approach to Captain Sparrow. But, it was only because he made such brave acting choices that he rises above this otherwise gifted cast. Everyone is cast perfectly and the director sets the tone beautifully from beginning to end. The real hero, however, in this film is the script. It launches us on a hair-raising voyage full of intrigue, conflict, false bravado, and laughter that doesn't let up until the final frame. How rare that a film is both entertaining and family friendly in the tradition of the old adventure classics!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how critics cannot give this a better rating than they have. I haven't had this much fun at a movie since "Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring" (all-time favorite movie, by the way). Johnny Depp, an unexpected surprise, makes the film, and the all-star cast along with him just makes things even better. Twists and turns in the plot are more numerous than the Disney ride itself, and I am amazed that the script writers created such a genuine article from just a ride! By the way, go buy the soundtrack now! I haven't heard music like this for a long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Depp's Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was a lot of fun, though it dragged on for about a half-an-hour too long, and the ending seemed altogether unrealistic. Most of the fight scenes were too long and I had a hard time believing that mortal sailors could give undead pirates such an extended fight. And the ending should've had Bloom and Knightley joining Depp as he sailed away with his new ship. But all that aside, Johnny Depp gives his best performance since Donnie Brasco as the wild, crazy, and slightly effeminate Jack Sparrow. Throughout the film he's incredibly funny and he obviously had a lot of fun with the part. The rest of the cast, for the possible exception of Geoffry Rush who shines as the villain, isn't anything special, but at the same time there's nothing really to complain about. Knightley is definite eye candy, but wasn't that believable, and Bloom does a good job(just not Legolas good). Overall the film was exciting and you should definitely see it, if only for Depp's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FIRST IMPRESSIONI dont know about you, but I've been on Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean ride probably a dozen times. Its a classic, and in some ways the new blockbuster hit, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is one as well.SUMMARYBasically, Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a cunning and smooth-talking pirate who seems like he might have spent a little too much time at sea. After the governor's daughter gets kidnapped by an odd gang of pirates, who have been sailing on the mythical Black Pearl, it is up to Jack and a courageous blacksmith to not only save the kidnapped girl but also prevent the crew of the Black Pearl from destroying the curse that plagues them.ACTING: 93%Truthfully, I wasnt a big fan of Johnny Depp.......until now. He is terrific in this movie. His smooth, humorous words and his somewhat drunken stature make his original pirate character into a full scale movie of its own. In some respects, I dare say, he made this film. But, all the other actors, including Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush, are top notch and worthy of praise. Still, its Johnny Depp who lights up the screen, and everytime he enters a scene, the movie is somewhat enhanced and ultimately more enjoyable. All in all, great acting all around.STORY: 75%Moderately good story. I mean its nothing epic or rather new, but its decent for an action movie. Usually in a standard action flick, the plots follow a set pattern. The bad guys steal something, and the good guys set off to take it back. "Pirates" follows the same premise. One thing I didnt like about the story, and this is a big chunk of the story actually, was why did Jack and Will Turner want to stop the pirates of the Black Pearl from breaking their curse? I mean, once the curse is broken, they become mortal men. So, the danger of walking skeletons with the intent to kill would be over. And it wasnt like they were going to kill Will Turner over the coins; they just needed his blood. They knew and the audience knew that a simple cut would have sufficed. Decent story, with that one big fault in the story.DIRECTION: 85%When a high scale action blockbuster comes out, you know its probably a Michael Bay film or a Jerry Bruckheimer film. In this case, its a Bruckheimer film, and he doesnt disappoint. The shots of the battling ships floating around in the fog and the smoothness of the transition of the pirates to skeleton are all perfect. The shots of the beaches and palm trees also bring out a certain feeling of being stranded on a deserted island, with nothing to do but fish.FUN FACTOR: 85%One of the things that plagued this film slightly is its length. At 133 minutes, the sword fighting got a little boring towards the end. But, nonetheless, the rest of the movie, especially the beginning is totally engrossing and I would have to say "Pirates" is one of the more entertaining movies of the year.FINAL IMPRESSION ---84%With its exciting action sequences, the humor of Johnny Depp, and the excellent shots of the town and ships at sea, Pirates of the Caribbean is one movie definetly worth your time in the theater.

		<fullReview>Though this movie has been alternately panned and praised, there are a few things for certain. It will never win any big Oscars, and it is very enjoyable. There's a little bit of everything for everyone in this movie. For those in the audience who love women, Keira Knightley is beautiful and talented, if somewhat a little too close to looking JUST like Natalie Portman. For bad-boy lovers (even if only hormonally), Johnny Depp is a wonderful choice, and for those of you who like the boy next door, Orlando Bloom keeps up his star-power with a pretty face, and he does well with what little he's given to do. Johnny Depp positively steals this movie. For Depp fans, it's been a while since we've seen him stretch his proverbial wings. This role is not only fun, it's quirky, and quirks can be darned hard to portray. He does a fantastic job capturing the audiences' imaginations, not to mention the occasional mind, heart, and oh my yes, set of hormones. I was disappointed in Geoffrey Rush's performance; it seems bizarre that the man who played "twisted" so well in "Quills" could put forth such a mediocre bad-guy in this film. One thing I did find disappointing was the LACK OF CHARACTERIZATION AND PLOT given to Will and Elizabeth. It hardly seems fair that we are told nothing of what happened to them between childhood and adulthood. C'mon... give us at least something. Nonetheless, their respective portrayers did well with what little they had. All in all, it was good entertainment. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** This movie... well, it's so good I can't even begin to explain it. I may begin with saying that Johnny and Orli look awesome in it. The scene where Sparrow first appears is just wonderful, on his sinking boat.Johnny's acting is perfection in this movie. So far I have seen it 5 times, soon to be six, and it is wonderful. Keira Knightley is excellent, and Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa.In my opinion, Pirates of the Caribbean is flawless. I usually hate violent movies, but for some reason I love it in this movie. Probably because when they stab the people and stuff, there's not much blood and you rarely see the bodies, especially at the end. The casting for this movie is perfect, and nobody else could ever play the characters. Jack Sparrow is hilarious, and he makes the movie a comedy. Without him, the movie would be a lot less wonderful, but still good. I think the best thing about this movie is that there are few curse words, therefore making it okay for younger people. Although it is violent, like I said before there is little blood and few bodies shown.Another good thing about this movie is, well, I sometimes feel akward when dramatic moments occur, and in this movie, even the most dramatic moments can remain pleasurable. This movie is brilliant, and I highly recommend it to people of *all* ages. I give it a million thumbs up! A 100 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without Johnny Depp this movie would be nothing. Seriously. Mediocreplot. Mediocre direction. Between an hour and a half hour too long.But it does have Johnny Depp. I'll tell ya, I don't know of anothermovie where so much success can be attributed to a single person. Deppis incredible. He is a glam rock star in a pirate's body. Hisperformance is entirely genuine. It's incredible. His performance isso brilliant that for the Academy to ignore him would be an absolutetravesty. (as much as something in Hollywood can be)It's basically like this... if Depp isn't nominated for his performancein this movie, it will show exactly how out of touch the Academy iswith mainstream America.This movie is definitely worth seeing. Although it's not my favoritemovie of this year (I would place it behind T3 and X2) it is veryentertaining, and Depp's performance alone is worth the price ofadmission.

		<fullReview>I don't really see what the big deal was about this movie. It starts out promising, but I was pretty bored throughout the last 40 minutes.I will admit that all sets, props, and costumes were done with painstaking detail. The pirates are a colorful, entertaining lot. Acting was okay; Depp was amusing, and fake-Winona was nice eye candy. There are some wickedly funny moments, but plenty of stale one-liners and repeat gags as well. They are the kind of cheap shots at humor that can be sure to have the audience rolling on the floor as long as the movie has already roped them in by then.The ending is naturally cheesy and draws out for way too long. Although not as bad as some, Pirates still had plenty of plot holes for a party pooper like myself to pick at.***SPOILERS***- when one ship boards another, as the English did when chasing Sparrow and Turner, do they really send EVERY SINGLE PERSON over to the other ship? Wouldn't it make sense to keep at least a handful of people on your own ship?- Why did Sparrow steal a coin from the trunk near the end of the movie? In the end, it just needs to be tossed back in anyway. Was it just so that he could whip it out for drama's sake? "Ah ha! I stole this coin!"- If Sparrow had been under the curse the whole time, then wouldn't he also suffer from the lack of sensory pleasure? He certainly still enjoyed rum.- I had thought that the heroes would break the curse right as the pirates were walking along the bottom of the sea (a very neat scene, by the way). They would have all instantly become mortal and then immediately drown. I was disappointed when they instead waited another 30 minutes, let the ghost pirates kill several dozen people first, fought the immortal pirates themselves for another 10 minutes, and THEN broke the curse. A blown opportunity for a neat ending.***END SPOILERS***The special effects were good, but that's not enough nowadays to carry a movie.I was trying to figure out how this movie pulled off an IMDb 8 out of 10. Here's my theory: the promotions for Pirates successfully scared off the vast majority of would-be critics. The trailers and ads had Disney and BRUCKENHEIMER splashed all over, and that was enough to insure that only the sure-sells would actually pay to see it in a theater. I am predicting that Pirates will not age very well, and the rating will slip over time down to about 7.Overall, I give Pirates a 6 / 10: worth seeing at least once. Perhaps I am outgrowing the action, adventure genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp is mesmerizing, this film is a 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depp is genius and Rush is brilliant! Together they beguile and devour bringing piracy to a new level! This movie is a must see. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were respectably enjoyable, but Capitan Jack Sparrow stole the show and has set the stage. An affront no less, should he not be acknowledged for his portrayal in this role.Having been a Depp fan for years, it is no secret that Mr. Depp is truly gifted. My personal definition of an unparalleled, bravura actor is undoubtedly the often, disregarded Johnny Depp. This film is certainly evident of his talents (treasures, have you) proving you can't judge a man by his charcoal.Great film, great effects, great cast! Phenomenal job Mr. Depp and Mr. Rush! I'm enchanted once again. You two are magnificent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Really Surprised ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The posters and previews made this movie look sort of cheesy, but it was actually quite a good movie. Very handsomely produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and good to great performances by all. Johnny Depp was really funny and Geoffrey Rush had a lot of fun with his role too. The writers (who also wrote SHREK and THE MASK OF ZORRO) gave this simple and chliched story life through witty dialogue and characters.My biggest complaint was with Gore Verbinski's direction of the sword fight scenes. I think that he and his cinematographer tried to mask the mediocre choreography by quick cutting weird angles that obscure the action. However, Verbinski did a pretty good job on the ship battle scenes. That moonlight/skeleton effect was really cool. I'd love to see a making-of documentary on the DVD.My Grade:9 out of 10P.S. We saw a preview for HAUNTED MANSION before the movie. It actually looked like it might be pretty cool.</fullReview>

His characterization made the movie a truly fun "ride". Fun too was catching the director's references to Disney's park ride in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates was one of the better movies I've seen in awhile - not only was the cinematography great and the special effects amazing, the acting left nothing to be desired.The plot was gripping and left me wanting more - 2 hours is fairly long for a movie, but I could have sat through 2 more hours and loved every minute of it. A great blend of action, adventure, and comedy.The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and exciting, with the final battle leaving most of the audience cheering and clapping, not to mention laughing, going from skeleton back to human again.Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow was amazing, his facial expressions and mannerisms really made the character one of a kind. Unfortunately, Orlando Bloom did leave much to be desired (not in a good sense, ladies)- good looks aren't everything. Geoffrey Rush makes a great pirate, and Keira Knightly did a good job in more of a lack-luster role compared to the others.All in all, a flick that left me wanting to see it again and again. This is one movie that'll never be boring to watch, even after you've seen it a hundred times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great film and an Actor's Showcase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a total of 4 times. Why? Not because I didn't understand it because it is easily painted out for you the first viewing, but because it is a great story and an actor's showcase. I haven't seen a film in a while that has kept me as entertained the entire length of the film such as this one. Johnny Depp completely steals the show as Jack Sparrow and his love for the Black Pearl. (SPOILERS)He tries to get the ship back in his own hands, as he was captain before the curse set it's course, but he was thrown off the ship and marooned on an island. Since he was unable to take a coin from the cursed chest, he wasn't affected by the curse itself. This is what I don't understand. Many people say the plot is thin and doesn't make sense, but the whole movie revolves around the Pirates looking for the last piece of gold.(End of Spoilers)I loved this movie and will buy every version that comes out on DVD in the future, I strongly suggest you see what a good movie is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those that were disappointed with the action of this movie, I think you have missed the point. The comedy has something for everybody (parents and kids will laugh at the same jokes for different reasons). Even though it is a long movie, I never once looked at my watch or thought 'enough already.' This is a first class movie all the way!!!! Except for the academies bias against comedy, I think Johnny Depp would get Oscar buzz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie just makes me happy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie, and am glad that it has (finally) made its way on the top 250 movies on the IMDB. It deserves it. Pirates of the Caribbean is amazing on every level. First of all it's a movie with a screenplay. Many witty and interesting lines pepper the dialog, making it entertaining. So many movies are just there to watch, there is nothing to listen to, it is a breath of fresh air to be caught up in the words as well as the visuals. But on to the visuals, the special effects are amazing as well. Leaving the movie theatre there was only one scene where the special effects took me out of the movie, and that was the first one with the ship coming out of the fog. Pirates of the Caribbean achieves what every other blockbuster has failed, delivering great CG effects that are realistic and seamlessly woven into the movie. Now on to the acting, the weakest link in this is Orlando Bloom, but that is not to say that he is bad by any means. He has the least to work with so it isn't fully his fault. Keira Knightly is very good she is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses, and her character is wonderful. She is not just "the girl" she is one of the leads up there with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Her character is one of the best female characters in an action movie since Princess Leia. Geoffrey Rush is one of my personal favorites and doesn't disappoint in his part as the evil pirate captain.Now Johnny Depp, he deserves his own paragraph (as well as an Oscar nomination) for his Captain Jack Sparrow. From the moment he sashays onto the screen with his beaded dread locks, gold teeth, and slurred cockney accent you cannot take your eyes off him. He is marvelous. So off beat, and perfect that if all other parts of the movie were bad, he would have been worth it anyway, and the fact that the other parts of the movie are great makes his part glorious icing on a delicious cake.Pirates of the Caribbean is my fourth favorite movie of all time. I give it 10* out of 10. Please excuse me though, I must go to the movie theatre to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best summer entertainment movie since...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those rare films that gets better the more times its viewed. In fact it seems deliberately designed for repeat viewings, so dense is the amount of information packed into what I found to be an incredibly short two and a half hours. It may not be an intellectual piece, but it's certainly one of the more intelligently created films that I've seen. Perhaps its this denseness of information that's caused various critics to complain about plot holes because it does get to the point that you blink and you've missed something. Not that the film cannot be enjoyed without following every single explanation, but those critics determined to nitpick will erroneously find something to complain about. Certainly if they're unwilling to dig deep enough - and with a summer entertainment flick like Pirates, who would think that you needed to dig deep?On the substance of the film itself, watching Pirates is the most fun I've had in the cinema since... actually, I'm not sure when the last time was that I enjoyed a film this much. Johnny Depp's performance stands held and shoulders above pretty much every action hero to grace the screen. His entrance alone will become one of those shots thats played alongside Gene Kelly singing in the rain, the Death Star blowing up, Julie Andrews singing in the mountains and Indiana Jones running from that boulder. I've seen the film four times, and now I don't laugh when I see it, I start laughing about five minutes before (much to the annoyance of the rest of the audience).The rest of the cast are pretty good too - a stand-out performance from Geoffrey Rush, solid work from Orlando Bloom, (the gorgeous) Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and the host of minor players. The script is witty, clever and imaginative, while also still managing to pack in every convention of pirate movies under the sun - but then what else would you expect from Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio who wrote Shrek, The Mask of Zorro, and apparently Disney's Aladdin. And then Gore Verbinski's able direction manages to create a look that's both modern and classical at the same time.The only downside to the whole thing is the musical score. Much as Klaus Badelt (et al) produces some decent music to match the pictures, the music does sound derivative, it lacks a decent hero's theme (something along the lines of the Indiana Jones theme), and probably would have sounded much better if it had been written by Alan Silvestri. But that's a minor complaint in a film that actually makes me think that there's hope for the summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I'm going to be sure not to say anything that can be thrown back at me. But I have to start out with Depp. Without Jonny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, This movie would have gone nowhere and people wouldn't have loved it as much as they did. I feel that I must protect Depp from some of the IMDB users who love to be Critical of movies they had too high of expectations for.For one, Jonny Depp did not over-act his role, in fact, if Jonny hadn't acted the way he did, the movie wouldn't have been even half as enjoyable. I have read all the 500+ comments for this movie and most (90%) were saying how great this movie was. The other 10% however were totally bagging the movie, for all of you critics out there I have some advise, walk into the movie with no expectations and don't cut apart the movie, movies are not made to be critisized, they are made to entertain people and entertain this movie did. I was so happy with the performance by Depp, that the fourth time I saw this movie, I spent the whole time just watching Depp's hand movements, the way he moved his head, his expressions and carefully listening to his voice, and I must say I loved it even more after that. If you are going to this movie expecting gore, blood, cussing and other disturbing things, please keep in mind that this movie was made by DISNEY! This film however was not a true disney film, it definately had it's moments of adult humor, but was also made as a scary film for the youngsters.On a higher note, I will better explain the movie, and try not to spoil anything. I must start off by highly reccomending this movie to EVERYONE exept of those of you who love gore and sex too much to go watch a movie without it. The effects were superb and nothing short of PERFECT. The casting was also exelent and I could not think of a better cast. The one liners are great and really give it that extra something that every movie should have.IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THIS MOVIE, SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH...SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERS...SPOILERSI noticed the second time I saw this movie that it starts and ends with the same song, YO HO YO HO, A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME... And I thought this was a nice little touch that really ties the movie together at the end. I must also say that I love the part when Miss Swan faints during Norrington's proposal,It was histerical, along with Captain Jack Sparrow's entrance on his sinking boat, superb. The fight scene with Captain Sparrow and Turner was great as well and really had a sence of irony to it, as did the whole movie. Then the introduction of the Black Pearl and the first skeleton FX , also great. And when Captain Sparrow and Turner steal the Interceptor, now that was truley imaginative and highly creative, again perfect. I also think that Cotton's Parrot (Jack's new crew) also added a great touch throughout the whole movie and the trade of Captain Sparrow and Miss Swan made you feel bad and good at the same time. Then the capture (more of a disposal) of the Inetrceptor by the Black Pearl was alot of fun as was the scene of Captain Jack and Miss Swan on the Island, Highly Comical, as was their rescue. And this is when things REALLY start to get exciting. We are here introduced again to the effects of the skeletons in the night sky as everything starts to go from worst, to having high hopes. In this part Captain Jack's crew is rescued as is Captain Jack himself, along with Turner but not before tons of British Navy-men die, Captain Jack himself is stabbed only to find that he too is a skeleton because he had stolen a gold coin(I actually thought him to be dead at this point and was really sad only to see that things were okay)And this is when you REALLY get impressed, when Captain Jack and Barbossa are fighting in and out of the moonlight changing from live to undead, THESE are the effects that come close to matching that of the Matrix (different FX though)and this is the part even you critics loved!!and then Barbossa, the Rival, the Nemisis, the all-around bad guy we love to hate is shot and killed by Captain Jack's only bullet from his only pistol what was given to him by Barbossa only ten years before when he was marooned on "That Godforsakin spit of land"right when the curse of the Black Pearl is lifted by Turner. AMAZING!!! all of this was perfectly timed and choreographed down to the last second, AWSOME. And of course all ends well when Captain Sparrow excapes from being hung and then gets away on his new and improved Black Pearl as Turner gets the girl. I must admitt that there were a few loopholes, or misstakes, such as Ragetti's wooden eye that swivals. This is totally impossible for there are no tendons or muscles conected to his eye, it even moves when the curse is lifted. But all-in-all A PERFECTLY WELL ROUNDED, WELL WRITTEN MOVIE...This paragraph is for those of you who have yet to see this great movie. You will be delighted with the well written one liners, the great cast, the great scenery and well done FX.Also I'm sure you will all be impressed with the loyalty that the directors and writers showed to the famous Disney Park ride at least three to four scenes from the ride are actually in the movie. But I warn you DO NOT LEAVE AFTER THE MOVIE, STAY AND WATCH THE CREDITS, THERE IS A SPECIAL SCENE AT THE END THAT OPENS UP FOR A SEQUEL TO OUR NEW FAVORITE PIRATE MOVIE!You will love this movie(most of you)and I hope no one is dissapointed!! I give this movie a 10/10!!!"It's not a key, a hold, decks and sails; that's what a ship needs, but what a ship is, what The Black Pearl REALLY is,is FREEDOM" -Captain Jack Sparrow</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the title suggests, this was an incredible movie. It included stars such as Johny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Geoffery Rush as the evil Captain Barbrossa. The plot line was great and the acting was incredible from the main cast to those two undead pirates with the removeable eyeballs. When I first saw the trailer, I must admitt I was seeing it because Bloom (Legolas from LoTR) was in it. But I soon learned that Depp was much better than Bloom in this movie. Depp kept the audience laughing in about every sceen he was in, and Bloom provided the color commentary. Another good part was the music. It was just like a Star Wars/Lord of the Rings soundtrack. Loved it. Overall, the movie get a full 10/10. Certainly, the best movie of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Swashbucklin' Ride becomes the Swashbucklin' Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean has always been my favorite ride of Disneyland. The smell of the water, the wind breeze, and the pirate animatronics. The film has the same characteristics as the theme park ride. The pirates are humorous and they fall into humorous situations. Such as trying to fetch the doggy with the keys in his mouth. Pirates of the Caribbean is the best Disney film yet! The story is creepy with cursed pirates. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is fantastic. He was humorous and Captain Barbossa made a great appearance as a scurvy pirate. The famous song was sung many times in the film. It's great. Pirates of the Caribbean is this summer's blockbuster of the year. There's swords clashing and pistols and cannons firing. The action is daring and the curse is scary. Fantastic job! This is a Disney film! A bit violent, though. But great! The Haunted Mansion looks good too. The preview is amazing! Pirates of the Caribbean is a true sword fighting film!

		<fullReview>When I first heard about Pirates of the Caribbean: The curse of the black pearl, I was exited. I thought, "Wow, that looks pretty good!". Well, when I saw the movie, my thoughts changed. It wasn't pretty good. Is wasn't good. It was great. Now, I will start this with the graphics. They where amazing! Every bone was correct, and the rotting flesh was so creepy it wowed the audience in every way. Now, the actors... they where all also perfect. The one that I must say shined the most, was Johnny Depp (Captain jack sparrow)! He was perfect, and his acting and moves made him the most complex character. The others where also great, but there's something about Johnny Depp. Another thing to talk about. It's rated PG-13. Is this a bad thing? Not at all. Should you take your little kids to see it? No. It's almost as violent as "Lord of the rings". That's not a bad thing, though. The music. This was yet another great part of the movie. The tunes where fast paced, action packed, and amazing. In fact I highly recommend for you to buy this soundtrack. The setting was perfect, and the parts that are the best, (The duel, and the final battle etc.) are absolutely amazing. This is not only the first PG-13 Disney movie, but "Pirates" was also probably the longest. The comedy was side-splitting. Overall I highly, HIGHLY, recommend this movie. You will love it. I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

But what I loved the most, What really made this movie a must see, was Jonny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Now I keep seeing people making the mistake that Captain Sparrow was gay or always drunk, which would explain his strange yet comical movements but alas, hes was none of these, he was crazy. Mr. Gibbs said so himself. "they marroned him on and Island but not after he went mad with hate" Why do people always overlook the important stuff??-Syd"It's not a key, a hold, decks and sails; that's what a shipneeds, but what a ship IS, what the Black Pearl REALLY is... isFREEDOM."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies this summer. Everything from X2 to The Matrix Reloaded to Hulk to T3. These were all action packed and/or thought provoking. It was about time for something that was just `fun'. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl filled that quota.Orlando `Legolas' Bloom stars as Wil Turner, a typical `blacksmith-with-a-heart-of-gold-turned-to-piracy-after-undead-pirates-kidnap-his-one-true-love'.Keira `Not-Natalie-Portman' Knightley (who actually played Queen Amidala's decoy in The Phantom Menace) is Wil's one true love, Elizabeth Swann. It's one of those `high-class-girl-has-to-marry-high-class-even-though-she-loves-lowly-blacksmith' stories, but when she's captured by undead pirates, things change.Johnny `Didn't-He-Used-To-Be-Really-Famous?' Depp makes this movie as Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp stole every single shot he was in, playing the typical `pirate-who-you-never-really-know-what-side-he's-on-even-at-the-end'. Depp is hilarious, and I will probably buy this movie when it comes out on DVD, if only for his performance."Impressive" Factor: High. Besides the humor brought by Captain Sparrow, the special effects were beyond. Just beyond. Industrial Light and Magic outdid themselves on this one. You see, the undead pirates show their undeadedness when moonlight hits them, which makes for some creepy, dramatic moments, but once that point is brought across, it's almost like it's no big deal. Skin, no skin, its all the same. It's about time special effects weren't the focus, no matter how awesome they might be. The ending battle is great, perhaps only because the special effects were used to enhance the story, not just be there.Overall: See this film. It has everything. Pirates, love, humor, special effects. Go. Now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I guess it's a Disney movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, it was produced by Disney and the budget had "Disney" written all over it, but I have never seen a Disney movie quite like this before... and I like it! It wasn't easy getting me to this movie: I don't see Disney movies in the theaters... ever and I never see pirate movies, but my friend convinced me to go and to be honest the commercials looked good.Well, I'm glad I went. This was an experience to behold. The landscapes and cinematography is beautiful and the acting is terrific. The story is the only thing in this movie that's Disney and that is only the basic framework. I.g.: Don't expect a surprise ending, be prepared to say, "Well isn't that ironic?" In a sarcastic way. But that is okay because a movie that ends like that is okay now and then. Besides, what is inside the frame is totally un-Disney and it made me like pirates.There are many sword fights and many people die... I think just one is a record for Disney. The over all tone is dark and foreboding and the solution to the plot is more like an Indiana Jones film. While there are more senses on land than in the ocean, all the scenes are beautifully done and look like something you should see in a pirate movie.Now onto the best part of the movie: Jack Sparrow. I have a new respect, actually I have some respect, for Johnny Depp; no one could have made the role better. He plays a headstrong, not-not-so-up-to what he thinks he is pirate. In fact, most of the amazing stuff this guy pulls off is totally luck and total stupidity on the part of his enemies. He also brings a level of humor that goes between sarcastic and blunt and back and forth that really makes you wonder what he's going to say. The one liners and over all mood he gives the film makes it all that more enjoyable. He's like a modern day good for nothin' wannabe hippie that had everything dropped into his lap and if it isn't given to him, he gives up... finally a pirate I can relate to! Anyway, I hope he returns for sequels.Keira Knightly is, well, a perfect balance between talent and beauty. While anyone could have acted the role she makes the heroic portions of the role all that more believable and she looks damn good doing it. She's a woman that you can believe four guys would be going after at once. She is sexy and strong and I loved her in the movie. Wish I could say the same for Orlando Bloom, but he really wasn't in his element and obviously hasn't developed enough to make the best of what he's got... he seemed to method act a lot of it. Geoffrey Rush played Barbossa really well and looked especially well. I really felt hate towards him.In all this is a terrific movie that deserves it's success. Anyone who says other wise is looking to deep into the movie... it's Disney, and you can't expect Forrest Gump.Go see it even if you don't like pirates or Disney films, I did and I liked it.How it stacks up to me: Forrest Gump: 10/10 snatch.: 9/10 jackass the movie: 8/10 *Pirates of the Caribbean... ect: 7/10* Phone Booth: 7/10 Tears of the Sun: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pirates of the Caribbean; the Curse of the Black Pearl, is long in both title and running time. However, to those of us, myself included, who would sit forever in a movie theatre so long as we liked the movie we were seeing, the time was neither too long, nor over-done. At a whopping two hours and fifteen minutes, I found surprising little lag time in the plot as it hopped easily and smoothly from one scene to another. Though a lot of people are saying it was repetitive (and I'll admit, some parts were), I found I didn't care much as the movie was such a well done piece of work that it had me wanting it not to end.If you haven't heard enough about Johnny yet, here's some more. Though the casting was superb for all the roles, Depp certainly stole the spotlight. With a swaggering walk, slurred accent, and clever costume, the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow sweet talked his way out of trouble (an into the audiences' hearts!) time and time again. This suave rougue with his half-drunken manner, his clever comments, and his daring eye-liner look, got himself into and out of trouble in about equal amounts. Though he always managed to come out on top, most of the time it was obvious he was not entirely sure of what he was doing; though he did a good job of faking it. Not on any one side all of the time, Jack Sparrow played the part of a hero (whether he had intended it or not), while just trying to retrieve his beloved ship from the hands of the mutinous Captain Barbossa. However many flaws the bumbling Captain Jack had, and though he didn't always play by the rules ('pirate' after all), he became a loveable, goofy character that has landed Johnny Depp his greatest role yet, I believe. He seemed to have sunken completely into his role, and invented such a clever character.This action packed movie has a little bit for everyone, comedy, action, adventure, even romance, though Disney did a good job of not steaming up the screen too much. A carefully placed love plot was tied in with the rest of the movie, so as to keep it discreet but add a little spice to this adventuresome flick; not to worry parents, no Titanic scenes in this film! The two lovers, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, were played by the talented Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, both of whom did excellent jobs with their roles. Geoffrey Rush played the mutinous Captain Barbossa, who was an excellent villain, though not so funny as to take away Depp's role as the main comic relief.The animation was nicely done, and it was an interesting concept to see the crew of the Black Pearl turned into living skeletons. The plot is easy enough to understand, and will keep the younger audiences interested, as well as the older audiences. Great twists, memorable characters and quotes, beautiful scenery, and a carefully crafted plot kept me interested the whole way through. I'm only sorry I didn't stay to see the extra scene at the end, I'll be seeing the movie a second time, and will definitely enjoy it just as much. It has quickly climbed my ranks among favorite movies of all time. Though it was based on a ride, and many would consider it just a 'marketing ploy', I say; "if they spent the time and money to make it, and it's good, let them reap the benefits. They earned it." Pirates of the Caribbean is a memorable movie, with an awsome selection of characters (and actors) and a clever plot that I think anyone who just wants to escape reality and have a good laugh will enjoy. Definitely one to see in theatres!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supriseingly Good for a Disneyland ride movie....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit going in to this picture I had some reservations. I mean how desperate has the movie industry become that they are driveing around Southern California looking for amusement park rides for story ideas. I grew up in Anaheim right next to Disneyland so I am intimately familiar with The Pirates of the Caribbean ride there. I have to say that thankfully though this movie only has passing resembleances to things that take place on the ride; instead chooseing (correctly) to use the ride as inspireation for almost a completely new story idea.First off I have to say that the special effects were incredible, of course what could you expect but the best from ILM. I dont think i've seen a movie in the past year where they dident have some part in the special affects in the movie if needed.The movie itself was supriseingly rather well paced. I dident realize untill I got home that the movie was over 2 hours long, there simply are no slow spots in the movie, and certainly nothing you'd start thinking about sneaking out to get some popcorn over so you better come in with all the goodies you want for those 2 hours because your not going to want to leave.The story is amuseing in enough places to make the movie generaly classed as a comedy along with the action/adventure/fantasy tag but it somehow manages to roll all this into one without boreing the audience.It's sappy in some places, but comidicly so instead of being weepy. And the romantic sub-plot is goofy enough to be funny but romantic enough to be beliveable, and above all fairly original.The only reason I don't rate this movie a 10 is I dident leave it with the heart pounding intensity of being totaly drawn into the movie and the story it represents, but to be honest this dosent seem to be the intention of the movie at all. Instead it comes off as a light hearted romp thru the imagination of someone who's probably been on the ride at Disneyland one too many times. :)There are a few nods to the ride itself also, specificly 3 or 4 places where scenes from the movie could have been cut directly out of the ride, but it comes off more as an homage to the ride origin of the story itself instead of the movie relying on peoples familiarity with the ride to support it.There is also an amuseing bit at the end that I wont spoil here you can click on the side bar under "Crazy Credits" to see exactly what it is but it's probably the only part of the movie that shamelessly plugs the possiblility of a Part II if the movie goes in that direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie begins with very clever and subtle humor that continues through the whole movie. The visuals of this film were spectacular! Excellent special effects and excellent scenes produced just the right atmosphere for every scene. Johnny Depp was brilliant as usual, though I failed to understand what he was saying at times (along with some of the other characters). No, it wasn't the smarmy sea slang, it was just bad sound (or mumbling). The movie definitely dragged on towards the end, not ending several times when it could have. But even though it was late, I found myself hoping that it wouldn't end! It was just that kind of a show. My only complaint: I went at 11 pm, on a Sunday night, and I was SURROUNDED by noisy children and infants! Is there nothing sacred anymore????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, what more COULD anyone ask? "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" has adventure, drama, comedy, swordplay, excellent writing, a moderately capable damsel in distress, and two very, very beautiful men (for those moviegoers who find such things appealing). I saw this movie on opening night and wasn't disappointed in the slightest, although I had exceedingly high expectations for it.I've been a Disney fan since early childhood, and Pirates was always my favorite ride. I eagerly awaited the movie from the first moment I heard it was being made, even more so once I learned that both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp were to star in it. They both pulled their weight admirably, particularly Depp, whose Keith Richards-inspired, not-quite-effeminate Captain Jack Sparrow is, in my opinion, one of the best characters ever put on screen.In short, I wholeheartedly reccomend seeing "Pirates," repeatedly, and I fully intend to buy the DVD the day it comes out. (And by the way...make sure you wait until the end of the credits to leave--there's an extra scene!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To all the critical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, shall I say ostentatious and cynical, rather...I find myself frustrated when I read bad reviews of good movies. I know that it is a critic's job to be critical, hence their title... and I know that a critic can still appreciate a movie and still use wit and intelligence to point out some of its flaws... and I also know that a critic should not conform to other's views but I've unfortunately glanced over a few biting reviews of this film. It's really disgusting. The only reason I see that one would denounce this film as one of the worst of all time is that they are trying to go against the grain to seem really smart or ironic. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is one of the greatest movies of all-time - finally an Indiana Jones/Star Wars type adventure for the modern generation. And even if an audience member (or critic...) didn't personally enjoy the film (which I find very hard to believe) - he or she can at least admire it for all the technical achievements and brilliant writing, editing, cinematography, direction, acting...! Any way, my point is, there is a line that a supposed critic can cross over, they can cross over into cynicism... in which a reader of his or her review should question whether this person knows anything about movies in the first place. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a masterpiece and I don't think the readers on IMDB need to be told that, they should just go see it! A crowd pleaser with depth and intelligence, finally! It is times like these when I thank God for Disney and Johnny Depp!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the previews of this movie a while back, and was dying to see it, because of Orlando Bloom. When it finally came out, I was so mad that I couldn't go on the first day. I went the next day with my friend, but I wasn't setting my expectaions too high because, well, I'm not the biggest pirate movie fan. But it was AMAZING!!! Johnny Depp is hilarious as Jack Sparrow, Orlando provides the eye candy as he swashbuckles his way into your heart, and Keira Knightley is, of course, the beautiful damsel in distress. Everyone did a great job in this movie! The effects were amazing; I was pretty creeped out by those skeletons, I can tell you. Basically, this film is great to see if you're looking for a good, fun time at the movies. I'd gladly see it again anytime.I'd give it a 9/10. Good job, Disney!

SFX were great, Johnny Depp is the heart and soul of this movie, my favorite swording-fighting scene was between Depp and Bloom in the rafters, Knightley is lovely and funny in her own right, and Cap'n Jack Sparrow's entrance has got to be one of the filmdom's classics. Great cinematography, the plot was great (and left room for a sequel :), and I don't have a single complaint about it. The thing I enjoyed the most about it was that it was just rolicking good fun. It's up there with quotables like The Princess Bride and Holy Grail. Rush played a very good ham to Depp's cheese. Depp played it like he'd had a bit too much rum...ten years ago.

		<shortDescription>What a mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a complete mess!I believe much of the problem with the film lies with the screenwriters and director Gore Verbinski, who seem to be struggling to please Disney while insisting on violence and gore (pardon the pun). The tone of the film vacillates between swashbuckling adventure and lurid ghost story, achieving neither suspense nor horror. Instead, the film half heartedly plods along with some tedious dialogue and obvious lapses of narrative logic, occasionally eleviated only by amusing special effects.One of the major problems with the film seems to be dialogue that sticks out like a sore thumb. In addition to the rather stilted language (especially in the earlier portions of the film), the film is also hampered with a script that begs for a few more rewrites.(POSSIBLE SPOILER COMING UP - BUT IT IS NOT REALLY A SPOILER SINCE THE FILM SPOILS IT FOR ITSELF) There are many lapses of logic in the plotline that took me out of the film. Among them: The film is ambivalent in dealing with the pirates. When it becomes clear that only a little blood (not a death sacrifice) would revive the cursed pirates, one wonders why the leads would not simply consider getting these pirates out of their hair by simply acquiescing and getting on with their petty lives. Again, when it is revealed midway through the film that the pirates cannot be killed, the rather lengthy fight scenes that follow suddenly become labored and accessive, and the gore accompanied with that smacks of gratuitousness. It is as if the air that kept the film buoyant till then was suddenly sucked out, and the film, like many of the ships in the film, begins to sink.The characters in the film are also not the most interesting despite gallant attempts at making them so. Jonathan Pryce is mired line after painful line, by hackneyed dialogue. Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth is a pretty face but lacks the spunk, character and hootzpah that made Karen Allen's damsel in distress so appealing and unpredictable in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Orlando Bloom's William, while gallant, fails to transcend stereotype. Even Geoffrey Rush's pirate fails to surprise or intrigue. Perhaps the only person that comes rather unscathed in this debacle is Johnny Depp, who has made a career of making interesting (if unsuccessful or unconvincing) choices. Despite common belief, Depp's forte is not in being a talented or transformational actor. Depp's performances do not hold the gravitas or subtlety like a Brando, a Pacino or a Deniro. Rather, Depp's strength is in the courage and the curiosity of his choices which has earned him the respect as a risk-taker, rather than an excellent actor. Having said that, Depp, whose accent is not all convincing, and whose casting in the part is not at all perfect, winds up inadvertently being the most interesting in an otherwise flaccid film.Save your ten bucks for Indy 4.</fullReview>

But after viewing the film, I realized that only someone as quirkily eccentric as Depp could have pulled off this role. Most of the fun stems from Jack Sparrow's charismatic bumblings. You can't help but like the guy. I think the spark of the movie would have been lost if they had cast a lunkhead action hero.

		<shortDescription>Now this is PRECICELY what I'm Talking about! I Love this Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, another Disney Tie-In... How remarkably lame. And this time, not only is it a tie-in, but its a tie in for a RIDE at a Theme Park! What an insult! Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's what I thought too... until I saw they bagged both Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush! Not to mention the Director of The Ring, Gore Verbinski! And it didn't hurt that this particular ride is possibly the coolest in Disney History. Just about every guy who has ridden this ride has thought, man, this would make one great movie, man! I'm one of them! And we were all right! This is probably the most fun movie of the whole summer (just about tied with LXG)!Was a great action movie with intelligence, wit, and good actors too much to ask? Clearly not, as Disney (of all companies) has delivered just that! This is a swashbuckling, rip-roaring riotous assault in the senses with more fun and laughter than you're likely to find in just about any movie! Yeah, it's the sum of its parts, but its parts are very good. Johnny Depp doesn't find himself at the mast of a top-heavy film with only him to rely on! Instead, almost universally you find good actors here to grace the good script and the good directing. It's a good film... choke on it... I'll be at Disneyland... it worked, sue me!The plot centers around a pair of unlikely lovers in the form of Orlando Bloom (Legolas from Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings adaptations) and the mind-shakingly hot Keira Knightley (if you think she looks like Natalie Portman, you're not alone... George Lucas thought so too)! The lovers meet as kids and watch each other from afar for most of their lives, propriety preventing a union, much like the secret love we all know that Tom Daschle and Dick Armey secretly harbor... but I digress! When Knightley's character Elizabeth Swann first meets Bloom's Will Turner she sees an Aztec designed medallion about his neck which reminds her of the pirate mythology she has come to know, so she steals it and spirits it away, never knowing it might have more significance than she thinks!Though these two are two of the main movers of the plot, it is without question Johnny Depp's movie. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow a homosexual pirate down on his luck and riding into the same town that Will and Elizabeth live in! Soon after his arrival a ship called The Black Pearl, a sort of legendary Flying Dutchman from Hell, arrives to rape, pillage and burn, not to mention find all the Aztec Gold the crew scattered around which led to their demonic curse causing them to literally exist as the walking dead, led by the maniac captain Barbossa!What follows is an adventure leading to some amazing team-ups, surprisingly satisfying CGI, hilarious moments, and more underhanded scheming and backstabbing than a convention of Hollywood Producers! Aiding the fun is Depp's well-acted, yet incredibly funny in manner Sparrow, complete with compass that points only to his treasure stash and more secrets than a Linda Tripp phone call! The Animation, when needed is amazing, and pretty much flawless. When the Cursed Pearl Pirates are lit by moonlight they are shown for the undead ghouls they truly are, but only then! During an underground fencing match characters move in and out of lit breaks in the ceiling becoming skeletons, then men, then skeletons, then men! It's seamless to my eyes. The scenery, and the sets (real and animated) are just beautiful to behold, and set the scene perfectly!Geoffrey Rush is a perfect pirate. Funny at the right times, scary at the right times... and Orlando Bloom has the makings of a great actor. Knightley is not only beautiful but plays her part very well. As do the supporting characters, such as Jack's Crew (featuring the almost equally yummers Zoe Saldana)! I've long been a fan of old Jonathan Pryce in his roles as a brave, yet conflicted character of complexity in Brazil, Tomorrow Never Dies... those... Lexus commercials! Here he plays an aging, sniveling man who is pretty funny in his attempts to raise his daughter and survive disembodied arms fighting with him in his cabins.Depp steals every scene as Sparrow, and keeps the laughs coming with his daring schemes (that usually work), his insane mannerisms, and his occasional bumbling. Sparrow dresses like "Love in an Elevator" era Steven Tyler, and acts like a Male Ullman Character on Tracy Takes On! Verbinsky never lets you forget that Sparrow is above all other things, a pirate, and not exactly the golden hero one might expect from Errol Flynn or someone. It's not only refreshing to see a dignified gay hero in a major motion picture, but to see this hero not be a stock character in all other ways. It's common to se a cleverer than life Hollywood Hero who sets into motion events that ultimately pay off for him in the end. Sparrow isn't so much a hero as a haplessly goofy Keith Richards, thrust into a leadership role. While his plans commonly work out, he's commonly as surprised as the rest of us that they do, and he's just bumbling enough to not really know what the hell he's doing! He doesn't so much exude confidence as he does an forlorn acceptance of unfortunate events that he's pressed into. Rotten scalawag or not, Sparrow is impossible not to like from his Gold Capped Teeth to his obnoxious swagger, he's as much fun to watch as a J. Edgar Hoover Home Movie!There are a few nods to the Disney ride, fans of which should giggle with the recognition of these. The film doesn't rely on these little things though, so you who have never been to Orlando or to Anaheim won't be negatively affected. The scenes are clever with or without precedent! There is one truly terrifying scene (at least to me) that takes place on a desert island (there is nothing funny about the mass torching of Spiced Island Rum)! There is also a bit of a curiosity to the method of breaking The Curse of the Black Pearl. Apparently this involves the shedding of the blood of a certain character deceased before the events of this film... but why this is doesn't seem to ever be explained... if I missed it please, tell me why!There really isn't anything to complain about in this film! It's a heck of a lot of fun, and well worth the ticket price. Therefore, I'm giving it a rare Four and One Half Stars! I'm glad the Pirate Movie is back... I just wish Cutthroat Island hadn't gotten such a bum wrap! So... why not the full five stars for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl? Well... it's not quite Citizen Kane!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POTC is absolutely the BEST movie I've seen all my life and I've seen a number of movies. It contains different genres, such as comedy, adventure, and romance, that come together to result in a great film that's, without a doubt, worth seeing more than twice in the theater. Johnny Depp, who plays the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow, has proved his superior acting skills once again, while at the same time, taking the female audiences' breath away with his gorgeous face and hot bod. It's actually kind of awkward that I find the black eyed "pirate look" he flaunts to be very sexy and I think gives him a sense of mystery. He was deff. my favorite! As for the other cast members, they also did an outstanding job. Geoffry Rush, who's other movies I've never seen, played the villain of the film very well. Newcomers Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are rising stars who were lucky enough, AND talented enough, to get one of their first roles in a movie like this. The movie is entertaining for all ages, both boys and girls. It was thankfully long and kept me sitting in my seat wanting more and more, even after the two and half hours were over. POTC deserves every kind of movie award there is and I hope it receives at least three. I am going tomorrow to see it again with a friend who has also already seen it. After that, I'll probably go a few more times because I can't wait long enough for it to be released on DVD!! Go see it before it's no longer in theaters!!!</fullReview>

He really delved into the character to bring out the nuisances that make him interesting to watch and listen to. The costuming was outstanding, with a fine attention to detail.

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the greatest,cutest, and funniest pirate movies I have seen. The cast was great. Johnny Depp was hysterical. I was cracking up just by the way he walked. Orlando Bloom was great at the hero who denies his true nature. Keira Knightley was pretty funny too, especially when she started really chowing down. Geoffrey Rush was downright creepy. The special effects was awesome. I loved when the pirates transitioned into zombies. The costumes were perfect. All great choices made by Jerry Bruckheimer and the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Makers....Take a Clue from the Pirates!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All movies should be this much fun to go see. With most of the junk Hollywood produces now, I hate to spend $20+ for two tickets, 1 medium popcorn and a bottle of water, so that my kid and I can waste 90 minutes of our life, and come out thinking, "well that movie was OK...." I watch tons of movies, but generally wait till they're on DVD so I only blow $4 at Blockbuster if it sucks.HOWEVER, cheapskate that I can be, POTC was worth every penny!!! Even though some people here might think it was too long because Hollywood's getting us trained with the 80-90 minute flicks so they can cram in more showings at the theater, I loved every second of it. I'm 40 and my daughter's 11 and we both had a blast. And what's odd is that neither of us is particularly into "pirate" movies. It's just so much fun to watch, it's appropriate it was based on a Disney ride, because that's exactly what it is, a 2 1/2 hour long movie ride that lets you escape from reality into a wonderful fantasyland.They couldn't have picked a better cast for this picture. Johnny, Keira, and Orlando were perfect in their roles. Keira reminds me of a cross between Brooke Shields and Jennifer Garner. She's pretty without being too perfect, but portrays the damsel in distress that can swing a plank of wood like McGwire if need be. Orlando is a great romantic anti-hero/love interest for Keira's character. And as a dirty, natty-braided, gold-toothed, and, you assume, smelly pirate, Johnny Depp was as sexy a swashbuckler as you'll ever see on film (and MINOR SPOILER...) he doesn't even do anything resembling a love scene! Any female that doesn't want to jump his bones after seeing one of his side-ways glances needs to get her hormones checked!Filmmakers who are wondering why their movies don't make money at the box office need to take a long hard look at this one and learn some lessons.A) If we want to see serious issues or be depressed, we can turn on CNN.B) Movies don't have to be crammed full of blood, gore, profanity, or nudity to be a smash hit. You'll make more money when parents can take kids to a show without being embarassed or horrified every 30 seconds.C) When we go to a movie, we know the people on the screen are acting, and the actors know we know they are acting, so let your actors have fun with this, and subtly wink at the audience every now and then. It doesn't hurt and we viewers love it!D) Don't underestimate the intelligence of the movie-going public, even the kids. Movies can be hysterically funny with well-written, well-timed lines without resorting to stupid slapstick, pie-in-the face, or toilet-themed humor.My kudos to the creators of POTC. They did everything right, and I predict they'll sell a fortune of DVD's when this comes out at the stores. I know I'll be buying it the first day. This is a movie I'll want to watch many times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Seeing Over Three Times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After ticket prices for an admit have rose to a staggering $9.25 in my area, I have tried to avoid the theaters as much as possible and wait for the dvd to come out and rent it at my local Blockbuster for a measely $3.00. Surprisingly, after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean in Hawaii where the price for a movie is $6.25 (I'm in California now) I have had the urge to want to see the movie again, even if i have to pay nearly $10 for an admit. I've gone twice already and am going a third and fourth time soon!This movie is SO WORTH your money and more importantly, your time. It's not your typical, "arrgh.." peg-legged, one eyed pirate movie, its an original movie that this summer has been dying to find. In a summer full of seemingly endless sequels, Pirates proved to be the diamond in the rough. Full of spectacular action sequences, a humble love story, and a very subtle (yet hilarious) humor, its got something for everyone. Johnny Depp gives the performance of his life in this movie and most definately proved that he is a genious in the acting world, and is one of the most brilliant underrated actors ever to be on the silver screen. Granted, I have appreciated Depp for his other acting roles in his career, but his work done here is incredible. His Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the most intriguing characters in movie history. With his humorous wit and indescribable charm, he is the pirate that guys want to be, and girls want to be WITH. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, as the young beautiful stars in this movie, give the movie its youthful spunk, adding to the fact that their acting job was terrific. Definately rising stars! Geoffery Rush was outstanding as Captain Barbossa, and the greatest villain that you loved to hate.Overall, this movie was just unforgetable. It is a good 2 hours and 30 minutes to spend with whoever you want, and is worth seeing more than once, even if you have to shovel out a couple of dollars in your wallet. Believe me, you won't be disappointed!!! And you'll walk out of that theater wanting to see it again!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit that I am not hard to please when it comes to the action genre. When I go into a theatre to watch an action film, I'm not expecting any kind of magnificent acting jobs or solid plots. But I was pleasently suprised with POC.For starters, this movie had tons of quality action in the form of sword play, gun fights, town raids, and naval engagements. Second, it was solidly funny, especially Depp. His character and acting job is so funny, you might mistake him as some veteran comedian if you had never seen any of his previous work. Third, the imagery is simply compelling - many film makers should strive to meet this level of quality. Fourth, if you are male, miss Knightley is extremely easy on the eyes. You looks like an ultra-hot version of Wynona Rider with long hair. And finally, the plot is actually way better then I expected. It keeps you so engrossed that the 2.5 hour run time passes in the blink of an eye.I would have to reccomend this film to everyone. I will no doubt buy the DVD the day it hits shelves.</fullReview>

It keeps you so engrossed that the 2.5 hour run time passes in the blink of an eye.I would have to reccomend this film to everyone. I will no doubt buy the DVD the day it hits shelves.</fullReview>

I felt it would have been better if about 20 minutes had been deleted.Johnny Depp was very engaging as Capt. Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were appealing in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Geoffrey Rush gave a very solid performance.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best I have seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must admit I oringinally was interested in this movie because Orlando Bloom, the Legolas of The Lord of the Rings was staring in the movie. That and I liked Pirate movies of the older days such as Black Swan.When I went to see the movie I was surprised at how good the movie was. It had a interesting plot and wasn't your normal Pirate movie. Normally the romance is between the Pirate and the leading lady, but Orlando wasn't a Pirate...at least not in the way He thinks.It has a interesting back story as well and was incredably funny. I went to see it twice and laughed more at the second time simply because some of the things I realised were funny because of later events.I recommand this to anyone one who loves pirate movies and doesn't mind laughs and good fun. It is a wonderful family film although It might not be for younger children because of the skeletons.This is definatly a repreive from the lackluster films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first true contender for an Academy Award</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since its release on July 9th, I've seen this movie 3 times, and enjoyed it more with each viewing. With a wonderful cast that included the humorous Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and the evil cursed pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), this film should contend for an Academy Award in 2004. This movie encompasses the entire realm of why pirates were viewed as dishonest buccaneer looters who only cared about themselves and gold treasures. Former captain of the Black Pearl, Jack Sparrow wonders through the Caribbean looking to regain his ship from the mutinous Captain Barbossa. After saving the life of the beautiful governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Sparrow runs away from the British Naval Fleet and meets the son of a famous pirate, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). After Elizabeth is kidnapped and taken to the Black Pearl, Sparrow and Turner join forces to rescue Ms. Swann, who Barbossa believes is the one who could shed her blood to end the curse. Sparrow manages to get aboard the Pearl, but is unsuccessful in getting back Elizabeth and instead is marooned on an island with only a pistol. Once Barbossa learns that Will Turner is the only blood relative of the late William "Bootstrap" Turner, he tries to kill him only to be rescued once again by Jack Sparrow. Once Turner spills his blood on Aztec gold, Barbossa is shot, and the pirates are defeated, Sparrow is sentenced to death by hanging by the leader of the Royal Fleet, Commodore Norrington. Sparrow's life is saved by Turner and he escaped to regain control of the Black Pearl, while Will and Elizabeth proposed their love to one another. An incredible, edge-of-your-seat action comedy that will make you want to see it over and over again. Truly the best movie of the year and worthy of some hardware. I recommend it even for those who don't fancy adventurous films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Caribbean, love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was growing up as a young lass there was nothing I wanted to be more than a pirate. I've been to Disneyland and ridden Pirates of the Caribbean more times than I can count. I must also admit that even as an adult I've always come home with a few plastic swords and sacks of pirate treasure. There is something about the thought of being a pirate that totally frees someone. Of course we all picture honorable scoundrels much like Indiana Jones or Han Solo to name some modern ones (First two characters I thought of, Harrison Ford however is not in the film). But the rogues we have here are just as lovable, each in there own way.From beginning to end this film is a winner, everything on the scene is gorgeous and full of rich color, filming in the Caribbean really made the movie stand out. Personally I'm chomping at the bit to get the soundtrack. About 5 minutes into the film I said to my friend sitting next to me "Isn't this great music?". It's touching during the few quiet scenes and suitably bombastic when it comes to fighting always helping the story move along and reach the right emotional tone.Depp as so many other have already noted is simply remarkable in his role and it the Academy had any sense whatsoever he'd at least be considered for an Oscar (not nessacarily win) but that won't happen God forbid an action/comedey that is successful and appeals to everyone win something, can't appear mainstream. Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush fill there roles quite nicely, Bloom and all the other are ok but certainly not outstanding.The plot...does really it matter? Honestly it doesn't but that fact that is above par for a summer movie only make this movie more worthy. And while it does get a bit long at 140 minutes or it barely noticeable. Maybe about 10-15 mintutes could have been trimmed without losing anything. All in all a 9/10, add another point for all the lovingly placed references to the ride i.e. , "That dog is never going to move" and you get my score a perfect 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the 'surprise' movie at the close of the Cambridge Film Festival - and lived up to its billing. At no time during this lengthy movie did my attention waver . This was an occasion where the driving sondtrack did aid the pace of the film, and did not obliterate the action, but complemented it.Johnny Depp excelled himself, archly camp for much of the movie. The fight scenes were all excellent, though my personal preference was the first one between Johnny Depp's Captain Sparrow and Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. Lots of small humourous notes - the false eye being struck by a fork being a personal favourite! I'm left wishing I could look as great as Johnny Depp does in his make-up - that stays immaculate throughout, and the energy he invests in the part makes him clearly the pivotal role in the movie, wise-cracking all the way. I'd never normally go to watch a film with this kind of story line - now, I can't wait for it to open in the UK on August 8th - go see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit this movie was better than I thought it might be. Johnny Depp is of course a great actor, and in this movie he displays once again his extraordinary ability to develop a unique and memorable on-screen persona in any movie in which he appears. This ability is made even more incredible by the staggering contrast between his real-life self and the characters he plays. Orlando Bloom has fewer lines than you might expect, but he does a good job with what's given to him. Overall this movie is not heavy on plot or on character development, but as an action movie about pirates it is as good or better than one can reasonably expect it to be. It may not be one of the best films ever made, but it is certainly good entertainment for your ticket money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Johnny Depp's funniest performance yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little skeptical in the weeks leading up to the release of POTC. From what I could gleam from the previews I felt it had the potential to either be terrific or horrific.However, after reading a few great reviews on the day of the film's release I let my hopes get up and for once was justified in doing so. While the basic love story between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley left a little to be desired and sort of left parts of the ending a wee bit flat, the movie makers wisely did not let that side of the story play too key a role in this film's overall presentation. I should clarify that the actors' performances were good and did not carry the blame for the lack of spark and flame in this romance. It seemed more like the writers wanted just enough romance to move the story along where needed, but not so much as to interfere with other more interesting aspects of the film.One thing became quite clear about 5 minutes into the show; this is Johnny Depp's show all the way! However, it does help to have a great surrounding cast to bring the thing off nicely. Geoffrey Rush was fabulous as Captain Barbosa and several of the minor roles were played with unusual comedic brilliance as well. While not a perfect, nor moving film, POTC has to be one of the most entertaining and fun films I've seen in a long time. Parts left me fighting the temptation to start clapping and cheering. Besides, after a long week at the office it's just what I was looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film more than I thought I would. Sure, the casting is great, but does every ride at Disneyland need to be a movie now?But back on track, 'Pirates' is good fun. Very tongue-in-cheek. Johnny Depp's Cap'n Jack Sparrow is hilarious. Just about everything Geoffrey Rush does is worth watching. Once I got past Keira Knightley's amazing resemblance to Natalie Portman-it took me about half of `Bend It Like Beckham' to figure she was too tall to be Natalie, so who was she?-it wasn't hard to see there is much more to her than just a lookalike. Orlando Bloom is...well... Orlando Bloom (I'm smiling while I type this). Though he really doesn't have much to do except look smoldery and act rashly, which applies to Depp and Knightley, too, depending on the moment.It's a little hard to figure who the protagonist is, but I didn't mind too much. There are several bouts of swordplay that look great but lean toward the pointless side (please ignore the pun). A lot more is going on than is necessary: a lot of quirky little subplots that the house enjoyed but that don't really go anywhere. Over all the film is really quite long, and begins to feel like it; trimming would have helped, not hindered. The special effects were great, and Verbinski didn't dwell on them as other directors would have (thank goodness). All of that aside, though, I had a good time. I have always been impressed with Johnny Depp and thought him capable of much more versatility than he receives credit for; I think this piece demonstrates that versatility, as did the pleasant surprise that was `From Hell'. And he is hot, even with nasty teeth and eye-shadow. Huzzah that someone finally made a stomach-able pirate flick! I'll give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Pirate Movie That Works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think that Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer would discard the notion of making a pirate movie after Cutthroat Island and Pirates 'success' (the first of which shut down a film company). Yet, undaunted, they set out to make Pirates of the Carribean. They made more than a movie, they made a masterpiece.The Plot: Very creative. Something that many movies now are lacking save for a few.The Music: Incredible. Many movies have a bland score that leaves a bad impression on the movie. The score ranks up with that of the Lord of the Rings movies.The Cast: As if newcomer-turned-famous Orlando Bloom wasn't enough, they also tossed Geoffery Rush, Keira Knightly and Johnny Depp in the mix, the latter of which would be a shame if the Academy Awards didn't nominate. The supporting cast is well done as well.The Acting: It wasn't surprising to see that Orlando Bloom did a great job, seeing as how his acting in Lord of the Rings really stood out. Keira Knightly put a good twist on the 'Damsel in Distress' stereotype by actually doing something instead of just moping about and screaming like most Damsels in Distress. However, Geoffery Rush and Johnny Depp really stole the show as Captain Barbossa and Captain Jack Sparrow, 2 sides of the same coin so to speak.The SFX: Also would be a shame if the Academy Awards didn't nominate. The transformation of the pirates is shown seemlessly and effortlessly. I was worried that the SFX Team would 'forget' to transform a pirate into a skeleton every now and then, but luckily they pulled through. The other effects are spectacular too, such as the boats, scenery and what not. Even some parts have better SFX than The Matrix ReloadedThe Twist: It's a Disney movie. It's PG-13. Now if that doesn't surprise you, this will. Blood, swears, explosions, people getting stabbed, people getting blown up, people losing their eyes (sort of, if you've seen the movie you know what I mean), use of alcohol, people getting their throats cut open, some real creepy parts (the skeletal monkey was one of them) and to top it all off, prostitutes... Disney should make more movies like this.So far, 2003 has been a fairly good year for movies (aside from Dumb and Dumberer, Legally Blonde 2, ect.) but this movie has shone out from the rest. However, the year is nearly drawing to an end, but there are still 2 more great movies coming out: The Matrix Revolutions and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. All in all Pirates of the Carribean will stand the test of time, much like Lord of the Rings and The Matrix will, and hopefully its impending sequels will too. I really hope the sequels don't put the Pirates underwater, like 99% of Disney sequels do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years best, pure fun start to finish, Depp is on Fire!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harking back to the days when Pirate films and fantasy films were being released with decidedly more regularity this film really brings the young imp inside us all out, the sort of young imp that takes delight in watching classic fantasy swashbucklers from the 80's such as the Princess Bride. I am a big fantasy film fan, I love to plonk on oldies like Krull, Labyrinth and this is the sort of film that really brings that desire back again, not quite to the same level that Lord of the Rings did but still this is a fantastic adventure movie.What you have here is your basic pirate/fantasy adventure storyline, there is treasure involved, ghosts and of course damsels to be rescued not a Princess but a governors daughter in this case. Considering that the last big studio pirate film was the pap Cutthroat Island and that this film is based off of a theme park ride the signs did look ominous that this would be pants, but the cast involved plus good scriptwriters and a very excitable trailer put pay to that and as such this has struck gold at the box office and is a critical and public success.The film has great set design, it looks great and there is real scale to it. The action is exciting, the score is chest thumpingly good and the film creates a sense of magic, this is movie making magic, it's a feel good summer movie and has likeable characters and a witty script, hence this seems to have got the best audience reaction I've heard in ages. This movie is about having a great time, it's not particularly meaningful but it is great all round family fun that doesn't suffer from dull patches or failed expectations.The cast are all good. Orlando Bloom is given a lead role for the first time and he handles himself well, Keira Knightly is feisty and sexy as the damsel in distress, who of course is whooping ass with the best of them by the end. Then there are Brit actors such as Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport and Kevin Mcnally who are all good. Geoffory Rush takes delight in chewing the scenery as the bad guy, but in typically show stopping form is Johnny Depp as Cap'n Jack Sparrow who plays him out like Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones (I s*** you not). Depp is superb, he makes the movie, the movie on its own right is pure fun and a good time but Depp really does add another level to it with his charm and his humour. He has boundless energy throughout the film and his cockney accent is faultless, Depp proves once again what a versatile actor he really. Until watching this filming I had not enjoyed a film so much this year aside from Nemo and X2. It was a rollicking good time with great effects, and also very funny. This is good news for the fantasy film genre, with it coming alive recently with hits like Lord of the Rings and Harry Porter perhaps we'll see some more, while perhaps not with the regularity of certain periods like the 50's or 80's. One of the years best most definitely.****</fullReview>

The pirates who deserted him found a treasure that was cursed and need the blood of "Bootstrap" Bill Turner's only child to defeat the curse. They kidnap Elizabeth Swann, thinking she is the child. Jack tries to rescue her. Her father and the Commodore who wants to marry her also try to rescue her. Will she survive? Will she marry him? You will definitely fall in love with this movie.

		<shortDescription>The Mummy on the high seas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the 2nd trailer for this film, I thought to myself that it was "The Mummy" done at sea with pirates instead of in Egypt with mummies. But that's not a bad thing necessarily; this film is fun in an over the top, tongue in cheek kind of way. More a parody of pirate films than a real pirate film itself.Many people say that Johnny Depp makes this film as Captain Jack Sparrow, and while he certainly is fun to watch, every goofball needs a straight man to play off of, and Orlando "Legalos" Bloom does that about as well as anyone else out there would have. Oh and Keira Knightley is hot.The plot concerns Miss Keira being kidnapped by pirates (the ringleader played by Geoffrey Rush) who think that her blood will break a nasty curse hanging over them, all they need is to cut her hand open on the gold medallion in her possession by way of Orlando. The only problem is that it's actually Orlando Bloom's blood they need, not Keira's. But no one is aware of this right away so Orlando busts Johnny Depp out of jail and he agrees to help Orlando rescue the woman he loves.Chaos and mayhem ensues. It's fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i went to the movie theater already loving the movie, when i came out i was in a Pirate phase! this movie has got to be the best movie of the year so far. on a scale of 1 to 10 i would give a 100! i dont think the movie wouldnt have been very good without Johnny Depp. he was the perfect man for the job. Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and the lady who played Elizabeth also did a tremendos job. how could someone not like this movie? every little kid wants to be a pirate and it stays with us all our lives. Will Turner said pirate blood runs though his viens. but i disagree it runs through everyone and this movie really brings it out. "You forget... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!" ~dathomirprincess 8-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a Pirate Movie That Works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would think that Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer would discard the notion of making a pirate movie after Cutthroat Island and Pirates 'success' (the first of which shut down a film company). Yet, undaunted, they set out to make Pirates of the Carribean. They made more than a movie, they made a masterpiece.The Plot: Very creative. Something that many movies now are lacking save for a few.The Music: Incredible. Many movies have a bland score that leaves a bad impression on the movie. The score ranks up with that of the Lord of the Rings movies.The Cast: As if newcomer-turned-famous Orlando Bloom wasn't enough, they also tossed Geoffery Rush, Keira Knightly and Johnny Depp in the mix, the latter of which would be a shame if the Academy Awards didn't nominate. The supporting cast is well done as well.The Acting: It wasn't surprising to see that Orlando Bloom did a great job, seeing as how his acting in Lord of the Rings really stood out. Keira Knightly put a good twist on the 'Damsel in Distress' stereotype by actually doing something instead of just moping about and screaming like most Damsels in Distress. However, Geoffery Rush and Johnny Depp really stole the show as Captain Barbossa and Captain Jack Sparrow, 2 sides of the same coin so to speak.The SFX: Also would be a shame if the Academy Awards didn't nominate. The transformation of the pirates is shown seemlessly and effortlessly. I was worried that the SFX Team would 'forget' to transform a pirate into a skeleton every now and then, but luckily they pulled through. The other effects are spectacular too, such as the boats, scenery and what not. Even some parts have better SFX than The Matrix ReloadedThe Twist: It's a Disney movie. It's PG-13. Now if that doesn't surprise you, this will. Blood, swears, explosions, people getting stabbed, people getting blown up, people losing their eyes (sort of, if you've seen the movie you know what I mean), use of alcohol, people getting their throats cut open, some real creepy parts (the skeletal monkey was one of them) and to top it all off, prostitutes... Disney should make more movies like this.So far, 2003 has been a fairly good year for movies (aside from Dumb and Dumberer, Legally Blonde 2, ect.) but this movie has shone out from the rest. However, the year is nearly drawing to an end, but there are still 2 more great movies coming out: The Matrix Revolutions and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. All in all Pirates of the Carribean will stand the test of time, much like Lord of the Rings and The Matrix will, and hopefully its impending sequels will too. I really hope the sequels don't put the Pirates underwater, like 99% of Disney sequels do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years best, pure fun start to finish, Depp is on Fire!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harking back to the days when Pirate films and fantasy films were being released with decidedly more regularity this film really brings the young imp inside us all out, the sort of young imp that takes delight in watching classic fantasy swashbucklers from the 80's such as the Princess Bride. I am a big fantasy film fan, I love to plonk on oldies like Krull, Labyrinth and this is the sort of film that really brings that desire back again, not quite to the same level that Lord of the Rings did but still this is a fantastic adventure movie.What you have here is your basic pirate/fantasy adventure storyline, there is treasure involved, ghosts and of course damsels to be rescued not a Princess but a governors daughter in this case. Considering that the last big studio pirate film was the pap Cutthroat Island and that this film is based off of a theme park ride the signs did look ominous that this would be pants, but the cast involved plus good scriptwriters and a very excitable trailer put pay to that and as such this has struck gold at the box office and is a critical and public success.The film has great set design, it looks great and there is real scale to it. The action is exciting, the score is chest thumpingly good and the film creates a sense of magic, this is movie making magic, it's a feel good summer movie and has likeable characters and a witty script, hence this seems to have got the best audience reaction I've heard in ages. This movie is about having a great time, it's not particularly meaningful but it is great all round family fun that doesn't suffer from dull patches or failed expectations.The cast are all good. Orlando Bloom is given a lead role for the first time and he handles himself well, Keira Knightly is feisty and sexy as the damsel in distress, who of course is whooping ass with the best of them by the end. Then there are Brit actors such as Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport and Kevin Mcnally who are all good. Geoffory Rush takes delight in chewing the scenery as the bad guy, but in typically show stopping form is Johnny Depp as Cap'n Jack Sparrow who plays him out like Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones (I s*** you not). Depp is superb, he makes the movie, the movie on its own right is pure fun and a good time but Depp really does add another level to it with his charm and his humour. He has boundless energy throughout the film and his cockney accent is faultless, Depp proves once again what a versatile actor he really. Until watching this filming I had not enjoyed a film so much this year aside from Nemo and X2. It was a rollicking good time with great effects, and also very funny. This is good news for the fantasy film genre, with it coming alive recently with hits like Lord of the Rings and Harry Porter perhaps we'll see some more, while perhaps not with the regularity of certain periods like the 50's or 80's. One of the years best most definitely.****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome romantic, comedic, action-adventure! A MUST-See!!!!! I loved this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action, romance, adventure, and tons of comedy. I laughed all the way through this extraordinary movie. You will sit on the edge of your seat through the entire movie wondering what's next. There were tons of surprises throughout this unique story line. It was totally awesome. Captain Jack Sparrow tries to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, by fighting some pirates who deserted him on an island long ago. The pirates who deserted him found a treasure that was cursed and need the blood of "Bootstrap" Bill Turner's only child to defeat the curse. They kidnap Elizabeth Swann, thinking she is the child. Jack tries to rescue her. Her father and the Commodore who wants to marry her also try to rescue her. Will she survive? Will she marry him? You will definitely fall in love with this movie. Anyone can enjoy it. Old, young, men, women, boys and girls. It's a romantic comedy, action-adventure, thriller. It is AWESOME!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mummy on the high seas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the 2nd trailer for this film, I thought to myself that it was "The Mummy" done at sea with pirates instead of in Egypt with mummies. But that's not a bad thing necessarily; this film is fun in an over the top, tongue in cheek kind of way. More a parody of pirate films than a real pirate film itself.Many people say that Johnny Depp makes this film as Captain Jack Sparrow, and while he certainly is fun to watch, every goofball needs a straight man to play off of, and Orlando "Legalos" Bloom does that about as well as anyone else out there would have. Oh and Keira Knightley is hot.The plot concerns Miss Keira being kidnapped by pirates (the ringleader played by Geoffrey Rush) who think that her blood will break a nasty curse hanging over them, all they need is to cut her hand open on the gold medallion in her possession by way of Orlando. The only problem is that it's actually Orlando Bloom's blood they need, not Keira's. But no one is aware of this right away so Orlando busts Johnny Depp out of jail and he agrees to help Orlando rescue the woman he loves.Chaos and mayhem ensues. It's fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swashbuckling, Imaginative Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a girl who doesn't always go for the cute guys (i.e. Orlando Bloom) or the romantic side of things (i.e. Elizabeth and Will), I was looking forward to a good, action-packed movie that wasn't like any other one this summer. I got it. Johnny Depp stole the movie with his hilarious presentation of Jack Sparrow, and Keira and Orlando were just wonderful in and of themselves (why couldn't Keira have been picked to play Queen/Senator Amidala in the Star Wars movies?!). Nostalgic scenes relating to the actual ride, powerful music, and so imaginative it makes you want to go do SOMETHING relating to pirates. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit this movie was better than I thought it might be. Johnny Depp is of course a great actor, and in this movie he displays once again his extraordinary ability to develop a unique and memorable on-screen persona in any movie in which he appears. This ability is made even more incredible by the staggering contrast between his real-life self and the characters he plays. Orlando Bloom has fewer lines than you might expect, but he does a good job with what's given to him. Overall this movie is not heavy on plot or on character development, but as an action movie about pirates it is as good or better than one can reasonably expect it to be. It may not be one of the best films ever made, but it is certainly good entertainment for your ticket money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that some critics just don't get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that the only people who didn't like this movie were the movie critics and their wanna-be's. And it's been my experience that if the critics don't like it, the audience does. Vice versa. It's one of those facts of life, I guess.Now, one could say it's because 'the audience just doesn't understand' as if we're just lambs to the slaughter, mindless drones who gobble up anything the masses tell us is fun and cool.Normally I'd agree, but I think this is one instance where the audience knows something the critics don't, not the other way around. Oh how I long for the days when a movie was watched for enjoyment and not the lighting concept alone.Oh wait, we're there. *in a stage whisper* Someone forgot to memo the critics and the wanna-be's.And for those who said they got lost in the plot twists, I just have to say: you can't multitask either, can you. That's not a question. A statement of fact.In short (or long as the case may be. I do tend to ramble.) I loved this movie. I found it entertaining in everyway possible; the F/X, the romance (a personal fave of mine), the comedy, the action. And that last one is saying something since usually I find the fight sequences in movies rather drawn out.I've seen this movie four times. That's right four. I enjoyed every minute of it. Not once did I feel the need to glance at the watch I don't wear. And I plan to see it many more.Sure you can say I have no life. That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. But seeing as it's my life, I think I'll spend it in a way that's most enjoyable to me. And since I found POTC very enjoyable, that's one of the things I'll do.I guess all I have to say is that those who didn't like it lost their imagination a long time ago. That's not something you should be checking at the door when you enter a theater, just so's you know.On a final note (yes, I promise I'm almost done), for those nonbelievers, take a look at the box office results. If the movie were that bad the word would spread like it did with Matrix Reloaded. You wanna talk bomb.JMHO.AL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all those out there who are knocking this movie, you are being much too harsh! You can't expect a life-changing experience from a Disney movie based on pirates and plunder, but you can expect a lot of fun.I would have never guessed the idea came from a ride in a theme park...With a cast of Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly, the constant witty humor and good vs. bad battle makes it so much fun to cheer for the good guys (Knightly and Bloom) and also the not so good guy (Depp). Depp was outrageously funny in this movie with his quirky humor and gestures, all three leads did an incredible acting job. Whenever Bloom had a funny line he delivered it perfectly, which just goes to show how versatile an actor he can be. I was impressed at the writing and plot which was easy to follow, and had fun twists along the way.This is really a movie that can appeal to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>just got out of this movie like 20 minutes ago and i loved it, well not so much it but him. Johnny depps role which all are raving about IS worth the hype. Ive never seen a more likable character in a summer movie he brought a screen presence like nothing i have seen before, and while he was amazing the movie itself was far from it, the cgi was top notch but it is a movie about pirates so it wears on u a bit, but everytime i looked at my watch i would miss some little gesture depp made that was hysterical, so i just stopped looking at my watch, and i think geoffery rush's character is being overlooked by a lot of people he was excellent as the other captain with some great one liners. only real issue with this movie was legolas (orlando bloom) he was nothing special by any means and made me somewhat angery because his character clashed so much with all the others, they all looked like they were having fun but he was a little too serious. but all in all a great movie, and im impressed with disney this summer they put out 2 of the best flicks this summer, even though they didnt quite touch 28 days later, or matrix reloaded. well done disney, and i think Depp deserves an award for keeping a 2:30 long movie alive by himself, not many actors can do that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aye Matey...'tis a fun family movie, it be. Go see it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun movie. I took my 5 kids ages 7 - 16 and they ALL loved it. The action is great and the special effects work well and are not overdone. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Capt. Jack Sparrow. He plays the part so realistically that you begin to believe he's really a pirate. Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly are all wonderful in their portrayals but Johnny Depp seems to steal the show. Major kudos for his accent. It's always nice when an actor takes the time to get the character into his blood. It makes it, as I said before, realistic.It's very expensive to take 5 children to the movies but we've seen "Pirates" twice, now. That in itself should say something. My 7 yr. old asked when we could buy it as soon as we walked out of the theater. My answer? ........YES!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was okay. The storyline and plot was good, except a lot of the funny parts they tried to make sound funny... didnt. The only parts that I thought were funny were with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and although they tried to put humor into the other characters, but I didnt think it was funny at all. Jack Sparrow cracked me up a lot though, but that was because he acted like a retard a lot.Overall... 3/4 I recomend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See other comment for more details: EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: THIRD PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILER FOR EXTRA SCENE!Please see my other comment, with the one line summary of "One of the best movies of all time!" for more information. I believe that is what it was called anyway.I recently saw this movie for the third time (once on a sneak preview 2 days early, once with a friend, and today with a relative) and I still am not at all sick of it! I love this movie! Everyone does a wonderful job, especially Orlando Bloom ;D and Johnny Depp : ). I give it 10 out of 10, and I would give it more if possible. Disregard the rumors that it is "too long"- none of the three times I have seen it have I felt bored or anxious for the next scene. Pirates of the Caribbean will keep you on the edge of your seat with excitement, or rolling on the floor laughing. Also do not believe it is a kids' movie. Kids will enjoy it, but it is made for more mature audiences. Other false rumors say that the accents are all fake (NOT TRUE!!!) or Orlando Bloom cannot act (WAY NOT TRUE!!! He is one of my 2 favorite actors). All in all it is AWESOME!!!I just had to add another comment to tell anyone who did not stick around for after the credits to tell them what they missed (NOTE: THIS IS A SPOILER!!!) There is a quick scene after the hundreds of boring credits that makes waiting worthwhile. It begins by showing Barbosa's green apple floating in the water just off the shore of Isle de Muert(o?). The camera shows random sights like Barbosa's body, the coins, the water, the gold, the treasure chest, and then switches to a view showing Jack the monkey swimming over to the stone chest of the cursed Aztec gold. The monkey then climbs to the top of the chest, takes a coin out, and turns back into a skeleton monkey. A perfect setup for a sequel! As seen on the Pirates of the Caribbean trivia section of this site, The Curse of the Black Pearl was added to the title after the first few previews came out in hopes that the movie would do well in the box office and a sequel could be made. And things are certainly looking promising! The movie has done excellently in the box office and I for one am highly anticipating (and hoping for) a follow up. Let's just hope it will be as great as the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, I can't say enough good things about it. There was minimal swearing, no explicit sex scenes or skanky outfits, and the script was great. My personal favorite character was Jack Sparrow cause he was sooo cute and did such a great job. At first I went to see it because Orlando was in it, but when I saw how much better Johnny was at acting, I loved it because of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"But you forget ... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing the Pirates of the Caribbean and all I can really say was it was one of the most fun and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. To me, it was more than just another "Johnny Depp movie" it was a look back at my childhood. I can remember being 5 years old on the Disney ride having the time of my life. In all honestly, there were several parts in the movie that almost looked like the robots from the original ride (such as the part when the 5 pirates are in the jail cell holding the bone so the dog with the keys in it's mouth would come near it) It was just great. The action was intense, the music was good, the sets and special effects were awesome, the acting was terrific, and the story line was nothing less then pure fun. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of amazing. You can tell he was having fun with it and really got into the character. I have never really been a big fan of Geoffrey Rush but he definitely pulled off playing Capt. Barbossa without a doubt. The only minor thing this film lacked was Orlando Bloom (you know, Legolis Greenleaf the elf) I think in LOTR he is excellent but this might have been over his head, although, he wasn't horrible, I'll say that. One thing that stood out to me was the violence. I loved it. It was, by far, the most ruthless Disney movie I have ever seen. Basically the bottom line is, I walked into the theater thinking this epic wouldn't be all that good and after 2 1/2 hours I walked out thinking it was a definite 4 star movie. Reccomend for sure ... extremely entertaining!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard mixed reviews about this movie, some of my friends told me that it was the best movie they had ever seen, and yet others told me it was garbage. Usually I am a harsh critic when it comes to movies, so I was pleasently suprised when I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.To me it was interesting that Disney would make a PG-13 movie, but I suppose that is how the winds are blowing these days. But it worked out well. Although I expected more blood and violence, and possibly cussing, I can see why the movie got the pg-13 mark even with it's lack of gratutity in most 13 films. Also I was suprised that the Director could have some redemption in this movie after making the oh-so-awful and stupid "The Ring".As for the acting, Johny Depp was also suprisingly excelent in this role. I dont think I would have casted Orlando Bloom for his role however. *Spoiler* At the end where he suddenly became a pirate it seemed more like he was still a blacksmith pretending to be a prirate than anything else.This movie is almost two and a half hours long, but never was too boring. The pace was constant and didnt drag on. Although long, it ended where it had to and I didnt feel borded or gyped.I give Pirates of the Carribian a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the film it was Gr8 I think that it was 1 of the best movies disney has made in years! The movie was not only exciting the first time I saw it I was on the edge of my seat not knowing what the cunning Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom would do next!! The Other elements that interested me were the stunts and special effects having the pirates turn into skeletons before your eyes were spectacular, the list of stunt men and women names in the credits were very long! One thing concerned me that "bootstrap Bill" William Turner Senior if he was shot off the Black Pearl, was he a living skeleton, wouldn't he be a living skeleton also with the rest of the crew? If he was he would be in the ocean unable to die giving him in the neighborhood of 10 years to get to land or be picked up by a ship! Whatever happened to him? Overall the Pirates of the Carribean is a "MUST SEA" that is sure to send you to the high seas!Other Movies I would recommend: Lord of the Rings The Fellowship, Lord of the Rings The Two Towers, Legally Blonde 2, and Finding NemoOther Movies I would not recommend: The Hulk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yo Ho! Yo Ho! A Pirate's Flick For Me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a burst of concentrated fun, with not a moment wasted. This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Everything about this movie is note-perfect; every character, every nuance, every ship and sail. Bruckheimer and Disney have really outdone themselves (this more than makes up for Pearl Harbor). Johnny Depp's performance is amazing and even funnier than his Ichabod Crane from Sleepy Hollow. Orlando Bloom does a great job in his first major non-Legolas role. Keira Knightly does fine, and so does Geoffrey Rush and the other cast; I could go on and on. The writing (and even ad-libbing) is great, as is Gore Verbinski's direction. This beats Cutthroat Island, Treasure Planet, Sinbad, every recent pirate/ sea-adventure movie out there. Why, this is the best pirate movie I've seen since The Goonies, and that's saying something. If you haven't seen this movie, then what are you waiting for? Or should I say, "Arrr! What are ye waiting for?" Drink up, me 'arties, yo ho!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly fun and funny flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney flicks aren't what they used to be, and that's a good thing for adults. Sure, they still crank out the silly kids' movies that have just enough adult humor to keep the parents relatively happy. But this one is not for kids.It's an action-adventure comedy that doesn't insult its audience with unbridled silliness. It was cleverly written and excellently played, especially the role of Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp.Though seemingly shallow, the character has surprising depth. Depp plays him as a quasi-homosexual, macho swordsman with a heart. He delivered his comic punch lines with impeccable timing and flawless expressions. He was the best part of a very good movie.Is Sparrow the hero or the villain? Sometimes it's hard to tell, because he's a little of both. He is a pirate, after all. So one would expect that he would have a streak of evilness about him. And so he does. But it's not an overriding character flaw, as he redeems himself on more than one occasion.Pirates of the Caribbean was a marvelously funny, action-packed adventure movie. It holds your attention throughout its 2-and-a-quarter hour running time. I usually say that if a director can't tell his story in under two hours, something needs to be cut. But this movie pulls it off throughout its length.I highly recommend it and gave it a rating of 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this movie thinking that it would be an action/adventure flick with some drama thrown into it. And while it turned out to be all this anyway, it was so much more. I couldn't believe how hilarious this movie was! I thought it had an interesting plot, and the casting job was perfect. I mean, who's gonna argue with looking at Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom for two hours??? Anyway, I had no problem going to see it a second time. It was totally entertaining and I would love to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so good that I still can't believe it. I loved every moment of the movie and never found it long or slow. This was undoubtedly my favorite movie of the year (Matrix Reloaded and Holes were my previous favorites - and no, I'm not under 30 LOL). Johnny Depp deserves an academy award for his brilliant performance IMO. It reminds me a bit of Lee Marvin's comedic character in Cat Ballou, which I believe he did win an academy award for. Not that the characters were that similar, but yet both roles provided the actor with the chance to really get into the role and create a totally unique character, and even though they were traditional "bad guy" roles (i.e. pirate, outlaw) they had heart and were funny and were indeed really the good guys. The FX are amazing, the story is amazing, the actors are amazing....what more can I say but check out this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, my top 6 list of movies is as follows: #1: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, #2: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, #3: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, #4: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, #5: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, #6: Monty Python and the Holy Graile. You probably noticed that #3 on my list is Pirates of the Caribbean. This movie, in my opinion, is a 10 out of 10 must-see film. I attended a sneak preview on July 7th (2 days before it came out where I live), saw it again recently, and am planning to see it again. I am also highly anticipating the DVD, and maybe even a sequel (if there is one, I hope so!). Not to mention riding the ride at Disney World! The premise is strange: A movie based on a thrill ride. But it certainly lives up to the reputation of its namesake ride, and is by far the best pirate movie yet to come out! Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) was my favorite character, and one of my 2 favorite actors. Johnny Depp, odd as he is, really made the movie as Captain Jack Sparrow. The storyline follows the classic love story, but doesn't "go overboard" on it. Boy meets girl, boy loves girl, girl gets lost, boy saves girl, girl loves boy. But there is much more to the movie than that. I highly recommend this excellent movie to anyone. At 2 1/2 hours long, it certainly takes a while, but you'll find yourself wishing for more. To find out more about the movie, go see it at a theater near you, savvy? (That's pirate for "understand?"). Avast, me maties, and prepare yerselves for one of the best movies of yer thievin' lives!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Carribean was excellent, Johnny Depp stole the show! He was perfect, his characterization was flawless, his humor was well-timed and not too over the top. The special effects were stunning, the scene with the pirates walking underwater towards the end was especially breathtaking. The fight scenes did seem a bit messy though, they could have been more choreographed, and did anyone notice that Orlando Bloom was an underappreciated waste of talent? I mean, I'm not saying he didn't do the best he could in the role he was given, he acted great and didn't ever look out of place, but maybe he should pick roles that better suited him. Well, that seems a bit harsh. He was fantastic in this role, this role was a good one, the movie was a definite A, but Orlando Bloom can do so much more as we've seen in LOTR. Maybe compared to LOTR, every other role is going to look like a second-best. Keira Knightley definitely kept the damsel in distress to a minimum, and she kicked butt when she could. She pulled off the perfect balance of vulnerability and spitfire. Well done cast and crew!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp was fantastic! I couldn't get enough. The overall story was hilarious but I don't think it would have worked out without Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. The story follows "Captain" Jack Sparrow with his dream of becoming captain of his own ship once again. When Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) offers him just that in order to save his love Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley). They are faced with the fact the shipmates on the Black Pearl are, indeed, dead. This causes a problem because they are incapable of winning back Elizabeth. The funny antics are guaranteed you to laugh until you cry. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit, the reason I went to see this movie was because I truly think Orlando Bloom running around in sexy clothes is WORTH every cent of money I pay! When the movie started, however...holy c**p! I have never laughed so much in a theater in my life. Johnny Depp is brilliant, totally surpassing anything he has ever done! His comedic timing is priceless and his portrayal left me at a loss of words. Orlando as the love-struck Will was also jaw-dropping, though many people say he was just there to be there and look good. I think Orlando is one of the actors we will be seeing a LOT of. Geffory Rush kicked major a** as an evil pirate who will stop at nothing to regain his life, and Knightly knows how to swoon anyone.

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp was fantastic! I couldn't get enough. The overall story was hilarious but I don't think it would have worked out without Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. The story follows "Captain" Jack Sparrow with his dream of becoming captain of his own ship once again. When Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) offers him just that in order to save his love Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley). They are faced with the fact the shipmates on the Black Pearl are, indeed, dead. This causes a problem because they are incapable of winning back Elizabeth. The funny antics are guaranteed you to laugh until you cry. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie unlike ANY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit, the reason I went to see this movie was because I truly think Orlando Bloom running around in sexy clothes is WORTH every cent of money I pay! When the movie started, however...holy c**p! I have never laughed so much in a theater in my life. Johnny Depp is brilliant, totally surpassing anything he has ever done! His comedic timing is priceless and his portrayal left me at a loss of words. Orlando as the love-struck Will was also jaw-dropping, though many people say he was just there to be there and look good. I think Orlando is one of the actors we will be seeing a LOT of. Geffory Rush kicked major a** as an evil pirate who will stop at nothing to regain his life, and Knightly knows how to swoon anyone. The movie all around was brilliant, one of my favorites!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpectedly fun and funny flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney flicks aren't what they used to be, and that's a good thing for adults. Sure, they still crank out the silly kids' movies that have just enough adult humor to keep the parents relatively happy. But this one is not for kids.It's an action-adventure comedy that doesn't insult its audience with unbridled silliness. It was cleverly written and excellently played, especially the role of Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp.Though seemingly shallow, the character has surprising depth. Depp plays him as a quasi-homosexual, macho swordsman with a heart. He delivered his comic punch lines with impeccable timing and flawless expressions. He was the best part of a very good movie.Is Sparrow the hero or the villain? Sometimes it's hard to tell, because he's a little of both. He is a pirate, after all. So one would expect that he would have a streak of evilness about him. And so he does. But it's not an overriding character flaw, as he redeems himself on more than one occasion.Pirates of the Caribbean was a marvelously funny, action-packed adventure movie. It holds your attention throughout its 2-and-a-quarter hour running time. I usually say that if a director can't tell his story in under two hours, something needs to be cut. But this movie pulls it off throughout its length.I highly recommend it and gave it a rating of 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this movie thinking that it would be an action/adventure flick with some drama thrown into it. And while it turned out to be all this anyway, it was so much more. I couldn't believe how hilarious this movie was! I thought it had an interesting plot, and the casting job was perfect. I mean, who's gonna argue with looking at Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom for two hours??? Anyway, I had no problem going to see it a second time. It was totally entertaining and I would love to see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so good that I still can't believe it. I loved every moment of the movie and never found it long or slow. This was undoubtedly my favorite movie of the year (Matrix Reloaded and Holes were my previous favorites - and no, I'm not under 30 LOL). Johnny Depp deserves an academy award for his brilliant performance IMO. It reminds me a bit of Lee Marvin's comedic character in Cat Ballou, which I believe he did win an academy award for. Not that the characters were that similar, but yet both roles provided the actor with the chance to really get into the role and create a totally unique character, and even though they were traditional "bad guy" roles (i.e. pirate, outlaw) they had heart and were funny and were indeed really the good guys. The FX are amazing, the story is amazing, the actors are amazing....what more can I say but check out this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as entrances go into a film, only Darth Vader surpasses Captain (never forget the prefix to his name) Jack Sparrow. Depp steals this movie from the first scene he is in on. I love Legolas, but i don't really want to see Bloom play him in every one of his films. He did not take his character in a different direction from the swashbuckling, sleek, bravery in the face of certain death in this film. There was charisma in this film as opposed to the other "blockbuster" opening this week (ehhemm. cough hack, LXG cough, hack.) Keira Knightly was delicious in her portrayal of a non-stereotypical, albeint a little predictable damsel in distress yet in love woman of the era. The effects were very impressive. What can I say, Bruckheimer knows how to blow crap up. This movie is not one of those "absolutely must see" movies, but it is worth going to go see in the theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a "good fun for the family" movie, if you prefer your adventure soft boiled. I can't quite decide whether Johhny Depp makes the movie better or worse. Without him it would certainly have been drearier, but with him it takes the movie from adventure to amusement park ride. He plays a scalawag pirate who is more of a swish, than swash, buckler. He teeters rather than swaggers, bombs out with the ladies, and never shows us any of the skills of a former Pirate Captain. He's the modern androgynous anti hero we've had to put up with since "real men" departed the movies.Geoffery Rush on the other hand is the anchor that holds this flimsy vehicle down. He is plays evil properly: with cold amusement, and a solid sense of his own superiority. He adds just the right trace of despair at his condition, and avoids all of Depp's silly stereotypical "Pirate" babble. A more ironic Director would have allowed him to escape his formulaic ending.Unfortunately the movie doesn't know how to take itself seriously, when that is required, preferring to trot in a comedy relief duo when no such relief is required, and to insist on allowing Depp's character to stay dizzily in character, when I, for one, desperately wanted him to show some passion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pirate's Life For Me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard this film touted as "the most violent Disney film ever made", I wasn't quite certain what to expect. The trailers seemed to combine the adult appeal of such big names as producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski with the childish whimsy of an extended, "Spy Kids 2"-esque title and the always kid-friendly Disney logo. While I expected a decent popcorn flick, I was still worried this would simply be a mutinous attempt to make a grab for the collective treasure of the preteen through adult market.Interestingly enough, it was a skilled combination of these seemingly mutually exclusive elements that made this film work. For a film so reliant on visual effects, care was taken that they not be the focus of the film. A decent (if simplistic) kidnapping plot expands to an epic tale of cursed pirates. A surprising amount of Disney humor is woven with non-stop action sequences and dazzling CG effects. The pirate-to-skeleton transitions are done masterfully, proving this yet another beautifully laid notch on the belt of ILM.Orlando Bloom plays his underwritten part decently, despite clearly expending less effort than his co-star Johnny Depp as the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush could not be more compelling as the treacherous Captain Barbossa, and Kiera Knightley shines in a mildly stereotypical damsel-in-distress-turned-heroine role.Verbinski's direction continues to impress. This skillful director of "The Ring" is just beginning what will hopefully be an illustrious career.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since May, it has seemed as if 2003 was going to be just a run of the mill summer full of so-so sequels, average action movies, and very little of anything to look back on. In total, it may still turn out that way, but thanks to Finding Nemo from Disney/Pixar and now Pirates of the Caribbean from Disney, there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel. They not only broke the mold by giving us a Pirate movie of all things, they gave us a Pirate Movie that is exciting, humorous, adventurous, suspense filled, and filled with excellent performances all the way around. It is one heck of a good time at the movies. Pirates of the Caribbean is everything that Cutthroat Island wish it could have been, but didn't even come close to realizing. Renny Harlin and Geena Davis, eat your hearts out.Make no mistake about it. From the moment he steps onto the dock as Jack Sparrow, this is Johnny Depp's film. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who wants to regain his ship from the evil Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush). In order to do so, he is forced to join forces with Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom)to rescue the girl Will is sweet on, Elizabeth Swann (played by Keira Knightly). Depp's characterization of Sparrow is so memorable, that even when he isn't on the screen you are thinking about him. All the actors are excellent in their roles, with high marks all the way around. Keira Knightly shows more then just a feminine side in Elizabeth Swann, Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa is just evil enough to make a good villain, yet not so menacing as to bog the picture down. Orlando Bloom has the thankless role of playing the mostly straight arrow good guy, but he does it well, playing the part as it should be while knowing full well that doing so makes this Depp's film. That is not an easy thing to do in any film.The battle sequences and sword fights are staged to perfection by Gore Verbinski. They are never confusing, even when there is a screen full of pirates having a bit of swordplay. Though the movie is a bit long, you never think about it as Verbinski keeps his film paced just right, while at the same time letting you get to know all you need to know about his characters.A movie based on a Disneyland ride could just never work, and a Pirate Movie at that. That's what I and many others thought before seeing Pirates of the Caribbean. I hereby, eat one heck of a lot of hay, and am very happy to do so.Next Class Please</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes a pretty good movie for me to spend $9.50 per person twice in one weekend. But for this movie, I'd even do it again. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl has action, comedy, romance, swordfighting, swashbuckling, drunken brawls, and some really great lines. But while the movie itself is fun and has great special effects, its crowning glory is Depp's portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow. His wry comments and sheer panache provide some of the most memorable and hilarious moments in the film. And the mannerisms he adopts make Jack even more priceless, from the constant swaying walk of a man too long at sea to his facial expressions, which even without dialogue provoke laughter. As far as I'm concerned, Depp's Sparrow goes onto my list of the all-time best characters in film, with the likes of Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham, Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya, and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector.I can safely say that I'll be at the store to pick up the DVD when it comes out, and hitting the theater again for a sequel is a definite yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the movie theater with a bit of a bias - Pirates of the Caribbean has always been my favorite ride and I really like Johnny Depp. I thought these notions might work against me. Could someone actually capture the magic of a favorite amusment park ride on the silver screen? The answer is yes. This isn't the greatest movie ever made, the moral isn't profound, the script isn't Shakespeare, and the plot is a bit thin. However, it's a tremendous amount of fun. What makes it so much fun is that they truly captured the feel of the ride. It's all there: the yo-ho yo-ho a pirates life me for me song, the inmates luring the dog with a bone, the ghost ship, and the town pillage scene. The story line is simple, pirates steal cursed treasure and then hunt for the last piece of the puzzle to break said curse. The acting is superb. Of course, how can it not be with Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush? I was also quite impressed with the special effects and the cinematography. Usually I think all special effects are unnecessay, but these definately added to the movie experience. I rated this movie a 9, not because I think it is as cinematically magnificent as Casablanca or Schindler's List, but because it was thoroughly entertaining and it made me feel like I was a six year old kid at Disneyland. If you are looking for Citizen Kane or don't care much for pirates, you probably won't like this movie. If, however, you are a kid at heart and want to spend $7.50 (or $10.00, depending on where you live) on a good time, go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this short and sweet.I went into Pirates of the Carribean as a longtime fan of the ride, having been to disney world about 17 times all throughout my life. Many fond memories of the classic ride.I used to love Disney, before they stopped making quality musicals like the Little Mermaid and focused their attention on ruining their theme parks with stupid deletions/changes of rides, ludicrous closing times (6 pm!?), over emphasis on being 100% P.C. and not p***ing anyone off (rather than putting out quality material), and of course exploiting every single movie they ever made with a cheesy ham handed sub par "sequel" (SNL went as far as mocking them with a bit called "Bambi 2000". You figure it out.)Overall, I hate Disney's movies. Anyone see "Snowdogs"? Didn't think so. I went into "Pirates of the Carribean" thinking it was going to be another dumb "strictly-for-little-kids" fart-joke fest, with poor dialouge, a trite plot, crappy acting and general badness.I'm also a film major, and I know my stuff when it comes to movies.You could say I was probably the toughest audience member they could have had. ....and I was completely and utterly blown away. Blown. Away.Disney, somehow, released something that was devoid of all fart jokes, with no lame jokes or bad acting, or exploitation, something that wasn't watered down or cut or anything. In fact, it was completely AWESOME.They've managed to create a film that has all the wonderful fun, adventurous spirit of the old disney movies that everyone loved as a kid. It's as though Walt himself was watching over this project in some way. All the emotions I experienced riding the ride as a kid came back to me...the forboding &amp; sense of death lurking about, adventure, danger, and even humor...yes, that's right - they managed to NOT screw up the jokes at all - with a sense of flair and style that you could only expect from disney. Depp gives a smashing performance, his best since Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas, and the rest of the cast is positively top notch. The plot is creative enough to leave you guessing, but it still fits within the confines of a classic Romantic Narrative...and it was such a blast to watch.That was the most important thing - I'm 20, and I was sitting in a theatre watching a new disney movie.....and I was ENJOYING every MINUTE of it.GO SEE THIS.

		<shortDescription>I can't think of the last time I was that entertained.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie theater with a bit of a bias - Pirates of the Caribbean has always been my favorite ride and I really like Johnny Depp. I thought these notions might work against me. Could someone actually capture the magic of a favorite amusment park ride on the silver screen? The answer is yes. This isn't the greatest movie ever made, the moral isn't profound, the script isn't Shakespeare, and the plot is a bit thin. However, it's a tremendous amount of fun. What makes it so much fun is that they truly captured the feel of the ride. It's all there: the yo-ho yo-ho a pirates life me for me song, the inmates luring the dog with a bone, the ghost ship, and the town pillage scene. The story line is simple, pirates steal cursed treasure and then hunt for the last piece of the puzzle to break said curse. The acting is superb. Of course, how can it not be with Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush? I was also quite impressed with the special effects and the cinematography. Usually I think all special effects are unnecessay, but these definately added to the movie experience. I rated this movie a 9, not because I think it is as cinematically magnificent as Casablanca or Schindler's List, but because it was thoroughly entertaining and it made me feel like I was a six year old kid at Disneyland. If you are looking for Citizen Kane or don't care much for pirates, you probably won't like this movie. If, however, you are a kid at heart and want to spend $7.50 (or $10.00, depending on where you live) on a good time, go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With action, comedy, romance, and, above all, pirates, this is the perfect summer movie! The cast is superb. Johnny Depp is hilarious as the over-the-top rouge pirate, Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom, probably cast for the ladies ;-), is very handsome and makes a great blacksmith-turned-pirate, Will Turner. Newcomer Keira Knightney is a beautiful and talented girl (only 17 years old at the time of shooting) who will go far in her career. Her portrayal of governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann was wonderfully fiesty underneath her upright exterior. Geoffrey Rush was delightfully frightening as evil pirate Captain Barbossa. This movie had wonderful visual effects, the best being during a swordfight in a moonlit cave. Although not suitable for the youngest viewers, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fun way to spend a couple hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good swashbucklers just aren't in style anymore. It's been years since a pirate has sailed into the box office and made movie making history. But the applause must go to Disney for this grand achievement which can truly be deemed an 'epic.' Pirates of the Caribbean is in the grand old style of Errol Flynn. Not only are the sword fights grand, the escapes harrowing, and the cast top-notch, but the plot is truly brilliant and the two and a half hour pace never seems to lag. Most viewers will find themselves swept into an adventure unlike any other with a beautiful damsel in distress, a handsome rogue as her rescuer, and a motley crew of bloodthirsty buccaneers to provide the backdrop.Though the plot may seem fairly cut and dried, the script is actually far more complex than a simple summary might surmise. Full of surprising plot twists, witty dialogue, excellent swordplay, and some truly astonishing CGI battles, Pirates of the Caribbean deserves a sailor's welcome. Much has been made over actor Johnny Depp 'improvising' the character of Jack Sparrow. He really goes out on a limb with his interpretation of a slightly batty, overall likable, and sometimes downright sinister former (perhaps reformed, perhaps not) pirate captain. The thing is, it totally works. His gold-toothed smile, his half-slurred speech, and his 'sea legs on land' stride never fails to engage a laugh. His own entrance to the film is particularly memorable, one of the movie's best comic moments.This is one of the most stunningly visual movies I've ever seen. The costuming was beautiful, the backdrop romantic, and some of the cinematography, like a pirate ship sailing under a full moon, downright jaw-dropping. This film deserves a number of Oscar nominations for merit alone, and that's not including the excellent performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and British beauty Kiera Knightley. There's enough humor to elevate some of the darker elements, and for once it's eye candy which pays off for the two-plus hours spent in a cramped theatre seat. But a final word of advice for those of ye brave enough to forge these waters... stay until after the closing credits. There's a tantalizing little tidbit which will leave you thirsting for more..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was great family entertainment inline with the movie's Disney used to put out in the 60's and 70's. Tension, action, romance, fights, but only one kiss, no gore, and only artfully placed signs of blood!!! The comedy is great. Of course if you don't like cheesey humor, this movie may not be to your taste. This movie pokes fun at stereotypes and is the finest cheesey fun I have seen in a long time. I just saw it for the second time and I know I will buy it when it comes out. If you have been to Disneyland and have been on the ride, you will love all the sight gags that are placed in the film. Don't let that stop you thoug, my friend has never been to Disneyland and he almost hurt himself laughing, and he didn't even know there was a corelation. That's cudos for the creators of the ride in making memeorable and funny images. I would rate this a must see for most of the family. Little children could get nightmares from the skeletons and teenagers may think they are too cool to like it. Other than that, everyone else should love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, first off, this movie rocks, but the thing that really sets it aside, really, truly sets it aside (especially after seeing the new Charlie's Angels) was that *wow* they used realistic physics in their special effects!Maybe one scene, one, in the whole movie was exaggerated, and not by much. In addition, everything is perfectly balanced, like the person who's comments I just read noted, it has everything, but not excessive amounts, and the things it does have are done so well you won't care anyway.I would have to say that this is the best new movie I've seen in a very, very long time. Anyone who likes action and adventure, you need to see this right now, especially if you're a big fan of the whole pirate theme.P.S. Don't let the Disney label throw you...this is definately an excellent film for people of all ages (and from what I can tell all sexes and most demographics).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best pirate movies I've seen, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, it's innocent enough. (Capt.) Jack Sparrow is a likeable, although a bit fruity, pirate. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful breakaway from the LOTR saga, and Keira Knightly swoons with the best. The problem? It's just a wee bit long in the tooth. Eye candy like the ghastly special effects and great scenery notwithstanding, the entire last half hour could have been 10 minutes or so.Other than that, I would highly recommend seeing this movie. The history is dealt out in small parcels along the length of the movie, allowing you to digest each bit without giving too much away. There is enough doing without explaining to make the movie a bit more intelligent than then industry standard would normally allow, and the sword fighting is reminiscent of black and white film. (A good thing)Just remember: Commodore isn't a royal navy rank. It's a temporary title given to a Captain in charge of other captains when an Admiral isn't nearby. They should have made the officer in question an Admiral. It's a small change, but it made me distrust the movie in the first 10 minutes. They won me back, but it's still dead wrong.</fullReview>

Of course the plot had all of the expected elements ... damsel in distress, unacceptable suitor, nasty pirate with a conscience, incompetent naval officers ... but the cast made it all seem fresh, and the pace kept me captivated until the end. This movie is fun!</fullReview>

Sword fights and cannon blasts and walking talking skeletons oh my! The plot was more existent than that of Charlie's Angels and more realistic (ironically), which is a nice change from the general summer offerings. As usual, Bruckheimer spared no expense in transporting his actors and audience into the era of the pirate-run Caribbean.

I want long black hair and dreads with beads and charms hangin' on 'em. I want a blade and a pistol, big leather boots, dark waterproof eyeliner, and a trident hat that's seen one too many battles and trips to Tortuga. I want to swing from ropes and climb on fallen masts, I want to sing YO HO! YO HO! and drink bottles upon bottles of rum on the beach of a deserted island. Unfortunately, in my case, all this would entail some major costuming, props and sex-change surgery.I should probably just buy the video game ;)This exciting and fresh foray into the classic cult pirate genre garners nine out of ten stars... savvy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good swashbucklers just aren't in style anymore. It's been years since a pirate has sailed into the box office and made movie making history. But the applause must go to Disney for this grand achievement which can truly be deemed an 'epic.' Pirates of the Caribbean is in the grand old style of Errol Flynn. Not only are the sword fights grand, the escapes harrowing, and the cast top-notch, but the plot is truly brilliant and the two and a half hour pace never seems to lag. Most viewers will find themselves swept into an adventure unlike any other with a beautiful damsel in distress, a handsome rogue as her rescuer, and a motley crew of bloodthirsty buccaneers to provide the backdrop.Though the plot may seem fairly cut and dried, the script is actually far more complex than a simple summary might surmise. Full of surprising plot twists, witty dialogue, excellent swordplay, and some truly astonishing CGI battles, Pirates of the Caribbean deserves a sailor's welcome. Much has been made over actor Johnny Depp 'improvising' the character of Jack Sparrow. He really goes out on a limb with his interpretation of a slightly batty, overall likable, and sometimes downright sinister former (perhaps reformed, perhaps not) pirate captain. The thing is, it totally works. His gold-toothed smile, his half-slurred speech, and his 'sea legs on land' stride never fails to engage a laugh. His own entrance to the film is particularly memorable, one of the movie's best comic moments.This is one of the most stunningly visual movies I've ever seen. The costuming was beautiful, the backdrop romantic, and some of the cinematography, like a pirate ship sailing under a full moon, downright jaw-dropping. This film deserves a number of Oscar nominations for merit alone, and that's not including the excellent performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and British beauty Kiera Knightley. There's enough humor to elevate some of the darker elements, and for once it's eye candy which pays off for the two-plus hours spent in a cramped theatre seat. But a final word of advice for those of ye brave enough to forge these waters... stay until after the closing credits. There's a tantalizing little tidbit which will leave you thirsting for more..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was great family entertainment inline with the movie's Disney used to put out in the 60's and 70's. Tension, action, romance, fights, but only one kiss, no gore, and only artfully placed signs of blood!!! The comedy is great. Of course if you don't like cheesey humor, this movie may not be to your taste. This movie pokes fun at stereotypes and is the finest cheesey fun I have seen in a long time. I just saw it for the second time and I know I will buy it when it comes out. If you have been to Disneyland and have been on the ride, you will love all the sight gags that are placed in the film. Don't let that stop you thoug, my friend has never been to Disneyland and he almost hurt himself laughing, and he didn't even know there was a corelation. That's cudos for the creators of the ride in making memeorable and funny images. I would rate this a must see for most of the family. Little children could get nightmares from the skeletons and teenagers may think they are too cool to like it. Other than that, everyone else should love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best pirate movies I've seen, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, it's innocent enough. (Capt.) Jack Sparrow is a likeable, although a bit fruity, pirate. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful breakaway from the LOTR saga, and Keira Knightly swoons with the best. The problem? It's just a wee bit long in the tooth. Eye candy like the ghastly special effects and great scenery notwithstanding, the entire last half hour could have been 10 minutes or so.Other than that, I would highly recommend seeing this movie. The history is dealt out in small parcels along the length of the movie, allowing you to digest each bit without giving too much away. There is enough doing without explaining to make the movie a bit more intelligent than then industry standard would normally allow, and the sword fighting is reminiscent of black and white film. (A good thing)Just remember: Commodore isn't a royal navy rank. It's a temporary title given to a Captain in charge of other captains when an Admiral isn't nearby. They should have made the officer in question an Admiral. It's a small change, but it made me distrust the movie in the first 10 minutes. They won me back, but it's still dead wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2003 (So Far)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most children grow up dreaming of being modern day pirates. Many of us have ridden The Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney Land and dreamed of wearing an eye patch and drawing our swords. Yet, most of us have been deprived of a big screen picture that not only captured our eight bucks, but our imagination as well.But leave it to Jerry Bruckheimer &amp; Co. to bring our youth a picture that can give them the same dreams and creative thoughts that compelled us. However, we must not be fooled by the appearance of this movie. The Curse of the Black Pearl is a film for men and women of all ages.Director Gore Verbinski has come a long way from his days of mediocre films such as The Mexican and Mouse Hunt. He even manages to out do the quality of his last film, 2002's brilliant fright fest The Ring. While not near as horror oriented, Pirates of the Caribbean still takes you on a roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement.Orlando Bloom is decent as Will Turner, the blacksmith in love with the one woman he cannot have. Yet, among the supporting cast he is overshadowed by both Keira Knightly, who plays Bloom's love interest Elizabeth Swan, and Geoffrey Rush who displays his character acting abilities as Captain Barbossa. Both do an amazing job and stand out amongst all the sword fighting and piracy.However, it is Johnny Depp who is truly amazing in this film. His ability to transform into a character is absolutely amazing, and as Captain Jack Sparrow he stumbles upon his greatest role since Edward Scissorhands. Even thrown in with the elaborate backdrops and jaw-dropping ships, it is Depp who catches the viewers attention.With an amazing ensemble cast Verbinski is able to transport into the realm of swash-buckling pirates and mutinous first mates. Unlike predecessors, Verbinski creates the best Pirate movie since Roman Polanski's Pirates (1986) and the best movie yet released in 2003.</fullReview>

Also johnny Depp(captain jack sparrow) who was also in the movie made it so much better because he is such a great actor and plus, Orlando Bloom(will turner)who also plays a major role in this movie is so hot, talented, and sweet, and of course there is also Keira Knightley(elizabeth swann) who has that princess type of look which makes the movie seem more in the past or when pirates used to wander our oceans. Over all I thought the movie was great and I hope they make a sequel to this movie. (Orlando's #1 fan), Lauren</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, I have never been one to go for theme park ride inspired movies, especially rides from Disney -Youarehavingsomefunnowyes?- Land. Then I saw the trailer for Pirates of the Caribbean. Then I found out Geoffrey Rush was playing the bad guy. And then I was sold.All in all Pirates of the Caribbean surprises on many levels, mostly (for me) in the special effects department. The animated skeletons, while still retaining the all to fluid movement of CGI, are much more believable than, say, some other CGI effects in much more high profile movies.The music to the film is very fine, especially the end-credit piece, something I had not been counting on. The movie is very well cast, particularly in the case of Jonathan Pryce as a somewhat bumbling, but well-meaning father-of-the- heroine. And of course there is Johnny Depp, who seems to be vying with Guy Pearce (in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,) for the Most Flamboyant Character Portrayal Award. He truly takes the viewing experiance to the next level. Then there is Orlando Bloom, who seems all set to take over from Errol Flynn despite the fact that he has, with out a doubt, probably the worst role in the whole film. Geoffrey Rush is quite well cast in his part as Major Baddie in Chief, and seems to be having way to much fun with that monkey of his.Oh yes, and I should really say something about Keira Knightley, she is good, better than most. But I would have still preferred to see Franka Potente in this part. Oh well.Truth be told, Pirates of the Caribbean is a rolicking good time, although younger kids (and older ones, too,) may get nightmares, so be warned. I myself thoroughly enjoyed it, and cannot wait to see it again.Warning: Johnny Depp's character is highly contagious, after viewing this movie I spent the rest of the day prancing about looking as though I was a member of the Ministry of Silly Walks, Naval Devision, and speaking with a low caliber English accent. Just thought I might warn you, although if you are a teenager it doesn't really matter.--- Jaiko</fullReview>

Is it the rum the ..."blow to the head" or the ruse used to disarm adversaries? Who knows and really who cares. Depp is just terrific as Captain Sparrow.It is a bit on the long side at plus two hours but the movie was fun and my grand kids thought it was just "the best".Some have said it was scary but my aunts Cocker Spaniel is scarier then this film, but that is ok too. it is a neat and well done movie and I say it is an 8 out of ten...my best score this year I think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little skeptical going into this movie for 3 reasons 1)Disney 2) based on a Disney ride and 3) pirates, which I don't normally go for, unless it's Adam Ant. But I had faith in Depp, because he is in so many wonderful, quirky movies, and damn, he didn't let me down! Depp owns this movie. He was so funny and heartfelt and wild. I'm almost positive they'll make a sequel to this movie because Depp's Cpt. Sparrow is going to be so widely loved. Although I found Bloom and Knightley a little bland, the rest of the cast was super. Geoffrey Rush was excellent, somewhat reminiscent of his Sade in "Quills," which I loved. I didn't think the CGI was overkill at all. The skeletal pirates were awesome, but I most enjoyed the ship battles and swinging from the rigging stuff. Great fight choreography, beautiful settings and costumes. Again, esp. on Depp whose dreads, braids, gold teeth, and kohl-rimmed eyes is enough to make girls (corset-wearing or not) swoon. I'm so going to see this one again!! Story: 8/10 (10 being best) Depp: 100+/10</fullReview>

If anyone ever needed to see a movie that carries every aspect of a good movie this one is it. It has humor, beauty, intelligence, and so much non stop over the edge action. Johnny Depp hasn't been this fabulous since Edward Scissorhands. He is truly amazing. As for Orlando Bloom, this totally marks him as a truly versatile and wondrous actor, taking the much needed step away from Legolas, which I have to say is just brilliant.

I haven't had so much fun at the movies in ages.The casting is stand-up-and-applaudable, the action never once loses its rhythm, and the visuals are immersive and convincing.

I refuse to give away anything other than to say I was wrong to fret.There were plenty of children in the cinema around me. None seemed troubled by the film, but keep in mind that those skeleton scenes are very realistic. (Also keep in mind that children who cannot reliably speak quietly in the cinema need to be left at home. Please don't break the mood of this wonderful film for the rest of us just because you either can't find a babysitter or have an unfortunate entitlement mentality. Grr. Arrrr.)Oh, and if someone hasn't mentioned it yet (I'm sure they have), you need to stay all the way through the long, long credits. Nothing spectacular happens, but you will need to see the end-bit to fully discuss the film.The best pirate movie ever. Ever.

Johnny Depp hasn't been this fabulous since Edward Scissorhands. He is truly amazing.

		<shortDescription>Not expecting much, got surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't write many reviews or summaries but i believe this movie deserves one. I went into the movie expecting it to be horrible. After seeing the trailers with skeletons walking around trying to act scary and Keira Knightley saying "like pain, try wearing a corset!" I expected to be walking into a bad movie. As soon as Johnny Depp hits the screen the movie became good. His character was funny and entertaining and of course he "is the best pirate i have ever seen." Knightley's stupid line was explained before hand so it really wasn't that bad but a couple of things i thought could be improved were that Orlando Blooms character was a wuss and i expected much more (after all he is legolas) and the movie was really long. It didnt really lose your interest, its just that they could have chopped 30 minutes off of it. Not really big complaints and definatly worth the 7 dollars to see it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A LOT of fun!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED this movie! It didn't try to be too serious, it didn't try to be anything it wasn't. It was campy (in a good way), funny, spooky...just plain FUN! I was hoping that it was as good as all the trailers looked and it didn't disappoint. The acting was really good, the sets and scenery were fantastic, and you can never have enough sword play! And there is no need to discuss how cool the cursed crew was because they were just that...just plain COOL!!! Awesome job ILM!!!Okay, I'll admit it...I am a HUGE Johnny Depp fan, and his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of magnificent, and I could go on and on forever about his wonderful performance. Having said that the other actors deserve some praise too! Geoffrey Rush was a GREAT villain (but then, that goes without saying because he's good at everything he does), and Orlando Bloom was a great romantic lead...he was very handsome, swashbuckling, funny when the situation called for it, and I thought he had really nice chemistry with his lady love. Don't know much about Keira Knightley, but she was very good as the damsel in distress...but not that MUCH distress. Feisty governor's daughter, wasn't she???After all the hype about this movie I was afraid of a let down (see the last two Star Wars movies!) but I was NOT disappointed! I plan on seeing this movie again...and probably again!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is a great summer movie that never takes itself too seriously. I don't think since Toy Story has Disney had such a remarkable movie on its hands: one parents and children alike can enjoy. This film covers all audiences and is an excellent date movie.

		<shortDescription>adventure? excitement? this movie delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the Pirates of the Caribbean is probably one of the few films that sets out to show you a good time and holds nothing back in the delivery. The idea of this movie may have been taken from an attraction at a theme park but that is where line ends. This movie is amazing. The action is spectacular and not overly graphic so everyone can enjoy this movie. The special effects were incredible. Not the best around but very convincing. During the final fight between Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush the effects are flawless. But the thing that i enjoyed so much was the humor. the fact that this movie was not meant to be taken seriously was very appealing. The two british guards adding the color comedy during the entire movie as well as the two bumbling pirates. The characters were another huge asset to this movie and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is probably the best i have seen him in lately. Geoffery Rush is equally good as the cursed pirate Captain Barbossa and Orlando Bloom is quite good as Will. All in all this movie should be seen by anyone wanting to have a good time watching a movie. I guarantee that you will walk out with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film for everyone except annoying nitpickers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) is an exceptional film unique in our film scene today. Not only have pirate films not been common since the days of Errol Flynn, but as others have put it, they portray leads that have a mixed standing in America; half hero, half villain.Johnny Depp is exceptional in PotC as Captain Jack Sparrow, playing a rather cunning, if down on luck pirate in the eyes of both the British guard and amongst his fellow pirates. He provides much comic relief with his laid back swagger and in-conversation wise cracks. He does his good pirate/bad pirate thing well, and when Orlando Bloom is asked whose side he's on, Bloom tells it like it is; "Ours... for now."Orlando Bloom and his love interest Keira Knightley, daughter of the Governor, fit their roles well as a rather scrawny blacksmith and well versed swordsman and very slightly tomboyish young lady with agendas different from her father's, respectively. Bloom and Depp have pretty decent and sometimes funny chemistry when interacting, and the more romantic scenes between Knightley and Bloom are a cut above the rest.Where PotC also shines is in the visuals. The pirate/skeleton changing due to the exposure to certain kinds of light is flawless, and will most definitely get at least an Oscar nomination, if not the statuette. The fight scenes, consisting mostly of sword duels and intra-ship cannon warfare, are well done and look very realistic, even in scenes between the evil skeleton pirates and the protagonists. The imagery back on Bloom's home island of the British redcoats, old cobblestone streets and the moorings on the coast are also very well done.Some homages are paid to the ride in Disneyworld, but this isn't just some kiddie-park ride. Everyone can enjoy this movie, except for some nitpickers; with most period pieces and movies in general, they can find inaccuracies. But if you find some, don't despair; the movie is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i didnt really like this one as much, maybe because i'm just a pure action chick with a thirst for better acting from Mr. Bloom. I like seeing him better as a kick-butt elf- but thats only my opinion. I think Johnny Depp did the best acting there. He really did a great job being "the worst pirate there is" and totally brought his character to life. The walk, the talk, the comedic performance here and there.. i'd give Mr. Depp an A+. Orlando, all i have to say is- i think you should've done more Pirate homework instead of Elf homework.. Sorry!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so proud of Disney! This movie definitely lived up to my expectations. Johnny Depp was hilarious, Orlando Bloom did a wonderful job, and Keira Knightley did wonderful as well. This movie was funny, creepy, and engaging. I didn't find myself looking at my watch once, which is always an indicator of a good movie. This movie was very well made and the special effects were just awesome. I hope this movie does well. I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've already commented twice on this (that's how much I love this film!) because I can't get all my thoughts through in one.This one is dedicated to the fantastic actorsTwo of my favorite actors are Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp (and although they are gorgeous, that's not my reasoning, I assure you). This is one of my favorite movies johnny has acted in. He was AMAZING! The character was funny enough and entertaining, but like in everything else he does, He made this character above and beyond. He was the funniest part, and he made the character come to life. He was a rouge through and through just what the movie called for.Orlando is always fantastic. This was no exception. Every swashbuckling films needs the heroic lead. and he did it wonderfully. He was romantic, passionate, heroic...the list goes on and ends with PERFECT! And yet he was still funny (especially his impression of Johnny Depp!)Well done to the casting directors!</fullReview>

I was hoping that it was as good as all the trailers looked and it didn't disappoint. The acting was really good, the sets and scenery were fantastic, and you can never have enough sword play! And there is no need to discuss how cool the cursed crew was because they were just that...just plain COOL!!! Awesome job ILM!!!Okay, I'll admit it...I am a HUGE Johnny Depp fan, and his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of magnificent, and I could go on and on forever about his wonderful performance. Having said that the other actors deserve some praise too! Geoffrey Rush was a GREAT villain (but then, that goes without saying because he's good at everything he does), and Orlando Bloom was a great romantic lead...he was very handsome, swashbuckling, funny when the situation called for it, and I thought he had really nice chemistry with his lady love. Don't know much about Keira Knightley, but she was very good as the damsel in distress...but not that MUCH distress. Feisty governor's daughter, wasn't she???After all the hype about this movie I was afraid of a let down (see the last two Star Wars movies!) but I was NOT disappointed! I plan on seeing this movie again...and probably again!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the Pirates of the Caribbean is probably one of the few films that sets out to show you a good time and holds nothing back in the delivery. The idea of this movie may have been taken from an attraction at a theme park but that is where line ends. This movie is amazing. The action is spectacular and not overly graphic so everyone can enjoy this movie. The special effects were incredible. Not the best around but very convincing. During the final fight between Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush the effects are flawless. But the thing that i enjoyed so much was the humor. the fact that this movie was not meant to be taken seriously was very appealing. The two british guards adding the color comedy during the entire movie as well as the two bumbling pirates. The characters were another huge asset to this movie and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow is probably the best i have seen him in lately. Geoffery Rush is equally good as the cursed pirate Captain Barbossa and Orlando Bloom is quite good as Will. All in all this movie should be seen by anyone wanting to have a good time watching a movie. I guarantee that you will walk out with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp added sex appeal, spirit, and above all humor to Captain Jack Sparrow. He pulled off the sort of acting job that is expected from this well rounded actor and gave the movie a little zip. He carried the show through his delivery of zesty one-liners and never-ending supply of wit. Orlando bloom also did an excellent job as further acting eye candy but the character left a little more to be desired. He was missing a lot of (for lack of a better word) presence when juxtaposed next to the insatiable Jack Sparrow. And as for Gore Verbinski, bravo. The movie was a blast to watch from beginning to end. Along with them, good special effects, and a surprisingly nice job from Kiera Knightly, Pirates of the Caribbean was certainly entertaining and well worth matinee prices. But beware: a few horrible lines, obvious cliches, and a disappointing appearance from the token girl pirate lurk below.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm surprised at the great reviews this movie is getting on the IMDB since it's definitely not a great movie. It's overlong, has an extremely weak ending, even by Hollywood standards, and boasts action sequences that are, to put it charitably, not particularly well-directed. In fact Cutthroat Island for all it's flaws had far superior action sequences. The only thing that really makes this movie better than this Summer's other Hollywood blow 'em up crap like Charlie's Angels Full Throttle and Terminator 3 is Johnny Depp. He brings great humor and eccentricity to every scene he is in and single handedly makes this pirate movie a hoot. If only the rest of the movie were half as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first walked into the theather, i was expecting something different, more serious. Boy was i ever wrong. It was a funny, halarious comdey-action film. It was a sort of movie that went from funny to serious back and forth all throughout the movie. I recommend this movie for those of you who like movies such as Lord of the Rings and pirate movies. I liked this movie becuase i am a big Johnny Depp fan, also because i like pirates. I would not recommend this movie to people who are afraid of skeletons, dead people or have nightmares becuase there are some scences that you might not like. Also i do not recommend this movie for young children who are easily frightened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised at the great reviews this movie is getting on the IMDB since it's definitely not a great movie. It's overlong, has an extremely weak ending, even by Hollywood standards, and boasts action sequences that are, to put it charitably, not particularly well-directed. In fact Cutthroat Island for all it's flaws had far superior action sequences. The only thing that really makes this movie better than this Summer's other Hollywood blow 'em up crap like Charlie's Angels Full Throttle and Terminator 3 is Johnny Depp. He brings great humor and eccentricity to every scene he is in and single handedly makes this pirate movie a hoot. If only the rest of the movie were half as good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awsome Pirate Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first walked into the theather, i was expecting something different, more serious. Boy was i ever wrong. It was a funny, halarious comdey-action film. It was a sort of movie that went from funny to serious back and forth all throughout the movie. I recommend this movie for those of you who like movies such as Lord of the Rings and pirate movies. I liked this movie becuase i am a big Johnny Depp fan, also because i like pirates. I would not recommend this movie to people who are afraid of skeletons, dead people or have nightmares becuase there are some scences that you might not like. Also i do not recommend this movie for young children who are easily frightened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is excellent in this movie. I couldn't imagine anyone better fit for the part. The stunts were amazing, and the visual effects were good and didn't overpower the story-line. Although a bit loud at times, it is definitely a must-see. Orlando Bloom also gives an excellent performance.</fullReview>

Yes, the fights did tend to run a little long and yes, the movie could have been a tad shorter, but all in all, it was a very fun, entertaining experience. I especially enjoyed the performance by Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow, it alone was worth the $7 of addmission.</fullReview>

It had it all, really really hot guys who aren't cheesy actors, a great storyline, awesome swordfights, fantastic special effects, and yes, they even managed to squeeze a romance into all that action. For a movie based on a rollercoaster ride I was completely blown away! I love all genres of movies and this one covered them all. I have never laughed so hard at a movie before. So I hereby give this movie three cheers and a hearty ARRRGH!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sword swashing adventure and plenty of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean is not your usual sappy makeover of a theme park ride, no it's much much more. Pirates tells the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and the blacksmith Turner (Orlando Bloom) in thier attempts to rescue Turner's love Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from the lawless pirates lead by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). The special effects are excellent and the plot is simple enough to follow along nicely. Sword fighting, cannon booming, and pirate snarling are just a few tacts used in the fighting scenes. Longer than it had to be (cough...like the Hulk) but has enough humor to get you your moneys worth. Rush is great as the demented Barbossa, as is Bloom as the heroine Turner. The show belongs mainly to Depp, with his drunk-slurry Sparrow he manages to conjure up a hilarious performance as if he were preparing for Fear and Loathing 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll now you'll ee this movie; but see it sooner if you love Pirates! And if you've been on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland too many times, there are little tidbits to look for in the movie. (some are subtle, some aren't.) But if you haven't, the movie is still sweet. Johnny Depp is hilarious as Capt. Jack Sparrow, and Geoffrey Rush is perfect as Capt. Barbossa. But besides the good performances from the actors as the pirates, the movie is just fun to watch. There is action, adventure, romance, and a host of small characters sure to keep you entertained. There is also a little ghost story thrown in, excellently executed by Gore Verbinski, which is sure to shiver yer timbers. And if none of that interests you, Keira Knightly looks HOT!This movie is definitely what people should be watching this summer, mostly because it has everything for adventure fans, but also because it's the only movie this summer with pirates!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love pirates...books on pirates, movies on pirates.....and there was a lot of great stuff in POTC...BUT.... I think the movie would've been better to spend a little more time on real pirates and less on the undead ones. And the movie was a bit too long. Depp was terrific and I wish the movie could've spent more time with him and eliminated Orlando Bloom altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with my hopes up, but yet a lingering doubt in the back of my mind that it might be a little too cheezy and touchy feely since disney had a hand in it, and it is based on a ride at Walk Disney World, but i was fairly surprised. It was much better than even i had expected. There were a couple of moments of cheeze, but not nearly enough to spoil the extreme hilarity and action of this Summer hit. And the acting by Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing. I would say that if it wasnt his show to steal, he would have stolen the show. And for those of you that are fimilar with the Pirates of the Carribean ride at Walt Disney, keep your eyes open to detail, because there are a couple of details in this movie that mimic the ride directly. Very Amusing. overall 10/10. ENJOY.</fullReview>

I actually expected mediocre and got mind blowing amazingness. After seeing so many disappointing films lately it was great to see something that simply blew me off my feet.Every aspect of this film was wonderful and I can think of nothing bad to say. The script was well written, the plot actually worked and wasn't just silly, the action was fast and intense but easy to follow which I love, the effects were ASTOUNDING!!!! The love storyline was there but didn't take up much screen time which was great because that's not what the movie is, it's an adventure, not a romance.But the dialogue was so crisp and Jack Sparrows really made this movie something special. Even without saying anything, just a look or hand gesture worked great, but his spoken words were cutting and extremely delightful. The rest of the cast was also phenomenal, though Depp clearly sticks out as amazing. Bloom did great in his first real lead I've seen and was a perfect straight man for Depp, Knightley surprised me with her abilities and her great screen look. The supporting cast did their job as well.Overall I gave this movie a 10/10 because I believe it is possibly the most entertaining film I have EVER seen and I have seen many. The hours flew by and I actually wished it was longer. I have absolutely nothing bad to say, and I can't express enough how much I loved and enjoyed this film.

I have been waiting for months for this movie, being my favorite ride at Disneyland! I just got back from the theater, opening day of course, i couldn't wait much longer. I love Johnny Depp and he has turned out another amazing original character! It was such a funny movie, i loved that they incorporated soo much from the ride!!! I was worried that it would slack like COUNTY BEARS. This has everything: comedy, action, adventure, romance, thrills....and an opened ended ending to leave the possiblities for a rumored sequel. Disney did a great job and deserves a pat on the back. hopefully they willl recieve an Oscar for the groovy special effects. I LOVED IT!!!!!! I so want to see it again! and Again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike some reviewers, I actually watched the movie and saw that it was the Black PEARL it was about (not JADE), and that Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) was NEVER the beloved of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), but of Will Turner (Bloom). Inspired by the carefree and fun-loving nature of a pirate at rest, 'Pirates' has excellent comedy throughout the movie that accompanies the wonderful action sequences to roll it on with a great pace that always keeps the watcher happy and enjoying the experience with a smile and a laugh. There is, however, no sparing of the viewer from fights of many types and on many venues. The action is inventive, the lines are memorable, and yes, Captain Jack Sparrow makes all of the other actors dance a great dance around his magnificent performance. A movie to see on the big screen, and to own as well. One of the top movies released this year, and it's been a good year for movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just saw the movie and even though i had no intention of seeing it in the first place i got to say it wasn't that bad. I'm not usually into big pirate adventure back in the day kind of movies but this was pretty good. The fighting scenes are pretty decent and may i compliment Johnny Depp on an excellent performance. I enjoyed Johnnys portrayal of Captain Sparrow, it was tight. In all i'd say the movie is worth seein.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thrill ride of a movie with a memorable quirky performance by Johnny Depp. Destined to be the classic Pirate movie. Has the same fun feel as Indiana Jones went it first came out. Plenty of cannons, undead creatures, curses, gold coins, grappling hooks, and plenty of Johnny Depp. An excellent supporting cast, particularly Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of a pirate captain and a Royal Governor's Daughter who looks good in both a corset and British Navy pants. The kids and adults loved it. After a long dry spell, Disney remembers what entertainment is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's right, "Pirates" manages to be an epic, entertaining movie on all levels. I was in shock at how good the movie actually turned out to be. It has all the formulas for success: a great cast (Depp is perfect, and everybody else is more than up to par.), fantastic visuals (with help from ILM), and a great story. Being the first Walt Disney movie (under the Disney banner) to be given a PG-13 rating, I was surprised at how violent the movie was. While it is nowhere near an 'R' rating, definately not a PG rating either. Parents, think twice before bringing the younger ones.I can't think of too many complaints. Humor and action were well-balanced. I suppose some more sword-fighting would've been nice, but a minor gripe with an otherwise fantastic action-adventure. Compared to recent summer movies that weren't really all that good (Terminator 3, Matrix Reloaded, Hulk), it was nice to see another movie that, while no X2: X-Men United, manages to blow you out of the water! Hopefully, it will equally share the wealth with LXG (another great movie) when both open this week!FINAL SCORE: 7.5 out of 10 (Great action-adventure will blow you out of the water!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney has definitely learned from their mistakes with Country Bears, their first attempt to take a theme park ride and bring it to the big screen, to produce a summer hit with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film's most endearing qualities are a great original story (kudos to Gore Verbinski) mixed with tribute to the original attraction. Fanatical Disney fans will be thrilled at how these images, characters, and dialogue/song from the ride are subtly incorporated into the film.Johnny Depp creates the character of Captain Jack Sparrow as only Depp can, using his combination of charm and wit to captivate the audience to remark on his performance long after the credits have finished. He once again demonstrates that he has an impeccable knowledge of who he is as an actor and what roles he can create to great success. Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce all contribute fantastic performances to create a solid leading cast. All should receive accolades for their fancy footwork with a sword as well.The visual effects created by Industrial Light and Magic once again prove they are the leaders of the effects business. Audiences will be awed at classic swash-buckling action scenes combined with the latest in film technology.Jerry Bruckheimer proves that a pirate's life is also a life for him. This film has a great balance of Bruckheimer trademark action scenes with comical and plot development scenes. He has created a film that both the public and corporate audience will enjoy.Make sure you stay until the end of the credits... Could there be a Pirates 2?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(May contain spoilers)I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this movie. It could be a really great movie with an interesting plot and action scenes, OR it could be a run-of-the-mill pirate movie whose main claim to fame was Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush.It was indeed a really great movie with a surprisingly believable plot, understandable characters, superb special effects, and very good acting by the main (and not so main) actors.Orlando Bloom as pirate's son blacksmith Will Turner, Geoffrey Rush as evil Captain Barbossa, and Keira Knightley as governor's daughter/Will's girlfriend, performed admirably in my mind. Mackenzie Crook as the wooden-eyed pirate on the Black Pearl provided comic relief, and my mother was surprised that the movie was as humorous as it was. (Johnny Depp's funny little hand movements entertained me to no end. Then again, I'm me, so don't take my opinion for it.) But the BIG accolades for acting should go to Johnny Depp, as the rakish, dishonest, cool-headed and surprisingly sexy in that eyeliner, (Captain) Jack Sparrow. It is hard for me to describe the full extent of his acting, but let me tell you, HE DID GOOD. See the movie. See the movie just for Johnny Depp if for no other reason.The creepy cursed-pirates-in-moonlight may disturb younger audience members, but the effects that made them can be commended by many. The skeletons' torn clothes; empty, rotted eyes and skin-peeling skulls are especially freaky and appreciable in the scene where they attack the commodore's ship from underwater.I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected and give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is an extremely fun pirate action movie, filled with swashbuckling, cannonball-shooting, corset cleavage displaying, swordfighting revelry. It has all the familiar earmarks of the pirate action movie: A pre-Revolutionary War era settting, an attractive rogue who dances the fine line between bad guy scoundrel and good guy hero, a beautiful damsel in a corset, loyal sidekicks, stiff-as-a-board uniformed authorities, a menacing villain and his henchmen, swordfights, chases, daring escapes, gold treasure, plenty of humor, and oh yeah, a grotesque maritime curse that is deftly utilized by the plot. Hell, there's even a talking parrot.The audience laughed during all the funny moments, and applauded at the very end. The story moved together very quickly for a two hour and twelve minute film, and I was never anxious to look at the time.Johnny Depp plays Jack Sparrow, a flamboyant pirate who practically exudes charm from every pore on his skin, and who totally steals the movie by exhibiting the most unique full-body gesticulations when he speaks. After trying unsuccessfully to steal-er, commandeer a ship, he is thwarted by an honorable blacksmith named Will Turner who shares a mutual (if unspoken) affection for the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). After she is taken by pirates of the ship Black Pearl in the hopes of helping them to lift a terrible curse that was placed on them years earlier, Will agrees to free the jailed Jack in exchange for helping him rescue Elizabeth, setting them both on a wild adventure filled with cutthroat buccaneers, island caves, and constant reversals of fortune. The movie works because it knows how to use the plot and dialogue to move things forward. The action scenes are a wonder to watch, and even when characters engage in expository dialogue over dinner, one never gets bored, particularly given the pleasant humor that punctuates it. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush have great screen presence, and even Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley become characters that you root for.There was one thing I didn't get, though: (SPOILER WARNING: In the beginning of the movie, after Jack saves Elizabeth from drowning, he then temporarily takes her hostage to escape the hangman for piracy, telling her, "I saved your life, you save mine." But we later learn near the climax of the movie that he suffers from the curse of immortality. So why take her hostage? He could've just jumped into the water and escaped without her. Hell, he could've been hanged, and it wouldn't have done anything to him. For that matter, why did he suffer from the curse? He told Barbossa that he escaped it because he wasn't present when it struck Barbossa and the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ridiculous and fun ride that will be around for a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I go back and watch Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I find the viewing experience just as much fun as the first time I saw the film in theaters. I also find the film more and more ridiculous.When I first saw the film I was 13 years old, and I was just starting to realize that I wanted to be in the filmmaking business. Where films like American Beauty, Signs, and the films of Kevin Smith and Mel Brooks, really influenced me in the types of stories I wanted to tell, the original Pirates of the Caribbean really influenced the type of colorful characters I wanted to explore with my stories. In particular, and I'm sure to no surprise, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow dazzled me (for the record, and for no particular reason, the other performance that significantly effected me in my life was Heath Ledger's as The Joker). I can remember imitating him for a long time, something that caused much frustration for my parents I'm sure. And also probably contributed to my unpopularity in high school. But I didn't care, I loved the film and the performance, and it once again helped solidify my certainty in wanting to write movies for a living (now that I think about it, this might have been the aspect that frustrated my parents the most.)At some points the movie has a complicated plot and can also be quite long. By listening to the commentary of the film, the director even mentions at one point, that at that particular moment in the film (when Captain Sparrow and Elizabeth are stranded on the beach) the audience has all the information they need to end the story. Yet the film will continue for another 40 minutes. The film is flawed, as with ALL films I think. But with the eclectic characters, the overall plot of pirates and treasure, and the fact that it is just a fun ride, what's there not to love about this film?When I look back now, I have the same feelings I would image a grown up viewer of films like E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark might feel. When you go back and watch the movies from your own childhood you are aware of the dated effects and sometimes unbelievable sequences, but you also are reminded of the magical feelings that you felt upon first viewing those images. Now, I do not mean to compare E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark to POTC, but the feelings for me are similar. Classics are in a way defined by the generation in which they were released. Huge amounts of people saw E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, and Raiders, and some have now deemed them classics of their time. And if you don't want to call POTC a classic of a more recent generation that's fine, for the record I'm not particularly calling it that. But I do think that this movie, whether we like it or not, will be around for a long time. And well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a HUGE disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the "Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row?), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, "Curse of the Black Pearl," way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride.And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in ? an inconsequential "pretty boy" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a "pretty bit of fluff" who was "force fed" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., "we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly "updated" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..." Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character ? and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride? As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a "love interest" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in "Captain Blood" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in "Against All Flags" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely)....Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that "things would get better," i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride ? and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel ? BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the "perfect woman of his dreams" become the "the nightmare hag from hell?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp as some kind of transvestite, in a swinging, swordfighting fey-quest over the high seas of The Caribbean, with Orlando Bloom as his blacksmith girlfriend, and Geoffrey Rush as a grumpy old man in a Halloween pirate costume. Keira Knightley's square man-jaw causes untold distraction; Jonathan Pryce gads about in a wig slightly smaller than Dee Snider's hair during the Stay Hungry tour, and Jack Davenport tries to take it all seriously, for which I'm sure everyone laughed at him behind his back.PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is as entertaining as it is ambitious, as rollicking as it is ridiculous, as boyish-action-movie as it is gender-bendingly-ambiguous.Supposedly based on the boring Disneyland boat ride of the same name - without all the gender bending - if anyone ever has this much fun on that dank, irritating boat ride, I'll eat my triangular hat. Somehow, Disney's accursed homogenizing hand could not stultify this film's pure adrenalin bumrush.Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, who rocketed out of left field with his mascara on overdrive and his personality on sideways; he alone imbues this movie with its unique charm. For some reason, his aggressive effeteness lends an authenticity to the swashbuckling that none of the other "Halloween pirate" performances can. His drunken, insouciant braggadocio drives the film like a 1st rate Ship-of-the-line, beating to windward, guns blazing (and I do mean 'blazing').Matter of fact, there were secret talks held with the Oxford English Dictionary on whether to replace Anthony Hopkins's picture with Depp's, next to the meaning of the word "fey." Filmed in the Caribbean (St. Vincent and the Windward Islands of the Grenadines), PIRATES somehow avoids looking anything like the Caribbean. Must be that homogenizing Disney touch.Geoffrey Rush is aye-me-hearties Captain Barbossa who stole Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl, which Sparrow spends the whole movie trying to steal back.Keira Knightley is Elizabeth Swann, daughter to the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), betrothed to a stoic British Commodore (Jack Davenport), but in love with Jack's girlfriend, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom).Director Gore Verbinski frames Knightley's opening shot from an angle that makes her look busty, rather than her sad reality of being flatter than the Earth Before Columbus.Her pancake ironing board pecs are probably the reason that with all the kidnapping she undergoes by pirates, not one of them thinks to drag her into the hold and rape her - they must think she's a skinny boy. And since none of them are Catholic priests, she's not considered sexual property.It looks very eerie cinematically, but with all those holes in the sails, how does the Black Pearl ever sail? Oh, that's right, she's supernatural. Then why does she "sail" at all? Why engage in a "chase" to "catch up" to the Commodore's ship? Why not just appear alongside in one fell swoop? For once, the work of four writers looks justified (Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, Jay Wolpert) with the wealth of ideas on screen. Bold, brash, criminal adventure, involving Aztec blood amulets, hidden treasure, lots of yo-ho-ho barrels of rum, double-crosses and triple-crosses (Sparrow: "Me? I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly") and fencing the likes of which we haven't seen since Basil Rathbone and Errol Flynn (which does get tiresome when everyone is fencing for no reason, i.e. if you can't kill each other by fencing - due to being supernatural beings - why bother?) Bouncy-bouncy music by Hans Zimmer, moving us like the shifting deck of a schooner: coy, ominous, frolicsome, and rope-swinging-across-chasms epic, transporting us out into the salty breeze and briny seas - or at least to a water tank in San Francisco.I'm sure the PIRATES movie has made the Disney ride infinitely more popular - though no less boring.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is in this movie. He wears a cool hat and swaggers about like a drunken bohemian on the loose in a boarding school. I could watch him for hours.There's other stuff in this movie. Orlando Bloom possibly plays the hero, but he's about as boring as he's been in every other movie he's pretended to act in. Keira Knightley fails to fill out her dress, but that's okay because she's cute too. Geoffrey Rush plays another retired rock star, and between him and Depp the movie is nearly watchable.I stayed awake through this movie the first time. The second time, not so much. The third time, I'm not sure. I intentionally turned it on a fourth time while I was on a trans-Atlantic flight and needed to sleep. The plot is kind of unintelligible, with characters escaping and getting captured and being held in prisons and escaping again every five minutes or so, and no one ever bothers to clear up which ship they're on at any given moment. It's a little too lead-footed to really be swashbuckling.But anyway, it's got Johnny Depp. He's cool, right? He does stuff in this movie, so that must mean something. I'm not sure what, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something to remember when you're into your second century.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The theme of pirates is a very common one in movie-making. There hasn't been a high enough level of mathematics invented yet to number the pirate cartoons made. Several of the 'immortal' classics such as 'Treasure Island' are about pirates. And of course, Hollywood has it's share in the pirate stories: 'Cutthroat Island' (I don't know why it flopped), 'Treasure Island', and variants have all graced or disgraced our screens for decades. And then this...I truly think that pirate movies aren't going to get better than POTC. The plot is original, surprising, and impossibly dynamic, the humor fresh and unforced, the filming absolutely stunning, and the acting thorough and enjoyable. Watching Jack Sparrow (by the way, the entire image of Jack Sparrow was left up to Johnny Depp. I can't imagine how it could've turned out better) clamber, sway, and in extreme cases fall through trembling holds, cages, and rigging was something that I know I will look back upon in about twenty years with just as much relish as I do now. The brilliant dynamic created by the sarcastic, irreverent Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the uber-eccentric, hilarious, infinitely scheming Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is something that cannot accurately be described by anyone on this earth. Add to that some semi-peripheral roles that only enhance the humor and action, and you get a masterpiece.The sets were filmed on location using real ships (well... 2/3 real ships), real ocean, real islands, and a specially constructed real fort, giving this movie an authenticity that serves to endear it even more.There is something in this movie that will appeal to anyone: action lovers, wisecracks, the romantic souls, those that like to tickle their nerves with semi-scary images, the thinkers, ANYONE. Should you watch this movie? Of course! And bring the kids along too... the skeletons and such, they're not even really scary. The whole movie is almost like a story, in fact. A very fast-paced, engrossing, exciting, and profound story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is without a doubt the best pirate movie I have ever seen. The tale begins when Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) discovered a pirate medallion around the neck of a young boy who washes up from a wrecked merchant ship. She has no idea that it is really a missing piece of Cortez's cursed Aztec gold, stolen by the crew of the Black Pearl. The pirate crew, commanded by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) needs the last piece and the "blood to be repaid" to lift the curse set on them when they removed the gold. In attempts to gain back this cursed treasure, the crew runs into the captive, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who was marooned by Barbossa and left for dead. Once Elizabeth was taken capture by the cursed crewmen of the Black Pearl, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) sets free Jack Sparrow to help him locate the Black Pearl and rescue her. The cast is perfectly chosen and interacts with each other as if they had been working together on this film over many years. Johnny Depp plays a selfish pirate who is constantly calculating ways to manipulate others into helping him gain what he desires. His phenomenal acting was not only cohesive to piracy, but also added a comedic aspect to the film. He added a sense of comic relief to a typical adventure film by use of sarcasm, wordplay, and gesturing to make the scene humorous rather than somber. My particular favorite quote that depicts his wordplay is, "Me, I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you have to watch out for because you never know when they're going to do something incredibly stupid." He uses the wordplay to, it seems, confuse the other character into believing him to be truthful. After viewing the film, I was utterly convinced that the cast is a medley of pirates all working for or against each other to gain what each of them secretly desired. It is the audience's task to figure out which of the characters can be trusted and which ones have dishonorable ulterior motives. In terms of cinematography, the film utilizes the aspects of lighting to highlight the effects of the curse on the pirates and to show the authenticity of the time period. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush's character, states, "The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living' and so we cannot die, but neither are we dead." Lighting is a very important aspect of the entire movie because it shows the effect of the curse in action. The crewmen were forbidden to remove the gold from the chest, but they did so regardless of the warning and became cursed by the heathen Gods. Throughout the rest of the movie, the lighting is either candle light or natural lighting because of the setting. During the night scenes, there is emphasis on moonlight, when the pirate crew is shown, or there is use of candle light indoors. Whichever the case may be, lighting plays a very important role in the film. The costume designs for each character were carefully chosen and created to match each and every role. Some characters even wore colored contacts to make their eyes appear yellow or discolored, which shows how their life at sea has affected their appearances. Each pirate was made up to look unkempt and terrifying to show how pirates would not have the same luxuries as the upper classes. Elizabeth's character was cleaner in appearance and wore a more elaborate dress than those of the pirates.This film is full of symbolism and historical backgrounds such as the Black Pearl and the formation of the East India Trading Company. The East India Trading Company was against piracy and all for taxing shipping ports to gain profit from anyone sailing the seas. The Black Pearl, according to Captain Jack Sparrow, symbolizes freedom and his ability to sail the seas without feeling confined to any order or law. A ship has many different parts, but when they are as a whole, they form a liberating method of transportation, which actually becomes a way of life. Piracy becomes more of a culture than a history of rebellious sailors. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the most accurate depiction of historical piracy that has ever been shown in any film. It shows the nature of piracy at its finest and at its worst while adding a mythological twist to it. The cast, costumes, lighting, symbols and plot all come together to create this fantastic movie about pirates and fighting for that in which they believe. I highly recommend seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean a classic?...Yo Ho Ho!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was the surprise success story of 2003. Pirate films have not fared too well on screen over the past 30 years or so. It was a film that took its inspiration from a theme park ride (which is pretty crass self-promotion if you really think about it). And the star was Johnny Depp, an actor who, up until that point had avoided big-budget extravaganzas in favour of edgier material. In spite of the odds stacked against it, it made a splash at the box-office and was quickly hailed as a modern classic.I've always felt the Pirates of the Caribbean films are rather overrated. Pt 1 has an easy appeal and is not an unlikable film. But its not quite the barnstorming swashbuckler that people make it out to be. The sequels only upped the scale and wound up being capsized by it. Still, at least Pt 1 is straightforward. Its no classic, but at least you can keep track of the story. Something that could not be said for the sequels.I think with POTC, Disney were trying to make a pirate equivalent of The Princess Bride. An adventure story on the one hand, with a whole level of knowing humour on the other. Where it takes all the expected clichés and wittily subverts them. When this is done right, you can produce a very entertaining experience. TPB is the undisputed champion in the field. And the same was done with Westerns in the excellent and very underrated TV series The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.But POTC is not on they're level. It feels amusing more than it feels funny. And its also much too long. Clocking in at just over two hours, it lacks the snappy pace and perfect running times of the above examples. Something that only got worse as the sequels went on. Still, Pt 1 does have its moments. The jokey tone of the film is established as soon as we get our first glimpse of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.Its a very funny scene. Jack is standing on the crow's nest of his ship, purposefully looking out to sea. Then the camera pulls back to reveal that's all that's left of it. And just as the ship is about to go under, Jack casually steps off onto the dock of the nearest port. Its a scene that makes you think this is going to do for the pirate genre what The Princess Bride did for fairy tales. Its all the more disappointing then that the best gag in the film comes right at the beginning.Nothing else in the movie quite matches the hilarity of that scene. It so perfectly captures the balance between straight-faced adventuring and tongue-in-cheek humour. But nowhere else in POTC does it achieve the same level of success. Gore Verbinski directs it all with high-octane energy, throwing in everything you'd expect. Swordfights, battles, romance.But the plot has a thinness that the film never really escapes from. I think the problem may be that since its genesis is in a theme park ride, the writers have had to construct a scenario while working within very narrow margins. Certainly it never opens itself out to the possibilities or sharp deconstructions that come with the genre. Not like William Goldman and Rob Reiner's treatment of The Princess Bride.Where the film is more successful is in its casting. And Pirates of the Caribbean has a fine one. Johnny Depp expectedly rises to the occasion, putting his own unique stamp on the part. There has never been a pirate like Captain Jack Sparrow. And there never will be again. Depp's inspiration for the part was Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones because he thought pirates were the rock stars of the high seas. With a Keith Richards slur, a drunken swagger, and a fey flailing of his hands, Depp cuts and thrusts away with the entire movie.Orlando Bloom, in his first role away from The Lord of the Rings does just fine as Will Turner, the simple blacksmith out to rescue his lady love. Equally up to the action and dramatic scenes, this young man is one of Hollywood's rising stars. The exquisitely radiant Keira Knightley is wonderful as the spirited Elizabeth Swann. She brings a refreshing injection of modernity to the old cliché of the damsel in distress. And you mustn't miss Geoffrey Rush as the vile Captain Barbossa. He throws himself into the part with real theatrical gusto. A villain you just love to hate.Aside from Johnny Depp's performance, what makes POTC rather unique among the genre is the inclusion of a fantastical element. Barbossa's crew of pirates are under a curse, and are really the undead. Like the pirate genre has been crossbred with The Evil Dead. Gives a whole new meaning to skeleton crew! Its never quite as scary as it should be (this is a Disney film after all), but its a nice spark of originality in an otherwise very traditional movie. The CGI effects are really excellent here, even if such effects do seem somewhat out of place in a pirate movie.The script thrusts and parries its way to a surprisingly low-key ending. What should have been an epic battle at the end feels disappointingly lacklustre. And sadly, I'm afraid that is much of the problem with Pirates of the Caribbean. It never really goes for it with full wind in its sails. Its a pleasant film when its on, but it never wittily deconstructs itself like you imagine the writers intended. Its better then its sequels, but where it should have been a grand, high seas adventure, it sadly never gets out of the harbour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that revived the swashbuckler!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere inside this movie is a rather pedestrian summer swashbuckler about two strait-laced earnest lovers fighting for happiness. But with a bunch of talented screenwriters and the movie's real star, Johnny Depp in a now-legendary performance as lovable scoundrel Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie became something else. We had the strait-laced lovers, properly yearning from a distance. Then--wow--Captain Jack, and then BOOM! The Undead! Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa putting in a performance almost as wonderful as Depp's, purring his way through the delightful, witty dialogue. Jack Davenport putting in an oddly sympathetic performance as the requisite Navy stuffed-shirt (who became a full-blown heartthrob in the sequel). Kiera Knightley in the role that made her famous as the Governor's pretty young daughter, and Orlando Bloom, who hadn't yet learned how to act yet was fine as the earnest, smitten, puppyish, chivalrous, thoroughly decent and rather square Will Turner.Like all movies, this has a few problems, from Bloom's stiff acting to the end battle, which goes on repetitively for about ten minutes too long; but Captain Jack and Barbossa are always somewhere ready to save the day. The subsequent sequels (which I love) can never be exactly the same as this one; Captain Jack wasn't as astonishing the second time around and Elizabeth became rapidly more clichéd as an action chick. The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie has become bigger and yet more legendary in the light of its sequels; and while the "Good or not?" argument will go on for many years concerning them, this first movie will always have a place in every heart that secretly enjoys a pirate tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, if overlong, action film driven by Depp and Rush</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bermuda circa 1700, Port Royal comes under attack from a gang of vicious pirates led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). During the attack, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the feisty young daughter of the Governor (Jonathan Pryce), is kidnapped by the pirates. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith (and pirate's son) who is in love with Elizabeth, enlists the help of shifty pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), whose ship, "The Black Pearl", had been lost to Barbossa during a mutiny. However, Barbossa's men are no longer mere pirates - instead, they have been transformed into undead zombie pirates who need the blood of Will (or, so they think, Elizabeth) to break the curse.The main reason why "Pirates of the Caribbean" was so popular is simple. Take away Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, the action, the effects, everything - even Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush - and consider the simple fact that no one expected this film to be any good. It was based on a Disney theme park ride (a formula that had been unsuccessful before, see "The Country Bears") and had, to be frank, a ridiculous plot. This movie seemed likely to die a quick death at the box office, get torn apart by critics, and be forgotten. However, the film went on to be an astonishing box-office hit and pop culture phenomenon. In the aftermath of the mediocre sequel it's easy to forget how refreshing the movie seemed when it first came out - full of rousing action, great special effects, stirring music, a wonderfully written script, and of course brilliantly over-the-top performances by Depp and Rush.Really, this movie does not bear in-depth analysis. There aren't any themes running through it; it's just a fun, unpretentious action film. Or at least it tries to be; the movie is about twenty minutes too long, with a climax that drags on forever (and seems arbitrary in light of the sequel). But that's a fairly minor complaint, when the 120 minutes before it were so entertaining.Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is a wonderfully entertaining character. In the second movie, he will have worn out his welcome (at least for this reviewer), but here he's amazing. Campy, drunken, profane, and ceaselessly witty, it's easy to see why Jack has become such a immensely popular character. While ostensibly based on Keith Richards, Jack reminds me at least of Eli Wallach's Tuco from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" - a lovable, double-crossing rogue who is turns likable and hate-able. Depp gives simply a marvelous performance, and transforms a character who, on paper, was likely not much into something wonderful.Geoffrey Rush, one of my favorite living actors, is a perfect counterpart as Barbossa. Rush, who can be a restrained and subtle performer ("Shine", "Elizabeth"), goes way over-the-top here. But in a film like this - and especially with someone like Depp's Sparrow as your rival - over-the-top is the only way to go, and Rush executes his role with relish. Barbossa is a surprisingly sympathetic character; one feels for his anguish at the curse, even though he is ostensibly a villain, and Rush should get credit for being able to convey this as well.The histrionic sparring of the two above actors does, unfortunately, overshadow most of the supporting cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are just not good actors, I'm sorry to say, but they are able to handle their parts with admirable aplomb - even though they are blown off the screen by Depp and Rush. Jack Davenport, as Elizabeth's suitor Norrington, and Jonathan Pryce, as Governor Swann, give good, restrained performances that relegate them to the background. Among the rest of the supporting cast, Kevin McNalty as Gibbs, the sailor-turned-pirate and Jack's chief sidekick, is most memorable, bringing dignity and humor to his smallish role.The action sequences are well-done, and the special effects, while not realistic, are frighteningly convincing (unlike the ridiculously overdone effects in "Dead Man's Chest"). Elizabeth's discovery of just what Barbossa's pirates are is effectively done - it seems over-the-top but it works, helped immeasurably by Rush. The action scenes - particularly the climactic sword-fight between Jack and Barbossa - sometimes go on for too long, but most of them are so enthralling that you won't notice. The film doesn't lack for humor either, mostly through Sparrow's character.Though a bit too long and contrived, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a fun, fun action movie that is worth watching again and again. It's easy to see why it was such a successful film, and this one (if not the sequels) will certainly be watched for years to come.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is a nice 100-minute movie with an extra hour of inane plot twists thrown in - who edited this thing? Johnny Depp's performance is the one thing that makes this movie enjoyable throughout. Without Depp, Pirates is just another bad summer block-buster movie with too little plot and too much special effects trying to cover it up. I'm a bit amazed that the Oscars saw fit to nominate his performance - one of the boldest, riskiest acting jobs ever allowed in a summer release. I know all the accolades went to Sean Penn's overdone performance in Mystic River. But, I'd give the nod to Depp for single-handedly pulling this movie into the enjoyable category.Afterword: Pirates II has come out, and the first hour is abysmal. Depp seems bored, and there's even less of a story than in Crrse of the Black Pearl. Barely worth renting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is basically a classic...if you look it is on the top 250 movies on this website and it very well deserves to be!!! It may be scary for children under the age of 12. I have seen this movie multiple times and can't get enough of it. The part that was my favorite was when Elizabeth Swan was trying to hide from two pirates and soon hides in a closet, and they find her and she demands parlay. Pirates of the Caribbean does move somewhat slow and is a bit over two hours. But it is worth the time watching, and when i went to the movies to see it I knew I wouldn't be wasting money on a ticket. I would call this a family movie, so watch this while you relax with your familey.</fullReview>

I like Johnny Dep, but the portrayal of a pirate is a reach.... not at all believable. He seemed to soft to be a pirate, not rugged enough. There were some good scenes, but not the ones with Johnny Dep. If you are going to watch this movie don't expect a classic Pirate Movie, you will be disappointed. I have no real desire to see part two any time soon. I don't think the characters were developed enough and it felt like the movie is probably catering to the kids and not to adults. It had no historical value either and seemed to be done on a limited budget. Just not as good as all the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go sailing with these Pirates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first announcement, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sounded like a really bad idea to me. It was one of three films announced that would be adaptations (for lack of a better word) of rides or shows at Disneyland. The first was The Country Bears, which I skipped and the third was The Haunted Mansion, which was none too impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean had probably the best cast, headlined by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush, and was produced by uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I was still skeptical, but Pirates of the Caribbean proved to be better than it's pedigree would suggest. It is an entertaining, enjoyable romp, albeit a little overlong.Pirates of the Caribbean focuses on young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith's apprentice who has a thing for, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) the daughter of the Governor of the British Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), a notorious pirate, arrives at Port Royal in search of the Black Pearl, a pirate ship he had previously been Captain of but had been deposed by a uprising led by the ship's first mate, Barbossa (Rush). Sparrow is captured by the local militia when the Pearl attacks the colony and makes off with Elizabeth. Sparrow strikes a deal with Will to help him track down the Pearl and save Elizabeth, but the crew of the Black Pearl are not exactly what they seem: they have stolen and spent Aztec gold, which came complete with a curse that has turned them into the walking dead, a fate they are attempting to reverse and Elizabeth has the last piece of gold they need.Considering there is a dearth of good, old fashioned swashbuckling films in Hollywood today, Pirates of the Caribbean actually manages to be somewhat unique in the current entertainment climate. It, for the most part, lives up to the visual style you would expect from a pirate film, complete with elaborate sailing ships, down and dirty crew members, plenty of swordfights and cannon battles, not to mention the obligatory walking of the plank. However, director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot don't just deliver a standard pirate film, but one with a nice streak of comedy to it. Most of the humor is derived from the lead of Jack Sparrow. As portrayed by Depp, the master of cinematic eccentricity, Sparrow is a rather unusual pirate. Yes, he is self-serving and double-crossing, but he is also played with such a humorous air and a light touch by Depp as to become endearing. He also ensures that we aren't just looking at an actor using the role of a pirate to provide the usual moustache twirling. Jack isn't a hero, but he's not a villain either.Pirates of the Caribbean is an attractive enough film, no expense was spared in creating an environment that fits the material and when the action sequences kick in, they are engaging enough. However, this kind of film is still somewhat fluffy entertainment, not exactly the deepest of material, and Pirates of the Caribbean manages to overstay it's welcome a bit. The film runs 143 minutes, and eventually, it starts to feel like it. It never grinds to a complete halt, but it has no less than three points where it would seem to be reaching a conclusion and yet manages to keep going. This is the kind of film that needs to clock in well under two hours, not run two and half.The rest of the cast acquits themselves well. Rush turns in a decent performance as the villainous Barbossa, Bloom is appropriately fresh-faced and yet defiant enough as Will and Keira Knightley manages to blend her good looks with fire as Elizabeth. The film also boasts some nice visual effects when the Black Pearl crew is exposed to moonlight, when they are revealed as walking skeletons.All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean is a good, fun movie that is more than worth checking out, just don't be surprised if you start checking your watch a little late into the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. There is so much action and adventure, goodness I just love it all. Johnny Depp does a great job playing Captain Jack. Captain Jack is so comedic yet so tough and "piraty." Orlando Bloom is so great in this movie. Not to mention that he looks great in a pirate costume, but he is perfect for the part he plays. He plays a sensitive yet brave young man who tries to save his love. Kiera Knightly also does a wonderful job playing the beautiful but slightly tom boyish girl who falls in love with pretty boy Will. This movie has it all; romance, action (sword fights man!), mysterious music, and awesome special effects and costuming. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of any age, it's one of those movies you just can't miss. 10+++++!</fullReview>

I know we hear of actors performing well every now and then, but Depp pulls off this role so utterly convincingly. Of the countless thousands of films I've seen, this is one of the best performances and I will certainly remember it for a long time.Depp's accent is awesome (very much like Michael Cane, I thought) but there are so many levels to the character that its completely captivating.In closing, everyone should watch this film.Thank you.</fullReview>

It was very funny and very good and brings pirates back into fashion. Keeps you busy and excited throughout the whole thing. It isn't right though that they'll make two other ones or sequels to it. I'll see them don't get me wrong but this end is just wow though. I enjoyed watching it. *Spoiler part* (Look away if you don't want me to ruin it) It is about a pirate who is not afraid of meeting people who disagree with him. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith to save his girlfriend from another evil pirate who previously stole Johnny's ship. They set out to find her causing havoc everywhere. And in the end Johnny dies well not dead turns into a skeleton when fighting Barbossa and kills him. That's it really but if I didn't make it sound that good go see it anyway. End of review. But I'm giving it 8/10 because it's to good. S E EY A!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really is one of the best adventure movies of this year (possibly of all time) but as yet another glowing review would be redundant, I will instead focus on the score. Klaus Badelt's score is amazing. If you don't already own the CD for this movie, buy it. Though not quite a prodigy of Hans Zimmer, they often work together, and I know his style has been compared to Zimmers, but Badelt's style goes beyond Zimmer's in originality, and freshness, and the result is one of the best scores of all time, in my opinion. I do have to say, however, that I am disappointed to learn that Badelt will not be reprising his role as composer in the upcoming Pirate's films, and that sadly Zimmer has ousted him for that spot. I do not believe he will be able to do them justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is absolutely incredible.I'm very aware that many of the girls (ok, most of the girls) in the world that went to see this film probably just wanted a gander at the lovely Orlando Bloom.... well, I must say, it was really Johnny Depp who stole the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. His hilarious antics and insane actions made me laugh until I nearly cried.Mr.Bloom shows a lot of promise in the future as a successful actor. As Johnny Depp is considered the Marlon Brando of this generation, Orlando will most likely be named the Johnny Depp of the next. He plays Will Turner very well, starting out as a kind of awkward, geeky boy... and slowly molds into a brave and charming young man.Keira Knightley also deserves a word of recognition. Her beauty and talent are undeniable, and her character, Elizabeth Swann, was sweet and independent. I admired Keira's performance and look forward to seeing her in many more movies.Besides all the talented actors in this film... the visual effects were fantastic, and the screenplay was witty and exciting.I Definitely Recommend THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of my favourite movies because it has a mixture of everything... there's action, romance, funny scenes, historical background etc... most of all, jack sparrow couldn't have been more perfect!!! and no one could find an actor who could do it better than the exceptional johnny depp who loves to act bizarre characters such as this one!! he's genial and the movie is nothing without him. but apart of johnny depp, even Orlando bloom gave a very good performance and so did the other actors... but jack sparrow made the movie lighter and more enjoyable (to avoid saying funny!) hope the sequel is as superb as this one!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean, WHAT A MOVIE!!!! Everyone should see it. The graphics are so cool. I hope the 2nd and the 3rd are way better with the same cast all the way through the trilogy. For those girls who just love Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, there's plenty of them in this movie. The director ( Gore Verbinski )most be really pleased about his great success on this movie. It's rated PG so those little children who are under 12, you have to wait till film comes out on DVD before you can see it. And Penny Rose ( costume designer )nice costumes!! A great thanks to the producer ( Jerry Bruckheimer )who helped a great deal on this movie. I wish I was in these great movies. I HOPE EVERYBODY WILL SEE IT AND ENJOY IT!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the best movie I have ever seen. The way they take the shots were wonderful. The way the actors just played each roll was like they were meant for the roll when the script was made. The first encounter of Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Johnny Depp (Captin Jack Sparrow) was brilliant how they had a conversation while one was fighting for his life against a pirate and the other was fighting to get out of the blacksmith shop and also to save his own life. I highly recommend this for anyone. I don't usually like action movies. After I watched this I fell in love with Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp so of course I had to watch Troy and Secret Window which I also enjoyed. I LOVE ORLANDO AND JOHNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

It is awesome. If Johnny Depp didn't play Jack it would not have been very good at all. He makes it funny and i don't think another actor could make funny like he does. He is the best actor for this movie. Alog with all the other actors and actresses in it. I can't wait for the next one to come out because i think it will be awesome maybe not as good as the first but i definataley think it will be really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really an action-packed one. Johnny Depp plays the infamous Jack Sparrow, a pirate-gone-mad and is about the help Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue the damsel in distress, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) from the cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his group of also-cursed pirates. Jack also wants to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from Barbossa's hands. It seems simple enough, but when you put it all together, plus CGI and a group of good actors, you'll get a surprise at this! It might sound like any other boring pirate movie where they try to pillage and plunder and save the girl and stuff, but it's not.Johnny Depp really puts his heart into playing Jack Sparrow and is really good at the bad-yet-has-a-heart kinda character. His acting is what makes the audience laugh and leave the theatre content to have seen Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl. Orlando Bloom's acting was a little off but he's young and is up and coming. I personally preferred him playing Legolas in LOTR. Keira Knightley is also another with off-putting acting, but at that time, she was only a rising star, so you can't blame. Geoffrey Rush was well, a cursed pirate so there's not much to say about him. Just that he's good with his roles.Overall, I think what impressed me most was the CGI and the storyline, because the acting was a little bleak. I would've given it a ten but I figured maybe it could use a bit of work. So it's a 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be better than seeing a movie with Johnny Depp wearing makeup? NOTHING! Seriously, what a story. The first time seeing this movie, I felt it was too good to only receive the maximum of 3 out of 4 stars, and I still don't see why. First of all, the acting leaves you wishing you were in the shoes of a pirate yourself, whether you are on the good side or the bad. Personally, this was the performance of Johnny Depp's career, though he's had many, none were as recognizable or as fun to imitate as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast is superb, the action is endless, and the comedy is more than funny. I feel this movie deserved to at least win ONE Academy Award. As for my nine out of ten rating, I've learned to accept the fact that 4 stars is the most and I've made a balance. "Pirates of the Caribbean" leaves you dying to see the second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowadays when I see the "Walt Disney" mark at the top of a film I think to myself, "Oh no, another rubbishy soppy story with an ending like ones on Barney the Dinosaur." You cannot deny it, Disney is letting us down. Or was letting us down UNTIL the launch of "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".You see, POTC is nothing like the usual Disney do-gooder rubbish that everybody finds incredibly tiring and sickening. It is comedy from the start. And, thankfully, the soppy lines are kept to a minimum. And you know what? They are TWENTY TIMES more effective than when they are thrown at you all the time. For instance, when Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightley) kiss at the end, its for the first time in the whole film and it makes it so sweet that everybody is wiping their eyes at the perfect love story.The casting is superb as well and I'm not just talking about the big actors (Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Kiera Knightley, Geoffrey Rush), the less well-known actors are top-notch. Who can forget the showdown between Jack Davenport's "Commodore Norrington" and Depp's "CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow"? Or strange antics of Giles New and Angus Barnett's "Murtogg" and "Mullroy". And the extras do their job perfectly.Overall, this film is well acted and extremely well directed. The Jerry Bruckheimer effects will wow you and the comedy will have you quoting the script for weeks to come.A must-see for all the family! P.S. The extras on the DVD especially the Blooper Reel and the commentaries are a great source of entertainment.</fullReview>

Johnny depp is mesmerising as the seemingly forever drunk jack sparrow and Geoffry rush makes a great pantomime like villain as captain barbosa.The film has a timeless authentic look,and speaking of visual stuff, the cgi is amazing. In this day and age where cgi is so frequent that we've become a bit demystified to it , the films CG zombie pirates look fantastic.They so look real Its incredible .My only gripe with potc is the surprising lack of black people in the movie.I mean, its called pirates of the Caribbean, not the pirates of europe ,you know? the Caribbean is and was made up of black people and i think that it was wrong to avoid that.Apart from that flaw though , the film is an effortlessly fun and entertaining adventure.Who would of thought that id give a positive review to a movie based on a disneyland ride , eh ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pirate schemes to regain his ship by helping a young man rescue his love from pirates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is an excellent movie. It shies away from the excessive violence, sex, and profanity so common in today's films to present a funny and exciting adventure about pirates. It is not a highly realistic story, but that is what gives it so much charm.Captain Jack Sparrow leads the ideal pirate life, stealing and swindling instead of murdering. As a character, he is laid back and scarcely ever seems serious. He also has a seemingly never-ending supply of great lines. Jack's resourcefulness and wit are his greatest assets, and the ego he totes around is comical as well.William Turner, blacksmith's apprentice, balances out the light-hearted Jack. Will is intense, focused, and dedicated. He has goals and he goes for them. Jack and Will are an amusing pair throughout the movie, especially when Will's intensity and seriousness are shot through by one of Jack's witty retorts.Elizabeth Swan, the beauty of the picture, is by no means helpless. She is fearless and resourceful, witty and intelligent. Elizabeth seems to be more of a happy medium between Jack and Will, and complements the others quite well.The effects are great, and this prevents the movie from taking a cheesy turn. While the accursed pirates may be a bit much for some of the younger kids, it is still a great family movie as it is clean and enjoyable for both kids and adults. It has action and adventure, with an exotic aura to it. The fight scenes, especially the sword duels, are well done.Overall, this movie earns a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Choosing Johnny Depp for this role made the character perfect.

		<fullReview>The Black Pearl, a non-catchable ship, is legend to be "crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil, that Hell itself spat him back out". Is it true, that this ghost story should be unveiled to be a fact? Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp) and Will Turner(Bloom) go on a hunt to catch the Black Pearl in order to save Will's love interest, Elizabeth Swann(Knightley), whom the crew of the Pearl believe is the cure of their immortal curse. This movie is rather interesting. Even though Depp and Bloom are eye-candy, you can't help but love the movie. The special effects are fairly good. I praise the caster for casting this hilarious yet serious group. Well Done! Also, the two disc DVD set holds a great amount of extra's! Be sure to watch the blooper reel and Pirate's Diary! Great stuff for someone who wants to get behind the scenes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9/10 [with explanation]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My rating: 9/10Before the featured presentation of LotR: The Two Towers came on the screen, a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean aired. My first thought was 'Uggh.' I forgot about it for a few months, then read a few critics' reviews, which praised a movie so different from what the preview hinted at. I got interested, and decided to see what people were raving about. Then the next day, I went and saw it again...Fun and adventurous, 'Pirates' was not at all what I expected from a pirate movie, yet it was exactly what a pirate movie should be: swashbuckling fun and adventure, a bit of violence, treasure, etc. Twisting humor, romance, violence, adventure, and fantasy into a fast and involving plot, the film keeps the audience's interest the entire film.Johnny Depp [CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow] carries the movie, complete with brilliantly ridiculous attire and movements reminiscent of Keith Richards. Depp adds most of the humor to 'Pirates' with memorable one-liners and speeches. Keira Knightley [Elizabeth Swann] played her part quite well, too. This was the first film of hers I'd seen and judged her performance as excellent, fitting into all the facets of her character. Orlando Bloom [Will Turner] was watched even closer by me, since I had recently seen his debut in the LotR trilogy. He acted up to par and accented Depp's character. Geoffrey Rush [Captain Barbossa] played the evil and clever 'bad guy' and brought the cunning ship captain to life.One last aspect of this film captivated me-- the score. I can nearly hum the entire musical score from listening to the soundtrack too many times. The music is exciting and enthralling, pulling you into the action scenes and softening the deep tones for the romantic ones. In fact, that's one of the only times I've waited through the credits, just to here that final rendition of 'He's a Pirate'. Be sure to pay attention to the music--it will make your viewing that much more exciting.All in all, 'Pirates' is a well-wrapped package of entertainment and adventure that will keep you spell-bound 'til the end. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!--</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw Pirates, like most other teenage girls, I went for Orlando Bloom. The second time I went for Johnny Depp's outrageous character Jack Sparrow and for the incredibly complex plot twists. The third time was for the rest of the characters. The most intriguing of these characters is Commodor Norrington. He is in a position, especially given that this is a Disney movie, for the audience to despise him: he is not evil, but he is the competing love interest for Orlando's girl. Yet Norrington is selfless, perceptive, and a strong leader. Unlike anyone else in this movie, he is everything he claims to be. I won't describe the plot twists here, but I will say that all of it was unpredictable and brilliant. The staging and the music impressed me as well, from Sparrow's majestic appearance, to the treasure cavern, to the heartstopping final gunshot.</fullReview>

I loved the tongue-in-cheek humor. This movie is great and I hope there could be a couple of more sequels to it with the Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp and some of the others. I have some great story lines for sequels to this movie. This was humorous and was a great spoof on pirate movies. I have a full collection of Errol Flynn movies and this gets to sit with them as one of my favorites. Errol Flynn would have loved this movie as a man who was supposed to have had a fantastic sense of humor. The costuming, ships, and the special effects of changing them from men to skeletons was a very cleverly done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic adventure; my favourite film of 2003.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" in theatres, in the summer of 2003, I knew that it was the first of many viewings. I ended up seeing it four times in theatres, and I then acquired the DVD. PotC is a truly great action-adventure film, perhaps the best pirate movie ever made (although that genre hasn't faired well of late). Johnny Depp does an iconic turn as Jack Sparrow, the bizarre anti-hero that captured the audience's imagination, and earned Depp an Oscar nomination (he should have won, if you asked me). Sparrow is a truly unique creation, and he overshadows everything else in the film. Doing his best to match Depp in scenery chewing is Geoffrey Rush, playing another of his memorable villains, Captain Barbossa. Somewhat more subdued are Orlando Bloom, Jack Davenport, and the stunningly beautiful Keira Knightley (in the role that put her on the map). Knightley is just about the only woman in the production, but she is a great screen presence; hopefully she will have a long career ahead of her. My favourite scene is the dinner scene onboard the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth sits down with Barbossa and he gives her food to eat; unable to enjoy the food himself, Barbossa draws an absurd amount of enjoyment from watching her eat and drink; he then follows it up with an excellent monologue, one of the most memorable film speeches I've ever seen. I give "Pirates of the Caribbean" a 10/10.</fullReview>

Sometimes other Depp characters come across funny but I think that is his own little "edge" when acting. He has fun and it's contagious. Anyway, this time the character charmed us into loving him. How can you not love this goofy pirate? The film itself was done beautifully. The stunts and special effects were brilliant. Yes, it was a lot of fun, but then I always loved that ride at Disneyland best anyway... I guess I'm biased.</fullReview>

But In pirates, the acting was good, the actors were good-looking, though Keira Knightley looks MUCH better with her hair down, the swordplay was realistic, the storyline was good, no plot holes. Disney went out of the PG section, which is good. This movie could be appreciated by all age groups, children will like the swordplay, older people will like the story. Don't get turned off because it is a Disney movie, it isn't too childish like too many of them are. They will be very successful if they step over the PG line more. I give it 9/10.

		<fullReview>True to the tagline, I was blown out of the water by this film; for two reasons. I was more than a little afraid that "Pirates" would steer the same course as "Cutthroat Island". Which ended in a major shipwrecking, as I recall. The good part is the actors are giving everything they got. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are playing the eye catchers (blame the scriptwriters) and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are clearly amusing themselves, which works contagious on the audience. In fact, Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow kinda reminds me of Mick Jagger. Same accent, same moves. The story is the bad part of this film. In short: it drags too long. We could have done without an hour at least. The special effect are quite good and the sword fights are nice, but it takes the actors (especially Depp and Rush) to keep the boat from running on the rocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard that Disney was making a film based on the ride, "Pirates of the Caribbean," I was excited. This was by far my favorite ride at Disneyland as a child. I could just imagine the swashbuckling hero battling the pirates and saving the fair maiden. And sure enough, Disney delivered. I loved this movie.My favorite part of this movie was: an actor. Johnny Depp. The man is a master. Even with his slurred speech, matted hair, and half black/half gold teeth, I was amazed at how sexy a character can become when Johnny Depp is bringing him to life. I have seen this film four times now, and every time I sit impatiently until Johnny first appears on his sinking ship. Then I am glued to the screen for the rest of the film. Now I'm not saying that the rest of the cast wasn't good. Kiera Knightly was absolutely beautiful, and Orlando Bloom is as cute as he was in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But I was just completely captivated by Johnny Depp in this film. I can't think of any other actor that could have filled the shoes of Captain Jack Sparrow with such life and zeal. So bravo, Johnny! I can't wait for the sequel.Rank: 9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies i have ever watched. First of all Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hilarious. If he hadn't been in this movie it probably wouldn't be as good. Secondly this move has a great storyline and lots of action with it. Although Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) becomes rather annoying in trying to win Elizabeth Swanns (Keira Knightley)heart by saving her. However I was happy that at the end Will Turner tried to help Jack Sparrow escape. Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) is awesome in this movie. Although he looks really old in real life he is really great in the Pirates of the Caribbean. Jack Sparrow is really great and hilarious in this movie. He adds a lot of excitment and is a great pirate same with Barbossa. This is with out doubt one of the best movies ever. I hope that the second one will be just as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are excellent in the movie. They are both so cool as well as being fantastic actors. If you see a film and you don't have good actors in it then it will spoil the film. This is proberly one of the reasons the film Pirates Of The Caribbean is so good.There are certain parts in the film which they both stand out amonst other actors but I can't tell you as it will spoil the film! The other actors are excellent as well but those two are just the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a one-of-a-kind film that will stand the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pleased with myself that I'm finally getting around to writing a comment. I'll start off with this. This movie is more than you would expect. I went into the theater hoping for plenty of Orlando Bloom screen time, thinking "It's a pirate movie, it might be interesting".One of the biggest understatements of my life.I left the theater with a newfound appreciation for Johnny Depp as an actor. His role and acting were superb in the film. Definitely the best performance of the year. Orlando Bloom, while his performance was not as good as Depp's, was still a great supporting actor, and has the potential to become a bigger star with his upcoming films. Kiera Knightly puts forth a strong supporting role, and does perfectly in the sole female role (not counting Anamaria's). And Geoffrey Rush is one of the best villains I have seen on screen in a long time (with the exception of Gollum). He's the character you love to hate, but feel pity for him at the same time.This is a movie I'd recommend to anybody, and all that I have encouraged to see it thought it better than they had hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 2003.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was easily one of the best films of 2003.The story was brilliant, the acting was amazing and the characters were some of the most interesting and creative to have graced the silver screen.It was about time a pirate movie was made that didnt disappoint. there was action, comedy, romance...there was something for everyone....even my step-dad liked it.Personally, i dont think that the casting could have been much better. Geoffrey Rush and Johnny depp, two of Hollywood's most talented actors....how could they go wrong?Johnny Depp more than deserved an Oscar nomination, although the other nominees were equally deserving, and i think that its a shame he missed out. he has played so many interesting and challenging roles so well that i think he truely deserves one.Overall this is an amazing film that will hopefully stand the test of time, and in ten years time i will be able to sit down with my children and they will enjoy it as much as i have.However, the only think that worries me about it standing the test of time is the graphics. the speed at which technology is improving that will look awful in a matter of years.Other than that, i give this movie an impressive 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp turned an OK film into a masterpiece swasbuckler!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp brought the film ALIVE!!! I thought this film was a typical advenure shooting banging up, cutting up swas buckler. Ifn't wasn't for Johnny Depp, this film would not have done half as good. He should have won the best Actor award for this film, but had to lose to Sean Penn, because it was a Clint Eastwood film, and it was a drama. This film would fit well for all ages both kids and parents. However, the skeleton pirates look freaky like the dead in The Lord of the Rings Part III. This film should have also won best Make-up art for Johnny Depp. The only problem with this film was some corny bits, and some parts that should have been added. This film was an out of an ordinary swas buckler than Treasure Island or any other film. The action sequences were descent, the humor was non-stoppable from Johnny Depp, Orlando bloom was the real good guy hero, Geoffrey Rush was he hateful, and slow thinking villain, and the girl was a real hotty and cuty! this film is an honesty triumph over The Lord of the Rings Part III! It is ranked among the top five best movies of the year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This an absolutely excellent movie. It has humor and great action and is entertaining from the very beginning to the end. Johnny Depp's acting is fantastic. Some might say that they missed more of walking the plank in this movie. Well, then just remember that walking the plank is actually a quite made up story, very much brought to life by movie's like disneys Peter Pan. When the pirates actually managed to take a prisoner the did a lot more awful things then walking the plank. Torturing the people they managed to capture was the way the pirates entertained themselves. All in all this is just a geniously made movie, and deserves a 10 on the vote ranking.</fullReview>

I think Johnny Depp really deserves an award for his great acting skills.I loved the way the bad people were on the deck of the ship and were scaring Elizabeth Swann. My favorite line of the film was "Not all treasures silver and gold mate ....." and " me I am dishonest............................" both said by the very talented Jack sparrow that is Johnny Depp. The fighting was cool and awsome . My family had a great time watching it especially my bro and me and i would really say this film is worth a watch. I really loved it, east or west Pirates of the Caribbean is the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A swashbuckling joy for every fan of classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It just goes to show, this movie was created to promote a ride, but it has turned out to be one of the best movies of 2003. Set around 1700, a ship of cursed pirates scour the oceans for a piece of Aztec gold to lift the curse. Their search leads them to Port Royal, a port town, home to the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) and her secret, blacksmith admirer, Will Turner (Bloom). The pirates, lead by the evil, Captain Barbossa (Rush), kidnap Elizabeth in an attempt to break the curse but when Turner finds out, he tries to save her by seeking assistance of the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). The plot is pretty mediocre- the true sparkle of the film is Depp and the wonderful script. Johnny Depp's flamboyant Keith Richards impersonation is fabulous as Sparrow- probably his best role yet. Orlando Bloom is cringe-worthy as 'nerdy' Turner and portrays the character brilliantly- as does Keira Knightly who brings the feminine energy to the rather over masculine film. This is a film that could have easily sunk like the ships in it but it is ridiculously well casted and brilliantly directed. The script is Oscar-worthy, which could be down to Johnny Depp who made many adjustments to his lines. Full of charming, fun characters, convincing special effects, energetic action sequences and an array delightful accents, this film will transport you to sun, sea, sand and a swashbuckling masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 words: Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just plain, old-fashioned fun. And Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush are the core of this film. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, try as they might are completely overrun by these two shining stars. And we come back to Johnny Depp, he was nominated for an oscar for his role in this film and after seeing it you will understand why. Johnny's traditional affinity for quirky roles is evident in this character of Jack Sparrow. The eccentric, slightly drunk, incredibly dashing and mischievous Pirate Captain. His fellow pirate in the movie and once friend, now rival Captain Barbossa is played to perfection by Geoffery Rush. Rush also opts to not to play his character straight and it is to his credit. I adore Rush, his comical character in "Shakespeare in Love" brings back fond memories. The two pirates steal the show and Johnny the hearts of all the girls in the audience (provided that you like a lot of black eyeliner and dreadlocks on a man.)The other characters pull off slightly dry and less intriguing roles with enough stuffing to hold the film together but not do much for it. The film is wonderful to watch though. It has an enticing and rather odd story line and how wonderful it is to watch Pirates sail the seven seas. This is a movie that Hollywood has been dying to make for years and in it they have created a fun ride and a blockbuster.</fullReview>

Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) provided many one-liners and spur-of-the-moment quips that made me laugh my butt off....The skeletal pirates were well-done and the score was very fitting. I can't think of any flaws right off the bat, except that Tim Curry could've been a great addition! The movie is a tad on the longer side, but you won't notice, because you'll be so busy laughing and crying to the bumbling, dimwitted antics of the worst pirate you've ever heard of....but you HAVE heard of him!I highly suggest this movie....10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intriguing pirate movie. Johnny Depp's character (Cap. Jack Swallow) is exceptionally well fleshed-out and Johnny Depp plays it "to the hilt." The other characters in the movie are also well done and the plot line is complex enough to be interesting, but not too complicated as to be hard to follow. The special effects are also impressive--it's easy to get "lost at sea" in this movie. The movie succeeds in making pirates look clever and attractive, while the traditional British navy types leave something to be desired. All-in-all, this is an enjoyable flick, but one that I wouldn't want my young grandsons to watch, as I don't think they would be able to follow the plot!</fullReview>

But it did have exceptionell special effects. And an extremely hot actor Johnny Depp,who plays Captain Jack Sparrow. A drunken, rum lovin, tanned, hot, intelligent pirate. Johnny Depp is definatly what made this movie so great. NO other actor casted could have played the role of Jack Sparow as good as Depp. I think his preformance was incredible. I loved him as Jack Sparow and as his role as Mort Rainey in his latest movie "Secret Window". All in all I believe that this movie deserves 10 out of 10 because of Johnny Depp the best looking actor in the entire world, oh, yes, plus the fact that the plot was intriging and so very interesting.</fullReview>

It would had not have turned out the same if Johnny Depp portrayed his character any different. This alone added so much to the movie. All the characters were done well. I just can't say enough about Pirates of the Caribbean. It is definitely a movie I have watched over and over on a daily basis and still cannot get enough.

		<fullReview>This is my favorite Disney movie ever. I've watched it nearly one hundred times and haven't gotten sick of it yet. Possibly because Johnny Depp is so hot that it's impossible to get tired of watching it. Also, I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns in the plot. The plot was extremely well thought out. I am interested though to see if the second Pirates of the Caribean movie can match up to the first. I give this movie an 11 out of 10 because Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was just so beleiveable and incredible. No one,I mean no one could have played Jack Sparrow as good as Depp did.( he was made for that role) He is just such an accomplished actor that has a natural talent in acting. Johnny won the screen actors guild award for this movie and was nominated for a golden globe and an oscar. Although he lost out to Bill Murry and Sean Penn he will always be number one in my heart. Because of this movie I became an even bigger fan of Disney and gained more respect for Disney. I await the release of the sequil!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's great to see a pirate movie again, especially SUCH a good one. I love the old pirate movies (Captain Blood, one about Jean Lafette(sp)). But they went out of fashion with fluff movies like Cutthroat Island. Pirates is a comedy and has ghosts but it's got something that makes all that ok. And I don't mean just cute stars either, but Orlando and johnny aren't hard on the eyes! Also, Disney seems to have done some research since making Pocahontas, the ship in that cartoon was rigged so badly that a blind folded 5 year old could have done better. Hopefully the sequel will be well-thought out and not just an attempt to make money off the name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this movie because, quite honestly, I really did not expect to enjoy it at all. Although not a classic piece of filmmaking, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true classic! The cursed tale of a pirate ship's captain, marooned by his mutineering mates and left for dead on a desert isle. He returns with another ship, this time stolen from the Royal Navy, in order to reclaim his rightful command of the infamous Black Pearl, a ship so evil that hell itself spat back her dead. He is joined by the son of a murdered pirate ship's mate, a swordsman who's skill and craft are equal to that of Robin Hood himself. The boy is motivated by love for a woman, herself of royal blood and captured by those mutineering pirates of ill repute in order to release a curse cast upon them from the captured gold of the famous Spanish explorer and conquistador, Hernando Cortez. With the Royal Navy in hot pursuit of their stolen ship, the captain and the boy, along with another crew of pirates, make haste for the Black Pearl, execute a cunning plan, and live happily ever after. Well, not exactly like that but almost. This film is destined a classic because of the dry, witty comments, superb acting of the entire cast, outstanding writing and special effects, and it's about time someone put this swashbuckling story to film. Rated PG-13, which is the number of times you should see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the most fun movie of 2003. The story was original and above average, a pleasant surprise for a story based loosely on a theme park entertainment. The ghost ship and crew was a nice touch, but the show remained essentially an old fashioned adventure story, enhanced by a really good production to make everything seem believable. It had a good pace and special effects, but the strongest thing in its favor was the really good acting. Johnny Depp put in a great performance to make his character amusingly eccentric and likable, but there were other fine cast members, such as Geoffrey Rush and Orlando Bloom, not to mention some really knavish pirates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp deserves the Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is one of my favorite films of 2003. Johnny Depp deserves an oscar for the starring role, and owns the film from the time he hits the screen. Great job all around, the film looks cool, and the special effects are flawless.Admittedly, when I first heard about PIRATES, the idea of a motion picture based on a Disney theme park ride seemed just plain asinine. When I saw the trailer it seemed like it may work, but I wasn't totally convinced just yet. But when I saw the film in the theater, I was completely blown away. Now, having watched it again on DVD, it still holds up as one of the best of 2003.Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow is incredible. He says that much of the persona was inspired by Keith Richards, either way it's an outstanding performance all through the film. The mannerisms, gait, look, everything totally works. Geoffrey Rush turns in a fine performance as Sparrow's nemesis Capt. Barbossa, and clearly loves this role. The rest of the cast is totally solid, and there are also references to the Disney ride, which totally work in the context of the film.This movie is visually stunning, and the effects look flawless. I actually preferred the look of the undead pirates in this film to the somewhat similar treatment that the army of the dead had in RETURN OF THE KING.If you have not seen PIRATES, by all means check it out. It's a great popcorn movie that entertains without being condescending. Cool to see Depp get the Oscar nom, and it would be even cooler to see him win. Now that he's won the SAG award, it will be interesting to see what the Academy has to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the previews for this movie in the theatres, but thought that watching it would probably lower my IQ somehow. When I heard that it was a summer hit, I scoffed thinking "it figures." But after a friend told me it's not that stupid and Johnny Depp gives a good performance, I rented it. I'm glad I did, since it's really fun, but not mind numbingly preposterous. Depp is stunning. Captain Jack just oozes charisma, and I eagerly awaited his return when he wasn't onscreen. I had no idea what this film was about, so the little twist was a complete shocker and quiet scary! I think Johnny Depp deserves the Oscar for his performance. Granted, the other guys gave powerful performances and what not. But Depp did too, and he took a lot of risks in his! None of the other nominees stole every scene of their respective movies. Also, their character portrayals were easily dictated by the script. But Depp created someone refreshing and new. The only thing I could say is that this movie is waaay too long. Three hours? And the fight scene in the cave had a few to many 'twists.' It didn't really need them. Oh well. It's still good over all. I'm glad that they are making a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arrr matey, it's about time these landlubbers made a good old-fashioned pirate movie! I for one felt the need for this kind of action and in my opinion, this movie is brilliant. Just the breath of fresh air you need after the usual gore fest in movies today. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a great achievement, successful in being both fun and thrilling at the same time. It's the kind of movie that you either love or hate, but for a fan of the genre, it's a true blessing and a must see. I haven't been so excited about a movie in a long time and I believe that we need more movies like it, because it appeals a lot to the kid inside everyone. We've all imagined ourselves sailing the seven seas, sword fighting with anyone that comes in our way. "The curse of the Black Pearl" really fires up your imagination and the special effects add to the great feeling of reality the movie gives you, as it takes you into a world long forgotten. Johnny Depp surprises with his role as a pirate captain and is probably one of the last actors you would expect to play such a part. Nevertheless, his performance is outstanding and I can't remember him being so witty in any other role he's played. In conclusion this is a movie you can really enjoy and something the movie industry forgot about, that certain something that makes the seventh art so great: a fun adventure. You'll feel like you're 12 again! I certainly hope there will be a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie 4 times in the theater, and since I didn't have a DVD player when it was released for the home, I bought the VHS tape. Only to buy the DVD when I got a player for Christmas. I have not regretted any of the money I spent on this movie.Yes, I feel Johnny Depp has been robbed of both the Golden Globe award, and the BAFTA, for Best Actor. No one else could have played this character with as much swish and buckle. Hopefully the Academy of Motion Pictures will find it in their hearts to be just and do the right thing.The special effects were so well blended with the CGI. Seamless and smooth, the skeleton crew and swordfight between Jack and Barbossa awed and amazed me.The script was witty and smart, never playing down to the audience and making us feel like idiots. These writers deserved to be nominated too.And while I did notice some minor continuity faults for the most part, most of this stuff made sense through and through.This is a movie worth seeing on the big screen at $9 a pop and worth buying at $25 a video. A must see, must own. And truly one of this summer's highlights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not rush out and see this film. I mean, it is based on a theme ride at Disneyland/World. Ah, but that was my mistake. I kept hearing good things about it and finally did see it. I immediately found the sound track and also purchased the 2-disc DVD set when it was released. Johnny Depp has produced a masterful characterization in CAPT. Jack Sparrow, borrowing perhaps a bit from the barge gypsy in "Chocolat".But Depp truly hones and defines the swash and the buckle in Jack Sparrow. I realize the film was released in Summer 2003 to probably help build concessions at the Disney Parks, and the Caribbean, islands, ships, and pirates are perhaps more conducive to summer movie audiences. But perhaps a slightly later release date might have helped the film garner more Oscar nominations. I regret that the music and the costumes have not been nominated. I am pleased that the Academy did single out Johnny Depp for a Best Actor nomination. I realize his chances of winning are as great a long shot as Seabiscuit's were in his career, but I, for one, hope Mr. Depp wins. Captain Jack has a thrilling physical introduction in the film and his energy just goes on and on. He has a single purpose and he keeps to it, manipulating the winds, waves, and folk that come his way. Beautifully written and acted. It is not often that a choice role combines with a commercially successful film to push an actor up into star range, but Captain Jack Sparrow has certainly done this for Mr. Depp. Mr.Bloom, Mr. Rush and Ms. Knightley are good support. Quite a romp with great swordsmanship. A really good crew assembled. "Yo ho!"</fullReview>

While not perfectly transcribed, they do help one understand lines that were yelled or screamed over cannon fire, wave sounds, etc. For example, I heard Geoffrey Rush say, "They're clubhauling".

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot! Absolutely brilliant screenplay and acting, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Johnny Depp creates an original personality for his character, Jack Sparrow, a pirate looking for revenge after the mutiny 10 years ago from his first mate, Captain Barbossa. Geoffrey Rush gives Barbossa an amazing character, full of wickedness but also just that touch of pity and laughter. When the pirates of the Black Pearl, Jack's old ship, attack Port Royal, they take the governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), with them onto the ship. Keira has definitely launched her career with this role as she displayed some wonderful acting. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is determined to rescue her and teams up with Jack. Orlando has done it again - made a great movie even better. But only Jack knows that a curse has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever.I just absolutely adore this movie; it has everything - adventure, comedy, romance, action, you name it. Not to mention impeccable casting, wonderful costume and makeup, astonishing props and scenes, and amazing music. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a truly great movie. 11/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been disappointed many times by big blockbuster movies that, er, don't really hit the spot, I anticipated PoTC to be another movie to enjoy a bit then forget. It was, after all, branded as a goody-goody Disney movie with a bunch of heartthrobs casted in it. Big deal. How much can an undead pirate ensemble hold our attention and keep us in our seats?Well.Directed by 'The Ring' man Verbinski, produced by big time Bruckheimer, scripted by the writers of Shrek, and casted with eccentrics like the long-lost Depp, PoTC was a project that called upon an unusual combination of dedicated adventurers and artists who unabashedly engineered the movie to the extreme, purely for the audience's enjoyment. I mean, Johnny Depp with real gold teeth and eyeliner, and Geoffrey Rush with a pesky monkey on his shoulder?And it's not just the big guys who did all the magic--watch out for those supporting characters and little details in the set that would keep you smiling.Oh. And, I'm not the only one who has been surprised--and impressed. PoTC garnered FIVE Oscar nominations today, including a Best Actor nomination for Depp's, shall we say, savvy performance that won't be easy to forget. Trust the Academy on this.And why was PoTC so great? Because the people behind the movie simply delivered their all, man. PoTC is romance, humor, adventure, suspense, and horror, all in one package, perfect for the cynical, the innocent, and those in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my favorite movie of 2003 - entertaining, lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining, fun, rousing, and exciting adventure-movies of the year, `Pirates' is far better than you think it is. Basically, it is about a pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who teams with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue a maiden Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and seize back `The Black Pearl,' now captained by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). The exact plot is rather difficult to explain but not difficult to understand. Even though it is based on a Disneyland ride and produced by Jerry `Kaboom!' Bruckheimer, `Pirates' succeeds because it's so full of charm, humor, wit, and absolutely terrific ensemble acting. Almost every single existing review of this movie commends Johnny Depp for his funny, original, and wacky take on Captain Jack Sparrow. And that commendation is well deserved; Depp looks like he's having a lot of fun and he's inviting the audience to share it. His numerous and hilarious facial expressions are worth the price of admission alone! (He truly is one of the most talented and under-appreciated actors of today?he is totally awesome; I can't say enough good things about him.) Because Depp steals every single scene he is in, many critics haven't left room to write about a number of other really terrific performances in the movie. Geoffrey Rush is funny, over-the-top, and pitch-perfect as Captain Barbossa. There is one scene where Rush shines more radiantly than anyone else on the cast: when he is forcing Elizabeth and Captain Jack to walk the plank, Rush har-har-hars and swishes his sword and also has the funniest facial expressions. I also enjoyed the performance of Jack Davenport, as Commodore Norrington; he provided the perfect counterpart of the craziness of Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa. `Pirates' is clearly focused on character acting, which the director and screenwriters have obviously held to be of more importance than explosions and cannons and skewering of people (although there is lots of that too). To comment (to PRAISE, actually) on a few other things, I think the screenwriters did a fine job of mixing wit and humor into almost every single line of this movie. Captain Jack and Barbossa clearly have the best lines and I can't remember a time where I laughed more in a movie. Also, the violence is tame and rather harmless; I appreciated that. There is nothing too graphic. The visual imagery is absolutely superb and the set design is fantastic; the costumes (especially the pirates costumes) were genuine-looking and looked really well on the actors. It's total eye-candy. And lastly, I can't say enough good things about the music. Klaus Bedelt's score is heroic, bold, and entirely memorable. The music accompanied the movie perfectly but still sounds perfectly marvelous even without the movie. Everyone involved in the `Pirates' production ought to be incredibly proud for bringing such a magnificent adventure to the big screen. I can't wait until the sequel! `Pirates' is definitely my favorite movie of 2003. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An E-Ticket Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After working on an internship at Disney World and becoming a devoted Disney fan, I was absolutely psyched for the Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The only other movies that matched my excitement for Pirates were the new Star Wars movies, and let me tell you, Pirates did not disappoint! I dragged my parents to see it during the first weekend and was a bit saddened when the experience was over.Fast-forward to Christmas, and my ever-observant parents give me the DVD. I watch it again, and it's just as good as before, if not better! My only complaint from the first time I saw it was that the movie was a little long, but watching a second time, I was never bored or was never looking at my watch.Every minute is jam packed full of action, humor, and excitement. As so many people have noted, Johnny Depp absolutely steals the show. I was a bit iffy when I first heard he was cast because of movies like From Hell and The Ninth Gate, but he has created one of the most memorable characters of all time. His performance in this movie will be appreciated and enjoyed by people for years and years to come.Along with Mr. Depp, the acting ensemble in this movie is quite good. Geoffrey Rush uses his Oscar clout in a great role as the evil Captain Barbossa. His stature in this movie results in a very fun and formidable villain. Orlando Bloom also does a good job as sort of a naive citizen who becomes a brave hero for the love of his life. Which brings me to Keira Knightley who is just so H-O-T you can't take your eyes off her. I think she is definitely going to have a very prestigious movie career as already indicated in the successful Love Actually.So without making this review way too long, you can tell that I love this movie. It's definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time. The special effects are great. The story is smart and involving. The acting and direction are phenomenal. And most importantly, this movie is just fun, a main ingredient that most movies should strive for.My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)</fullReview>

Action, special effects, a good score, romance, and great acting encompass this film and make it an adventure that you want to be a part of. And a great part of it is that the actors maintain great character and bring humor into the story. Johnny Depp is without a doubt at his best in this film, and most definetly delivers an award-winning portrayal as the adventurous, swave, and disillusioned Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley, along with others, light the screen also. However, in the end it is Depp who bedazzles the viewer. A great movie to rent and watch with others. Although may seem to be a bit of a lengthy epic, it has some great lines and moments that you'll remember days after watching it. I can't wait for a sequel!</fullReview>

It proves that with an excellent director and an even more excellent cast, one can make a movie that keeps one on the edge of their seat. This film may start out unusual but once the burning ship scene appears, the movie is a non-stop roller coaster ride. It might slow down, but only to allow you to catch your breath for the next swash buckling scene. I truly hope that the sequel is as good. There is the possibility of Barbossa returning under the curse of Cortez. The end of the closing title shows the monkey pulling a medallion from the chest of Cortez and turning cursed. Drop the medallion on Barbossa and guess who is back. There is the possibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, as so many have already noted, a great pirate movie, in fact one of the best ever. But it could have been better, I think. I'm not exactly sure just how, but somehow. Perhaps because it was produced by Disney. It seemed to have some of that usual Disney "insipidness" that tends to take the edge off of otherwise excellent movies. Some kind of pandering to an unseen and irrelevant "political correctness". I don't know exactly. It is great for kids, my 10 year old just loved every second, and when you have kids, that counts for everything. I personally enjoyed it, but I wouldn't sit through it again. (Unlike "Return of the King," which I could sit through another 17 times, I'm sure!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's right. This is the best film about pirates and the high seas. Everything here works, this is the most perfect summer slice of blockbuster escapism that has emerged in a long time. High brow critics may bulk, but this is not meant to be a film that is all about characterization and emotion, it's meant to be fun, fun and fun and we get a lot of it.First of all, Johnny Depp is great. The surprising thing about it is, he seems well suited to being in a blockbuster film, more so that I thought before, and even more surprising is that his role as Jack Sparrow isn't the type that is taking advantage of his movie star good looks. Here is has dirty teeth, rag tag long hair and is playing basically a crook, but a lovable one of course. His performance is perfect, from his mannerisms, the slurred speech and the Keith Richards like accent, he should definitely be a favorite for the Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. The rest of the cast are well filled out too, with Orlando Bloom magnificent as the straight man Will Turner, Kiera Knightly is very lovely as the damsel in distress and finally Geoffrey Rush is great as the evil villain with a nice sideline in comedy.The script is surprisingly witty here, but coming from the writers of Shrek, this isn't surprising. It's not high art, but the script is a wonderful adventure laced with magnificent humor. Gore Verbinski as director handled the material rather well, which is a surprise. As the director of The Ring and Mousehunt, I wasn't sure if he were the right choice to be doing this film, especially considering that it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, but alas, I wouldn't be surprised after this effort if Verbinski joins Michael Bay and Tony Scott in the esteemed list of Bruckheimer directors.Of course the special effects are brilliant also. The sequences involving the dastardly crew of the Black Pearl turning into skeletons (the CGI monkey is terrifically well realized) are amongst some of the best special effects of 2003, while the shot of all the pirates of the Black Pearl walking on the ocean floor is spine tingling.Overall this is a fantastic film and ranks as one of the best blockbusters to have emerged from this decade so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what movies should be like!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie was the most pleasant surprise that I've had in a movie theatre since I was dating... this movie reminded me so much of years gone by when movie making was based on great stories as well as great character development and excellent acting...these days, movie makers rely so much on special effects to cover the incredible shortcomings of modern day storytelling and talent... Mr. Depp and the others were perfect for their roles... and, even though the special effects were spectacular, they didn't seem to be the reason for the movie... other motion pictures of late seem to be made just because some guy sitting at his computer can do something amazing and have it look fairly real, to which they then build a story around... the effects in Pirates simply added to the movie... and the references to the Pirates amusement ride made the whole experience even more fun... I wish that more movies were like this one but, alas, after seeing the latest movie trailers, I'm saddened by the lack of talent that hits the silver screen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome! I loved the old fashioned look of it all, the action, and the effects, but Johnny Depp made the movie. It looked like he had a lot of fun in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow. The effects were top notch and deserve the Oscar for FX. It's been so long since a pirate movie has been entertaining and worth paying $8.50 for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was, in fact, much better than I expected it to be. I was dragged to see it by some friends, and I have thanked them many times for making me come. Johnny Depp is awesome as Captain Jack Sparrow; in my opinion he steals the show. This is definitely a fun, swashbuckling adventure, which is exactly what Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer wanted. The DVD is one of the best of the year, as noted by myself along with various newspapers and magazines. The writing, especially for Captain Jack Sparrow's part, was clever. Citizen Kane it's not, but definitely one of my favorite movies of the year and probably one of my favorites ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Sparrow, chameleon extrordinaire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film in the theatre and the DVD adds yet another layer to that enjoyment.The background information reveals that the producer, director, writers, and actors were relatively relaxed, but thoroughly dedicated to creating a very entertaining story. They were doubtless intimidated by the recent theatrical failures of the pirate genre, and that only spurred their dedication. To our benefit. But the leading man and the writers were not completely trusted.The deleted scenes are quite telling. A number of them illustrate Sparrow's more sober and somber and ruthless characteristics and reveal him to be an even more ambivalent character...perhaps more than the makers of the film could credit the audience with accepting....but what a fascinating character he is. Hopefully, the sequels will allow Depp to fully inhabit this chameleon. I look forward to the possibilities.</fullReview>

Not a Depp fan (hes usually to creepy) I find myself captivated with his antics and acceptance of bad luck. his English accent is downright excellent..specialy if he MEANT to sound half cut throughout most of the film. As for Bloom He is most definety an actor with a future...I wonder if Legolas is to Frodo what Han Solo turned out to be to Skywalker..(In other words Mark Who..??) And Miss Knightley what a beauty. A REAL beauty. And dear Jack Davenport after coupling how great to see him in a movie playing quite the opposite and still be excellent bravo Jack. (and twas nice to J Pryce on screen again after been gone a few years..something wicked this way comes is still a fave..:).This film still has my lmao even after a dozen re runs...my 4 and 6 year old kids love it my 15 y/o girl loves it even my hard to please hubby loved it...At last a movie for both sexes and all generations. Its a winner.:D</fullReview>

You haven't lived if you haven't seen it. Anyone who cares to disagree clearly has a problem or are jealous of the wonderful performances by the actors in it. Johnny Depp is by far the best! He fits the role perfectly, and is also VERY sexy ;-) The music in the film is great too, I had to buy the soundtrack after i had seen it.The extras on DVD are fantastic!! You HAVE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film :-D I would be VERY VERY surprised and shocked if this didn't receive a few Oscars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why on earth hasn't Johnny Depp got an Oscar yet???? Even if he doesn't do a movie in a whole year, they should just give him one for being a darn good actor. Darn great actor, infact! This movie was an adventure. One that you could go on again and again and again. Every aspect of the movie was extremely entertaining. As soon as Johnny Depp enters, you know that there's gonna be a hell of a performance. And there was. That guy can play anything and I really wouldn't mind if he played a pirate for the rest of his life! His ability to put on almost any accent for any role is absolutely amazing. He doesn't slip up even for a second. Orlando Bloom looked really good, Keira Knightley looked really pretty and this role suited her well. Geoffrey Rush was amazing, as always. The direction was excellent and the dialogues were hilarious. Very highly recommended! *****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this, it was boring and long. But Johnny Depp rules. The second time I watched Pirates of the Caribbean, it was better. And Johnny Depp rocks.The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story.All in all, wonderful effects, brilliant dialogue... good movie. It is Disney. What a change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, excellent performance by Johnny Depp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this film at the cinema, but I really wish I had because it has instantly become one of my favourite movies of all time. I bought the DVD because I'd heard good things about the movie, and I've been to both Disneyland Paris, and Disneyland Florida and loved the Pirates ride at both of them. Having been on the ride, it's quite easy to spot many things in the movie that pay tribute to the ride, especially in the town scenes. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the movie, but I definitely didn't expect to laugh so much! This movie has such a wonderful combination of excellent acting, astounding special effects, and dry humour. What I usually find with movies that contain a lot of special effects is that they rely largely on them to get ratings. That may work for some but not for me, and this movie impressed me so much because despite the effects being absolutely amazing - I can't fault them - they don't overshadow the characters. All the actors were brilliant, but Johnny Depp really surprised me because Jack Sparrow is unlike any character he's ever played before, yet he played it so fantastically. I just thought he had so much charm and wit, yet you can still see the genuine human emotions and can really feel for him when **SPOILER! SPOILER!** he is once again stranded on the desert island. There is also excellent chemistry between the lead characters, especially Jack Sparrow (Depp) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) even though **SPOILER! SPOILER!** Elizabeth is romantically involved with the other male lead character, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). I think this movie would have been successful without Johnny Depp, but his performance is exceptional and I personally think he made it what it is. His facial expressions, mannerisms and quirky comments are just hilarious and fascinating to watch. In my opinion, Depp should have an award for this performance. This is my favourite Disney film of all time, absolutely fantastic in every way. 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie we should be telling Hollywood to make.Yes, it has big names in it. But they're also proper actors, not celebrity gurners (Willis) or a famous ass with celebrity baggage (J.Lo). Putting real actors at the heart of a daft summer flick like this results in the creation of uniquely appealing characters like Capn' Jack Sparrow.Yes, it's got a huge budget and superb special effects. But they're there to serve the story and blend seamlessly with the action - not to replace story or character. (Are you listening, Wachowskis? Anyone care to greenlight LXG II? Thought not.)Proof that there's life in the House of Mouse yet... Good gags, good characters, a few nasty shocks for the kiddies, and no bloody Phil Collins songs. Uncle Walt would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing over and over!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that has something for everyone - adventure, humor, romance, action, drama, even a bit of the supernatural. And all in just the right doses so that one doesn't overpower any of the others. The writing is wonderful - clever and articulate - and brought alive by a first rate cast. Keira Knightly was only 17 when this was filmed and her acting skills bring to mind Lauren Bacall at the same age. I must say, too, that POTC made a Johnny Depp fan out of me - it really does show what an amazing talent he possesses. Johnny Depp IS Captain Jack Sparrow, having stepped right into the persona of a pirate who is more comfortable on sea than on land. Ruthless in his quest to retrieve his beloved ship and stay "afloat", as it were, he keeps us guessing as to what really lies in his heart, what makes him tick. Half the fun of the movie - most of it really - comes from watching to see what he will do and say next. Yes, it's a long movie, but I really couldn't find a boring part in the whole thing - and I saw it six times when it was in the theatres! See it - you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean - a two hour advertisment for a disney ride? - anything but. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and young blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) as they sail across the Caribbean to save the governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) from the termination of a curse which has left the crew of the Black Pearl in limbo. The swordfights are not very epic, but the special effects are amazing. All of the actors and actresses are amazing in this movie, but Johnny Depp steals the show. His portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow is truly unique. I loved this movie for many reasons, one of which is because Disney went against the grain, and made its first PG-13 movie. Also, the pirates aren't exactly "Hollywood bucaneers." You wont catch and peg legs, eye patches, or pieces of eight in this movie. One of Disney's best.</fullReview>

I think that is was successful because of the fact that it connected with the most visited ride in America, and that it was a jerry bruckheimer film which gives it quality right away. Plus the fact that it had Johnny Depp and his character that just blew me away. In closing, this was a movie that might not get an Oscar but is still an excellent movie. -Ryan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was going to the movies to see it and when i got in i thought:" It will be another movie with beautiful people(except Geoffrey Rush),a terrible script and lots of money for Jerry Bruckheimer". I was wrong. Since The Lord of The Rings the movies will never be the same again.The magic,the cast, everything got right on it. We have to bless Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp, everyone that made it come true.But I came here to tell about visual effects.They made me want to get into the college to study it. I am 18 and I've never wanted to understand how Rivendell was made.But the pirates,I felt they were real that I could touch if I see them. Well,share my experience with another people because this magic will be forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As has been correctly stated in piecemeal form, Bruckheimer simply got it all right with this one. He went back to basics, hired the best in the business and came up with pure escapist entertainment that works on every level. THE ROCK with an eye patch! Didn't hurt his cause either, that Johnny Depp handed in this once-in-a-career performance as Master Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow - part cockney, part Gilbert Grape, all Rock-Star - the most endearing rogue this side of the Jolly Roger! Geoffrey Rush's turn as Barbossa, a supernatural `Captain Hook' gone feral and swapping his parrot for an occasionally digitised monkey-with-attitude is given arguably his best role since Helfgott! Bloom also does just that.Erroll Flynn coming along nicely! Meanwhile, the painfully corsetted Miss Knightley balances the film's romantic interest, Elizabeth Swann, beautifully - somewhere between Ripley and GI Jane.Toss in a truly great script that bridges the gulf so well between pirate chatter and teenage attention-span and you're looking at a seriously brilliant off the wall two and whatever hours of cornball whimsy that wouldn't put a harmful psychological dent in a five year old's psyche.Depp drops one-liners that are funny as all hell (`Stop putting holes in my ship'). The production work, costuming, action sequences and set-design are cutting edge. What we have here is a multi-dimensional `lost-boys' loose in a candy shop. It's a buddy movie, a romantic comedy, an actioner and always at its heart, tasteful family-orientated entertainment. Bruckheimer has tossed everyone's juvenile pirate fantasies into a blender and poured out this tribute to childhood memory and screen decency.Great ending also that does justice to what preceded it. Reminded me very much of another rollickingly good-time action-fest from Sam Raimi that co-incidentally was also top heavy with some seriously aggro skeletal miscreants - ARMY OF DARKNESS. `Hail to the King baby!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can this be? This is like a bad dream. A Jerry Bruckheimer film on IMDB:s top 250 list?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first swordfight can sum up the whole movie. They jump on a board, one guy flies up in the air, he lands on the board again and the other one goes up. And the brain-dead audience laughs, they actually laugh - it's a sin against anyone who considers film an art form.In the words of Tyler Durden, `Murder, crime, poverty-these thing don't concern me.' And his right, it should not concern us as much as Pirates of the Caribbean. Because crime and poverty is things a fraction of mankind have to deal with daily. Stupidity on the other hand is something that affects everyone living today. What should concern us is that a majority of mankind's new favourite movie is on an intellectual level of Teletubbies.To actually criticize Pirates of the Caribbean through pointing out the lack of character development, the fact that every character and every scene is a cliché or the all-around dreadfulness of the script, is pointless. No one that can formulate an intelligent answer can deny it.I would instead like to share with you an epiphany I have had pondering this movie. The question I asked myself was why people have so different experiences watching the same movie? The answer is simply that the child enjoying Teletubbies have a different level of understanding than the adult.The same answer applies to why some people think movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean and A Knights Tale are `brilliant'. And thinks Citizen Kane and A Clockwork Orange are the worst movies ever made.This doesn't seem like such a catastrophe, we are all different, we accept that and get along anyway. But it is a catastrophe to quality filmmaking, because money-grubbing filmmakers without a sense for art will use the same pre-build Hollywood-scripts and recycle the same garbage for generations.Perhaps it's also a catastrophe for human intelligence. Not that a bad movie magically would drain the viewers IQ but it will in another way deprive the viewer from knowledge. Everything is a choice and through seeing a Jerry Bruckheimer flick instead of a Stanley Kubrick film the viewer loses an intellectual experience.How the loss of quality art would affect the democratic system in the long run, which only chance of working at all is if the average voter has a reasonably high level of understanding, is not that hard to imagine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp saved this movie. There, that's all you need to know. POC was a pretty good film overall, with excellent production design worthy of any spectacular epic film. But it was one character that made this whole movie worth watching, Mr. Depp. I have to say, that without Depp, this movie would be tanking worse than Charlie's Angels 2 with an anvil attached to its foot. The eccentricities of his character Jack Sparrow provides such an energy to the film, you can't help not saying a good word about it. Every one of the characters were fairly hollow and boring, but Depp's portrayal of Sparrow provided a nexus for all of the other characters to feed off of. To say the least, this film was fairly entertaining, even if Orlando Bloom seemed completely out of his element. This is one of he few times I will say a movie was good mostly for its entertainment value. Rarely do pirate movies grace the landscape of overly expensive action movies and remakes, but this movie really hit the spot. Go to enjoy this film, because you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp saves this unbearably long film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to tell you whether or not to see this movie in one sentence, I would say this: Go see this movie purely because Johnny Depp is in it.I know that that is what virtually everyone has been saying, but there is so much truth in it. As my subject line says, the movie was decent. It had action, a good plot, and good actors. The script was not too awe inspiring, there were few (but very clever) funny lines, and the special effects were not as good as we've seen in other recent movies. On top of that, the movie drags on for what seems like close to four hours (it actually runs about 2 and a half). The movie drags on and on, and after a long day of work and other activities I was tempted to go home and get some sleep because it seemed like the movie would just never end. However, one thing kept me watching: Johnny Depp.He is absolutely brilliant in this film. He stands heads and shoulders above everyone else in the cast. His take on the role was completely original and the few funny moments that there are seem to always be led by onto the screen by him. You just don't ever know how he's going to react to things next, and you never know exactly whats going through his mind. From the minute he came sailing onto the screen you could tell that he would command this film, and indeed he did. Even the ever rising Orlando Bloom (who I had a serious hard time not looking at him and thinking 'Legolas') was barely noticable when next to Depp. Besides Depp, the movie also scores points for its score. It's not always something you think about when reviewing a movie, but the music in this film really fit perfectly with the action/adventure theme and gets you into the battle scenes. Overall, its an entertaining movie but one that will keep you checking your watch almost constantly. The pace can be slow, and the lines cheesy, but its saving grace is Depp's astounding performance. If for no other reason, go see it just to see Depp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gem of the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe they based the film on the Pirate ride at Disney (I have to confess, it is my favourite ride at the Magic Kingdom). I thought it was genius they could do a 143 minute film and have a plot that wasn't light and had plenty of weight to it.Out of the three movies, this is my favourite.It was the first film in a while to tackle pirates and cover all the key elements of pirate movies in the past- lovely locations, a love story that had the right amount of attention but wasn't the main focus of the plot, great action sequences. Then this film updated it in such a way that modern audiences wouldn't be put off watching this type of film which probably happened in the past as they just didn't know how to make a successful pirate film to appeal to their audience at the time. I thought it was an interesting idea to have the pirates cursed and that they couldn't be killed.The cast was brilliant, I loved the romance between Elizabeth and Will but who I enjoyed watching the most was obviously Johnny Depp. He had a really fantastic idea about making Jack Sparrow very rock n' roll and basing him on Keith Richards. He played him just right and probably made him the first anti-hero in a while that the audience was interested in watching and rooting for.The film really does have it all- stunning locations, really breathtaking. A very unique plot with many twists and turns. Unforgettible characters, incredible and scary special effects and exciting sword fights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A joy from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's surprise hit from 2003 based on their long running theme park ride was widely expected to be a huge flop but is a fantastic popcorn blockbuster featuring swashbuckling action and a very sly funny screenplay from the writers of Aladdin and Shrek.Johnny Depp is Captain Jack Sparrow, possibly the worst pirate you've ever heard of, in search of reclaiming of his long lost ship, the cursed Black Pearl, captained by his rival Barbossa (a brilliant Geoffrey Rush) who have been doomed for eternity by pieces of Aztec Gold. The cast is rounded out by a large contingent of British actors (Bloom, Knightley, Pryce, Crook, Davenport) who excel in this kind of film. There are countless references to the ride throughout the film (and lots of hints of what was to come in the sequels, which is surprising as the follow ups were never planned which is unheard of for a summer blockbuster these days) There's nothing to fault with this film at all IMO. Acting, screenplay, direction, production design and FX are all superb. It's very rare with today's Hollywood product that you come across a film like this that is just pure enjoyment from start to finish. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy has always been my favorite trilogy because of the fact that one second the story will be serious and adrenaline-pumping, and the next, you will be laughing at the antics of Jack Sparrow, who is BRILLIANTLY played by Johnny Depp.But there are several other great actors that do not need to go without mentioning. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both excellent in their respective roles, and Geoffrey Rush plays a great villain in Barbossa.But the thing besides the comedy and acting that sets this movie apart is the action. All of them start off as ordinary old sword duels, but they eventually escalate into unique fights with creative use of props.All of the POTC movies are fairly long, but believe me, you will have so much fun, they seem like the normal old 2 hour movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was a minor quibble with the movie, it is that it is a little overlong. Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like "Stop blowing holes in my ship," that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates Of The Caribbean Curse Of The Black Pearl is a terrific adventure film with action, drama, suspense, some romance, and humor. Johnny Depp is amazing as Captain Jack Sparrow and he's clearly having a lot of fun with this character. The rest of the supporting cast are great in their roles including Geoffrey Rush as the villain Captain Barbossa, Orland Bloom as Will Turner a blacksmith, and Kiera Knightely as Elizabeth Swann. Gore Verbinksi does a fantastic job of bringing this movie to the big screen. From the action, to the drama, to the humor and adventure this film has something in it for everyone who's looking for an entertaining movie to watch. It really is that good and The Curse Of The Black Pearl is now one of the my favorite movies. With two possible sequels on the way lets just hope they can be just as good or even better than this one. Go see it you won't be disappointed even with a running time of 2 hours and 23 minutes the movie is fast paced and action packed. With plenty of humor thrown in that balances well between the drama, suspense, and action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure pirate perfection, to see this film once is worth all the gold and silver in the world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of plucking a long-time neglected genre out of the dark, combining it with concepts introduced by a theme park ride and throwing the varied combination of Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley does seem bizarre and risky. Admittedly director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer had no idea what they had created when they first released this spectacle into the theatres, and certainly weren't prepared for its instant monumental success. Though one must remember that nowadays twentieth century pirate adventure flicks are considered predictable and shallow light entertainment that really only haven't been criticised because of when they were made. Indeed, you might say that it is a miracle that this film was even accepted by today's audience and its creators were very fortunate not to be insulted over and over by thousands of cynical and terribly displeased critics. But no it definitely wasn't fortune that got this over the line and beyond, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of The Black Pearl' differs greatly from the others in many ways. The major one being Depp's exceptional performance as the film's central character: notorious, elusive, sly and unpredictable rogue Captain Jack Sparrow. His unique portrayal turns what could have been yet another classic specimen of a famous stereotype into a character that is hilarious, charming, poignant and perplexing.The other cast members are also pitch-perfect, and some of them are even better: Rush is wonderful as the cunning and horridly cruel villain; Orlando and Keira are nothing outstanding and we feel that we have seen their characters countless times before, but neverhteless they do manage to pull off the pair of heroic lovers that they play quite nicely; Jack Davenport is superb as the dutiful Commodore who greatly despises piracy; Jonathan Pryce is decent as a cowardly governor and the protective father of Keira's character; Kevin.R.McNally is excellent in the role of an old companion of Jack's; and the dynamic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg are delightful as two bumbling blundering pirate buddies under the the service of Rush's character.The music is incredible, and greatly enhances the overall uplifting and exciting feel of the film. The choreography of the action sequences are outstanding, the special effects work beautifully, the costumes are very well designed as are the sets...This is my equal-third favourite film, with the other two being 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. I really sincerely do mean that, no other of my reviews says this. I just hope that i have given this film the vast quantity of praise that it deserves.It completely shatters the Walt Disney Company's reputation for being able to create only babyish kids cartoons and similar live action movies. Though it is still a bold and daring little company that thrives on risky endeavours, like the dazzling 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', such as this.</fullReview>

Orlando Bloom starring as Will Turner, a blacksmith; and Keira Knightley as the beautiful Elizabeth Swann.Johnny Depp plays a magnificent pirate, and was even nominated for Best Actor at the 2004 Academy Awards (but lost).

		<fullReview>It's now almost four years ago that this movie came out and it's still my favourite movie ever! I just love the light-hearted, humorous and adventurous context which stands in total contrast to the sequels which are darker and more epic.The humour in Pirates is brilliant - snarky, sarcastic and the running gags are also working very well. I especially adore Barbossa's monkey Jack (who will get more action in the third part!) But - as everyone else must admit - the real highlight of the whole trilogy is our dear Captain Jack Sparrow - played most brilliantly by Johnny Depp. I can't even say how much I love the character he created! His way to walk, to talk, to drink and to manipulate everyone else without them having the slightest clue as to what really are his motives has completely blown me away. Johnny Depp sure gave the performance of his life with this role and I'm still so very, very mad at the fact that he didn't get an Oscar for this achievement. Sure, Sean Penn is also a great actor, but the fact still remains, that without Johnny Depp we would have never gotten to know our beloved Captain Jack. No one else would have played him like this and he really created something on his own, instead of simply reading the script and doing it in the straightest way possible. And that's why he should have gotten an Oscar! - But hey, there's still hope for the third part!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Celluloid Pirate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched the original Pirates of the Caribbean for the third time. The first time was in the theater in '03, and the second time was when my brother bought the DVD in '04. While the first viewing was fun, I remember the second viewing as rather pedestrian. But I'm glad I watched it again now (after having seen and enjoyed the sequel), because I wasn't bored for a second of it. The dialog is sharp and funny (at times even intelligent), the story progresses very well, and the production values are top of the line (even if '03 CGI looks dated now - but by "production values" I mostly mean the beautiful sets and environments).I was struck by how much of the action of the sequel is prefigured in the original movie, and how some puzzling details that are explained in the sequel were never revealed in the first movie (such as the "compass that doesn't point north", which only in the sequel is revealed to be pointing at what the holder most desires).So while I originally rated the first (and the second) movie a 7 out of 10, I will now emend that to an 8, for both movies. They're a couple of great romps, packed with action, ideas, characterization and eye candy.The third movie, unfortunately, was a huge disappointment for me... :-(</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Kind of Movie That Improves the More You Watch It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie, I was surprised ---no--- out right stunned as to the kind of movie that could be made based off of a Disney ride. This isn't some simple point "A" to point "B" plot, these characters aren't mechanical merry-men and the score isn't the work of some back-stage maestro on a keyboard. Everything about this movie was incredible and surprising, and the more I watched it the greater it seemed to become.The acting of this film was outstanding, with a full and able a cast as could be wanted. The greatest was, of course, Johnny Depp's performance. He always chooses very quirky, very unique and singular, characters to play, and Captain Jack Sparrow fits Depp's natural tendencies. He's a quirky and awkward character who acts as if in a perpetual drunken and ataxic stagger. Accompanied with typically slurred words and uncomfortable body language, this would, in the hands of most other actors, be an awkward and uneven performance. But Depp pulls it off flawlessly in this striking and memorable addition to his acting repertoire.Orlando Bloom, fresh off of his work as The Lord of the Ring's Legolas Greenleaf, plays the blacksmith William Turner, and easily holds his own next to Depp. While his part is not nearly so... colorful... it is, nonetheless, equally memorable. He is a believable performer who has noticeably grown from his Lord of the Rings performance. He acts as the antithesis of Depp's character; a serious and emotional individual to contrast with Depp's quirky and aloof character.This, personally, is my favorite performance of Kiera Knightley's, even overshadowing her Oscar-nominated performance in 2005's Pride &amp; Prejudice. While this role is clearly not meant to showcase her talents, nor is it as necessarily deep or spotlighted as Elizabeth Bennet's, it is a clear and charming performance. She takes on a somewhat comedic supporting role and really shine in it. Her timing matches up well with her costars'; her comedic delivery leaves nothing to be desired. She's rather impressive in a role that could have become another "damsel in distress" awaiting rescuing in the hands of a lesser actress.The remainder supporting cast all deserve mention for their talents. Geoffrey Rush shines marvelously as the villainous Captain Barbossa, Jack Davenport gives a stiff yet convincing performance as Commodore Norington and Jonathon Pryce give a light comedic performance as Governor Swan. Even David Bailie and Lee Arenberg played pleasant comedic performances as Cotten and Pintel, despite also playing the parts of decent villains.The score was absolutely outstanding, a singular masterpiece all its own. Every song, every line, every measure, every note, is so striking that by simply listening to the score on its own you can tell exactly what part of the movie would be playing alongside it. It stands as one of my favorite movie scores, and Klaus Badelt has nestled himself along such greats as John Williams, Howard Shore, Danny Elfman and Elmer Bernstein. I personally preferred it to Return of the King's score (Which is really, really saying something, as that was a masterful composition), and the fact that this wasn't even NOMINATED for best score is a travesty to the history of the Academy Awards.Visually, it was outstanding. The special effects for the undead pirate crew were pretty impressive. But they weren't overly obtrusive; for how obvious they were, the effects were actually rather subtle still. The only part where they become a little hokey is when Kiera Knightley's launched into the air on a sort of trampoline. Other than that, the effect were flawless.Overall, this is an excellent movie; perfect for families, action fans, comedy fans and fans of any of the main actors/actresses. It is certainly deserving of all the praise it's received as well as it's position on the IMDb top 250 (currently 237). This is a surprising gem of a movie, and one that it's quite difficult to find a person who absolutely dislikes it. It's a very safe movie to recommend to everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Disney movie in my opinion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, I didn't know much about Johnny Depp before I saw this movie back in 2004, a year after it came out. But now hes my favorite actor. It is probably one of my favorites because of great acting from Depp, Bloom, and Knightley. I also enjoyed how there are the different scenes from the ride at Disney land/world. Cpt. Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) was by far my favorite villain of all times. I honestly cant think of any weaknesses in the movie what so ever other than the CG isn't up to date anymore. Over all I think that the entire cast deserves three flaming thumbs up(if thats possible) I highly recommend to everyone. I think I'll be Jack Sparrow this year for Halloween...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is masterful entertainment for people of all ages. I didn't take it seriously the first time even though Depp impressed as always. He certainly did get a slew of awards and nominations, including a chance at an Oscar. He was certainly deserving of it.Amazing the concept comes from a theme park. Everything is done right here. Often movies fade as time goes on, but this one moves from strength to strength and builds up to a finale the way it's supposed to be done.I don't like Disney and don't understand anyone who does. So it just doesn't feel good this coming from such a financial - and even political - empire. But it's good fun all around.The soundtrack, made by Zimmer collaborator Klaus Badelt, moves along just like a Zimmer production would. It keeps things going.Masterful entertainment without being profound - and the lasting memory will always be Captain Jack Sparrow. That this one is in the all time top 250 at the IMDb is perhaps too much - but an 8 out of 10 is exactly appropriate: it's that well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the commercial for this film in the TV and I thought, Oh, I don't want to see this movie it is way to scary. But my parents got it for me at my birthday and I completely fell in love with the movie, its characters and the humor. It has the wonderful mix of action, romance and humor that only a few, too few, movies have. I have now seen it so many times that I have stopped counting. I know must of the lines by heart and I still thinks it's a brilliant movie even when I know the ending. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and even when he's not in focus he completely steals the picture. Keira Knightley is gorgeous and Orlando Bloom is so handsome, but Johnny is the true star in this movie you just have to see. I will recommend the commentaries on the movie, some of them are really entertaining. So see it again and again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best pirate film in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best movies in my collection of DVD's. Pirates of the Caribbean is the best rendition of a traditional pirate movie plus all the special effects and budgets of our day and age. Johnny Depp was the absolute perfect character to play Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom couldn't have played the part of Will Turner any better. The casting crew did their homework and compiled and all-star team of actors and really knocked this movie out of the park. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 because there isn't any other pirate movie out there in the market to compare this one with. Better yet, I haven't seen a pirate movie at all that was worth anything except this one and I must say, I have been duly spoiled by it. I hope they come out with a sequel, because I can guarantee you that I will be one of the guys waiting outside the theater just to be the first one in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahoi there!!! "Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" is one of the most funny, exiting, action-filled, spectacular masterpiece of this genre! One thing over all: Johnny Depp! He is simply fantastic acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow. I consider him one of the best actors of all times because he is always perfect in almost every role (thanks to Tim Burton that discovered him!). Jack Sparrow is incredible, funny and strange, the perfect buccaneer for a movie like that. Good performance from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley too. The photography, the sets, are perfect, and you can feel all the "salty" feeling of the Caribbeans in the whole movie. The story is good: a good mix of adventure and mystery, filled with action, explosions, and naval battles. The extra contents on the DVD shows how they have bought to life all that magic! The soundtrack is epic and it fit perfectly in the movie, thanks to Klaus Badelt, a real artist. In conclusion, this is an adventure masterpiece, incredibly entertaining for everyone who have a little pirate-child inside! HARRR..... where's my bottle of rum???</fullReview>

I went to see it the first time because the Lady Washington played the Interceptor and she was built on the harbor where I live. I just was enamored with Johnny Depp whom I had only vaguely heard of before. I am so glad I went to see it I would have missed so much if I hadn't.

I wouldn't have gone to see it if my friend hadn't told me how good it was.The actors were phenomenal, and the script was so well written. Johnny Depp gave an outstanding perfromance as the legendary Jack Sparrow. He portrayed his character so well, a rough, take-no-crap tough man, but somewhat sweet on the inside. Kiera Knightley had a character with same same kind of personality as Jack (except not as happy-go-lucky while drunk). Orlando Bloom, oh my gosh! I never thought I could find a man with long hair sexy, but he just completely....ugh, it was great! His acting, his character, his look, all fantastic.

		<fullReview>Although when thought of a pirate movie was in the making i had my doubts whether it would be a worthwhile movie 1 to watch or 2 to even make, whether or not it was based on a Disney theme park ride or not. But how i was wrong.With none stop brilliant acting throughout and a real smart dialogue with the right amount of humour to not this into a comedy genre movie was ideal. The real show stopper was off course the great Johnny Depp who up to now in my opinion has never played apoor role.The way he move and most definitely talks is perfect and in my opinion no one else could have played the character as good as he, he was seriously a joy to watch. With great help from the all star cast or Bloom, Rush and off course Knightley the film started and ended with absolute flying colours.The best thing in this movie is the way that the zombie pirates of the black pearl are portrayed and in my opinion a bliss to watch. I feel that every one should watch this movie and if they don't should be cursed to being in a zombie state themselves.Ps that last line was a joke.</fullReview>

Totally first class acting from the man as the irresistible Captain Jack Sparrow, loosely based on Keith Richards.Sparrow swaggers and burbles his rum-soaked self across the Caribbean on a quest to reclaim his beloved ship the Black Pearl from his mutinous first mate Barbossa and involves young Will Turner (Orlando B) who's trying to win over Elizabeth Swan (Keira K). So follows the most exciting and funny adventure on the seven seas with some really great quotes.If you haven't seen this already I'm shocked and suggest you go out and buy it now (you'll want it in hard copy, trust me.) Potc2:Dead Man's Chest London release is 7th July 2006 and they are in the process of filming Potc3. Long live Captain Jack Sparrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It figures that Johnny Depp would, for years, reject offers to star in commercial filth produced from the bowels of Hollywood in an effort to distinguish himself from other "pretty boy" actors, take on daring film roles such as in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and then only achieve worldwide superstardom for finally bowing out and performing in a terrible Disney film produced by a socialist bottom-feeder who churns out the same reptitive crap from untalented hack directors on a daily basis.Yes, I'm talking about Jerry Bruckheimer. Depp should have never answered the telephone. He should have instead read the script for a low-budget indie film and persevered. Now, he's hot stuff. He's got his name on high-profile sequels, remakes, and childish epics of silly proportions.Congratulations, Johnny. You did it. You finally sold out to the conglomerate Hollywood. You whored yourself out. And guess what? It worked. You sold your soul to the Devil and now you're famous.I only have one question. Was it really worth it? I hope so.</fullReview>

Keira Knightley plays the part of Elizabeth excellently and Orlando Bloom did a great job with Will Turner. There is a lot of comedy in the movie, most of it coming from Johnny Depp. There is a part near the start of the movie when Depp comes sailing into Port Royal in a sinking boat and by the time the boat gets to the platform it is just at the right height for Depp to step onto the platform from the crows nest. There is also a thing called the Pirates code that the Pirates will never break, however Captain Barbossa always finds loopholes in the code.

		<shortDescription>"Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie was sometime during the summer of 2003. I read about it a bit, heard about it from a friend, and decided it sounded like a nice movie, so I might as well go watch it. And at first, I came out thinking it was a nice movie, nothing more. But I had watched it again later. And again. And again. And you could say the movie grew on me, because while I admit this isn't the best film ever made, it is my favorite movie.So what makes this so great? It's fun. I can watch it many times over and over and never grow tired of it. Be it the incredible fight scenes, the captivating scenery, the rich and amusing dialogue, the interesting plot line, or the unbelievable acting, something about this movie never bores me and just has me watching it again and again. I have seen the Star Wars movies many times, and can find myself growing bored while watching them. I have seen the Indiana Jones films many times, and lately found myself beginning to grow a bit bored while watching them (they are still enormous fun, though). I have seen Pirates more than any of the previous films, and never once have I been bored with it. Too often I catch it on the TV, sit down to watch a favorite scene, and stick on for the rest of the movie. It simply never gets old, and it's just as fun to watch it the tenth time as it is to watch it the first time.Part of the reason for it is, I suppose, that the movie doesn't really rely much on its plot to progress. Sure, it has a good, solid and interesting plot: the town of Port Royal is attacked by the cursed pirate ship, the Black Pearl, captained by the vile captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal, is kidnapped by the pirates due to a certain medallion she possesses and the name she gives the pirates as her own. Young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith who has a secret love for Elizabeth, goes to rescue her and enlists to his help captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own plans regarding Will, the Black Pearl and Barbossa. It is interesting to see how the plot develops, but what really holds you are the magnificent scenes that come one after another. Whether it's the amazing sword fights (such as the early fight between Will and Jack, an extremely well-choreographed and amusing clash), the naval battles (fire all cannons, arr!) or the stellar performance by Johnny Depp, each scene is as captivating as the previous.I have mentioned all the good things in this movie (and yes, there are a lot of them), but the absolute best is the acting: Bloom and Knightley are good as Will and Elizabeth, each portraying their characters personalities extremely well, and you can believe that the two care about each other. Geoffrey Rush is extremely captivating as the villainous captain Barbossa. He manages to look, feel and sound like a true villain (even adding a little "arr!" here and there) while still having us believe that Barbossa is a human after all, with motives and feelings. You can understand why he's doing what he's doing in the movie. And as for why he's a pirate - that's what rotten scalawags such as him do. The true star of this movie, though, is Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow is incredible - he acts a bit drunk and a bit crazy (to the extent where you hardly see the difference when he actually is drunk!), yet he is also cunning, intelligent and thoughtful. He is also amusing to no end, dishing out funny lines one after another, while maintaining to remain serious when the time calls for it. Depp's acting in this movie is truly the best I have ever seen in my opinion, and I believe to this day that he has been robbed of his rightful Oscar.And finally, I can't help but mention, that simply the fact that this is a pirate movie makes it so fun. Pirates are fun, and I am really interested in pirates. This film may not give a historically accurate version of piracy (I don't recall undead pirates ever mentioned in history books) but it's still fun, and gives you everything you need when it comes to the romanticized view of pirates that's so dominant in today's modern culture.Jack Sparrow says at one time during the movie: "Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate." and this is especially true of this film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is treasure. It's a captivating, enriching experience. You'll come out with a smile on your face, and the mood for swashbuckling. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, hurry up and do. Anyone who has, go watch it again. It's worth it. I'd give it 11 out of 10 if only I could. ARR!!</fullReview>

With the help of Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) they set out to retrieve Elizabeth(Kiera Knightly). They go to the secret hiding place of the "cursed pirates" and watch as they sacrifice the blood of Elizabeth. In the end the "cursed pirates" are cursed no longer, thanks to the great fighting skills of Jack and Will. All Johnny and Orlando fans should see this movie and the movies to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the Black Pearl" is the best movie I've ever seen. In this film there are: a cursed ship, the Black Pearl,with a cursed crew; a charming, fascinating, romantic, wonderful, clever, smart pirate, Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp); a proudly and lover blacksmith, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom); a lovely, beautiful Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley); and a perfidious, horrible, ironic captain of the cursed crew, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). To notice the perfect performance of Johnny Depp (Oscar nomination), and Geoffrey Rush's performance, too. The director of the film is Gore Verbinski (THE RING), and the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer (PEARL HARBOR). The scores are perfectly for this movie and they are absolutely amazing. All in this film is wonderful, but not so wonderful as Jack Sparrow! I love him! The best interpretation of Johnny Depp, his most popular character, which includes his first nomination at the Academy Awards. He is so perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite movie of all times! It's full of action and is not a scary pirate movie. I have watched it many times and I can't get enough of it. The actors/actresses are great in this movie. Johnny Depp is especially good with his facial expressions. I am eagerly waiting for the release of the second and third movies. I have bought the DVD and the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this movie is also really good and the only soundtrack I have ever bought.In this movie Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) must sail in search of the Black Pearl, where Elizabeth Swann(Kiera Knightly) has been held captive. The Black Pearl is under the control of Captain Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of cursed pirates.This movie has a great plot and is continuously exciting. Also there are many memorable scenes and quotes. If you have not seen this movie then you are missing out on a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, entertaining and funny adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever played Monkey Island? This film is a pirate movie in true Monkey Island style. In case you've never played that game it means lot of fun, crazy pirates, a beautiful lady and a bunch of zombie like pirates.First of all the story is good. The whole love thing is simple and not original, but who cares?! It works and the setting, characters and the whole curse thing spices up the story a lot and makes it very interesting. The dialog is very nice. It's funny, but not all too funny. That keeps the focus on the story. The characters are good and they work well together creating contrasts and showing development through the film.Johnny Depp is very good. He pulls off this whole pirate act really good and manage to take on an English accent. Orlando Bloom is nothing worse. His performance in believable and good. All together the cast is strong and preform very well. The use of English actors makes the whole thing more believable.The effects are well done. In the beginning you'll see some not exactly impressive CGI, but the rest is much better. The skeletons looks good and the explosions too. The fights are well coordinated and the rhythm of the fencing in the blacksmiths workshop is really nice.The music is also good. It's piraty and gets you in the mood. It builds up around the action and fits the movie very well. You don't pay attention too it, witch is a good thing. It means it fits the movie and the action and subconscious just affects your feelings like it should.It's a good looking movie, meaning the cinematography is good. The composition is good and so is the lightning. No shots stood out as extraordinary, but no one stood out as bad neither. It's nice shooting with some playful shots here and there and all together good cinematography.The sets and decorations also make this movie good looking. The mix of CGI and real stuff is good and the look of the costumes and the settings are believable and nice.All together I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was way better than I expected. It added a lot of comedy, but still focused on the story and managed to remain serious. I would definitely recommend this movie if your looking for a high quality, cool and funny adventure movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was everything a great pirate movie should be, and more! Instead of adding more praise and point out some flaws, which previous reviewers have already done, I will say this: Johnny Depp may be the coolest character that sweeps you away but Geoffrey Rush is actually the better pirate. You will realize this during the scene where Barbosa points exactly the same out to Sparrow. The bottom line: Sparrow has a heart and cares about doing the right thing while Barbosa is one evil son of a b*** who'd sell his own mother if it would make him a profit.Oh, and the true star of this movie, of course: The Pirates! I felt so sorry for them in the end. But looking at the sequel currently in production and seeing the names of supporting cast, perhaps I have nothing to worry about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As everyone here can see, many of the comments about this movie is positive. The Writing was excellent and i can give it a 9/10 for just its writing. There are tricks and twists in this story. Hence, for those who have not vote, watch this movie again and concentrate with their actors and the script. I am sure that, you are going to enjoy this movie for the next round. I think there will be another movie coming out for this, hence i encourage everyone of you to watch it. Although not a classic piece of film-making, the movie was never intended to be such and did exactly what it intended to do - entertain. The make-up and costumes for the pirates were very well done and most of those same pirates were very well played. The town of Tortuga and the ships were also quite impressive. Geoffrey Rush was very good in his role as Barbossa, although perhaps he should have been more evil. Jack Davenport and Jonathan Pryce were very good in their roles as Commander Norrington and Governor Swann. However, as already mentioned a million times, Johnny Depp completely steals the show with his wacky performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. This character should have been pretty one-dimensional but instead he's larger than life. Sparrow is a very memorable character. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley had perhaps the two worst performances in this movie. Their characters were so flat that one truly doesn't care what happens to them. Looking handsome or pretty just doesn't cut it. Another complaint is the extended scenes involving fights with skeletons. Although the CGI pirates were impressive, the fight sequences near the end go on far too long. That said, the movie is still surprisingly good and very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. Each actor did a great job. But the one that really stands out it is good old Johnny D not to mention he's hot but he has a lot of talent. his portrayol of capt. jack sparrow is what makes this such a great movie to watch he's funny charming and witty. my suggestion is to go out and buy the DVD. it has a whole CD of special fetures that are just as good as the film. I rate this movie 9/10. The extras on DVD are fantasticE to get it, it will be WELL worth the money, you will not be disappointed one bit. I have seen it MANY MANY times and I still find it funny, it REALLY is a must see film. The only problem with this movie is Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley. Too much screen time for such unimportant story lines. Pirates should have just been more on Captain Jack Sparrow and less on the sickly love birds. It doesn't add much to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh my god i love P.O.T.C, it is such a clever film. Johnny Depp is the perfect casting choice as Jack Sparrow. he is really funny, and plays the part really well. i know some people will hate me for this but Orlando Bloom really annoys me in this film and i know he plays the part well Bla Bla Bla, i just don't like him.it has such a good storyline and they perform it so well. i must have watched the film at least 10 times now and i am getting a bit tired of it but it is still one of the best films out there. i wasn't sure when i heard about the trilogy, but when i had seen all three of the films i was totally hooked. usually films get a bit boring if you have such high expectations but the next 2 films were just as good. Keira Knightley plays the part of Elizabeth Swan really well too. she really helps make the film as good as it is.it is a masterpiece of a film and everything about it is brilliant. it is a film for the whole family to enjoy and i know for certain all of mine enjoyed it. i would recommend it to anyone. 10/10 definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some time now I have been putting this movie down because it didn't seem to appealing to me when I first heard about it. Now, I know, I was so wrong to say I didn't want to see it. One reason was because I knew the sequel was on the horizon and that I felt I should see the first in order to get a sense of what Pirates was all about. I loved just about every aspect of this film. The acting was great and the story had so much to tell that I never felt like the film was long just for the sake of being long. Johnny Depp played a great pirate and so did Orlando Bloom, only in the latter part did he really shine though. The story is pretty simple but is an old tale that people of all ages will react to, for some time, as they always have. The effects were not over the top and they were done to a point where I thought I wouldn't care if I could tell the difference between live action and CG. The only thing I felt to be off balance was some of the Disney dumbness, that plagues most Disney movies and was probably put in at the request of Disney to make it more audience friendly. Overall I felt that I saw a movie and not some action flick with no backbone....ie(STORY). When I was finished, the movie gave me a sense of pride I have not had in a long time when I watch film. I have seen something I will never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Accident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, here we go... 2 years after initially seeing this movie, it finally hit me. This movie should have been absolutely terrible. It had a mediocre plot, terrible screen writing, Disney (which, at this point in time, if it didn't have Pixar attached, it sucked). The initial character development and interaction was contrived and shallow. So, why such a wonderful movie?Because of the people behind it. Everyone talks of Johnny Depp, whom i will agree got robbed of a worthy Oscar that year. He is an excellent actor, whom was hilarious and refreshing in what could have been a cliché role. But, we cannot forget the ENTIRE cast. Geoffery Rush, once again adding his own ingredient to a meal already been had, played a devilishly enjoyable villain. Orlando Bloom gave us proof that he can, in reality, handle dialog with other characters, and i believe successfully broke the chance of possibly being type casted. Keira Knightly added a visually stunning character, which would have been understood from the beginning. But, she didn't allow her character to fall into such an easy "no-so-damsel-in-distress" role, which has been played again and again.In essence, it was the people involved that made it what it was. While i'm concerned for the sequel, this is truly an adventure classic, with very little cliché's, awesome and intriguing characters, beautiful and fluent choreography, awesome set design, and most importantly, a cliché' and boring plot/script in the hands of true talent, who were able to break it from the Blockbuster purgatory that it was doomed to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie this summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW.It's not often I watch a whole movie with a smile on my face, but I did with this one. It was a delight from start to finish, and I can't think of anything bad to say about it aside from the fact that it bugs me that Jerry Bruckheimer actually produced something I liked.Here's the top ten things I loved about this movie:1) Johnny Depp. A simply amazing, scene-stealing, MOVIE-stealing performance. Pure genius.2) Restrained use of CGI. It was thrilling to see REAL PEOPLE swinging from the ropes on those ships. And the CGI is effectively employed when it is used, especially during the underwater march of the cursed pirates.3) Johnny Depp.4) A great cast. Orlando Bloom doing an amazing impression of a young Errol Flynn and holding his own in scenes with Depp. I look forward to watching this guy's career. Geoffrey Rush doing a great job as the villain and making him almost as fascinating as Depp's Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly as a beautiful, smart, believably spunky heroine. Can't wait to see more of her! Uh, I mean, in other movies. Acting. That's what I meant. What did you think I meant? Get your mind out of the gutter. Oh, and Johnny Depp is great, too!5) Everything you'd expect in a pirate movie, including a talking parrot, a monkey, Spanish gold, a ship battle, a young hero of uncertain lineage, the governor's daughter, walking the plank, "Avast!", "Davey Jones' Locker", hats with big feathers in them...and yet it NEVER seems cliched.6) Johnny Depp.7) The exhilarating music.8) A movie without one use of the F-word, not to mention a restrained amount of swearing since this IS a pirate movie. Oh, and no nudity or car chases or buildings exploding. It is summer, isn't it?9) Amazing fight sequences; the early, acrobatic sword fight between Depp and Bloom, and the ship battle, were stand-outs.10) Oh, yeah, and Johnny Depp is great! Did I mention that?I'm a big fan of the two recent Mummy films, and I think this one falls into that category of enormously fun, endlessly entertaining adventure flicks. There's nothing profound here, but hey, it's summer, and this movie is great fun. This is one of the few times in my life when I've said this, but God, I hope they do a sequel! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining jumbalaya of a pirate movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two reasons to see Curse of the Black Pearl (and I'm speaking more to adults, kids will see just about anything they can get into admission-wise) are the effects done on the crew of the Black Pearl, and two performances amongst those that were OK but nothing special- Geoffrey Rush as the taut, creepy captain of the Black Pearl, and especially Johnny Depp as the somewhat unconventional captain Jack Sparrow. On this site it's said that Depp patterned his character's moves and voice after Keith Richards, which I can see, however my first impression watching him was that he was basically playing Raoul Duke from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas in a pirates cap and with gold fronts. This is indeed an original turn for Depp, even if we've seen him do something like this before, and it helps when a persona is this fresh in a story that counts the numbers a bit too often.Curse tells of a governor's daughter, Elizabeth, who is on the verge of being married to an uptight British officer, despite to pining of blacksmith Will Turner (LOTR's Orlando Bloom). When she is kidnapped by a looting band of pirates one night, he enlists the help of imprisoned Jack Sparrow to find her and the Black Pearl. But when the curse is revealed to Elizabeth that's when things get suspenseful (to a degree). One thing that makes this a worthwhile time for the kids is that it's the first PG-13 film from the Disney people, and though it might have fared a higher calling if it was under a different studio with an R rating, it can give them a chance to see some scenes parents may find a little risqué. For instance, at one point Jack and Elizabeth are stranded on an island (which is all I'll say as to not spoil it), and he finds a stash of rum in a hiding place, and then the two get hammered under the moonlight. Another instance is when the curse is first revealed, once again under the moonlight, and this can be a perfect introduction to the magic of zombies. The action scenes, however, are the weakest scenes of the film, which is a let-down since there's some good choreography in the swordplay, but there's just something about the way they go on that doesn't catch the viewer in (at least me) like how other action scenes this summer have. By the end of 'Curse', the audience can see it's nowhere near greatness, but as popcorn fodder it is a pick of the moment. B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Shiver me timbers!' Matey, we have the coolest pirate film of the summer with Gore Verbinski's (`The Ring') `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Jade.' The coolest pirate of all time may be Johnny Depp's (`Chocolat') captain Jack Sparrow, a fey swashbuckler with androgynous mannerisms and a slightly besotted mien possibly from too much wine or just an overactive actor's imagination. At any rate, Depp steals the booty and the film in a gracious act of saving the summer from the absence of any unforgettable performance. Verbinski clearly let Depp do what he wanted, and he did. Fortunately, unlike Marlon Brando on the loose, Depp can contain his genius and entertain while still showing formidable talent of the very best in film today.Inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name, `Pirates' tells of Sparrow pursuing the ghost ship Black Jade, run by a real skeleton crew and headed by the sordid Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). They seek to break an ancient curse by kidnapping the luscious Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, `Bend It like Beckham'). Most of this is parody of all the pirate films ever made, right down to the talking parrot on the buccaneer's shoulder, swordfights, treasure coves, and a post-modern pirate's code interpreted as just `guidelines.' Even Orlando Bloom as Knightley's love interest looks like a young Errol Flynn. With over 600 visual effects shots as well, Verbinski succeeds in making a rollicking good story while satirizing the genre at the same time. But at 143 minutes, with several returns to the same locations and a tedious father-daughter tiff, `Pirates' is too long and repetitious. Without the watchable Depp, it could have been the sunken `Cutthroat Island' of mid-nineties infamy. The bard as always catches the cavalier spirit: 'Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage, And purchase friends, and give to courtezans, Still revelling like lords till all be gone . . . .'As it is, in a summer of mediocrity, `Pirates of the Caribbean' is worth seeing for its unpretentious fun for the family, just like Disneyland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Originally a skeptic, it got to me! A mighty fun adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH:Well believe it or not I just saw this movie! Up till now I had no desire to see it. I'm not a particular fan of pirate movies and not a big fan of action/adventure type flicks(though that's been changing a bit in the last few years.) But I have to admit I have been curious. So many people I know have seen it and told me I am really missing out on something special. So I did indeed see it this week. And the movie got me! I thought it was excellent.As has been mentioned, the best part of the movie is Johnny Depp. Now I'm not exactly a huge Depp fan. I appreciate him and do think he's an amazing actor but have never taken to him as strongly as some other actors. But I have to say, his portrayal of Jack Sparrow was brilliant and easily the best role I've ever seen him in. Depp takes this role and Creates an unforgettable history making movie character. His Sparow is fun, funny, mischievous, lovable and quirky. He definitely made The movie for me.And the cinematography is fantastic. The movie rippled with adventure and drew the viewer in immediately. The campy fun atmosphere was perfect as was the larger then life quality. If one's ever been on the famous pirate ride, they will find things they recognize about it too. And Bloom was very good as was Kneightly as the fiery pirate loving Elizabeth. Perfect casting.The movie may have been a little long for me and I won't say there weren't a few draggy moments but by and large this was a wonderful adventurous ride and I really felt bad I didn't see it when I originally came out though I'm not sure I'd have appreciated it as much then, if I had. As mentioned, I had been gradually getting more into these type of flicks and I think the more appreciation one has for the action/Adventure film the more they will appreciate this though it is the type of film one can enjoy without necessarily being a major fan of pirates and sword fighting. The reason that is so, is because, simply put, these characters are fun and different as is the movie and there are moments of pure exhilaration. That's something that a good adventure movie needs(actually almost any type of movie) and Pirates has it. It is so utterly unique it isn't surprising to me now that it has received so much recognition though I admit I didn't get it before I saw it.Not that there were not some negatives. The biggest one is the length of some of the sword fighting scenes. Some of them I thought, just went on an unbearably long time, particularly the one toward the end. It did get to the point where it really became a little numbing and unless one is terribly into the sword fighting element I think a lot of people might feel that way. I'm not sure how long the last sequence was but it seemed like hours. I wish that had been a bit shorter. One scene I loved though, was the fight between Depp and Bloom in the beginning. That was excellent and one of my favorite scenes.So....I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and can't wait to see Pirates two which I will be doing very soon. I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it and maybe Skeptical. It's a mighty fine time!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was an okay movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, this movie was pretty good. But, the ending was cheesy. As Stephen King once said, "You can have a really good storyline, but it isn't as good as it could be because of the ending. After all, it's the ending that matters most in a story. Without something special to wrap it up, the story is worthless." With Pirates of the Caribbean, the storyboard directors should have been more choosy about what makes it in the movie. The ending of Pirates of the Caribbean makes it seem like the entire plot is a whole big love story, even though romance was shown very little throughout the film. Though, the hanging scene was good, the "As is mine" part wasn't necessary. Jack could've just thanked will and went on his way. And After Elizabeth's dream and before Johnny comes in, it was rather boring. I mean who CARES about Will and Elizabeth. It's setting up for a romance movie, when the movie should make the audience focus on the cursed pirates and Captain Jack, which is after all the focus of the movie. They could've just shown the part where Elizabeth puts on the necklace, then opens the window showing Port Royal. Then, the next part could be when Jack comes in on the boat. It would have kept the pirate theme alive, while still showing the movie from Elizabeth's point of view. There was a lot of action in this movie, so it should have ended shortly after a part with a lot of action. After the pirates become cursed no longer, they could've had Jack become captain, once again, and end the movie there. It would have made the people leaving the theater, thinking thet just came back from a really good pirate movie. Instead, they just remember the final part, so they leave thinking, "That had a really good love story in it." COMPLETELY forgetting about Will and Captain Jack's huge sword fight and the climax of the 3rd act. The movie was overall good, but I would've tweaked it a bit to make it perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie deals upon a curse on a pirates , then they abduct the starring named Elizabeth Swan(Kiera Knightley) with the aim she free them of a damned spell.But she's helped by a likable pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and a rush blacksmith (Orlando Bloom).They will have to confront a nasty villain (Geoffrey Rush)and his henchmen.The runtime film is overlong : two hours and some , but is neither boring , nor tiring but entertaining.The motion picture mingles adventures, action packed,tongue in cheek,rip roaring, humor , love and is enough bemusing.The movie there is a homage to the pirates' films, also to Ray Harryhausen and his picture ¨Jason and the Argonauts¨ regarding the living skeletons. First rate interpretation by Johnny Depp ,he plays like a ¨drag queen¨ and Robert Newton in the film titled 'Blackbeard'.Kiera Knightley is beautiful but lacks her experience who proved in his followings hits , becoming first star.Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush(Shine)is excellent but overacting.Colorful, glamorous cinematography by Dariuz Wolski and lavish production by Jerry Bruckheimer.Direction by Gore Verbinsky and Klaus Badlet's music is riveting.It's followed by two sequels : ¨Dead man's chest¨ and ¨At world's end¨ with similar actors and technicians.Rating: 6,5/10 .

One of the major problems with this movie was that it was so unrealistic that it ruined the whole movie. The real pirates were nothing like the pirates in this fake piece of trash. I would rather watch my finger nails grow than watch this stupid movie again. If your into the fake stupid pirate movies than I would recommend this movie, but if you like movies that are realistic than avoid at all costs. I don't know how this piece of garbage made it to theaters. Hollywood has really gone down hill their new movies. This movie was a real disappointment to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie with a great performance by Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: this review is from 2003.) In its fullest, "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Curl" succeeds as entertainment. It is one of the great adventure films of this year, jam-packed with chills and thrills. It's a rousing swashbuckler with a great cast and a great story. But, ranking in at 143 minutes, it goes overboard on scenes a few times. Just a few.When "Pirates of the Caribbean" first opened, my Website was bombarded with desperate letters from frenzied fans of the film, all asking me to post a script for the film. It is perhaps the most requested script I've ever had people write to me about. It's amazing what an impact a film such as this can have.It stars Johnny Depp in the lead role as the infamous pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, the worst pirate the film's Good Bad Guy has ever heard of. "Ah, but you have heard of me," Jack says. Jack used to be the captain of a deadly ship named the Black Pearl, before a mutiny took place at the command of Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), who left Jack for dead on an island where he drank rum for three days and got a permanent case of sea daze.But Jack survived, and now with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he will track down Barbosa and claim his ship back. Will is not in it for the ship, however, but rather for the young girl, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa in hopes of removing a curse put upon him and his crew after they removed gold coins from a cursed treasure chest. By the moon of the light, Barbosa and his idiot crew turn into skeletons. They cannot die, they cannot feel pleasure. They are "cursed pirates." First, they must restore all of the golden coins to the treasure chest, then pour the blood of a Turner over the stash of treasure. Captain Barbosa thinks that Elizabeth is the late Bootstrap Bill Turner's daughter, but he never had one -- his single child was a boy, and the boy is Will, who is coming to save Elizabeth from a doom that he himself should be facing more than anyone.Confused? Don't be. When you watch the movie it will all make sense, because it just does.The main element that carries along "Pirates of the Caribbean" well past its expiration date is the casting of Johnny Depp in the role of Jack Sparrow. In a constant drunken stupor and with a splendidly funny rough British accent, Depp has finally hit payday in a mainstream motion picture. He's been cast in cult favorites over the years, specifically those directed by Tim Burton ("Edward Scissorhands," "Ed Wood"), but he's been around since "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Platoon." He hasn't exactly gotten major recognition over the years, and though movie buffs know him by name, mainstream filmgoers probably wouldn't recognize him at first. Not now, however. Now everyone's jumping on the bandwagon. Depp, at forty, has finally gotten a mainstream break.Also helping the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa. He's a dastardly villain with bad teeth and, we can only assume, bad breath. He's good at being a bad guy, but because the film is rated PG-13, a big step forward for Disney, he isn't allowed to be quite as vicious as he probably would be. And, I can only assume, the rating prohibits him from taking advantage of poor Elizabeth while she is held captive aboard his ship....The movie's score is by Klaus Badelt, who has been getting his big break lately with films such as "The Recruit." It's a good score that fits the film's tone of pirates. Pirates are everywhere in this film, and at one point a character remarks that it's good to be a pirate, or something like that. I just wonder: If that's true, why does Disney prohibit pirating of its films? Har, har."Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is one of the better entertainments of the year, helped primarily because of a great cast and witty script. But the character that will stay in your head long after this is over, more than any other character in the film (including Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's father, who I have not mentioned before now and I think I should have), is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. He's going to go down in the books as one of those famous film heroes. And what saves him from becoming another gung-ho hero is what helped Harrison Ford make Indiana Jones so likable: He's an apprehensive and cautious hero with wit and loads of dry humor and funny one-liners to spare. He's not the type of hero who is necessarily always looking out for the best because he wants to save the world, but rather because he knows it's sort of his duty to do so. And he does so with apprehension. It's a key to making a great screen hero, and Johnny Depp succeeds where I can only assume most modern action heroes would fail.Let's just hope the rumored, upcoming back-to-back sequels don't sink to Davy Jones' Locker, eh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Good &amp; Bad Of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it but lost interest on the second viewing, for some reason. It's the usual Disney adventure story which means the same good and bad traits I usually find, namely:THE GOOD - Nice camera-work and very slick-looking on DVD. Interesting characters, mostly here the ones played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's difficult to find a role in which Depp doesn't play someone odd and/or fascinating. The story has a good mixture of drama, action, suspense and humor. Keira Knightley is attractive as the female lead and the story is interesting for the full 133 minutes (the last 10 minutes are ending credits.)THE BAD - Once again, the messages are "laws are made to be broken;" "rebels in society are the good guys while authority figures are the villains," and the girl wants the poor man over the rich man, etc. etc. That all is so '60s clichéd by now, you'd think the Baby Boomers in Hollywood would grow up, but apparently not. These traits are in almost every film, including a worldly outlook on everything, which includes glorifying occult nonsense. Disney will never change.OVERALL - A fun movie, thanks mainly to Depp, director Gore Verbnski and his cameramen, and successful enough to spawn a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic comedy meets campy horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Pirates of the Caribbean last night, I was very surprised to see that it had an IMDB rating of 8.0! Could THIS MOVIE really be one of the best 250 movies ever made?!? Then I looked at the voter breakdown, noticed that females gave it an average rating of 8.7, and the 1,041 females under 18 gave it a 9.5! Suddenly things started to make sense. A little sense.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW* Basically what we've got here is a pretty typical story. The rich governor's daughter loves the poor blacksmith boy, and he with her, but she's supposed to marry the military man. The blacksmith boy is amazingly handsome, makes the most beautiful swords that you've ever seen, and is an amazing sword fighter, since he practices in his free time-- apparently against no one. The military man takes a role that's been popular in romantic comedies lately. He's not a horrible, slimy jerk. He's just not the type of guy that women want to marry. He's stuffy, always follows the rules, and there's nothing the least bit entertaining about him. Of course she ends up with the blacksmith. Yawn.The story was incredibly predictable. The evil, vile pirates don't seem that evil and vile, perhaps because they were given too many comedic gags. Additionally, their fighting scenes looked like some sort of a cheesy video game. They never really seemed as real or threatening as they should have.Bloom and the girl turn in average performances, as does Geoffrey Rush. I was really disappointed with that, as I expected him to really blow me away. Unfortunately, he either wasn't feeling it, or he didn't get adequate screentime.Johnny Depp was quite good. He really brought some fun to an otherwise drab movie. Had it not been for Depp's performance, I don't think that this movie would have made half of the money that it did. If you DO watch Pirates of the Caribbean, watch it for Depp.6.5 of 10, rounded down to hopefully drag this thing out of the top 250. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Jerry Bruckheimer Piece of Trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing I realized when I saw this film was that Disney is running out of ideas for good films. I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks. It's a pirate film with some good acting but Orlando Bloom proves yet again that he can't act. After the daughter of the governor of an island in the Caribbean is captured by mysterious pirates, only two people are able to save the beloved Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). These two men are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Some how they are able to comender a British super vessel able to navigate it across the ocean. The movie just went way to long, topping two hours and twenty minutes, way to long for a Disney film. Jerry Bruckheimer adds tons of corny lines and supposed battle scenes between undead pirates and British Soldiers . Johnny Deep and Geoffery Rush do what they can with the roles they're given. Their are some beautiful filmed scenes of the ocean but their really isn't a story. I guess you could call this entertaining for a nine year old but for anyone else it's just a yawn fest. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Starring: Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, Keira Knightley, and Jack Davenport. 2 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush, Zoe Saldana: A celebration of pirate movies symbolizing trouble when placing trust in the world. Jack Sparrow placed emphases on his ship, the Black Pearl until his partner's betrayal. He is sentenced to death until a pirate raid results in the kidnapping of the Governor's daughter. They seek a medallion that can lift a curse. Directed by Gore Verbinski who previously made The Ring and The Mexican. He brings a sense of youthful enthusiasm that works. Johnny Depp delivers a hilarious scene stealing performance as Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush is fierce as his ex partner. He is the evil pirate leader seeking the medallion. Its power is never properly explained but they are seen as skeletons under the moonlight. Orlando Bloom plays a weapons manufacturer. Keira Knightley goes beyond damsel in distress as the Governor's daughter. She is involved in a mesmerizing sequence where she is hurled aimlessly from skeleton to skeleton when she realizes the horror that is upon her. It is obvious that she and Bloom will unite. Zoe Saldana plays a female pirate who joins Bloom and sets out to confront Sparrow for stealing her ship. Special effects are best when the moonlight turns normality into a skeletal frame of relentless horror. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disregarding the bloated the carcass that has become the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series helps restore the lustre to "Curse of the Black Pearl". At least, it did for me. It's a rousing pirate adventure, cleverly mixing battle scenes, humor and memorable characters. But it's really built around Captain Jack Sparrow, which is a problem I had with the later entries when the cast really got crowded and he was (somewhat) sidelined. But he is the real magic here, and Depp plays the character with mincing bug-eyed flair. He's a treat.Then again, so's the whole movie, especially bearing in mind that it's a big effects movie spawned from a theme park ride. Let that sink in for a moment, and this really has no business being so good. Like some sort of mad science experiment in Anaheim that was never supposed to work.Yet it totally does.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with eccentric pirate "Captain" Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to save his love, the governor's daughter, from Jack's former pirate allies, who are now undead.Although he has been around since the early 1980s, and has made such great films as "Edward Scissorhands", this is now the role Depp is best known for. And, as of now (2015) it may remain that way, as his career seems to be in idle any time he appears as any other role (though his Wolf in "Into the Woods" has its charms).Worth pointing out is how this film has one of the finest scores ever recorded for a Hollywood movie. Even if the soundtrack existed and the screen was blank, the film would deserve credit just for the score. Not many films could claim this, but "Pirates" can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, A Decent Pirate Movie Back On The Silver Screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie after all these unnecessary sequels, still remains the best movie. When I first watched "Pirates of the Caribbean" at the age of 11, it breathed new life into pirate movies that seemed to have been absent since "Hook" (1991). Luckily with a fantastic score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer, plus fantastic performances from Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. It's debatable who steals the show, as director Gore Verbinski creates a movie that is anything but slow and visually wonderful."Captain" Jack Sparrow (Depp), searches for a ship and crew in order to get revenge from Captain Barbossa (Rush), and claim back his ship the legendary "Black Pearl". Unfortunately along his way, he also manages to involve Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and local blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Who become entangled with the villainous pirates and their quest to break an ancient curse.Saying all that. I suppose I would like to jokingly shoot myself in the foot, and say what are the point of all these wonderful fight scenes if they're cursed skeletons who remain pretty much invulnerable? Regardless, the styles and influences definitely hearkens back to the Golden age of Hollywood. The choreography is swift and for as much as the CGI is wonderfully rendered, a majority of effects are practical thanks to the films impressive budget (Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer).Final Verdict: One of the better live action Disney movies, and probably the best movie ever based on a theme park ride. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Pirates of the Caribbean Condensed Storyline: A group of cursed pirates are looking for pieces of Aztec gold which a woman called Elizabeth has, she gets kidnapped so a black smith has to team up with a pirate to rescue herNotable Acting: This entire franchise stands on the shoulders of Johnny Depp, he is what gives this movie it's spark. No matter how great Geoffrey Rush's, Orlando Bloom's or Keira Knightley's acting was if the main character of Jack Sparrow wasn't done right, the movie would have fell on deaf ears, mainly because this movie was suppose to be about Will and Elizabeth's characters, but it was just as much about Jack and Barbossa. So everyone really needed each other to make the drama and tension work for this movie.Graphics: The skeleton crew of the Black Pearl are nice effects to say the least Incorrect Science: The boat scene at the beginning is impossible because you would need to have the strength of 100 men plus the weight of them to keep that boat from floating to the surface, mainly because wood floats and the air trapped in it that they are using to breath would make it float moreIncorrect History: Granny Smith apples were not discovered until 1868 "Bob's your uncle" was not used until 1890 Concertina was not invented until 1829 Trapdoor gallows weren't invented until 1800 Incorrect Geography: Gunships are generally too big to sail in Jamaican waters Overall Feel: This movie was one of the biggest gambles Disney had made up until this point, as Disney always liked being family friendly. They found that this movie worked they would continue milking this franchise for another 5 movies up to this point. There are a lot of science and history errors in this movie, but it is made to be an action, adventure, comedy flick. I liked this movie as it had a solid cast, decent budget, good effects. Everything you would want from a fun movie which doesn't take it's self too seriously. This movie was based on the ride of Pirates of the Caribbean, but there is little to no reference to the ride in this movie, there is more reference to the previous Disney in this movie than the ride. But the movie was made to be its own movie, so it stands by its own merits and works great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best. Forget the rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With every additional sequel the 'Pirates' saga has become bloated and weighed down by its own sense of whimsy and importance. And why do they have to be so bum-numbingly long?! However it is important to remember that this first entry was actually pretty good and contained lots of good moments.Johnny Depp is on fine form as Captain Jack and the Will/Elizabeth romance is not nearly as annoying as it would become in later instalments.It's a good stand alone film really but you can understand why Disney, faced with a surprise hit, would want to milk it for all its worth. Sadly though, the more films that are produced the more the reputation of what once was a strong franchise is weakened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked three things in particular about this film. Just say Johnny Depp three times. His character Jack Sparrow redefines the term swashbuckler. Not since William Hurt's performance in Children of a Lesser God , and to a slightly lesser degree Kevin Costner's in JFK, has an actor so resoundingly stolen the show. If you do not like Johnny Depp, 'Pirates' is not for you. If you do like Mr. Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), you will enjoy 'Pirates'.That is not to say that Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush were less than fantastic. Rush made a delightful villain as Capt. Barbossa, and Orlando Bloom's performance brought charisma to a rather limiting role as Will Turner. Expect nothing but good things from this young actor in the future.Let us examine the plot. This will be a rather short paragraph, for sword fights do not a movie make. The opening scenes show a young Elizabeth Swann on a ship at sea. A young Will Turner floats up on a raft, unconscious, wearing a gold medallion round his neck. Elizabeth hides the medallion so that no one else will know that young Will is a pirate. Years later, the pirates come to Port Royal in quest of the gold piece and kidnap the governor's daughter Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly), now all grown up. The fact that she also has the medallion they are looking for is just one of those lucky things that will happen if you're a good pirate who eats well and stays fit. Captain Jack Sparrow shows up at about the same time and he and Will commandeer a ship from the Royal Navy to chase the pirates, save Elizabeth, and add some adventure to their otherwise bleak lives. Swordfight, swordfight, swordfight, and that's about it. Let us just say that Pirates of the Caribbean has all the plot of an amusement park ride and leave it at that.</fullReview>

Blah, I know that most of you have read several reviews of the movie since 2003 and I am not going to bore with how great the acting was, how the humour worked and the VFX was amazing but I am not. The only reason for this review is that the Academy missed another opportunity to revive itself in the minds of the common audience. Jim Carrey was snubbed so was Steven Spielberg (Read The Truman Show and Saving Private Ryan ) Jack Sparrow will be considered as an icon in the next 50 years. Never before we had seen a character with such indulegence in himself and slyness beyond the usual. The Academy could have recognised the fact and given the Best Actor award to Depp instead of their usual winners.Nevertheless, the character will remain etched in the minds of all POTC fans. Whenver the name Johnny Depp comes up, I am sure most of us will remember him as Jack Sparrow.Now, Bring Me the horizon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a massive fan of Johnny Depp in the past, but I must admit that his performance in Pirates of the Caribbean was nothing short of perfect. He really stole every scene that he was in and really helped in making this a fun and entertaining feature.What's also great about Pirates of the Caribbean is that the story itself is both captivating and compelling. Basically, the Pirates of the Black Pearl led by Barbossa (brilliantly portrayed by Geoffrey Rush) kidnap the governor's daughter (Keira Knightley)after they discover that she has the missing gold piece that they need to lift the curse of the Black Pearl.Upon realising that she has been kidnapped, blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) calls upon the help of eccentric pirate Jack Sparrow (amazingly performed by Johnny Depp)to help in the mission to rescue her. Turner recruited Sparrow as he is a pirate himself and was a former ally of the Pirates of the black pearl and therefore he knows where they will be heading. A crew of pirates are hand picked to assist in the rescue - there is one scene where Sparrow asks a couple of questions to one crew member, but this crew member can't speak as his tongue got ripped out so a parrot does his talking for him. Genius!POTC combines all of the elements of great film making; good acting (particularly by Rush and Depp), impressive special effects, humour - Jack Sparrow is utterly hilarious - check out the scenes where he gets slapped by several different women and the scene where he is marooned on an island with Knightley's character. These scenes are absolutely hilarious. There are also plenty of battle sequences to keep fans of action happy too and these battle scenes come fairly frequently so the film never becomes dull.If you like films that have a mix of humour, action, combined with a compelling story and pretty impressive special effects then look no further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a bona fide classic, one of my 50 favorite movies! Capt. Jack Sparrow is a hero for the ages! brought to life by the lovely Johnny Depp. Depp gives a swashbuckling original performance. Curse of the Black Pearl is high seas adventure to the very end, barrels and barrels of fun! It's good and fun for every last second! Captain Jack's character introduction is excellent, at the very beginning when he first steps onto the docks from his sinking sail ship, I love that! It reveals Jack's sloppy and resourceful being as a pirate. Depp acts brilliantly and totally brings out the best in Sparrow. He acts like a drunkard. I can imagine how much fun this role would have been for Depp. The nomination was good but he should have brought home the Oscar. Orlando Bloom's attractive as young Will Turner. Depp and Bloom alone are plenty amusement for the ladies. Keira Knightley looks amazing as Elizabeth Swann as she's wonderful. She's just too good of an actress, better than even Rush or Depp. Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa, a creative and fun villain. The 1st Pirates of the Caribbean is the only one worth its weight in gold. The sequels pale in comparison. Each of the Pirates of the Caribbeans are worthy for Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack character if nothing else, but the 1st Pirates is the only one that's really well-crafted. Curse of the Black Pearl has great writing, gorgeous cinematography and sharp, learned dialogue. I love the visuals of this film! Pirates is funny and is one awesome family adventure! Pirates of the Caribbean is a great tale filled with interesting characters, pretty landscapes, and extravagant sets. It's really always a good viewing, it's harmless fun, and it never grows old! It'll really lightens your spirits. Pirates of the Caribbean is stylishly artful, but also, it's really very fun!</fullReview>

With Depp in the lead role.Orlando Bloom as the simple yet sword trained lovestruck young man, who helps Captain Jack as his soon to be love, Elizabeth Swann played by a then 18-year old Keira Knightly is kidnapped by the antagonist of the film, Captain Barbosa played by Geoffrey Rush who would later be a good guy in latter films.As Jack wants revenge against Barbosa after he stole Jack's ship among other things and much more.A mighty fun time for this Disney feature and Johnny Depp and company making it more amusing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney fires one across the bow with winning 'Pirates'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally published on June 11, 2003: Let's face facts, Johnny Depp's record in films has been pretty good throughout his career.From his early efforts, "Edward Scissorhands," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," and "Benny and Joon," to later work in "Don Juan DeMarco," "Ed Wood" and "Sleepy Hollow," he has maintained a steady run of decent performances.He has also never been nominated for an Academy Award, although his terrific work in "Ed Wood" did earn him a well-deserved Golden Globe nod. Oscar neglect, however, may end with his latest entry, Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl," which, like many of his other roles, does not disappoint.And even though he is not working with his favorite director, Tim Burton (this movie is helmed by Gore Verbinski, "The Ring"), he still does a marvelous job.Based on the wildly popular ride at Disneyland, which, in turn, was inspired by an episode of the 1950s TV series, "Davy Crockett," the plot has Depp as the leading man,the bumbling, mascaraed pirate captain Jack Sparrow of the ship, The Black Pearl. Marooned on a deserted island as the result of a mutiny, he thus missed out on the curse the vessel was plagued by.Given a blunderbuss with one bullet (in which to end his misery), he nonetheless saves it to gain revenge against his mutinous first mate, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, Oscar-winner for "Shine"), but there is a catch. The crew of the ship has now become part of the living dead, so it may be a bit difficult to dispatch the traitor.Along to aid this cause is blacksmith William Turner (Orlando Bloom, the elf in the "Lord of the Rings" films), who was found adrift as a young boy wearing an Aztec medallion (part of the whole curse thing), as well as Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly, "Bend It Like Beckham"), the daughter of the British provincial governor (Jonathan Pryce, "Brazil").Depp, even though a dashing handsome man, is in rare form here, not afraid to look ridiculous or take a pratfall or two, but at the same time, engages in some amazing swordplay and derring-do athletics. He also carries his British accent amazingly well, albeit he does sound a bit slurred and inebriated, much like Dudley Moore in "Arthur." With Sparrow's motley crew of handpicked pirates chasing the Black Pearl, the Royal Navy is also in tow, searching for Elizabeth. Conclusion has all three groups battling it out in a somewhat frightening denouement.Picture is also peppered with not only sharp, intelligent dialogue not usually found in a Disney film, but features some obvious scenes taken directly from the ride itself. Also, the cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, "Dark City," "The Mexican"), visual effects (Joel Behrens), costumes (Rochelle Best) and makeup (Greg Cannom) are top-notch and spot-on, giving this film a feeling of complete authenticity.All in all, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a fun, wonderful adventure, not unlike the attraction from which it came, one I am proud to say is still one of my favorites. Beware parents of younger children, however, there are some scary sequences and frightening characters as well as some violent scenes which give this movie a PG rating - the first ever for a Disney production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Biggest Surprises Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was one of the most surprising films I have ever seen. I was very apprehensive going in. It was based on an amusement park ride! And I remember thinking "This is going to be bad" after watching the trailer. I think it was one of those trailers that cram in all the cheapest jokes the movie had to offer. But I went because Johnny Depp is my favorite living actor and my college friends had an obsession with pirates. I was blown away by how funny it is and what a great ride (hee hee) this film is. Depp really makes the film. It would probably be a completely forgettable movie with anyone else as Jack Sparrow. I can't think of a better example of an actor completely losing himself in a role and having as much fun as possible.

		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie quite a bit when it first came out and its still good to this day. Usually Disney goes for really childish movies but this one has more of a grown up feel and with a fun interesting story line and a great performance from Johnny Depp this movie becomes very enjoyable.This movie is about a blacksmith who teams up with pirate Jack Sparrow in order to save the love of his life who was kidnapped by Sparrows ex gang of pirates who are now undead monsters.I know the plot sounds kind of silly and strange but this movie is really enjoyable. Besides the countless historical errors if you blot those from your mind and just sit back and enjoy the ride it is very fun once all said and done with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl boasts a large British cast, consisting of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightly, Jack Davenport, Orlando Bloom, and Jonathan Price. Impressive. Their acting is good. But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit.Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann, his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest.Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears, Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it, the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock.There are some great special effects, suspense, and humor in this overly long film, as well as some wonderful acting, but Johnny Depp steals the film. His hilarious Jack Sparrow, based on Keith Richard, is fantastic. He makes this a film a cut above the usual adventure film by giving such a quirky performance. As he would say, savvy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often Contradictory, Sometimes Even Campy, Curse Of The Black Pearl Is Still A Fun Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is flawed fun. It's mostly predictable, it's got some good gags, but it's heavily flawed. The film has literally HUNDREDS of contradictions and plot holes. I enjoyed the film, but the contradictions were distracting. This film has a fantastic first half hour. It's funny, and thrilling at times. However, after that first half hour, the quality drops. It's still enjoyable, and you will be entertained, but it never lives up to that first half hour. The musical score is VERY good. There were too many hands in the score for me to properly credit anyone, but Hanz Zimmer played a big part in the score, and it shows. The action, is mostly generic, and will never have you on the edge of your seat. At times, the action is even predictable. At the minimum, it's passable, and not terrible. The acting is strong. Performances from Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Geofferey Rush shine. The story is a little on the cliché side, but it's a silly tale, and no one really cares. In addition to contradictions, there were a lot of moments where I rolled my eyes at the improbability of it all. Of course, teenage boys tend to eat that stuff up. POTC: TCOTBP is a fun, albeit flawed movie, that's probably best for teens and tweens with low expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney seemed to be going down the tubes lately, with Atlantis and Home on the Range, but this movie is a masterpiece. If it wasn't for this movie, Johnny Depp wouldn't be as famous as he is today. Every scene with him or Geoffery Rush is brilliant. The movie is very crisp and the shots of the islands are breathtaking. Definitely a movie worth picking up at Blockbuster or even better, buying ( I don't buy DVDs often but this was one of them). The characters are thought out very well and plot is excellent. The script is one of the main stars of the film itself, every line that seems to come out of Sparrow or Barbossa's mouth or any of the other cast is original. If you like action films you'll love this, if you like comedy you'll love this, actually, this movie is great for everyone (except small kids, who may get frightened by the skeleton scenes). 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome _ Depp!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney "adventure" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect? And then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...I cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen "Pirates" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, "Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?" And that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp was hilarious a Jack Sparrow, and acted like a true Pirate. His obsessive drinking antics, and his walk really brought out this chaqracter. Plus he made character we could all love and enjoy, that deserves an Oscar in my view.Geoffrey Rush played Barbosa the bad guy. Who turned out to be quite a good bad guy in my view. He showed real potential, and I loved the way how he manipulated people.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth, the governor's daughter. Prisoner of the Pirates. She is quite momorable in this role, and is a great jump for her evergrowing popularity.Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner. A simple blacksmith, who is also a well trained swordsman. Who is in hot pursuit of saving Elizabeth from the Pirates.The more memorable thing about this though is the curse. A well thought out curse. That can always lead to sequel or a prequel. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed, and they want to rid the curse. To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of Bill Turner- William Turner. Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates Capture Elizabeth, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbosa. While all at the same time are being chased by the British fleet.A great adventure. Well played swordfighting. Great laughs. Great music. And great story. Pirates are back in my good book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The films opening scene was fantastic. It was fun and creative and really captured the essence of the Jack Sparrow that we love. It kept going for a bit. The first 20 minutes of the movie were the most exciting and fun parts of the movie except for one scene which I feel may be second best scene in all the Pirates films.The infamous addition of mermaids was the best part in the entire film. It was very reminiscent of the powerful underwater march of the dead from the first film.Lets move onto the acting. Most of it was decently solid but Ian McShane as the villain, Black Beard stole the show. He actually seemed like the only one who cared to make the film interesting. Another newcomer to the series was Penelope Cruz. She was nothing fantastic but completely necessary to bring in a much needed sex appeal to the film. Geoffrey Rush returned as Barbosa, I felt he was very confused as to if he was a bad guy or good guy which caused his acting to seem very indifferent. There were a few scenes that you knew he was having fun but otherwise he was just a drag. And of course Johnny Depp reprized his role as the witty fun loving Captain Jack Sparrow. Again he had his moments just like Barbosa that were fun and creative but he even came up a little lackluster in certain scenes.The story was super simple, which I guess is understandable considering the convoluted mess of 2 and 3.There was an unnecessary sub plot that never got resolved, which I wish they spent a little more time on and made it a little darker. I am not going to spoil anything though, but you will see what I am talking about when you see the film. As you wait for the scene after the credits you want it to be the conclusion to this sub plot but nope. The climax could have been a bit more climatic and more exciting, but I guess they did what they could. Most of the action happens in the dark so I would not recommend the 3D transfer of it. I saw it in 2D and I thought the 3D wouldn't be worth it.It was nothing special and definitely not Gore Verbinski. The way the film turned out, it looked like the director was even bored while shooting.Positively though it is a summer blockbuster where your brain needs to be left at home and will be enjoyed by lovers of the series. It may not stay with you but for an hour and half of the movie out of the 2+ running time you will be enjoying yourself which I guess is not too bad.On initial reaction to the film I gave it a 7/10 because at the time it was enjoyable. Then I thought about it and the reason I almost fell asleep twice was not because it was late, it was because the story was boring and nothing was really happening in this lengthy piece of work. Therefore on second reaction it gets a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new kind of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer created a completely new genre of movie with the Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not just a pirate movie, not just a ghost movie, and not just a comedy, but all combined into one strange tale of curse, legend, and adventure. Not to mention some romance along the way.The movie also created a new character, Capt. Jack Sparrow who's not even human as the hero.The story is bit convoluted and difficult to understand. Why the curse started in the first place, why Jack is cursed, where the heck Davy Jones' locker came from etc. etc. Even if you've paid attention, some of the details still remains unclear, and remains that way in the subsequent sequels.The movie is beautifully made, although bit creepy at times. Johnny Depp's acting adds to the mysterious mood of the movie. I've watched this movie several times along with its sequels, but I still haven't figured out the whole story yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pirates who infested the Caribbean in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may, in real life, have been a murderous bunch of cut-throats, but Hollywood has generally seen them as swashbuckling heroes, as in the Burt Lancaster vehicle "The Crimson Pirate" from the fifties. "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is a modern film in the same tradition. It is said to be based on a Disneyland theme park ride, although in this context the phrase "based on" probably means little more than "sharing a name with".The film is set in Jamaica during the late seventeenth century, presumably before the destruction of Port Royal in an earthquake in 1692, as part of the action takes place in that city. There is, however, little attempt at period accuracy, and some of the costumes and uniforms on display seem to date from a much later period, in some cases as late as the 1770s. There are a number of other goofs; why, for example, would anyone need a warming-pan in the tropical climate of Jamaica? The plot is a complex one, which I will not summarise in full. It centres upon the rivalry between Will Turner, a blacksmith, and pirate captain Jack Sparrow for the love of Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of the British Governor of Jamaica. Despite their rivalry, and Will's detestation of all pirates, the two men have to join forces to rescue Elizabeth who has been kidnapped by Hector Barbossa, captain of the pirate ship the Black Pearl. Barbossa and his men are under a supernatural curse, laid upon them when they stole a treasure of Aztec gold. It transpires that Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl, but lost his command when Barbossa, against whom he has sworn vengeance, led a mutiny against him.The studio did not hold out great hopes for the film; at one time Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner even wanted to drop the production. In the event, however, it proved an unexpected success, both critically and at the box office, and has spawned three sequels to date. The fact that a major character dies towards the end of the film might suggest that the producers were not anticipating a sequel; the character in question was miraculously resurrected in time for "Dead Man's Chest". There are, I think, two reasons for the film's success. The first is that, despite a complicated and often nonsensical plot, the story is an entertaining one which moves along at a fast pace. The film stays true to the traditions of the pirate film with some good action sequences, including an excellent hand-to-hand duel between Will and Sparrow.The second reason for the film's success is some highly inventive casting. This was the film which first made a major star of Keira Knightley. The lovely Keira had already had a big success in Britain with "Bend It like Beckham", but was less well-known in America or internationally. In a traditional pirate movie, Elizabeth would doubtless have been played as a helpless, fragile damsel-in-distress. Today, feminist theory frowns upon this sort of portrayal of female characters, so Elizabeth becomes feisty and determined, but Keira is able to suggest an underlying fragility and vulnerability even when her character is at her feistiest. Geoffrey Rush was rather cast against type; I had always previously regarded him as the star of serious films like "Shine" or "Elizabeth", but here he plays Barbossa as a swaggering, semi-comic pantomime villain. Orlando Bloom has a difficult task; Will is, nominally at least, the romantic lead, but he is also rather strait-laced, and at times he seems rather dull by comparison with the film's real star character, Captain Jack.For it is undoubtedly Johnny Depp who steals the film. Depp is sometimes an eccentric actor, but he is hardly ever a dull one. (OK, he was dull in "Chocolat", but then that was a very dull film). The original intention was that Captain Jack Sparrow should be played as a straightforward swashbuckler, based upon the pirates played by the likes of Lancaster or Errol Flynn. Depp, however, subverted this intention and turned Sparrow into a sort of 17th century rock star- he claims the character was based on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones- with a slightly slurred diction and a more than slightly camp manner. To traditionalists this must have seemed like an outrageously eccentric interpretation of the role, and yet somehow it works brilliantly, contrasting nicely with the more straightforwardly masculine Will. Depp even received an Oscar nomination for "Best Actor", a remarkable achievement for an action-adventure summer blockbuster. He, more than anyone else, is responsible for lifting "Curse of the Black Pearl" well above the normal standard of such blockbusters. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is a hugely entertaining, comedy-cum-action-cum-horror romp, with Johnny Depp, arguably the finest Hollywood actor of his generation, running riot as Captain Jack Sparrow, reportedly modelled on Keith Richards. In terms of how the film is constructed, the nature of his role is interesting, as there's an almost conventional story without him: a romantic lead, a beautiful, feisty heroine, a love rival and an evil villain account for most of the plot without Sparrow even getting a mention. Sparrow is more like an annoying child than anything, cropping up and getting in the way, pursuing his own ambitions and desires with childish abandon. As is often said, he really is the "world's worst pirate", scarcely meriting being taken seriously; but instead of just being a comic extra, he's actually the film's central character. It's hard to imagine the story working without Depp in the role, but fortunately, it doesn't have to. Sit back and smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie based on a attraction ride, this is pretty good. But I still found it a bit overrated because of the big praise it got when it first came out. This movie is something kids and adults can enjoy, but it doesn't excel to something more than that. The trailer for this movie was more better than the movie itself, but for going in a direction where it's watchable for the whole family. It's done pretty well for the most part, although it comes off a bit silly at times because of it and not really in a positive way either. I personally didn't really like the humor in this although some of the audience might like it. Johnny Depp has created a iconic character because of this movie, and he liked this character a lot himself. Jack Sparrow is a fun and interesting character to watch on screen and is the character that stood out the most. The other cast members did really well with their roles especially Geoffrey Rush who plays Captain Barbossa. The movie was fun a ride, however it got pretty old after it got shown in school way too many times. Overall it's a good movie that the whole family can enjoy, but it's still a bit of a overrated movie.7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems only fitting that the film that started the billion-dollar franchise is also one of the best films that Disney Pictures has ever released, and also one of the best adventure flicks ever made. "Pirates of the Caribbean" has a little in it for everybody, great action sequences, sharp, hilarious comedy, stellar characters, a great story, and of course, Jack Sparrow, who's impossible to not adore.The film tells the story of Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who teams up with a blacksmith Will Turner as they attempt to rescue Elizabeth Swann, Will's love interest, who has been captured by a cursed crew of a pirate ship called the Black Pearl, captained by the evil Barbossa. However, Jack has ulterior motives in their mission, and from there the film takes off on one of the most exciting and enjoyable action romp of the decade.The characters are all brilliantly fleshed out and interesting, and sympathetic, but the character who steals the show is Captain Jack. Johnny Depp gives the performance of a lifetime with Jack, masterfully crafting a character who is incredibly sly, charismatic, funny, and yet constantly gets himself into stupid situations. Never has a character like this been committed to film, and it's immortalized through Depp. He absolutely makes this film leap from good to great.The film's special effects, while somewhat dated by today's (and the sequel films) standards, still maintain a sense of charm to them and the stunt sequences are all fabulous. The action is intense and entertaining, keeping you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The swashbuckling never gets old, and the film is always great fun.Thanks to this film, the pirate genre was redefined from silly and hokey, to what "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" gives audiences: a strong story intertwined with intense action and humor. It's one of my personal favorite films, and definitely one of the best films to bear the Disney name. It's great, and I absolutely recommend anybody who wants to enjoy themselves with a movie to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl When the first Pirates of the Caribbean film came out in 2003, expectations were low. Recent swashbuckling fare in the cinemas had been disappointing to say the least (Cutthroat Island anyone?) and this new Disney adventure was based on a theme park ride! Early production news was generally greeted with trepidation, rather than anticipation - which made Pirates of the Caribbean such a wonderful surprise. 2 hours of rollicking adventure that harks back to the glory days of Errol Flynn and the like, and more recently films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Such was the impact of Pirates of the Caribbean that it not only spawned a trilogy (with a fourth in the works) but completely refreshed and re-launched the family adventure, leading to enjoyable imitations such as National Treasure ? and even providing the impetus for Spielberg to finally get round to making the fourth Indiana Jones movie. Even Johnny Depp can be grateful for this juggernaut of a franchise; his outstanding show-stealing performance reinvigorated his career and thrust him into the mainstream of Hollywood, as well as landing him a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination.The plot (such as it is), opens with a suitably creepy nautical fog scene ? which proves somewhat deliberately disingenuous for what is to come. After a misleading tone is set, a plot develops which revolves around a band of bloodthirsty pirates searching for some treasure or other in order to free themselves from a curse, with our swashbuckling heroes in valiant pursuit, trying to save the captured damsel in distress. So far, so predictable. But what makes Pirates work is that it knows how corny it is, and rather than trying to disguise it, director Verbinski and producer Bruckheimer (who has his explosive and exaggerated fingerprints all over this yarn), turn the corny all the way up to 11. What follows is a true piece of enjoyable escapist cinema. It may not be highbrow, but it sure is entertaining, and Johnny Depp is truly a revelation as Captain Jack Sparrow. For all his previously eccentric parts in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and the like, this is the role which will forever define him ? and Depp is fine with that! The treasure is little more than a macguffin, and it is the characters ? particularly Depp's Sparrow ? not the plot, which provide the basis of what is a very entertaining film.Yet while Depp does steal the show, it is not solely his film. Orlando Bloom does (barely) manage to expand his emotional range from that seen in Lord of the Rings, and Keira Knightley manages to display for the first time the contradictory qualities of feisty modern heroine and elegant damsel in distress that gave her success in Pride and Prejudice and The Duchess. Geoffrey Rush however, is the equal to Depp in scene-stealing stakes, and provides a fascinating villain to the piece.All the ingredients for a fully enjoyable epic adventure are here. Exotic locations? Check. Stellar (largely British) supporting cast? Check. Swordfights and chase scenes? Check. A scene-stealing heroic lead who dishes out one-liners galore? Check. Finally, an enjoyably hokum plot with some macguffin or other at its centre? Double check. All of these elements combine wonderfully to make Pirates of the Caribbean greater than the sum of its not-inconsiderable parts.</fullReview>

The plot was not predicting as I would have thought, so I enjoyed it very much. It is generally not good for younger children for some violence but my 8 year old brother was thrilled with it. Of course he loves Star Wars. I was glad to see that there were movies that came out later and have been very happy with all of them. I hope that the next one coming out will be as great. The Black Pearl definitely earned its way to a family fave. I definitely recommend to any family with older children. The movie gave a happy feeling throughout the house. It is just a perfect little thing. I can't seem to find a fault in the movie. It was excellent and well put together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie lifted to greatness by Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem a given that an action/adventure film based on a theme ride at Disneyland would be an underwhelming disaster. However, one would be refreshingly incorrect on that score - at least as far as this film goes. An incredibly imaginative and rousing swashbuckler directed with technical finesse by Gore Verbinski and sporting a solid screenplay. The film would have been good fun on its own merits, but it has been gifted with a tremendous lead performance by Johnny Depp as the riotous Captain Jack Sparrow - a lucky pirate rogue who manages to succeed in spite of himself. The visual effects are dazzling and the film has a spirited supporting cast. Geoffrey Rush is an intimidating villain as the cursed Captain Barbossa. Keira Knightley is enchanting as the gutsy governor's daughter and secret pirate groupie accidentally caught up in the adventure. Orlando Bloom brings much of the grave beauty of a young Douglas Fairbanks to his role as the more traditional hero and provides the film much of its heart. Yet the real reason to be amazed is Depp's incredible work. Any actor can take a great role and be good in it, but only a great actor can take an iffy role and turn it into a scene-stealing delight the way that Depp does here. This is the mark of a great actor and he should have walked off with the Oscar were Oscar voters not so overly entranced with Sean Penn's tiresome Method acting from Mystic River. If the film has any weakness, it is that it sports at least one ending too many and the pacing starts to flag slightly before the credits roll, but these seem trivial compared to the achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful thrill ride through the times of the swashbuckler. Johnny Depp is marvellous as the scheming captain Jack Sparrow. His use of incoherent attitudes and forte's of paragraphs of confusion, really gave the audience a good dose of how a pirate is supposed to be. A person of the sea, no quarrels with another except if a foe cheats lies or steals, but that's a pirate for you. This film was a grand scope of true adventure, to be at sea and fighting off cut throats at every corner of the ocean. Geoffry Rush was magnificent as the double crossing Captain Barbosa. And in the middle is William Turner (orlando Bloom) a man who is love with the lovely Miss Swan (Keira Knightly). Both together are and unstoppable force for good in the face of betrayal and uncompromising dastardly deeds between heathen swine and gobs who lose their eye. This movie has every element of action, locations, humour, great sword fights, and above all true Pirates Of the Caribbean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Pirates of The Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl", 2003 Directed by: Gore Verbinski* * *Viewed: September 30, 2010The first chapter of what was to be a successful trilogy, is an entertaining, big scale adventure film, loaded with action and visual effects. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, gives an impressive performance in the film, complete with accent, energy and mannerisms.The film, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, is longer than usual, for it's genre of action/adventure. The film moves along at an energetic pace, and considering the scale of it's story, does not feel overly long.The story concerns pirate Captain Jack Sparrow's return from exile and meeting up by chance, with the owner of a fabled pirate medallion, believed to have the power to help lift an old deadly "curse of the black pearl".Technically, the film delivers, along with Johnny Depp's acting performance. One should not expect much from the story however, as it was inspired by a Disney Land theme park attraction. The story is a blend of action, adventure, fantasy and humor. I imagine, humor was added to lighten up the film as a whole and provide additional entertainment value, while not frightening it's targeted young audience too much. The somewhat solid story has some convenient plot points to move things along, but there is a large cast of characters: heroes and villains, to help keep things interesting. Keep watching until the end of the closing credits, for a sneak preview of the story set up, for the next film in the trilogy.The real stars of this film: Director Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp and the technical/effects crew.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For kids, they can enjoy the pirates outfits, fight scenes, and Asian exotic settings.For adults, they can enjoy the script that talks about honor, changing world, love, destiny, meaning of life ... etc.One famous Hong Kong director (Wong Jing, whose recent hit was "I Corrupt All Cops") suggested Cptn Sao Feng's (Chow-Yun Fat) costume design is racist and his participation in it is a disgrace to his own people. I cannot disagree more.There are good guys and bad guys characters in this film - his character happens to be a bad guy, so of course his costume design got to give a "bad guy" impression to the audience. Furthermore, his role is a second or third tier of actors/actresses - he can't dress up like a prince from the east and steal the main characters' thunder. Lastly, betraying is a tradition in the pirates world, according to the storyline, thus his betrayal to his fellow pirates doesn't reflect any ethic values. Instead, it shows how the government likes to use the betray tactic to create wars among the pirates. Concerning his performance, he got better performance opportunity in this movie than "Dragon Balls: Evolution" and he did a great job. If not better than other actors'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), "Is he making this up as he goes along?" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, "The Curse of the Black Pearl," but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because "Pirates" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.That sequel, "Dead Man's Chest," takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. "Dead Man's Chest" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, "At World's End," gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The "Pirates" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival "Star Wars" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?The "Pirates" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America. Grade: "Curse of the Black Pearl": B "Dead Man's Chest": C- "At World's End": A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cutthroat Island? What's That?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget all the bad pirate movies of the past - Cutthroat Island, for instance - and indulge in the first masterpiece of the 21st century. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was based on a piddling Disney theme park ride and starred Edward Scissorhands, Legolas, David Helfgott, and that skinny girl from 'Bend it like Beckham'.But this film packs a killer punch with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the notorious rock star/pirate with a resemblance to Keith Richards and the coolest hat on celluloid. Without him, we would have an enjoyable if messy romp with non-acting Orlando Bloom, undead pirates, and a hammy Geoffrey Rush. With him, we have an adventure classic.In fact, I could find only one problem with this film. A roguish outlaw and an innocent boy team up to save a princess from an evil warlord. 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' does bear striking resemblances to 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope', but Han Solo's no Captain Jack.The film doesn't outstay its welcome. Dead Man's Chest, it's sequel, was a nice attempt and Johnny Depp does brilliantly, even without the surprise factor he's fantastic, but here's hoping At World's End returns to the original's brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is about a lone, loony pirate by the name of Jack Sparrow. He's been down on his luck, lately. He's wanted by the authorities, his hooker girlfriends want nothing more to do with him, he's been deserted on an island and suffers from sun stroke, the rum is gone, etc...just to name a few.What also is very bad is that a group of supernatural pirates are after a cursed Aztec coin to cure them of their invulnerability. It hasn't been a very good day for Jack Sparrow.What's great about this film is that it is one of those big summer action movies, plus it has a soul. It is with its characters a lot more than you would expect. The villains are, well, villainous. Their protagonists are likable and well-written. The action is entertaining and suspenseful.Gore Verbinski directs it with a big epic scope in mind, but makes it look easy. The action is superbly directed and doesn't suffer from 'style over substance'.Of course, the movie's main strength would have to be Johnny Depp. It is obvious that this is one of cinema's most memorable performances. Depp brings the perpetually intoxicated Captain Jack to life with such brilliance and comic timing, I couldn't believe that it was Depp behind the makeup.The CGI is nothing short of breathtaking. The skeleton pirates are a little cartoonish, but I still commend ILM for their wonderful effort. The score by Klaus Badelt is a bombastic and heroic one filled with big epic tunes and great themes that tie the film together.Overall, a great summer action movie that is great for both kids and adults. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are two of the main reasons to see this film. Their note-perfect and seemingly effortless portrayals of rival pirate leaders Sparrow and Barbossa fills the screen whenever they appear. Other actors are allowed their chance to shine as well, thanks to Gore Verbinski's generous direction.The action is plentiful, the laughs come like a volley of cannonballs and the special effects don't overwhelm the story. What's not to like?Well, er, Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, unfortunately. Shrewish and drippy respectively, neither of the two young leads has the screen presence to create a credible romance. Knightley gets more annoying as the movie progresses and I found myself hoping that someone would kill her character with another 45 minutes to go. Bloom is fine and athletic in the action sequences, but fails to convince as soon as he stops moving and starts to open his mouth.Fortunately, the energy, charm and quality of this movie outshine the damp squibs of Knightley's and Bloom's performances. 'Tis a fine film, to be sure, ah-har etc...</fullReview>

Nobody has thought that the movie about pirates never be boomed. But, this thoughts was stopped since 'pirates of the caribbean' filmed. From this movie, Disney people showed that they are still alive. In this movie, the most popular actor was the 'Jack Sparrow' as Johny Depp. His acting was as special as Charlie Chaplin. He looked like a punk rock star so everybody was fascinated by him. And secondly, The captain Barbosa was good. He might the poorest actor in this movie. He acted pretty well, but it was fainted by Jack's special acting. Besides, other parts was as good as acting. Music was enough to express about pirates' lives. Actually, I think the story is some childish. But many people love it because it makes people recall their old books and fables.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL ****1/2 The film is an explosion of many genres - comedy, action, adventure, horror - that does each one justice. Set decorator Larry Dias and costume designers John Bright, Liz Dann, and Penny Rose do superb work to pull off a 17th century setting where the story's players become pawns in a chess match, and combat rounds, chase sequences, and redeeming efforts set off to make an extremely likable motion picture. Equal effort was given from the director (Gore Verbinski) and the numerous screenplay-writers. Johnny Depp is incredible as Captain Jack Sparrow, a slightly "off" pirate who longs to regain control of his beloved ship that is in the hands of his former disciple (Geoffrey Rush). He sets out to sea with a young blacksmith to take back possession of the ship and to rescue the British governor's daughter, who is held captive on the ship. Only, they find that a haunting curse is bestowed upon its crew. It doesn't take much effort to find something you like within this film, may it be its thundering adventureline, appealing cast, witty dialogue, or visually rich setting. I recommend you try it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates is an instant classic and will be remembered for generations to come, assuming that the poor reputation of the sequel does not overshadow its wit and brilliance. The first story is a pop-up book adventure with cartoon-like monsters and a villain whom we all have loved to hate. The film stands on its own, and Johnny Depp brings to life the lovable pirate Jack Sparrow, who exhibits questionable loyalty and hilarious wit. I hope and pray, as a serious fan of the film, that the fine reputation of this excellent film will not be soiled by the sequel, which was apparently slopped together to entertain vid-head teenage boys. Evidently, the writers did not realize that the film's appeal was in its deep and evolving character relationships, not its special effects, and making everything bigger and more revolting was not the key factor in a successful sequel. I for one, among many I'm sure, have been harshly disappointed after three years of tense anticipation for the story of lovable Jack Sparrow and his companions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film I have ever seen, savvy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed when I first saw it, but liked it even more when I saw it for a second time. All the characters are amazing, although there some specific ones that drag your attention from the first minute they appear on-screen. I believe one of them is Jack Sparrow. He is one of the two people that make it all worth seeing the movie. He has that very different style of walking,standing, speaking, that it is almost impossible for the viewer not to be influenced from him. (Depp got his second Oscar nomination by playing Jack Sparrow in this movie). The other one memorable character is, in my opinion, Barbossa. Brilliantly played by Geoffrey Rush, he is one of the best villains that ever appeared in the silver screen. He may be blood thirsty and vile, but what he wants most is not gold and glory, like Jack, but a chance to live again. And you can easily understand that, for all he wanted through the movie was to be mortal once again, and taste that one very desired apple. And when he finally gets rid of the curse that consumed him, he is killed from Jack Sparrow, making the viewer wander whether his death was necessary, whether he actually ever was a villain. An amazing film! It IS true that it gives a more tale-ish view on pirates, with more imagination and less reality. It's not completely fictional, though, it is just a more romantic look on buccaneers. If you want to see a pirate movie with romance, action and laughter, this is the one. Pirates of the Caribbean is an one-of-a-kind PIRATE MOVIE!...and clearly a MUST!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Fun as an Amusement Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is an over-the-top romp that's just plain fun. Gee, much like an amusement park ride.Too bad the roster of good actors (including from British TV comedies "The Office" and "Coupling") were clearly directed to lay it all on broadly (except Jonathan Pryce who is very atypically laid-back and therefore wasted). Orlando Bloom doesn't get to do too much, Geoffrey Rush has a ball being a villain, while Johnny Depp steals the show with his loopy pirate captain (I like most folks comparison of him to Keith Richards). I figure the only reason he plays it sort of drunken and crazy is to not add an unintentional romantic triangle with a very contemporarily feisty Keira Knightley.For all the action, there's too many close-ups and not enough opportunity to take it all in from a broader perspective.Stay through the extensive credits (and, evidently yes, they did film some of it in the Caribbean) to see a cute plot coda.The music is so bombastic and continuous that it's not completely attributed to just Hans Zimmer but to a large team.

In fact, although the the main focus seems to be around Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters (and their romance which was not very believable), Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was the real focus and what a riot he is! The visual effects was pretty good too. Other than that though, the story itself is okay (I thought Cutthroat Island had a better story and that's saying much) and the music was average (Hans Zimmer has done better - i.e. The Lion King).

There are several well know actor, including: Jonny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, and Geofery Rush. All of whom did a superb acting job.

		<fullReview>Pirates. What were they thinking? They're making a film based on a attraction at Disney land. A film based on a roller-coaster!? Are they nuts? No, they're not. Say whatever you want about Bruckheimer but he knows what the audience wants to see. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best films so far in late years. Pirates is a perfect movie too watch on a rainy afternoon. Classical Sunday matine. Give me this film, some snacks, candy and a bottle of Cola and I'm satisfied for a couple of hours. It has humor and action, two very important thing nowadays, and it has a quite good story and fantastic characters. You just got to like Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp, being a brilliant actor, gives one of his best performances so far. I don't know how much of Captain Sparrow that comes from Johnny and how much of him that's in the script but ones thing for certain: He is one of the most lovable fictional characters in a long time.But just because Jack is the best character this movie doesn't lack good supporting characters. Elizabeth is a cool chick and I would like to see her use a sword in the next movie. Barbossa is a very good villain and the Thomson &amp; Tompson like pirate duo on Barbossa ship is a funny couple. Sadly enough Will Turner is a very lame character, but he became better in the sequels. Just don't expect to see a realistic movie about piracy. This movie is far from realistic. Like I've said before, it is a classic Sunday matinée.So, to wrap things up, what do I think about "Caribbean"? Well, it's a lovely place. It's a nice vacation for a couple of hour. It has sandy beaches, great pubs and the people are wonderful. Overall, their is only one problem with "the Caribbean". For some reason the rome is ALWAYS GONE!</fullReview>

The ride depicts pirates pillaging, drinking, eating, and having what seems to be a successful raid.In Gore Verbinski's epic tale of a cursed ship and its crew trying to find their lost treasure, johnny Depp stars as the worst pirate ever, Captain Jack Sparrow. He encounters Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) after escaping from an island prison and his love interest Elizabeth Swann (Neira Knightley). The three find themselves in quite the mess.When the Black Pearl sails into port, all hell breaks loose. Led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), these pirates will do whatever it takes to find their treasure. After taking Elizabeth away because she has the missing piece, Will and Jack must find a crew brave enough, or dumb enough to chase the Pearl.The story featuring scenes from the ride in Walt Disney World and Walt Disney Land in California, causing this film will trigger a lot of memories for fans of the ride. The film also tells a great story with action, romance, and comedy. Depp is brilliant as mumbling, sometimes heroic Jack Sparrow, getting himself nominated for an Academy Award.Another interesting aspect of the movie that is well done is the computer generated effects like when the pirates are seen in their "true form". This gives the movie an eye candy effect, bringing in more viewers.Overall, this film is spectacular. Appealing on all levels of cinema entertainment. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a movie not to be missed. In the words of Jack Sparrow, "Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate,". This one is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie only for the older individual!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a great movie as far as the action, but it did have some stuff that we could have done without. The dress code I would say would have to be one of them. I prefer women with more clothes on, a modest dress code would have made this movie a better one.It was fun seeing the funny oddball actor Johnny Depp. This was the first movie I had ever seen him in, and the first time I had ever heard of him. He was a really fun character in this one. I loved his accent!!My favorite line... "I can't breathe!" (splash!!) -Elizabeth Swan "you know he's only a blacksmith...No, he's a Pirate"Great for the older individual! wouldn't recommend the younger (age 14 and under).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie i like you know. But when i first saw it, it was complicated. It was like "what a waste of time". Too many stupid ghost-stories. You know i really think that of some movies the first time, but in the 2nd it was just "oh my god, its good". And its a movie really worth buying. I'm definitely gonna get it because Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley is awesome. Its a real adventure that takes to dead pirates and wannabe-pirates. Its like full of comic but that what makes the movie all good. Most disgusting of this movies was when one of the pirates lost the eye all the time, I really wanted them to cut out of that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It actually has a plot that leads naturally from one event to the next. The characters are portrayed superbly, there is plenty of action and adventure, and there are of course the twists of fate that make it a winner!Depp played his part to the fullest - a dirty, rotten, happy-go-lucky thieving, loving pirate. I am not usually big on Depp, but this time he did it right! The entire cast was chosen well. Nothing in the movie was so far out of reality that it makes you think, 'Yea, right. An M-16 on a pirate ship!' They didn't capture any airplanes in the sky, nor did they show a brief glimpse of the microphone dangling in front of the camera as I have seen done in other lack-luster films.It is a good story and it is fun to watch. I just know that the next Pirates movie is going to be at least as good as the first and I am waiting anxiously for its release sometime in '06. No matter which way you look at it, this movie is a winner. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and rent or buy it.Why didn't I give it a 10 rating if I enjoyed it so much? Well, nothing on earth is perfect - but this came close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean was an excellent movie for the family and especially young boys. There are hardly any movies that families can enjoy...things like Lizzy McGuire and Freaky Friday are directed toward teenage girls - Pirates of the Caribbean can be enjoyed by male or female and people of all ages. POTC has everything a good movie should have: action, fighting, pirates, unspoken love. The story was intriguing and so were the characters (Jack Sparrow in particular)... I would be interested to see if the sequel will live up to it's predecessor - most of the time sequels are rather mediocre. The cast is great. Orlando Bloom has a lot of talent and it's nice to see him making a name for himself, and it was wonderful to see Johnny Depp introduced to a new generation - he is finally getting the recognition he deserves.</fullReview>

Jerry Bruckheimer has recently put together some very well done movies. This one and Natational Treasure and King Arthur. He also did Pearl Harbor. Kiera did a nice job, she a great English accent. Johnny Depp job was really good. I can not wait until the next part of the trilogy comes out.it has a well drawn-ed together cast and crew. The story line is a match to the wonderful ride, and the movie part those mechanical characters in the ride to life. And I hope the next one is as big of a hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to reiterate all the other comments here, but I have to say one thing for Disney enthusiasts. If you are still thinking there is no way that they could make this movie-connect it with the amusement park attraction, and have it be compelling, you are absolutely wrong and are missing a real joy. Some other comments here have touched on some of the connections but they have by no means done justice. If you are a real fan of the amusement park attraction and have paid close attention you will not only recognize scenes but will be amazed by the incredibly similarities of makeup and dialog.To think that someone was able to write a screenplay that accomplished this and the director was able to reproduce these few seconds so well and still make a compelling movie is amazing to me.If you are a Disney nut and haven't seen this film do it today!!!!!</fullReview>

As I stretched my eyes to see if possibly someone with my last name added to the production of The Black Pearl, I embraced all those that were responsible for it. Truly a classic film that has it all adventure, drama, a sense of dignity that caresses the audience with an appeal towards the characters and story-line, and of course love, love of life and freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would have thought? It's actually good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You wouldn't have thought a movie based on a ride would be any good. In fact, most rational people would think it was dreadful; a horribly cynical marketing exercise. Imagine my surprise, then, at Pirates of the Caribbean. While it would be perhaps exaggerating to say it is a cinematic masterpiece and one of the great movies of our time, it is a solidly entertaining film and wins brownie points on a number of levels. Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow (the Captain bit is very important to him), a pirate who has no ship. When he comes to Port Royal, the happy-go-lucky Sparrow is caught by the marines and sentenced to hang, but he escapes when the dreaded Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew of evil scum of the earth (scum of the sea?), attack the port and kidnap Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), the daughter of the Governor (Jonathan Pryce). Why do they kidnap her? Because she has the last piece of a cursed treasure they plundered years ago, the return of which coupled with their blood will lift the curse upon them, the curse that has turned them into walking corpses. Of course, to say more gives away the plot twists, of which there are several. As a viewer, I spent most of the time trying to figure out if Sparrow is good or bad. Whose side is this guy on? Depp&amp;#8217;s performance is a very curious one. He speaks in no particular accent, seemingly Irish, Australian and cockney all in one, and he leaps about the screen, smiling an odd grin and making witty repartee with the others. Depp apparently copied much of his performance from Keith Richards - now that I know that I can see the resemblance (perhaps Depp has a future as a mimic?). He is a pirate, no doubt about it, in that he can never be trusted too far; but how far, of course, is one of the points of the film. The rest of the cast are good too. Orlando Bloom plays the blacksmith unwittingly caught up in Sparrow's wake, mostly to save Elizabeth from the pirates, and does a nice job of the 'young man at sea' routine. Rush, one of my favourite Australian actors, is well cast as the villainous, cursed Barbossa (his eyes and voice always make him seem like a bad guy) and Knightly is sufficient in the role of the damsel in distress, although she comes into her own several times in the film, which is good to see. Unusually for a film like this, the plot and script are actually pretty good. The twists keep coming, the story makes sense, and there's plenty for the characters to do. There are also some very good action sequences, including the Governor's battle with a severed hand (you have to see it) and the final fight between Sparrow and Barbossa. Pirates of the Caribbean is not a movie you go and see if you're into thought-provoking, meaningful and uplifting film-making. Fortunately, I'm not. I like to be entertained, and Pirates entertains nicely. It's funny, dramatic, suspenseful; what more can you ask from a film? Well, actually you can ask for a lot more, but Pirates isn't that kind of film. As it is, it earns points in all categories, and while it's not a master stroke by director Gore Verbinski, it is a solidly entertaining movie, with a yo heave ho and even, at one point, a bottle of rum. Arrrrr. And so on and so forth. Good-o-meter rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Johnny Depp movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really belongs to Johnny Depp. I wonder what'd have this movie done without him. I began to watch "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" without any idea of who Johnny Depp was and what this movie was about. By the end of it, I was wondering, "Who is this stunning actor acting Jack Sparrow?" I have watched some movies of Johnny Depp without being impressed by him, hence, without concerning about even his name. But this movie was elevated by none other's but Johnny Depp's acting. A movie is never complete without the team-work but someone has to be outstanding.Story, as it is obvious, is entire fiction but cleverly written and well handled. Action sequences are simple (compared to lots of other action flicks), but according to the story line, hence impressive. Special effects are stunning. All actors contributed in an impressive way. No one tried to be unreasonably clever (this is a common problem that I have noticed in Hollywood movies as non-English viewer.) It is not "just-another-pirates-movie". It is a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a very fun movie. It is like a ride grabbing you at the beginning, and not letting go until the very end. It stars Johnny Depp, who did an excellent job in the gangster film Donnie Brasco. Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is played by Keira Knightley. The director Gore Verbinski does a great job and the special effects are to notch. A second installment is already in the works, as this film was a success at the box office.Pirates of the Caribbean is a sweeping action-adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas. This roller coaster tale teams a young man, Will Turner, with an unlikely ally in rogue pirate Jack Sparrow. Together, they must battle a band of the world's most treacherous pirates, led by the cursed Captain Barbossa, in order to save Elizabeth, the love of Will's life.The real magic in the movie lies in the characters mainly Jack Sparrow. If you like action/adventure films this is a good choice to spend a Friday night with a few friends. You may even find yourself looking forward to the second one like I am.</fullReview>

They eventually settled there differences and travel to isla DE meurta to find Barbossa and his crew as they have held elizabeth captive to end there curse. but boy did they make a big mistake, they needed the blood of will turner the son of boostrap bill. 10 years ago barbossa and his crew left jack on an island and stole his ship, and he wants it back. It's a fun packed action film that will make everyone laugh, starring johnny depp, geoffrey rush, orlando bloom, and keira knightly. If they put as much effort into the second movie as they did with the first movie, i'm certain it will be a hit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie and immediately thought it to be one of the greatest movies of all time. It's funny, contains great action scenes and all the acting is outstanding. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey are all superb. Pirates of the Caribbean contains great camera angles. Johnny deep fits the roll of "Jack Sparrow", a clumsy and often referred to as the worst pirate alive, perfectly. Geoffry Rush is the perfect bad guy and Orlando Bloom can add "Will Turner" to his list of interesting and well played characters. The best scenes in the movie would be: 1) When Jack is talking to the English guards about him sneaking aboard the ship in an attempt to steal it and 2) Where the pirates invade Elizabeth's town and take her to the ship The movie is well directed and the music is great. There is never a dull moment and as I said before the camera angles are great. Pirates of the Caribbean should be enjoyed by viewers of most ages and will definitely be enjoyed by any fans of Fantasy, Action or Comedy movies!!!Overall - 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the greatest blockbuster epic ever made! It is right on the same level as the Star Wars Trilogy, Indiana Jones Chronicles, and the Spider-Man Movies. The movie follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith. The Black Pearl, which is a haunted ship with a cursed crew, kidnapped the beautiful Ms. Swann (Keira Knightley) in order to undo the curse that was bestowed upon them by Cortes's gold. The reason was she was the holder of a gold coin that they stole, and they needed that coin to undo the curse. Sparrow and Turner are trying to track down and recapture the Black Pearl and Elizabeth Swann. It is a well paced story that must be watched closely for their are many new details revealed along the way of the quest.The set design is impeccable, and possibly the best addition to the film was Depp's incredible performance. He was flawless as Sparrow with great comical timing that made him really stand out in the dry acting submitted by all the other actors. He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination and probably should have won (i haven't seen mystic river).The only flaws were the skeleton pirates were a little lame and Orlando Bloom is possibly the worst actor ever, but he didn't ruin the film because we had Depp to look and marvel at so you forget about Bloom. Overall, this film is one of the greatest summer releases ever made and should go down as a great film in the eyes of critics and audiences. I can't wait for the sequels which will hopefully be as strong as the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Spider-Man sequels were.8/10</fullReview>

Johnny Depp totally steals the film as Captain Jack Sparrow and this role has truly cemented him as one of my 4 favourite living actors. (the other 3 being Keannu Reeves, Nicolas Cage and Clint Eastwood). There isn't a weak character or a poorly played part in the film. The bit where Jack Sparrow is running and being shot at and is trying to bat the bullets out the way with the palm of his hand makes me cry with laughter every time i watch it. Geoffrey Rush is deeply inspired as Barbossa and Kiera Knightley is one of the brightest English roses around.

		<fullReview>It is usually difficult for a film to successfully combine different types of genre and remain enjoyable and easy to follow. I expect it is even harder to do this when the film is developed for children's viewing. However, with this film that combination was, in my opinion, a success. Pirates of the Caribbean emerged as an excellent blend of romance, mild horror, action and adventure. Also, the comedy - provided by the wonderful Johnny Depp - makes it irresistible to watch at least once. The actors themselves give an outstanding performance, though none so outstanding as Depp himself. He plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate with only one thing on his mind. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is in love with the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightly). During their high seas adventure, we, the audience, get a chance to admire the superb special effects which help the entire movie hit us with such an impact that we will remember it for decades to come. I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

It is in this spirit of fun that I base my high esteem for this excellent, entertaining movie and consider it one of my favorites that I will watch over and over. It is funny, exciting, ahem, er.... sexy, and adventurous escapist fun! It is not meant to be authentic or seriously considered (against the likes of Master and Commander). Rather, it is grand art of a different sort. The key element in this film that made it superior to other pirate fantasy films is the casting. I thought both Johnny Depp and Geoffery Rush were magnificent! It is their endlessly entertaining, outstanding performances that made Pirates of the Caribbean into an instant classic that is very repeatedly viewable. Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Jonathan Pryce and all the rest of the cast were all great also. When I was 8 my father took me to Disneyland for the first time. Although I was apprehensive at first (seeing the talking skull and dropping down through darkness into the caverns in a boat), I ended up loving the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and wanted to ride it again and again! This movie perfectly evoked that same feeling and reaction... creepy apprehension turning into fun adventure and humor... jolly family fun. The various references to the Disneyland ride in the movie just thrilled me. I wholeheartedly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, but with a distinctly modern lack of clarity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean" is fun, but it is Johnny Depp's great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow that holds the thing together, not any skill in storytelling on the part of the filmmakers. You have to see this thing twice to understand the convoluted plot and a good four or five times to even catch on to many of the poorly presented running gags (how long did it take you to get the "wooden" eyeball gag? Be honest?). I'd bet my life savings that not a single person who saw this movie "cold" (without reading a plot summary first) understood what the f was going on until they'd discussed it with someone or seen it again. The screenplay is partly to blame, continually doling out necessary information well after we would have really cared (Oh, THAT'S why they kidnapped Keira Knightly--wish I'd known that half an hour ago). But even though the story is convoluted in a way that only contemporary movies seem to manage, the problems aren't necessarily with the script. This same screenplay could have been filmed and all the story points and gags could have been made crystal clear without changing a word. The main problem here is that we have yet another TV commercial/music video director who has been given the reins of a huge-budget flick without ever having proved he/she can actually tell a story. The director here does put some great images up on the screen, and a few very good bits of business make it as well. But fun performances, great set design, great sfx, make up, etc don't add up to a great movie if the story is incomprehensible. And it's not just the story as a whole I'm talking about, it's tiny bits of storytelling that fail, like the previously mentioned wooden eyeball joke. This director does not know how to visually emphasize the proper elements to tell a visual story. All he is capable of is making it all look either pretty, or loud (or both). And I'll give this to the director--he does get the look of a pirate movie right. SO, annoying as the directorial shortcoming are, the film still ends up being fun. But it could have been SO much better in the hands of a director more experienced in storytelling.</fullReview>

Set right out the attraction at Walt Disney World, this movie has the "feel" of the ride done to a tee. The sets are wonderfully brought to life and if you look carefully, you will see several aspects of the ride in the movie, most notably the scene where the dog has the key to jail cell and the prisoners just can't get the dog to bring them the key. Best quote in the movie - "Jack Sparrow, you are the worst pirate I've ever heard of." "Ah, but you have heard of me." Makes the movie, shows what kind of character Jack Sparrow is and what kind of actor Johnny Depp is to pull it off. Go rent it, go buy it. Just go see it.</fullReview>

Being a Disney movie, I had low expectations. This movie was surprisingly good. Sadly, not all the acting was noteworthy. Johnny Depp carried this movie, but he had help from Geoffrey Rush. Orlando Bloom was dull and Keira Knightley was only there to look at.Graphics - I was not disappointed in any of the scenes. I was quite impressed with the cursed crew jumping in and out of darkness in the final fight scene.The movie seemed like it was only an hour and a half long when it was actually over 2 hours. This is the first Gore Verbinski movie I have seen, and I was quite impressed. This had the potential to be a terrible flop, but between Verbinski and Depp, it came out to be a superb movie for the time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is the best pirate film ever, at the moment anyway.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has to be one of the best Pirate films of al time, it has comedy, good action, brilliant stars, and sexy actresses (keira knightley) i love this film because it is such a side breaker, it had me in stitches so many times, an all time classic, i don't really want to see the sequel though because i am afraid that it will be rubbish and will spoil the first one, i am going to see it anyway just to see how it goes but i have confidence that Johnny and Orlando will bring yet another great swashbuckling movie to our screens. I regard Johnny as a hilarious joker who has obviously had one to many drinks down the pub!, nevertheless he is great in this film and a great actor altogether. I also liked Orlando Blooms performance, he is one of my favourite actors and is great with a gun or sword, i mad a reference to a gun because of Ned Kelly another one of his classics, one i must publish a review on, i am new around here so i am a bit rusty about it all bit i am sure i will fit in fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome, fabulous movie..**Contains spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Disney's best. Based on the ride (although not a whole lot of reference..I went on the ride after having seen the movie) the viewers are in for movie ride of a lifetime. Full of excitement, surprise, and wonderful special effects, with an intriguing storyline behind it, well it's worth it's weight in gold. Johnny Depp as Cpt. Jack Sparrow was wonderfully casted. No one else could have done as spectacular as a job as him, with his quirks and oddities. He was "gyped" so to speak out of a well deserved Oscar in this one. As a woman, he somehow managed to be so attractive in this, despite his black and gold teeth, dirty hair and fingernails and constant inebriation. He has said he "modeled" the character after long time British rock star, Keith Richards and he had it right on the nose! No matter how hard you try, you can not dislike him in this movie..right down to his "eunich" comment to Orlando's character "Will" while fighting in the shop. The movie has a few twists and can be a little confusing (how is it that "Will" survived without becoming one of the living dead, when he was wearing the stolen medallion??) but if you watch it more than once or carefully, its there for the viewer to figure out (spells prequel). Geoffrey Rush is perfect as the villain, a shame he won't be in the "sequel". Ms. Knightley, a spunky, beautiful newcomer, perfectly casted as the damsel in distress. This is a must see. The song "Drink up me 'earties yo ho" worth it, Cpt Jack capturing his horizon, the skeletons in the moonlight..very Disney, but very worth it. The reason I gave it a 10/10, I can't think of any way to improve it. And it's one movie I am eagerly awaiting the sequel to. Hopefully, Johnny Depp will take home the Oscar for the next one, because he deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is the best film ever, and I don't care what anyone else thinks! I've seen it at least 25 times, and never get bored of it.My favourite part is when Jack Sparrow grabs Elizabeth Swann and says, "Gentlemen, m'lady, you will all remember this as the day that you almost caught captain Jack Sparrow!" He is a great actor and plays his part very, very well. He's so funny to watch, and Orlando is a good actor too, and Keira Knightley. Anyone who hasn't seen this film must be mad, as everyone should see the greatest film of all time!!!!!Oh, and I voted: 10 p.s Orlando Bloom is fit! Don't forget to watch Calcium Kid too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nauseating CGI Adventure Starring Female Teen Idol Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the high level of bad acting and slapstick antics involved, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is essentially Caddyshack with swords. Or Police Academy, without guns. Actually, the comedy is so bad; it's more like Caddyshack 2, or Police Academy 5. Whatever it is, it's at least 30 minutes too long, and that, along with next to no character development and a video game plot, forces me to point my thumbs down toward the ground, even though I wish they could be pointing up toward the sky, like all the shimmering swords in the film. At least the theme park attraction knew when it was time to wrap it all up.Can Disney stop making movies based on Theme Park rides?</fullReview>

Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom pair up in this swashbuckling adventure that will have you laughing on the edge of your seat the entire time. Never without a witty comment, Depp plays the part of Captain Jack Sparrow absolutely perfectly. Bloom, slightly over-dramatic the entire time, makes you laugh almost more than Depp! This is my all-time favorite movie (I saw it 5 times in theaters and over 20 times at home!) and I don't know a single person who dislikes it! "A wedding- I love weddings!

		<fullReview>At the first time, I wanted to see this movie because of the actors, Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. But, it was a funny and very adventure movie. I like the setting, so classic. And Johnny Depp, of course, he was very funny even if he didn't look too handsome on that movie. The creature was good, spooky but made me laugh. Esp. the visual effect when they turned from human to skull. And Kiera Knightly made me jealous when she kissed Orlando Bloom. Every girl wants it, no doubt. O yeah, Johnny Depp won for best actor on Mtv Movie Award. It's proper for him. I'm very want to find out what will happen on the next sequel. I hope it will be more fantastic. Great job for all of the casts and crews,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was amazing. whether ur a fan of action, adventure, romance, or thriller, this movie was right for you. i thought everyone did good in the movie and I'm glad they're bringing another pirates of the Caribbean in 2006. the movie starred johnny depp, Orlando bloom, Geoffrey rush, and keira knightley. i guarantee that you wont be disappointed if you watch pirates of the Caribbean. the movie has an excellent soundtrack, great sword fighting scenes, and if you purchase the DVD, tons of great features. even though its a Disney movie, it is for adults as well as teenagers. i thought it would be for kids since it was by Disney, but the movie was more for teenagers and adults. all in all i think that the movie of the year 2003, was Pirates of the Caribbean. I really recommend getting the DVD or if not at least watching the movie!overall pirates of the Caribbean was an A+...5 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"But where's the rum gone!"All Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, who's Erroll Flynn meets Keith Richards) wants is to drink rum, swagger and regain control of the beloved ship he was cast from, The Black Pearl. Its convenient that he stumbles across Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who both may be exploited to get the Pearl back, and has a mission of his own, rescuing the princess, which Depp can go along with...Rousing, hearty, swashbuckling good entertainment. If Hollywood blockbusters were always this much fun (and always had Johnny Depp to bolster them and make them tongue-in-cheek), then i'd say more power to them. Its travesties like Pearl Harbour that insult the public's sense of taste.If you can overlook the lack of effort and skills from Orlando Bloom (doing his best Matthew Broderick impersonation - which is easy, just make your face as blank as possible)8/10. Its a masterpiece of the order of Back to the Future and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It lost big points from me because i found Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann to be corny and cliche, and am still amazed that people consider what Orlando Bloom does "acting." Plus, and maybe this is my fault, but i saw it three times within the space of a month, and by the third time its appeal was waning. It seems that unlike something like Mr Bean, or something as visually beautiful as Lawrence of Arabia, it doesn't have unlimited replayability. That probably means that its not to deep. Which it isn't - its very surface entertainment - which means you can only reap so much value from it."And really bad eggs... Drink up me 'earties, yo ho!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl, directed by Gore Verbinksi (The Ring, and more importantly creator of the Budweiser Frogs) and starring Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands) Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings) Keira Knightly (Love Actually) and as the bad guy Geoffrey Rush (House on Haunted Hill) put this together with a superb cast of extras and back of actors and you have a great cast. That's exactly what Verbinski was able to do for this movie.It all starts with the Governors daughter Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) as a young girl and her meeting with Will Turner (Bloom) although I thought this was a clever idea at first it did seem a little cheesy but mainly for one reason. A certain Mr Gibbs (Kevin McNally) is on the ship and shares his thoughts on Pirates, well they're not the thoughts of love let me tell you, but yet later in the movie he has become one?!?! Maybe I missed something along the lines but I don't think the drink alone will have destroyed his naval career and led him to a life that he so hated. Anyways I digress?. This is the point in which Miss Swan sees the feared and fabled ship the Black Pearl, now personally after seeing the wreckage that she saw I'd probably try to stay away from pirates but not our miss Swan, in-fact she's probably more suited to being one herself than being just the Governors daughter. Soon enter Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) and his rum induced drunken state that seems to last the whole 137 minutes that this movie lasts (not that I blame him, so long working alongside Mr Bloom and I'd probably be drinking too) Sparrow is probably one of the best thought out and acted characters I've seen in a long time really, too often you see wooden performances because actors just turn up and read the script to the camera, Johnny Depp has gone into a lot of effort to make what he thinks and what is a believable character (hence the Oscar nomination) his great escapes from Captian Norrington are although not breathtaking are cleverly thought out.But what is a good pirate movie without a great villain? And that's exactly what Captain Barbossa (Rush) and his crew (including the Office star Mackenzie Crook) bring to the screen. This cursed band of pirates have only one thing to look for and that's the piece of amazon gold that currently resides around the neck of Elizabeth (remember the first part with Turner? Well he was wearing this gold around his neck and the lovely Miss Swan took it from him, yes that's right politicians and their families are just plain thieves) so when Elizabeth hides her last name fearing that they're just after the Governors daughter she chooses the wrong one in Turner. So the ride begins and the story is told of Will's father being a pirate on the Black Pearl who like the rest of the crew was cursed, the curse? Well whenever the moon hits them there true selves are brought to the surface. Great CGI is used for these exceptional looking crewmen which just adds to whole experience of the movie based on the Walt Disney ride, but in the whole was it worth the price of admission? Well if I'd paid when I saw it at the cinema?.yes it would have been fortunately for me I was working there at the time so I got to see Pirates not only for free but about three days before the general release. Overall I'd give this movie 9/10 just lacking in that one aspect about Mr Gibbs I'm afraid Gore, otherwise fantastic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific movie made more terrific by Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie has an actor whose performance really stands out, especially in some mindless action pic, it's tempting to just give him all the credit for the movie, but I was surprised to find that there is a lot more to recommend the movie than just Depp's fascinating performance. The movie as a whole is quite amusing, the action is well handled, especially the highly entertaining sword duel between Depp and Bloom and it's really pretty imaginative for something that was created just to capitalize on the success of an amusement park ride.A movie like this is clearly designed to have a great, flashy performance. Depp was hired for that role and did it beautifully, but if not Depp, the producers would have undoubtedly gone for another actor who could give an over-the-top comic performance. You could actually have a pretty good movie if you replaced Depp with someone more generic, but the movie couldn't really work without a big performance here.The producers were very fortunate to get Depp, who is a wonderful and inventive actor. His gives Jack Sparrow a loose-limbed charm that makes you suspect he's always slightly drunk, but while a quirky pirate he still gives you that Errol-Flynn sort of swashbuckle. I wouldn't want to in any way diminish his credit, but I just wanted to point out that the movie is consistently well-acted and stylish in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FANTASTIC!!! 9 out of 10 at least. A great combination of action, adventure, comedy, mystery and a touch of romance. All in real Disney style. Anyone who has been on the "Pirates of the Caribbean" Disney ride will notice a few odd jokes that others don't see, so you'll get a few extra laughs. Johnny Depp is hilarious, the special effects are ground breaking and edge of the art, the fight sequences are fantastic, the music is addictive, and this whole film is a feature you'll want to watch again and again. This is a film that almost anyone can enjoy but I would particularly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Johnny Depp (from hell, sleepy hollow, secret window) or the producer Jerry Bruckheimer (bad boys II, top gun, armageddon, pearl harbor). If you enjoy this film then look out for its sequel due out in 2006.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARLRated: PG-13 for Action Adventure ViolenceGenre: Action/Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy/ThrillerStarring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush and Keira KnightleyStar Rating: ***** out of 5At first when I was looking at lots of previews for Pirates of the Caribbean, I thought it wasn't going to be that good but then when I heard lots of excellent comments on the movie, I decided to change my mind and watch the movie. Also after the movie had it's first weekend in the movie theaters, I was reading the entertainment section in the newspaper and saw that Disney announced that they were going to make a sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean and I thought that was fast especially since it made $46,630,690 million dollars on it's opening weekend! The movie is based on a theme park ride at Disneyland or Disney World. I think because I don't know which one. Pirates of the Caribbean is a sweeping action-adventure story set in an era when villainous pirates scavenged the Caribbean seas. There is a curse on this gold medallion for whenever it shines that is when Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his ghostly crew awake! When the Governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is captured by these ghostly buccaneers, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) teams up with an rogue pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to fight these ghostly pirates!SPOILER WARNING: Will and Jack attempt to recapture The Black Pearl ship, save the British navy, and relinquish a fortune in forbidden treasure thereby lifting the curse of the Pirates of the Caribbean.I really liked how this movie had lots of action and funny parts! I thought Johnny Depp did a really good job has a pirate and plus he was also really funny! Orlando Bloom did a good job too! I also thought the beautiful Keira Knightley did a great job also! I think Keira Knightley is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen especially with her looks and her sexy English accent!BOTTOM LINE: GREAT MOVIE WITH ACTION, ADVENTURE, THRILLS AND HUMOR!</fullReview>

Why oh why, though is this movie rated pg-13? Seems to me it should be pg easily. I mean pg means parental guidance and I do believe many eight year olds would love it. Just seems the ratings board has forgotten that movies like Jaws and all the earlier James Bond movies were rated pg. I just think they under use that rating to a ridiculous extreme these days. I also thought Spider-man should have been pg. Well enough of that, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable for the whole family with action comedy and all that good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From its very first opening scene, to the last.....Pirates of the Carribean gives a swashbuckling sensation of greatness to the movies of today. It matches the Lord of the Rings trilogy in greatness, and makes you laugh every few seconds. Johnny Depp sashays into the scenes with a convincingly piraty manner, a rum soaked pirate with no home to go to. His witty lines, funny nature and great acting abilitys are amazing, he is convincingly the one and only "Captain Jack Sparrow." He leaves most of the handsome heroics, dueling and all of the loving to Orlando Bloom, a major hottie, who seems to be made for acting out extremly handsome young men with a slightly Pirate nature about them in love with gorgeous woman such as Kiera Knightly, who plays Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful young governers daughter, is a great actress, and manages to look amazing in every picture ever taken of her. Geoffery Rush draws back his eyeballs and speaks in a convincingly evil tone, and when you see his equally evil crew you think "how much makeup did these guys need to make them looking that....ugly?" It was..in fact, two hours work every day....at least, for Jack Danport who plays a great role as Pinnel the bloodthirsty pirate. Ok, lets review.....we have Johnny-the great and unique actor with a great sense of humor, Orlando-the handsome great guy who loves to act, Kiera-a new girl in the world of film who manages to stand out from everyone else, Geoffery-a well known and great actor....plus so many many many many many many many many more!!!!!!! Including lots of people from St. Vincent, the harbor in the Carribean where most of the movie was filmed, and the Lady Washington who plays the "Interceptor." all in all...this is the best movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" is certainly better than the last Disney movie based on a theme park attraction ("The Country Bears") and one of Jerry Bruckheimer's more endurable productions - but it never really catches fire, much as director Gore Verbinski's "MouseHunt" and "The Mexican" ultimately didn't cut it either. Although the movie doesn't even wait for the Walt Disney Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films logos in its rush to get started (they're relegated to the very end of the movie), there's not much real excitement to be had.Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush make it worthwhile as rival pirates Sparrow and Barbossa; both put so much relish in the licences to ham it up that are their roles that they fully deserve their billing and more - Depp in particular is a blast from the time we see him arrive at port on a sinking boat, and is fully in the spirit, giving the movie an energy it could use more of. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley ensure that both sexes have somebody to lust after during the two and a half hours (and both do okay in the performances, with Keira's character at least not a wimp), and the movie's certainly never dull - and unlike some other Bruckheimer efforts, never deafening - but somehow despite such a scope it doesn't take off.I blame those scurvy knaves Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, who have a knack for writing movies that promise a lot and never truly deliver (admittedly they worked on "The Mask Of Zorro" and "Aladdin," but they also have "Small Soldiers," "The Road to El Dorado" and the 1998 "Godzilla" on their resume); "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" throws in ghosts, battles on the high seas, narrow escapes and swordfights, but because the movie keeps veering between an all-out adventure and... let's face it... panto, it never settles down; when you see a ship crewed by skeletons and the first thing that comes to mind is Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video, it's hard not to think you're taking the movie even less seriously than the makers want you to.The score doesn't help either - many fans weren't pleased when Alan Silvestri was replaced on the project by Klaus Badelt and a whole band of other Media Ventures composers, and the resulting Hans Zimmer-soundalike doesn't help proceedings. This is a pretty good time-passer, and the work of Industrial Light and Magic, Captive Audience Productions, Digiscope, Boy Wonder etc can't be faulted (and it's nice to see that there's still a place for miniatures in these CGI days), but "Sinbad: Legend Of The Seven Seas" made much less money and was much more fun. And it had better music. I'll stick with "Armageddon," which has Liv Tyler and is therefore instantly preferable to this one, Keira Knightley notwithstanding.All that said, the scene after the end credits should NOT be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is so bad the box should be labeled with an admonitory skull-and-crossbones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many negative things I have to say about this that I don't know where to start. I am going to cut the crap and write my review simply by noting everything I hated about this and why. 1. All of the action scenes are so boring and derivative that they are about as fun as watching plants grow. If you've seen one swordfight, you've seen 'em all, unless you've seen "Army of Darkness", which this is a rip-off of in several ways. 2. It would help if I cared about the characters, that way there could be some suspense. Instead, every single character was created from cardboard, no matter how good the acting jobs were. I hate to break it, but revealing more of the plot does not reveal more of the characters. All of the "character development" is as about as effective as the attempts in an awful z-grade horror movie I saw recently called "Evil Town", where a bimbo and her guy exchange childhood stories for a few seconds before getting kidnapped and doing nothing else for the story other than titillation. Anyway, back to this review, and reason number three: Did I mention that this blatantly rips off "Army of Darkness"? 4. I was amazed at what the corporate bigwigs at Disney could get away with in a boring supernatural adventure that much better horror movies got in deep trouble for. Gee, the MPAA sure aren't playing favorites are they? 5. The plot, as you can probably guess from the title, not only really offers nothing new to the fantasy genre, but is only redeemable when resorting to a fork lodged in a guy's eyeball, a bird crapping on a guy, and renegade body parts on the move separately from the bodies they once belonged to. Have scenes like these been used in better movies? Hell, yes. At the same time, those better movies have generally been the enemy of mainstream film, which explains again why this boring dreck made it out from under the axe with a casual PG-13 rating, while much better movies are faced with full-on R ratings, or even NC-17s (depending on the current political climate). Sorry to sound redundant, but I can't get enough of trashing the MPAA because I've got fine reasons for it and believe I state my case well. 6. Also, this movie is miserably predictable. Even some of the stranger stuff I could see coming a mile away. 7. Yes, this is a movie that is way too long. For me, the three-hours-max of running time felt like an eternity. Now that I've appropriately blasted this piece of garbage for all it's worth, I would like to, in all fairness, lay down what I saw as redeemable points: gross, morbid jokes and what can be taken as an interesting comment on how those who try too hard to not conform end up conforming through their small-minded attempts at escaping a system that they feel doesn't meet their specifications. At the same time, I would finally like to note that even the redeemable points are murdered by how awful the movie is. I would rather sit through several hours of MTV than have to watch this overlong piece of devastatingly derivative rubbish ever again, for I may not be a Christian, but I certainly felt like thanking God when this movie was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" is weird and wonderful; funny and droll, but cannot stand up over repeated viewings.(Well, it can, if you check your brain at the door before taking your seat.)I mean, come on now! Six, count 'em, six writers, and hundreds of workers on the film and NO ONE pointed out that the main plot falls under the film's own rules? Should we not expect more from Disney and Bruckheimer? Oh. I forgot. Disney is adept at making lies into "popular fact"... such as their enduring lie that lemmings commit mass suicide (they pushed the little fellers off the cliff to their doom!) and teaches moms are expendable, a subtle misogyny, and more, to little kids in their animated films. (Not so subtle is the showing of a woman being hit by men... twice! Once by a large black man, enforcing nasty stereotypes, and then by the pirate captain.) Then there is Jerry Bruckheimer, well, his career has been uneven, at best. From "Con Air" and "Top Gun" to "Kangaroo Jack" and lots of television stuff, so perhaps we should expect non-thinking films from him.So, don't examine the premise closely or it will unravel like an old knit sweater.Before you holler about it being a kid movie, realize PG-13 is NOT a "kid movie" and Capt. Sparrows obsession with eunuchs (also see deleted scenes) is certainly NOT appropriate for the minds of 13 year old males, (who are embarking on a critical stage of sexual development with its attendant castration fears) let alone younger children. With the DVD release coinciding with the Yule season, a lot of youngsters will be getting this film, which is exactly as the marketers intended. Besides, 13 year olds are bright enough to question the film's violations of its own internal logic... even little kids are adept at pointing out movie inconsistencies these days. Taking it too seriously, you say? Well, watch the extras on the DVD, the makers took this film seriously, and obviously intended we would also.**** *** ** Warning! Logic Ahead! ** *** ****If Miss Swan's corset was so tight she could not breathe, and she fainted from it, then what reserve of air was in her lungs that she could survive the plunge to the depths and back up again?Ol' funny eye screamed about being burned, but the cursed has no feeling as Captain Barbossa informs us.How is it the cursed carried such wonderful fresh food aboard a ship when for a decade they have been unable to eat? Any food aboard makes no sense. Apples in the Caribbean in the 18th century? And how is it the blade plunged into Barbossa has blood on it when withdrawn?If the cursed cannot "die" (and we repeatedly see them walk away after mortal wounds), then why is it that "William 'Bootstrap' Turner" - who was cursed by stealing the medallion - stayed dead upon being thrown to "Davy Jones' Locker"? The other medallions were on the Isle so don't say it was because he sent the medallion to his son. If the cursed pirates can walk the ocean depths, then why not ol' Bootstrap?If Capn' Sparrow can immediately become a dead and cursed skeleton upon stealing the gold medallion, then why didn't Elizabeth when she stole that same medallion in the cavern? Or young Mr. Turner who also stole it. If it makes one immediately cursed, and dead, and the dead can't bleed, how came it to be that Will Turner could bleed and thereby release the curse?Why is it blood was not required of every other piece of gold retrieved?If Isle de la Muerta is only found by those already knowing its location, (and still a special compass is needed) then how did the Commodore's ship find it? There was a huge squall when Sparrow made way to the isle in the 'fastest ship in the fleet', so they could not have followed.What is it with Depp's accent? It doesn't quite belong anywhere, and he acts as though he is blitzed or something throughout the whole film... (he marred "Chocolate", one of my favorite films, with his dreadful Irish accent!) if you look carefully, you can catch sight of some of his tattoos. I wonder how he felt making the little "France" joke, which obviously caters to the current American distaste for the country. (More blatant and foul in the deleted scene for it, with its allusions to eunuchs, the French, and mayonnaise.) Screenwriters should be careful in period films about modern allusions as they invoke stream of consciousness thoughts, causing the mind to wander from the film, possibly never to return. If the mind does not make the connection, then there is no point to the allusion. Screen writing Russian Roulette, guys.For fun, you can even sneak a peek at Bloom's LOTR elvish tattoo on his right lower forearm. I suspect he will come to regret such obvious placement. (Elijah Wood was probably wise in getting his placed below the belt line.) Bloom is an up and coming actor and I look forward to seeing him in new roles.And so on. At this writing, Disney is just releasing its second film based on one of its rides, "The Haunted Mansion" it seems to be getting little fanfare, so maybe the trend will stop. It is, of course, better than them ruining great old films by filming remakes.On the plus side, Rush is impressive as usual, and if you let the film just wash over you it can be fun. At least the first time around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have mostly praise for Pirates. Johnny Depp absolutely carries the movie with his exceptionally brilliant, somewhat comedic, performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. He was everything you could imagine a pirate to be - a sly thief with a swagger in his step and nothing but a desire to sail his beloved ship on the high seas. Orlando Bloom (personally, my favorite actor)gave a nice performance as heroic blacksmith Will Turner and Kiera Knightly played Turner's captured love interest Elizabeth Swann. Also, great performances by Geoffrey Rush as Jack Sparrow's undead enemy Captain Barbossa and Jack Davenport(whom I love in the British sitcom, Coupling) as Commodore Norrington. Another great attribute of this film was it's soundtrack. Klaus Badlet hit the nail on the head..perfect Pirate music! I only had two problems with the film. First, there were questions pertaining to the plot that should've been answered such as, why a Turner's blood was needed to break the curse. (It is possible that that question was answered but I missed it.)Also, the fight scenes between the British and the skeleton-pirates were a bit drawn out and could've been shorter. However, overall, this movie was one of the best times I've had at the movies in a long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>YAY! A Pirate's Life For ME!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Disney was going to be making a movie inspired from the theme park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, I laughed, `Oh my God, they're getting desperate for new material now.' The trailers came out for the movie, featuring sword fighting, skeletal ghost-pirates, and the seemingly out of place Johnny Depp; I was very much intrigued. I walked i nto the cinema opening day, having no expectations about its entertainment or general value. Silly me, I forgot to heed the warning from the advertisements: `Prepare to be blown out of the water.' I absolutely loved the film from beginning to end! Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great movie because of the magnificent actors, the engaging story, and the reminiscence of some much loved old-time adventure films. At first, the prospect of a pirate that walks and talks like Rolling Stone Keith Richards with the haughty egomaniacal mentality of Warner Brother's Pepé le Pew may seem rather outlandish. However, Johnny Depp manages to make this blend very credible and comically entertaining as Curse of the Black Pearl's purveyor of eternal piratical adventure, Captain Jack Sparrow. A mouth full of gold teeth and a often slurred cockney accent make a wonderful source for a symphonic cacophony of witty lines such as the soon-to-be classic retort to a snooty British naval commodore's observation that he is the `worst pirate I've ever heard of.' Depp's Captain Sparrow smugly replies, `But you have heard of me.' It is the opinion of some critics that Depp's portrayal `steals' the show (you say `steal,' Captain Sparrow would say, `Commandeer: it's a nautical term'). However crucial to the success of this movie, Depp's performance is not the only one noteworthy. No one could surpass Geoffrey Rush's gritty, undead persona that is the spirit of the delightfully, fiendishly cunning villain Captain Barbossa. Taking the more traditional route in terms of pirate look, speech, and mannerisms (did I hear him say `Arrr'?), Rush nevertheless accomplishes freshness to his character that establishes him as an archetypal but menacing `baddy' who is threatening not only in his cursed skeletal form but also his yellow-toothed, yellow-eyed, fully-fleshed leering scallywag. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann respectively, fit very nicely into their pegs of the star-crossed lovers thrust into this grand adventure that is lovingly referred to by its fans as `POTC.' The story, by Shrek screenwriters Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, has the feel of traditional epic adventure movies with a tongue-in-cheek humor employed to hint at the movie's theme-park ride roots. In one scene, a key-carrying dog cocks his head at three pirate prisoners whistling and waving a bone to lure the mangy mutt toward their cell door. A parrot slowly screeches through the rolling fog an eerie forewarning of threat: `Dead men tell no tales!' A scene with Will Turner and Jack Sparrow touring the pirate island of Tortuga reveals buccaneer party antics such as bar brawls, busty babes, and of course, lots of rum drinking. Such is the soul of the famous attraction in Disneyland, California. You will never get to a moment in Pirates of the Caribbean where you will be remotely jaded. Around every corner are spooks to make your skin crawl, sword fights to quicken your pulse, and tension relieving wisecracks to split your sides. The comedy is often very refreshingly intellectual for a so-called kid's movie. Pleasingly, a lot of the humor is geared toward adults yet still appropriate to present to kids. Many adults found themselves laughing more than their children. A couple of well-known, classic movies come to mind to which I can compare to Curse of the Black Pearl. They are: Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Princess Bride and Star Wars. Curse of the Black Pearl has the fundamental nature of the classic adventures of George Lucas' ultimate American hero, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr. (AKA Indiana Jones). Captain Jack Sparrow is our new `Indy.' He fences villains and dodges perils on quests requiring bravery, faith, and a little help from his friends-old and new. Will Turner, in exchange is the new Wesley of The Princess Bride: the lover turned pirate. The situational absurdity and word wit of The Princess Bride is imminent in Pirates of the Caribbean in scenes such as Jack Sparrow's final escape from the British navy and his accord with the commodore. Pirates of the Caribbean also shares the element of total immersion into the world of its characters (and a fan following sure to eventually match) with the original Star Wars film. Fans want to dress like the characters and they debate technical and philosophical aspects of the film with others (such as `How are Will and Jack able to hold a overturned rowboat under water, trap the breathing air within it, and not float to the surface of the ocean?' and `What more specifically are the motivations behind Captain Barbossa's severe hatred of Jack Sparrow?'). Thankfully, fanatics will have more to ponder and discuss when the film's sequel is released some time within the next few years. The principal actors have expressed passion and interest in a chance at meeting with their alter egos for a second, and perhaps even a third time. Frankly, I am enthusiastically and impatiently awaiting the arrival of the continuing tale of Captain Jack Sparrow and his trusty ship, the Black Pearl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- Pirates of the Caribbean: 8/10I went to watch this movie earlier, having heard all the hype. I was very doubtful that I'd like this, as Disney made it. Boy, was I surprised. This was definitely one of the superior "epic" movies of the last few years. Not only was the storyline entertaining and never boring, but the cast was just awesome. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush were terrific in their roles, and the supporting cast was really good. Johnny Depp deserves special mention. What an actor! He brought the role of Jack Sparrow to life with such a majestic performance. Now for my one complaint of the movie, and one that I expected, given that it was Disney. Way too many out-of-character/setting one liners/jokes/tension-breakers... whatever you want to call them, every modern day American movie seems to have them. There were little flaws too that can be easily overlooked, like one of the cursed pirates using the term "spitting image", which can't be more than 30 years old (and this movie is set in the days of pirates). No more complaining though, this was a wonderful, vibrant movie that everyone of any age should see. The special FX were awesome too, and I loved the main theme from the soundtrack. Depp deserves an Oscar for his role, and should be the most pursued actor in Hollywood now.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp brought to life a character that is so damn cool it's suprising that the set didn't freeze over.Everyone else in this movie, which is an excellent movie by the way, play their roles well but Depp just makes them look ordinary with his outstanding performance. He is so comfortable in front of a camara, if he was anymore relexed he'd fall over. This film is worth seeing for him alone.Rest of the film? Very good fun, I can't remember the last time I came out of a film with a big smile on my face. Special effects do there job but don't take over the film, which makes a nice change.In summery, the best film i've seen this year. Johnny Depp for President! Legend.</fullReview>

He certainly looks dashing enough and there are some genuinely romantic scenes between him and Knightley, and he's good at action sequences, however at times his acting is pretty awkward.If Depp hadn't been cast beside him: this movie would have been a stinker. Bloom doesn't have the on screen presence yet. But hopefully that will develop.He does have talent.The plot and story of the movie is as expected very thin and there are problems with pacing. The movie is 20 minutes too long. The middle part of the movie being occasionally uninteresting. But the beginning and end make up for the mediocre storytelling in between.I'm starting to become a fan of Gore Verbinksi.

Just saw the Stones-stock in Toronto with Keith Richards, then Boom, there he is speaking thru time and depp space!Keef!How funny!Heard it /saw it / felt it Before reading confirmation here and elsewhere that he Was being Keith as a pirate, and Yeah, it obviously wasn't just some arbitrary hip choice, like playing him as Bob Dylan or even John Lennon. It's great to know Keith is still living and breathing among us, and great to see him living and breathing on a pirate adventure in the 1800s through overlaid masks of Johnny's Hunter Thompson and Ichabod Crane and Don Juan -- like Ed McMahon becoming an axe-wielding maniac thru Jack Nicholson -- bizarre, but it works.The choreography of all the many swordfighting scenes was great -- comical at times, theatrical &amp; tense at others -- it was Errol Flynn with a little Fred Astaire, and maybe Eddie Murphy or Jim Carey.This is Swiss Family Robinson, Kirk Douglas, swashbuckling swordfights, swinging from ship to ship -- except done in a real 21st century foxy way -- with explosions that shake your soda, and a surreal Star Wars bar scene in Pirateland, where Jack 'Han Solo' Sparrow goes back to recruit a crew.The music was just great, swept you along with the swooshes of swords, as did the choreography. The sets take you there, the castles make me want to be there, and the living skeleton special effects bring out my own worst nightmares. The acting is typically melodramatic Disney comedy, but that's the genre, and its consistent and funny. The storyline is kind of convoluted and ridiculous, but the dialog is righteous (just look at all the quotes on this site after about one week in release). Finding faults in this is like complaining about Duck Soup; ignore the flies, and just fly with the parrots. This is a silly, wonderful, imaginative, transportive ride based on the coolest scary ride at Disneyland. How could it not have been made before? And I'd love to have a five bowl serial.</fullReview>

The movie is 20 minutes too long. The middle part of the movie being occasionally uninteresting. But the beginning and end make up for the mediocre storytelling in between.I'm starting to become a fan of Gore Verbinksi. He has certainly created a unique atmosphere in Pirates of the Caribbean.Keep up the good work!!And know i'm not alone on this: GIVE JACK SPARROW AN OWN MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun than the ride....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It amazes me that so many people get on the computer an pan perfectly good movies. Pirates kicked arse, in my opinion. (Note the English accent so prevalent in this movie.) Johnny Depp made the movie, which, admittedly, was little more than a special effects tribute to the popular Disney attraction. His character was not only the basis for the film and a cause for the best action sequences, but also the comic relief. The plot was curiously interesting, and made sense if you think about it, adhering in many ways to the type of pirate legends that made up the Caribbean history. If you liked Cutthroat Island, you'll love this movie. It's fun, exciting, and well worth your schillings.Also, as a Florida boy who went to Disney many times in his youth, Pirates was always one of my favorite attractions. Not only did it have air conditioning (which in the summer months was a major draw in the magic kingdom's choices), but it also featured the animatronics and music that made the ride famous. Glimpses of this attraction can be seen throughout the first sequence with the pirates, including, but not limited to, pirates chasing wenches, the pirates locked in the prison trying to tease the dog into bringing them the key, and the pirate skeletons hanging from the rock.I loved this movie, and would recommend it heartily...mates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you really want to like. It's unbelievably well-made and succeeds on many levels:-It looks great.-It sounds great.-It is well acted.-It has great special effects.-It has a great plot.-It has good action scenes.Despite all of these good points, something just didn't work for me. The pacing was off and I found it too long. I think it would be a much better movie if it were 1/2 an hour shorter. I found myself checking my watch several times-not a good thing.The length of the movie offset most of the good points for me and I gave the movie a 6/10. It was really hard for me to submit the vote. I could tell that someone really labored over this movie and tried to sweat the details. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how hard film makers work on their craft if it fails to deliver the goods, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start. From Johnny's Depp's opening scene on the sinking dingy to well done CGI that didn't overwhelm the movie, Pirates has established itself as one of the finest pirate movies of all time. Each character is well acted, even the minor characters have well established personalities. The fight scenes are well choreographed, and the CGI meshes perfectly from flesh and blood to bones and tatters.As far as plot goes, it's a pirate movie. Buried treasure, kidnapped lady, plank walking, ancient curse, broadsides and lots of sword play, they hit all the cliches you would expect. But they do it well. Where other pirate movies have failed, Pirates manages to mix action and comedy in the right amount. I know these kinds of movies don't win Oscars, but it at least should get a hard look. Depp and Jeffrey Rush especially for their brilliant portrayals of rival pirate captains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: don't go to this movie looking for an intellectual view on life (not that you would, but...). Yes, with that said, I have to say that I found this movie to be quite lovely. The casting is pretty good, though many of the characters are far too restricting for the actors to go anywhere with it. Johnny Depp is absolutely delightful with his rendition of the slightly-addled, but all-together wise Captain Jack Sparrow. There are a few moments that will make you chuckle and a few moments that will send your heart into your stomach. Also, a couple of nice references back to the ride (such as the infamous jail scene with the dog). All things considered, this flick has only half a brain, but continues quite nicely and allows the viewer to leave the theater with a smile on their face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable. While some parts could certainly have hit the cutting room floor, with no loss to the film, I still enjoyed it enough to recommend it to everyone.Johnny Depp turns in a hysterically entertaining performance as Jack Sparrow - I'd call this one of Depp's greatest performances, and the price of admission is worth seeing his turn here. Orlando Bloom makes a believable pirate as well, and gets extra points for having that lovely hair. Kiera Knightley's talent as an actress is apparently debatable; but then again, the part wasn't much, so I can't judge her based on this film alone. Geoffery Rush makes a great bad guy, but I expected nothing less than a stellar performance from Rush anyhow (that is what he does, after all).The sets and costumes are gorgeous and lush, and the ships are beautiful to look upon. I do wish there had been more swordfighting, though! Overall, I think this film will sit well on the shelf along with the other Disney live-action films that have done so well over the years, and is entertaining enough to watch more than once. More than twice, in fact.</fullReview>

The pirates reminded me of the mummy in the mummy series, but they even looked better, but Johnny Depps comic relief was just enough, they didnt over due it but still kept him as a comedic character......8 out of 10, would have been a 9 or 10 if it was 20 minutes to 30 minutes shorter.a</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Gore Verbinski ("The Mexican" "The Ring") finally delivers with this instant Disney classic. Wonderful casting, crackling humor and terrific special effects make this one a gem. Johnny Depp is perfect as the strange, funny, smart, slightly off center pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush is his equal as Sparrow's enemy Barbossa. Brilliant casting with the up and coming stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly ("Bend it like Beckham") give this film very wide appeal to the mass audience - not an easy task for a swashbuckling pirate movie - ask Geena Davis and Renny Harlin. Although some of the dialog is bit over the top, the basic story line is pretty interesting and actually works on a couple of levels. This is fine movie making and a joy to watch and recommend. Doubt the sequel will be as well done, but enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (2003) Rating out of four: **** Starring: Johnny Depp, Geoffery Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly Directed by Gore VerbinskiWhere to start?This movie is exactly what people need this summer. It has it all, comedy, adventure, action, and a slight bit of horror.The acting is absolutely amazing! Everyone played their part spot-on. This is definately Johnny Depp's finest performance. The way he slurs his lines when he talks, his face and hand gestures, and the way he walks around like he's drunk all the time hit a good spot with the audience. Depp stole the show. Geoffery Rush was fantastic as Captain Barbossa, him and his crewmates adding creepyness to the movie. Keira Knightly anf Orlando Bloom did a fine performance. I was especially pleased with Knightly's. As an 18-year-old actress, she acts like she's been doing it for years and years, worthy of a best supporting actress award.As for the rest of the movie. CGI wasn't absolutely stunning but it did it's part. Showing us what the curse of the aztec gold had on the pirates. I enjoyed the scenes of the beautiful landscape and waters of the Caribbean, especially that one little island that Jac..(sorry) Captain Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann were marooned on.Drink up me 'arties yo ho!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see this movie the third day after it was released. I went in thinking I'd enjoy myself and I sure did. I was in awe of how Johnny Depp became the pale man he was in Sleepy Hollow, to the rough and dazed pirate he was in this movie. I was not overall impressed with Orlando Bloom's role in this movie, but when his character was needed for certain scenes, he was there. I liked the 'heroine' of the movie, though, in some scenes, I found her a little too, bland. The storyline was pretty good, though, not the kind of thing you would see in a disney ride, more like for "Jason and the Arganauts". I really hoped that it wouldn't be all scifi, and stick more to the lines of an pirate movie where they smuggle and steal, and rape and kindle. The swordfight was rather good, though I had to tell myself 'Your not watching Errol Flynn'.But all in all, I enjoyed myself when seeing this, and I will be buying the movie when it's released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have ever been to Disney World, undoubtedly you have ridden one of their oldest and most famous rides, ?Pirates of the Caribbean.' The ride first premiered at Disneyland in California in 1956. Since then, it has astounded riders with its stunning animatronics that make riders feel as if they are actually viewing real pirates. Now, in 2003, we are blessed with a film version, equally as remarkable as the ride, but far more frightening. Unlike the usual simple live-action films based on Disney creations, hence `The Lizzy McGuire Movie,' the new `Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances. Starring Johnny Depp (`From Hell'), Orlando Bloom (`Black Hawk Down'), Geoffrey Rush (`Frida'), Keira Knightley (`Bend It Like Beckham'), Jack Davenport (The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Johnathan Pryce (`What A Girl Wants'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' is quite possibly one of this summer's most exciting motion pictures. The story follows that of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), who after being imprisoned is freed by a blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom). Turner needs the help of Sparrow to hunt down a band of pirates who have kidnapped the radiant Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), who is the governor's daughter. Incidentally, Swann holds a medallion that has a secret power to transform her kidnappers back into real men, as a curse has left them as ghosts. It's now a race for Sparrow and Turner to find and kill the pirates before they sacrifice Swann in an ancient ritual to free themselves from the curse.  Depp steals the show with his constant swaggering and drunken behavior-he fits the character of Sparrow like a glove. Beyond Depp, Rush is equally engaging as the nefarious pirate Barbossa. Bloom also pulls off a realistic performance, as he does in every film in which he appears. Mostly known for his role as Legolas in `The Lord of the Rings,' films, he brings class and wit to `Pirates of the Caribbean.' All three actors share something in common-they can do no wrong. They all grace every project that they work on and add a sense of intrigue to the plot through their characterization. The general feel of `Pirates of the Caribbean' is serious, yet campy enough to have fun along the way. The audience will certainly enjoy how Sparrow tricks British soldiers as he tries to steal a ship. But there is also a sense that the film is trying to be truthful in it's realistic portrayal, at least physically and set-wise, of what the battles would be like between naval ships. The set design is astonishing. A great deal of craft and creativity went into the building of ships and buildings that the pirates pillage and plunder. One feels as if they are looking at real ships from the era. Usually there are little flaws that seem to stick out on a movie screen, but with this film, they just don't seem to show up. The film may be a bit longer than necessary, but its thrilling from start to finish. Directed by Gore Verbinski (`The Ring'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' will long be remembered and loved for its action sequences and pure fun. However, parents should heed the PG-13 rating, as the film can be quite scary for the little ones at times. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though a bit violent for small children and a bit long in some places, Pirates has tidbits for all movie goers, old and young, male and female. There is the romance, there are the fight scenes, there are the ghost/horror elements, there are the cute comedy bits that all make up for a rather fun, entertaining film for everyone. Johnny Depp almost steals the show with his anti-hero antics. The movie ultimately stands up to honest scrutiny for all characters for the most part by the end, though perhaps Barbossa could have been even a more complex character making the movie even more dramatic and riveting. The climax avoids the usual melt-down to action and blustery fury, using instead a more moderate and superior ending device. Overall, Pirates rates eight stars out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good, but overrated movie which was improved on all counts in the sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curse of the Black Pearl was almost loved by many critics and according to some of them, it was a masterpiece. Then, why? You know, critics don't like such kind of movies, the movies which they call blockbusters, they underestimate such kind of movies and don't give high ratings. Even the sequel can be an example. As I see, they did not like the second movie as many people did not. Firstly, I want to say that I don't categorize movies as blockbuster and non blockbuster. What I am trying to say is that Curse of the Black Pearl has nothing different or unusual that would make even critics appreciated, instead, it was engrossing, entertaining, but a so so movie. Just another adventure movie. I slightly enjoyed it, it was entertaining, but mildly entertaining, so I cannot say a lot of fun here. I had expected much more by trailer. I think that I can tell my thoughts more clear above The King Arthur. Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie. I was entertained by The King Arthur, but just by some scenes, it was not uninteresting, it was engrossing, but no more than that. I had rented it, watched, was entertained, then gave it back. It was a so so movie, it was not a new Gladiator, it was not a new Excalibur. This first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl is such a movie, if you ask me. It is an engrossing pirate movie with ghosts who look like flesh and blood, but turn into ghost by moonlight. Cool! As for Johnny Depp, one of my all time favorite actors, Jack Sparrow is remarkable, interesting, but he cannot even touch Jack Sparrow in Dead Man's Chest. In the sequel, this character is much more interesting, eccentric, colorful and funny. However, his performance in all The Pirates of the Caribbean movies is outstanding, especially in the second movie! Jack Sparrow hides a secret, it is unfolded at the last part, but it ruins the character, it kills the humor of the character. I was just disappointed, but not so important. Before the sequel was released, I had been sure that the second movie would surpass the first movie by far on all counts and I was not mistaken about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pirate Blockbluster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike a lot of people, I thought the Pirates of the Caribbean series was okay, entertaining in place, but not great. Pirate films have a history of being flops, from Roman Polanski's Pirates to the biggest Blockbuster failure Cutthroat Island. Pirates of the Caribbean also has a filmy source material, a ride at Disneyworld (and the Florida version isn't that good). So the signs weren't good. However, the film is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who has made a large number of blockbusters, had writers who were involved in successful films like Aladdin, the Mask of Zorro, Antz, Shrek and Colleratal, and staring Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.POTC is set in the 17th Century, set in the Caribbean (surprise surprise). Sailing from England to Port Royal, Jamaica, the young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her father, the Governor of the island (Jonathan Pryce) find a young boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) floating in the ocean. The film fast-forwards to when Elizabeth and Will are young adults, Elizabeth still the daughter of the governor and Will is a blacksmith. Will is in love with Elizabeth but doesn't do anything about it. However their world is rocked when Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) shows up. He saves Elizabeth from drowning before getting arrested by the British authorities. That night Port Royal is attacked by pirates from the Black Pearl, with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) leading them. Elizabeth is kidnapped and Jack and Will have to chase to save her.Now the film is hokum, but that's acceptable. It is meant for a family entertainment. It also adds supernatural elements and it felt similar to the Mummy, even have similar action scenes. This film in the series has the simplest plot and has many humorous elements. The action is top-draw, mixing live-action and CGI, the whole series is known for it special effects and had an excellent score. The acting is hit and miss. Johnny Depp is entertaining as the drunken, distruthful Jack Sparrow. This is Johnny Depp's first blockbuster, in the past often rejecting big budget movies to work on smaller projects. Depp is a brilliant actor. Geoffrey Rush is an actor who added gravitas to project and makes an excellent villain; the films allows him to have some fun. Johnathan Pryce was underused in the film, but still made his character a good but indifferent being. Keira Knightley was okay, I don't mind her, she is very easy on the eye. Orlando Bloom is a bit wet and he has been type-casted since Lord of the Rings (he has been in Troy and Kingdom of Heaven). The film is too long and the story is not the best. It is filled with pirate clichés. Gore Verbinski is more comfortable with the action scenes then character development. Most of the humours comes from Jack Sparrow and often slapstick.Basically the film is entertaining enough, 3 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie three or four times by now. I have enjoyed it every single time like it was the first. I watched it again today and it still amazes me.The cast is incredible, Depp, Bloom and Knightley make a really entertaining team. Watching this film again, it made me realize that Orlando Bloom does have acting skills and he probably has a great career ahead of him. Keira Knightley was beautiful and delivers a good performance in The Curse of the Black Pearl. She was made to act and to shine, I cannot believe she was only seventeen in this movie, the age I am now. I believe she is a really good role model as well.Johnny Depp... His name says everything. He's an amazing actor, always part of the best movies of the genre and one of the best entertainers of this millennium, probably. It's not his looks or his muscular body, or his youth (I was making a joke) that impresses us - it's the facial expressions and the body language. Jack Sparrow is a really good character and young kids, specially boys, everywhere will want Jack Sparrow backpacks and Jack Sparrow lunch boxes. But not only kids enjoy this movie, adults do too, Sparrow is also a complex character.But those tree are not the only ones that impress, the rest of them are good also. Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Weatherby Swann are a good contrast to Will and Jack. Both amusing and amazing. Barbossa makes a nice villain in this film and Geoffrey Rush acted pretty good alongside Depp and the main cast.The special effects are good, modern, it almost makes you forget you're just watching a movie. The story is relatively simple, the humor is really good, sometimes I wonder if this is a pirates parody movie, but then I realize that they're trying to create that perfect feeling that comes into your mind when you are thinking about pirates and adventure.I don't know what more I can say since I'm not an expert. If you haven't seen this movie then what are you waiting for? Everybody has seen it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best live action Disney films of all time. Pirates of the Caribbean revived a dead movie genre with spectacular glory. Full of comedy, action, great story and character development and amazing CGI, it deserves to be in the film hall of fame, if there is one. The story revolves around the cursed treasure of Cortez, placed in a large chest on Isla De Muetre, an island that can only be found by those who know where it is. Anyway, a crew of pirates take the coins and become cursed skeletons. They need all the coins to free themselves of the curse, so they kidnap Keira Knightley from Port Royal to complete their goal. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, teams up with swank pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to save her from Captain Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl. Hilarity, action and old-fashioned pirating follows with an amazing final battle. I give the film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The below or above writer made a valiant point in saying Disney hasn't come out with decent movies for quite a while now (at that point in time), however you cannot say Johnny Depp would be as famous as he is because of this movie? He has always been great in his own right even though he wasn't the mainstream actor of that time...he had a cult following and his movies and characters are quite memorable. Movies made from Disney haven't always been the best as i can agree with this previous writer, however, of all Disney movies...NOT ANIMATED...this movie will always be a top the list!! Depp sold this movie!! Hands Down! The rest of the cast added to the beauty, laughter, and amazingness(my word) of this film!! One of my favorite rides of Disney actually made an Amazing Film!! Can't say that with a lot of Disney Films now a days.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates: one of the best movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. First of all, I love pirates, which means anything that has to do with pirates, I love. So, obviously I would like this, but, besides that, this movie has romance, action, adventure, a witty rum-obsessed captain (Jack), a brave hero (Will), and a not so distressed damsel (Elizabeth). There are also bad guys of course (Captain Barbosa), the undead skeleton pirates that Jack, Will, and Elizabeth have to defeat.Overall this film is a wonderful pirate movie that I love, but I wouldn't recommend watching the other two, although they somewhat summed up the story, they were not as good as the first one, which above all, has to be the best out of the three. So, as I said, it is a great movie that I give 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far my absolute favorite. The drama, fights, romance, humor... EVERYTHING fits perfectly within each other like a puzzle.This whole story starts out with action right away. THe Governers daughter, Elizabeth, played by the gorgeous Keira Knightley, is kidnapped by pirates. Not just any pirates. Cursed pirates. And supposedly, Elizabeth's blood can lift the curse as she beholds a medallion, one of 882. However, her blood is not who they need, Will Turner, a blacksmith, is truly the one who can lift the curse. And of course, what's a movie without romance? Will and Elizabeth are in love.Captain Jack Sparrow, played by the wonderful Johnny Depp, is along for the ride, in hopes for fetching back his beloved Black Pearl, who was stolen from him by Captain Barbossa. Leader of the cursed pirates.All in all, this movie is amazing. Everything is played out perfectly. The plot is great, the acting is fantastic, the special effects are superb.Well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful pirate movie! I loved every bit of it. This is a real treat for Disney fans. The performances was incredible and realistic, there are some superb actors and actresses in this movie, such as Johnny Depp, who plays the mighty yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow he will certainly blow the audience away with his action, humour and look!! Also the heroic and handsome Orlando Bloom, who plays Will Turner, he proves that he can shine no matter what with his personality and talents. As for Keira Knightley (who plays the beautiful governor's daughter in this movie)proved that she can play a grown up girl who is stuck in the 18th Century very well and probably her fans think so too. And Geoffrey Rush, who plays the evil and cunning Captain Barbossa, did very well and you can feel his emotions inside you and he can have you right at the edge of your seat. I think all of the actors and actresses did brilliantly in this movie and not to mention the makers of this movie, they have done an absolutely amazing job to produce such a enjoyable gripping pirate movie.I loved the special effects in this movie - it made the movie more realistic than ever. Also I loved the idea of the plot, the mighty and charming Captain Jack Sparrow is back, this time the evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) stole Jack's ship, The Black Pearl. And later it attacks Port Royal and two pirates kidnapped the beautiful governor's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth get kidnapped and in an attempt to rescue her he joined forces with Jack. But a cursed treasure doomed Barbossa and his band of cursed men to live as undead forever and Will dosen't know that...This is a perfect pirate movie mixed with humour, horror, mystery, adventure, love and sword fighting action.</fullReview>

So you must be wondering, what business does a girlie eleven year old girl have watching Pirates of the Caribbean? Well, I'm bursting to tell you why.When I first heard of Pirates of the Caribbean I thought 'Oh! Not another Pirate movie!' But when the second movie came out, my father insisted that I had to watch it. At first I tried to get out of it, but then when I finally sat down to watch it, I fell in love. Jack's tricks, Elizabeth's sense and Will's courage are what kept me going.After I had watched it, I wanted to watch it again and again. Now I seriously think that my parents are sick of it. One thing's for sure, I'll never be sick of it.Pirates will never get old and this movie will be a legend forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jhonny Depp adds to his list of already enigmatic characters played probably the one he is most famous for playing - Captin Jack Sparrow , during the 2 hours of curse of the Black Pearl it was hard to think of anybody else who could pull it off as well as he did. The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of those summer time movies which you have to be in the mood to view and many years later finally... that mood had arrived for me. On the whole I was not left disappointed as it kept me hooked through its swash- buckling antics and I can see how the angles were curbed to keep this a good family film. The plot was fairly straight forward with our anti-hero pirate trying to recover his ship back whilst taking revenge on a group of super natural foes along with the entire naval fleet and the meeting a few characters along the way . The special affects were very good , not to mention the stunts and the sword play all brilliant although its never really taken to the level I had hoped for but hey again this is a family film!!! Jhonny Depp was the man who kept me in my seat , whether it be the action or the catchy one liners he makes it very apparent why he is one of the most versatile actors to have emerged onto the big screen. Orlando Bloom although I am not a fan of his he pulled his weight through out the film very well indeed UNLIKE in Troy where he was nothing short of an annoying pep-squeak and I really enjoyed Keira Knightley's performance through out the film (not just eye candy)and every body made full use of the scenery to the brilliant make-up and costumes really made it worth while. Too conclude The Curse of The Black Pearl is one of those films which are worth a check at on summer's day with your family or worth a rental if your looking for a bit of light action/fantasy I mean I may just be a little too old for Pirates now days and the action was not taken to the level I had hoped for but instead it was saved by brilliant performances all round. THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL: 8.1 OUT OF 10'You best start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner, after all your in one!' - Captin Barbossa (played by Geoffery Rush.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..and uplifting. There was a time when this is why people went to the movies. No pretentious advocacy. Just high caliber entertainment. (Good music too) What? Johnny Depp can even take his young kids to see it. Pirate Jack Sparrow is an all-time characterization. Geoffrey Rush boosts the wonder of storybook pirates to a level not seen since the original "Treasure Island". The Brit officers are great foils for Depp and the pirate crew is all that one could hope for. Great lines sprinkled throughout. Rush's response to the Lady's demand on pirate ethics is classic. "..it was more of a guideline than a rule". The old adage -always leave them laughing- was transgressed for me as the film went a tad long. This movie will be watched 20 years from now...long after "American Beauty" or "Syriana" are utterly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Swashbuckling Action Adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This swash-buckling tale follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, Barbossa along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made.This is a very entertaining action adventure and probably is one of the best films ever made! I'm not exaggerating. It has an interesting storyline for people to watch, great characters for people to love, great action scenes for people to get them to the edge-of-their-seats, and some clever dialog for people to laugh at!I even have to disagree that the film is too long. Well, I didn't mind it at all because I didn't find a single moment in the movie ever being boring. The special effects of the film was good, as well as its costume design, and production design.As you can tell, Johnny Depp plays another, but this time, a really weird character. His acting is funny and the other two roles by Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and Keira Knightley were all good. The score is also memorable, still being played today.If you want a great, big summer movie (well, that was 4 years ago) then go on and watch the film for you folks who still have yet to watch it! It's funny, thrilling, romantic, and so on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Caribbean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Readers,The Pirate movie genre has supposedly been cursed. Every time someone makes a Pirate movie, it flops. Pirates of the Caribbean was supposed to do that just like any other pirate Movie. It instead has become one of the most popular movies of all time with one of the most anticipated sequels of all time: Dead Man's Chest. With stunning action, perfect acting, and a killer score, this is Disney's best franchise yet.The port city of Port Royale is bombarded one bleak night by the deadly pirate ship known as The Black Pearl. The pirates have come for only one thing. A simple Aztec gold coin. As they kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth, with the gold coin, they are almost stopped by the Blacksmith's apprentice, Will Turner. The Next Day Will springs maverick pirate Jack Sparrow from jail in order to find Elizabeth. The two commandeer a ship and sail to the pirate port of Tortuga while Elizabeth learns the chilling secret of the Pirates of the Black Pearl and why they need the golden Coin.Pirates of the Caribbean is probably one of the most awesome movies ever. Johnny Depp was born to play Jack Sparrow while Orlando Bloom, riding on the massive success of The Lord of the Rings, plays Will Turner to a T. Keira Knightly, who I'd never heard of until I saw this film, is beautiful and sexy as Elizabeth. Geoffrey Rush is chilling as the villainous yet charming Captain Barbossa while Jack Davenport does a good job as the Commodore Norrington, who's sworn to stamp out all pirates in the Caribbean. Klaus Badelt's score is pure awesome, swashbuckling, and gets your blood pumping heavily. Gore Verbinski, director of the blockbuster horror film The Ring, does an amazing job directing this film while Jerry Bruckheimer keeps the action coming hard.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie based on a Disney ride. A movie based on a Disney ride. Hmm. Does it sound appealing?? No. But did I finally watch it?? OH, yeah! Loved the casting. Can we do something with what's-her-name's teeth, though? At parts, looks like she's trying to pout over the overbite. Not attractive. But Johhny Depp??? Incredible job as the Pirate who helps others only to help himself. ("Don't do anything stupid"..."like that..." *sigh*) I am looking forward to the sequel, but not seeing it in theaters... Cause I'm going to buy it straight-out. I know it will be worth it as long as Disney didn't drop the ball. I can't imagine Depp signing back on if they had. So, looking forward to it. This movie is a must-buy. The casting, acting, direction and cinematography/choreography were all almost flawless. The special effects were well-done. Disney's getting better at the CGIs. (Hooray.) You'll love it for the plot. It's safe to root for the underdog again. You'll love it for the characters. How sweet the attraction between the main characters. Great family movie. Pop a large bowl of popcorn, grab your drinks, and have fun. Much better than the ride at Disney. (I don't want to see the Hall of Presidents on screen, so please, Disney, draw the line before you go too far, but good job on this one.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It'a almost 3 years since I saw this for the first time. And who didn't think: "This It's going to suck big time"? I did, but somehow I still ended up in the cinema, and saw the movie. I was VARY surprised when I walked out, and remember saying to my self: "This is actually good!" The movie has it all.. Good vs. bad, love and the funniest pirate you probably ever is going to see.Johnny Depp as (Captain) Jack Sparrow is not your everyday pirate, and some will probably still wonder what is he doing? Johnny does a great job and get every part of Jack to work so well. It makes me want more of that character. Orlando Bloom as Will is I my opinion good as well. Who else could be a little bad boy and still have some nerd-style over him? Keira Knighty as Elizabeth challenges the god girl question. Can you really be a god girl, like you have been your whole life in a pirate-world? Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is more dominated than the others characters, without make the other characters look small. That's a god balance between them all. And lets not forget even the smaller parts, but I think you need to see the movie to get to know them. You mat think: Is it still worth it? AYE! Specially if you are going to the the next 2 movies.. Look at me. It's now 3 years later I still can't get enough of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can i say this film came from no where and impressed. I have been to Florida quite a few times so was familiar with Pirates of the Caribbean the ride. When i saw this film was coming out, i thought oh dear!! but went along anyway. I had ZERO expectations.THIS FILM IS BRILLIANT..... It has action, adventure, Humour, Romance and even a touch of horror. The characters are all great and you can empathise with all of them. The action sequences were all great, with good sword fights, Daring escapes and even ship to ship battles. The Humour is probably the best thing about this film, its just fun and light hearted you can't help but like it. This film also has some great one liners.The acting in the film is also very good, Depp being the best. He has created a great classic, anti-hero lovable rouge who is up there with the likes of Indiana Jones and Han solo, he's just campy(but trust me that works). The rest of the cast is also good.The set pieces and special effects are also great. a good mix of real effects combined with CGI have combined to make a great looking picture.If you want a good swash buckling adventure action flick with a big dash of Humour and a pinch of romance mixed in for good measure. Then this film is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't forget to watch the final scene. If you are patient enough, wait until the credits are over and you will be rewarded with one final scene. I won't tell you anything about it, you have to see it for yourself. Like this one, there are many films that have inserted one extra piece of the story. Some times you have to expect the unexpected, a twist in the plot right in the final scene. Why directors include such easter eggs? Maybe they expect that a film-goer like you should see the entire movie, his whole piece of art. So, run to your video store o videoteque and place the VHS or DVD in your player and enjoy.Remember: the story is not over till it's over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I wasn't at all interested in seeing Pirates of the Caribbean, but, after I rented it and watched it, I realized what a cool movie it is. Its really clever.I likes most of the actors. Johnny Depp never really caught my attention before this, but, since now, I have been waiting anxiously to see him reprise his role as captain Jack Sparrow. Kiera Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are excellent as well. Now, on the other hand, Orlando Bloom sort of bugged me. He didn't seem to fulfill his character as well as he could have. But, luckily, this didn't detract from the movie too much.Pirates of the Caribbean had a very original story line. Packed with witty, funny lines and very clever dialog, it never ceases to entertain. While I found some lines a little bit hard to understand, I thought it was very well done.Last, the special effects were really amazing. When the pirates turned into their ghostly form, I found the skeleton effects incredibly real looking. Never inconsistent or weak, the effects were done to best possible degree.So, having said all that, the bottom line is this: I would recommend Pirates of the Caribbean to anyone who enjoys an action/comedy about some pirates of the high seas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the fog at sea, a small boy, Will floats on a scrap plank. Picked up by the British Navy commanded by Governor Swann and Norrington, Will is taken into care by Elizabeth, Governor Swan's daughter. Elizabeth discovers that Will is a pirate carrying a gold trinket, yet keeps this secret. Eight years later, Norrinton is soon to be announced as Commodore Norrinton and reveal his love for Elizabeth. Will is a black smiths apprentice, with a hidden love for Elizabeth. Arriving at Port Royal on a sinking ship, pirate Captain Jack Sparrow is looking to commandeer a ship to continue his travels. When a phantom ship, the Black Pearl comes into port, commanded by Captain Barbossa, Jack, Will and Elizabeth become entangled in the Black Pearls cursed crew and their goal to lift the curse.Strangely based upon a theme park ride at the Disney theme park, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is an exciting adventure. For a long time, pirate movies have been a disappointing venture; its hard to say when a good pirate movie was. The genre was close to be non-existent. Director Gore Verbinski and screen writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought to pirate film into a new age and revitalised a very dwindling genre.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has all the standard elements of a pirate film; savvy characters, treasure, boat caught in thunderous storm, people walking the plank, but its the induction of the supernatural element that elevates Pirates of the Caribbean from just a standard pirate film. The cursed pirates turning into skeletons in the moonlight spins the whole notion of the genre. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio have brought a real authentic element; the lingo and dialog, the pirate code, adds more realism and authenticity.Really making Pirates of the Caribbean all the better is the character driving force it holds. The character are detailed and fleshed out; they are all so unique. The life of the film rests upon Johnny Depp, bringing his most memorable and best performance of his career; he is the most versatile actor of this age in cinema. Johnny as the miscreant Jack Sparrow, with all his blasé idiosyncrasies, are impossible to turn away. Orlando Bloom at time over plays, with his love lorn looks, yet does a great act. As the beautiful damsel Elizabeth, Keira Knightley is wonderful. Making for an ultimate pirate, Geoffrey Rush is just flawless. He makes Barbossa so charismatic, with some tongue in cheek wit.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one swash buckling adventure and one of the best pirate films in such a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little something for everybody...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not want to start this comment off by saying that this is my favorite film. But it is. Yes, I know that period films may not be everyone's cup of tea, and Disney films aren't for everybody. But Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl offers so many unique things to such a wide array of viewers, that it makes it darn near impossible to see it as a typical "Disney ride" film. For one thing, you've got Johnny Depp. Oh, the many faces of Mr. Depp. To me, Johnny Depp can do no wrong. That's because there is NO wrong for him. He puts himself everywhere, in every part possible, every complex acting gig he can squeeze himself into. He's not afraid to be out there or wacky and crazy...Which is EXACTLY what the character of Jack Sparrow is. Yes, he presents most of the comedy and witty one-liners. But he's more than just the comic relief. He adds an unexpected depth to the story, and beckons viewers to take a closer look at him. As do all of the characters. Keira Knightley presents a tame young lady on the verge of adulthood, who, when captured by the cursed pirates, unleashes a fierce fighter from deep within, very unlike any young women of her time. She grew up wanting to meet a pirate, and once she did, her life was thrown in a completely different direction. As an audience, we are expected to follow her journey, and we are also presented with an underlying theme of "there's more to this than there seems", and even characters like Knightley's Elizabeth Swann and Bloom's Will Turner offer prime examples of this theme. Orlando Bloom's acting is often described on the POTC boards as "wooden" and "lacking", but I say no to all of it. His acting is exactly what the character calls for. Will Turner is supposed to be sure of himself and over-confident in the beginning, and throughout the movie he grows mentally and physically to be able to support and back up his confidence. As Orlando Bloom once described, it's like Will is wearing a corset in the beginning (mentally, of course), tight and restraining. But through the period of the film, it slowly unlaces and he can be himself more. Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is evil enough, and even to his character there are layers. There is method to his madness. He is angry because he is living in misery and the same discontented state he has been in because of the curse. He harbors a lust for what he cannot have and a desire towards how he wishes he could live. There is depth behind the harsh, seemingly-cruel exterior.I think, in this sense, the plot and characters are held in a corset at the beginning, each piece held in firmly in it's place. But as the "corset" loosens, the pieces fall away, and come together how they want to be. Maybe not how they're meant to be, but how or where they have longed to be.This movie has more than comedy and a bunch of swashbuckling pirates and action. Yes, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, so you can expect some definite action on a grand scale, but the movie isn't just action. It's romance (between Will and Elizabeth), longing (from Barbossa and the crew), freedom (Jack's knowledge of it because of his ship), fighting (for what you truly believe in and where you are meant to be), and so much more. This is a film I believe everyone could enjoy. I mean, yeah, even if you hate it...You could always sit and make fun of it for the full 143 minutes. If you don't find yourself actually intrigued at some point, that is.</fullReview>

Not only was Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as Jack Sparrow, but he was irresistibly hot as well! The plot seemed unbelievable and slightly cartoony on first sight, but when it was transformed into a movie it developed into one of the most entertaining and engaging stories of the year, even my lifetime! Johnny Depp was hilarious as the eccentric Jack Sparrow, and i am looking forward A LOT to the second and third movies not only to watch two more wonderful plots unfold, but i can't wait to see Captain Jack Sparrow's cheeky smile again...and i can't wait to see him run like a chicken who lost control of his wings again either. The plot of this movie is complemented further by the compositions of Klaus Badelt, one of the first things i noticed while i was sitting in the cinema. The original score that the rest of the music was based upon was pure musical genius! Basically, Pirates of the Caribbean is Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie! And Johnny, je t'aime beaucoup!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great action flick. I was quite surprised that Disney was behind this, and that they gave Depp such free reign. He is a marvelous actor, though, I love just about everything he's done.It was nice to see Orlando Bloom have some more lines than he did in the LotR trilogy. And Geoffrey Rush...ah, Geoffrey...I love just about everything you do as well (Quills, though? What were you thinking?). Mr. Rush did such a great job, overshadowed only by Depp. What a great character he created in Captain Jack Sparrow. But he's created so many great characters.Johnny? When are you going to team up with Morgan Freeman to do something? Now THAT would be a movie. But this one was great too. Pirates of the Caribbean? Two enthusiastic thumbs up, and I highly recommend it.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Movies Should Be Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen. Brilliantly done. This will be one movie that will be remembered for years to come.The story works. I ride the Pirates of the Caribbean at Disneyland all the time. It's so refreshing to see that they just didn't copy the ride story like Haunted Mansion did. It's original and doesn't feel like you're just going on the ride. They used parts of the ride but only when it fit into the story. They could have perfectly well made this story without the ride at all and it still would be good. The scene where Jack is in the prison and the others are trying to get the dog to come over is hilarious, if you've been on the ride. But it's not like the whole movie revolves around that dog. Just one of the subtle touches that people love.I could go on forever on the acting. Every character is perfectly cast. But the two that I must point out is Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. While every single actor and actress does a good job, these two stand above the rest. Barbossa is no nonsense and completely threatening. A villain worthy of the ranks among Darth Vader, Sauron, and Hans Gruber. Jack Sparrow is . . . well he's different. Completely unique. Like none you've ever seen before. Depp plays him almost like Christopher Walken would. He does goofy things with all seriousness. He steals just about every scene he's in. And when those two characters meet it's like when Batman and Superman meet. Two great characters, great on their own and even better together. I just love the way they play off each other.The CGI also terrific. It's not over the top like some movies tend to get. When they need CGI they use it but don't use it everywhere. Just the right amount. The most incredible scene is the Barbossa-Sparrow fight. The two go in and out of the moonlight, both turning into skeletons, and yet the CGI doesn't take away from the fight itself. The CGI use is so great you'd have to go through the movie frame by frame just to get it all. The CGI is just used to enhance the already good story.The soundtrack is outstanding. The music never overwhelms the movie. It fits in perfectly. It's also a great soundtrack to listen to on it's own. It's one of my favorite CDs.Now, no movie is without it's flaws. The rules for the curse seem to change. Like how exactly did Bootstrap Bill get out of the curse? Why does Barbossa die when he's shot before Will drops the coin? It seems that a movie of this size should have had such an important part of the story a little more defined. But unless you really stop and think about it or are just picky like that who cares. Also the last fight scene seems a little tacked on. They just had this huge climatic battle and then they decided to add just one more. It sort of seems like a pistol shot after a cannon blast. It is nice to see Will and Jack working together but after the previous fight it seems to drag the movie on longer than it needs to be. But the movie works anyways.A great movie for everyone to enjoy. Go out and rent this, then go and buy it. You'll love it. A movie you'll never regret seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp,Orlando Bloom,Keira Knightley...a good cast for a good movie!And it has all that is required for a block-buster:funny scenes,adventure...dead people... Moreover,Johnny Depp's performance was flawless like always.But we should ask this question:why doesn't he enjoy playing in block-busters? Seeing this movie is a great opportunity to learn more about pirates...and their code for example.In addition to this,it is perfect for a family reunion in front of the TV,with a bowl of popcorn,of course! In my opinion,this is one of the fewest movies which really deserves a sequel and of course all my comments above will be applied to it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the greatest movies of all time! Johnny Depp gives his best performance in this humorous movie that was inspired by a Disneyland ride, though I didn't really see anything in common, except perhaps the treasure and "dead men tell no tails" bit. *** Spoilers ahead***Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings trilogy) plays William Turner, a blacksmith/ future pirate. Although he says he never will be a pirate, he does some things that prove he is a good pirate. WARNING! There are a few words that I would classify as bad, but you can mute the words if you know where to look. I own the soundtrack to this movie; I highly recommend it for those who love music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Disney Film Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, all I can say is that Disney has finally redeemed themselves. This is the best movie that Disney has ever released in a decade. I am so glad that it is not for kids!!! It is very nice to see a Disney film that is for older audiences. A very refreshing change for Disney. Disney has been very successful with this movie and I think the sequels that they are making for this film will be very successful as well.Anyway, i'll talk about the movie now. This movie was a pleasure to watch. It had everything that makes a movie good. Humor, action, and violence. The action sequences in this film were very enjoyable to watch. My whole family watched this movie together and we all loved it! That's saying a lot because usually my parents hate these kinds of movies. However they had a lot of positive comments about this film. My verdict: This film is very enjoyable to watch and I recommend it to anyone and everyone.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates is the best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies of all time correction this is the best movie of all time.Johnny Depp is genius in this film one of his best roles.With One of the best casts with Johnny ,Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly and Geoffery Rush this film plunges the deep Caribbean with action drama romance and even comedy. That is probably what makes this film so good there isn't just one genre there's several. Also this isn't the classic and very overused Good vs. Evil we have The Black Pearl crew the bad guys then we have Commodore Norringtons navy which is the good guys but kinda are the bad guys also when they are keeping Elizabeth from rescuing will and then we have the crazy crew of captain jack sparrow which are pirates and bad guys to the Royal navy but good guys to the pirates of the black pearl and then we have just Captain Jack Sparrow who we never really know what side hes on.Another thing that makes this movie so incredibly awesome is the hilarious quotes. Jack sparrow is one incredible character hes always funny but serious its to hard to describe he has the most hilarious facial expressions all the time and is never scared but always 3 steps in front of everyone else.I have a friend who had never seen it because she said the previews scared her but i begged her into watching it and now thats all she talks about she bought the cereal she has a countdown for the second and shes just about as obsessed as i am my dance troupe has made our production dance pirates thats how incredibly awesome everything in this movie is!!!!! If you haven't seen this movie you are missing something incredible ! Don't delay go out now and rent it the second one will be out soon July 7th 2006.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent adventure that is highly entertaining, with amazing performances, however it goes on a bit too long. All the characters are fantastic, and the story is awesome if a little overlong, plus Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush are all simply amazing in this. Orlando Bloom surprised my by giving a very good performance, and his chemistry with Keira was on big time, plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when Sparrow and Elizabeth are on the Island, and there both drunk on the rum, then Keira gets rid of it, and Depp's reaction just cracked me up!. Johnny Depp, gives one of my favorite performances of all time as Jack Sparrow,and the sword fight between him and Rush was extremely cool, plus the special effects were great!. I thought the dialog was very clever, and I can't wait for the two sequels! plus it's extremely well made and written as well. All the characters are extremely likable, and the opening is especially cool! plus I loved the ending as well. This is an excellent adventure, that is highly entertaining, with amazing performances, however it goes on a bit too long, still I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Gore Verbinski does an excellent! job here with wonderful camera work, great angles, and plenty of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is amazing!. Johnny Depp is amazing as always and is incredible here, he plays one of my favorite character of all time in Jack Sparrow, was hilarious, extremely likable, wonderfully mysterious, had some of the coolest makeup, and was just tons of fun to watch! (Depp Rules!!!!). Geoffrey Rush is amazing as the evil Barbosa, he was simply chilling, and I loved his accent, he also had some awesome makeup, and had one of the coolest sword fights ever with Depp, he was clearly having a ball, I loved him!. Orlando Bloom is surprisingly very good here, he was likable, had some good scenes with Depp, and didn't annoy me like usual, I dug him. Keira Knightley is incredibly gorgeous, and is amazing here as Elizabeth Swan, she adds charm to her role, had very good chemistry with Bloom, and gives one of her best performances to date! (Knightley Rules!!!!). Jack Davenport is good as the arrogant Norrington, and did his job well. Jonathan Pryce adds comic relief as Elizabeth's father he was funny. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

The story is not different from any other pirates story, it is not really original, but the cast gave another dimension to it, they brought it to another level. Johnny Depp's interpretation is really amazing, you can not not like Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny made this pirate unique when he could have been nothing more than a pirate among others. Plus the battle scenes are really impressive, the photography is amazing and the soundtrack is one the best I have ever heard. I am sure Pirates of the Caribbean will be remembered as one of the best pirates movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Orchestral Score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The music to this movie is very beautiful and greatly added to its success. It is both majestic and somber, but also exhilarating and intense. I was so impressed with the film score that I bought the soundtrack CD. The music is by fellow German Klaus Badelt a friend and contemporary of the excellent film composer Hans Zimmmer (Gladiator)....with numerous musical influences or references to Motzart and Beethoven and others throughout. I also hear the inspiration of another great pirate movie film composer named Eric Korngold who wrote the music to Captain Blood and many others that starred Errol Flynn. I only buy a film score if I feel that the music can stand on its own minus the film. Not all film scores can do this, but the movie music of the top film composers like John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith do hold up quite well on their musical merits.I want our High School band director to do a corps-style marching show based on the music to Pirates of the Caibbean</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates Scores Big Booty at the Box Office!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inspired by Disneyland's classic ride, Pirates of the Caribbean is a film of lovable characters, an eerie underscore, and action-packed plot. The story runs a bit long and becomes slightly tedious to watch towards the end, yet a typical Disney happy-ending saves the day just in time for the viewers to walk away pleased with the movie and secretly wishing they were pirates themselves. The film possesses all the classic characters and scenarios of a romantic Disney adventure, including the young, fate-seeking hero, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the comedic relief and clown, witty Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the uptight straight man, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), and the ruthless villain, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Of course, let us not forget the leading lady, young miss Keira Knightley, playing the governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann.Situated in the British, Caribbean colony of Port Royal, Swann wishes to live the life of a pirate and not a governor's daughter, while her admirer, the impoverished blacksmith, Will Turner, wishes to deny his own pirate roots. Once mischievous Sparrow enters the town with his agenda of rounding up a crew, stealing a British naval ship and retrieving his rights as captain of the Black Pearl pirate ship, havoc ensues. The entrance of the damned Black Pearl's crew into Port Royal is quickly summoned by the last missing piece of treasure, which calls them when Swann falls into the water with it (a gold coin) wrapped around her neck. The pirates sac the town, stealing Swann and headed to return the treasure and break their curse. The chase is on, once Turner springs Sparrow from jail, for the ship and its desired possessions. And that's just the first 20 minutes of this event-filled 2 hour and 23 minute movie. The hero's luck runs out, but just when all hope is lost, Sparrow devises a plan to save his ship, get Will his girl and escape the grips of both the cursed pirates and dim-witted British navy. Filled with an excellent cast and first-rate special effects, Pirates makes it easy to truthfully accept the unbelievably fantastical events of the film including sword fights, pirate ships on the open seas, cannon warfare, and caves of treasure. Director Gore Verbinski brings out the best of his actors, who enable the sometimes-cheesy script to flow smoothly and as convincing dialogue. Depp's typical ability to create a quirky and enchanting character is again fulfilled in his drunken pirate role. He brings out the character's bad luck but determined nature, making him the admirable good/bad guy. Depp's humorous line delivery and outstanding timing nicely accompany his scruff appearance, adorned with eyeliner, a bead-embellished wig, and braided goatee. Rush also performs his role of the evil pirate convincingly and with his usual gifted acting talent. Bloom slips nicely into his usual typecast role as the love-driven romantic young lad, and his opposite, then seventeen-year-old, British actress, Knightley brings the adventurous, bold, and beautiful identity of Swann to life. Though none of these characters exist in the Disney adventure ride, there are two similar scene's that lovers of the ride will recognize, one being the stop at pirate infested Tortuga Island. The storyline does become a bit boring and redundant, as the minutes turn to hours, creating the feeling of déj? vu. Yet, the scheming scoundrel Jack Sparrow saves the day, and the audience's attention only to sacrifice himself to capture by the Royal Navy. Don't worry, though, it all ends well as a good Disney movie should. Along with watching an action-packed, historical fantasy and obtaining some great new words to add to daily jargon, such as 'savvy' 'parlay' 'commandeer' and 'ecumenically,' I somehow feel more complete. And just when that sense of completeness fades, the sequel, promised by the title's saga specificity The Curse of the Black Pearl, will probably be in theatres.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I thought that it would be a normal "adventure movie" I didn't think that this is a comedy. Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those movies that isn't entirely funny but there is a character in it that makes you laugh every time you watch it, and that of course is Captain Jack Sparrow, in this movie. He makes the movie even better than it would have been without him: it had a good plot and good supporting actors playing the other characters in the movie. There isn't that much to say about this movie, just go see it, enjoy it and be ready for a good action/comedy.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie based on a "ride from Disneyland" or something like that. That was the first i ever heard about this movie. Not the best premise for a movie you might say. But i was very pleasantly surprised i must say.The governors daughter gets kidnapped by pirates. Her love-interest and the famous captain Jack Sparrow both set out looking for her. Her love wants her, Sparrow wants the pirate ship.Many have tried to live up to the matiné-classics of old. Or not just them maybe, also more modern classics like the Indiana Jones-movies. But it seems the essence of the adventure-film is hard to capture, considering how many have failed. And the pirate genre especially seems to be treacherous ground. Just think about such catastrophes as "Cutthroat Island". Here though the tradition of adventure, and fun for the whole family, is picked up in an admirable way.There are several elements that make this such a great experience. The acting is solid, especially from Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp who both seem to have a lot of fun here. Orlando Bloom is his rather stiff and bland self, even though it's less evident here than in most cases. Also this movie is very playful. It makes jokes at the genres expense, at almost everyones expense. And foremost it doesn't take itself very seriously. There is quite a bit of violence in the movie (it involves pirates after all), but it's all quite mild and it never disturbs the experience.When it comes to family fun this is one of the best i've seen. Not that i'm a fan of the "family" genre, but still. And the older viewers can always stare at Keira Knightley, and maybe dream that we too could fence, sail and rescue ladies like her... Rating is 8/10 and very recommended!</fullReview>

In Short this film is Well cast and directed, it has great visual effects and is good entertainment, the problem is this, the film simply doesn't have enough story or character development to attain its quest for epic status or justify its length.

		<shortDescription>Piracy on the high seas never looked so good (on DVD)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Borrowing traditional elements from films like CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE SEA HAWK and many other '40 tales of piracy on the high seas, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN goes further than all the other pirate tales by adding strong bits of fantasy that give new meaning to the phrase "a skeleton crew".You'll see what I mean when you watch the moonlight scenes where the cursed pirates become shadows of their former selves--effects that are guaranteed to cop a nomination for the Best Special Effects Oscar. So too are the gorgeously detailed sets and costumes (all of which have an air of accuracy), as well as the make-up wizardry involved in turning these actors into reasonably convincing 17th Century pirates.Standout among the performers, of course, is the central role as played by JOHNNY DEPP as the rogue pirate who teams with ORLANDO BLOOM (who looks like a young Errol Flynn here), a man with pirate blood himself. Their combined efforts to rescue a damsel in distress (nicely played by KEIRA KNIGHTLEY) and search for hidden treasure in a cave while fighting off the villain (GEOFFREY RUSH) is all done in almost comic book style and flair. Everyone seems cast to perfection.Artistically, it's a stunning film to watch, especially on DVD where the images are richly detailed and the mammoth production costs are clearly evident in every frame. Beautifully photographed and with a busy background score that is reminiscent of the kind of rousing music that Erich Wolfgang Korngold composed for the swashbucklers of the past.Summing up: A jolly good show!! A fun ride all the way.Only drawback: its length. Could have been trimmed by at least twenty minutes of running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After years of enjoyable viewing of 21 Jump Street, some of us did not need this movie to appreciate Johnny Depp's talents and abilities as an actor. But for the rest of the world, this was the springboard for Depp's movie career.The movie begins with a hauntingly beautiful child singing of pirates on the misty bow of a ship. She is cautioned not to bring pirates down on them, by singing of them. Just after, a small boy is found floating on a piece of wreckage, and the young girl child immediately identifies him as a pirate, and hides his true nature/identity from her father the Governor and the captain of the ship upon which they sail.You then fade to the same little girl as a grown woman (Keira Knightly), dreaming of the day when she first found her William (Orlando Bloom) adrift in the sea. She's hidden his treasure in a secret compartment beneath one of the drawers in her bedside cabinet, and obviously treasures it, as she does him.The remainder of the movie, she attempts to find herself, discover whom she really is, and please her father at the same time. No easy task of ANY daughter.William has since become an apprentice to the blacksmith of the small seaside village in which they reside. He has learned his lessons so well, in fact, that his master sleeps in a peaceful but drunken slumber all the day while Will masters the work sent to their forge.These two are obviously in love, but Will knows his place, and refuses to be familiar with her in any way, in the presence of her father the Governor. Not quite the way to woo the lady's heart, there, Will.Enters now, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), in a sinking water-filled schooner. He himself bears no small resemblance to a bilge-rat, as he rides the main mast of the sinking ship right up to the harbor of the same village in which Elizabeth and William reside; Port Royal.His shenanigans will not be tolerated, as he soon learns, and he quickly finds himself in irons.We discover that Captain Jack Sparrow was once the captain of the Black Pearl; the most feared pirate's ship to sail the Caribbean Sea. This ship is rumored to have black sails, be crewed by the damned, and captained by an evil darker than any other.There has been some criticism of the vocabulary used by the pirates, but in reality, they did have quite the vocabulary. They had to trade in many different ports, using many different languages fluently in order to prevent themselves from being taken advantage of. These men were mostly self-educated, learning the hard way. And while most could not read and write, true enough, they could and would bargain with anyone which could uplift their situation.They sought fame and riches. Having been heard of was akin to the gunslingers of the US Western days having wanted posters of themselves jealously secreted away within their own saddlebags. They lived by a strict code of ethics, and experienced a very unstable lifestyle; feasting one day, while enduring famine the next.Also, the "mascara" some critics have criticized, was usually Kohl, used commonly by sea-farers of the time to block the sun out of their eyes, much like football players use black stick, today. It does create a rather dramatic look, but was a common technique used in the days of such men as these.This story, while not wholly original, borrowed from every pirate movie I've ever seen, but uplifted and upgraded those old tales. It was extremely well told, convincingly executed, and brilliantly portrayed by Depp and Bloom. I've acquired a new respect for both of their work, of late, actually. And while this does not possess the epic qualities of some other recent productions, Bloom's talents were just as well exercised here as they were in his most recent success.As for the wardrobe of the pirates, they were in the Caribbean; an exotic place, populated by people of colorful cultures. Their dress, while basically British, was properly colored by the islands in which they prowled.Reportedly, having modeled his Jack Sparrow character closely after Keith Richards, Depp's flawless Cockney accent was quite believable and near perfect. He worked very hard on that portion of his character, as was obvious by his beautiful and colorfully wide use of the Cockney hyperbole. "All by me onsie," meaning all by myself, and so on.There was one element with which I had some qualms, however. That of the undead army. Having recently seen LotR: RotK, I could not help but compare the undead armies to one another, and found that this one was a tiny bit lacking. Their movements were sometimes choppy, hesitant, clumsy and not surreal as was Jackson's. These lacked the graceful, floating ghostly quality that was exhibited in Jackson's masterpiece. They ~looked~ real enough, but their movements were awkward and clumsy.Other than that, I was completely delighted with this endeavor, and cannot wait to see the next installment of this franchise. I hope it is a long-running one.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great adventure!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" takes you on an adventure full with sword fights, explosions, bottles of rum and much humor.This certainly is the most fun movie of the year (yet). It's an awesome "feel good" movie. The movie has a very high entertainment value, not only because of the fun story itself but also and mainly because of Johnny Depp. It has been said many times before and it will be said many times again but Depp is fantastic in this movie! His character introduction is priceless! But let's also not forget the perfectly casted Geoffrey Rush who also seemed to have lot's of fun making this movie.The story is one big adventure and it has all the typical pirate adventure elements in it. Added to that there are the cursed ghost pirates and the British marine with as a result an even bigger adventure story. The movie is full with crazy and fun characters and there is some great dialog and much much comedy. In other words, how could you not like this movie?The musical score is awesome, even though you can hear it was done in an hurry. The music uses lot's of elements from previous Media Venture scores such as "Gladiator" and "Black Hawk Down" but it just suits the movie very well and gives it an extra cool feeling.Visually the movie looks simply amazing. The costumes are great and so are the sets. But even better are the special effects, the way the cursed pirates (and monkey) in the moonlight look is amazing.The fights are cool, however I feel that it could have used some more wide shots instead of quick fast cuts. The final fight is amazing mainly because of the special effects where the characters change from their cursed look into their normal human look and back again time after time every time when they step into the moonlight.No Oscar material, just great fun for everyone to watch over and over again! Also very recommendable if you like the "Monkey Island" games.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining yet slightly shallow and formulatic summer blockbuster that only surprises in the acting department</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is your traditional summer blockbuster: it has good special effects, a lot of action, a few pretty faces and not too much of a story. But that is not all. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which usually means that it is very high on the entertaining side and nothing more. Pirates of the Carribean fits that profile almost exactly. It is entertaining (although slightly longish when the cave is visited for the second time), that's for sure, but the makers of this film have succeeded in doing something that I had not yet seen in a summer flick of this magnitude (or maybe I have simply forgotten). They have chosen a cast, that was so superb on the one side, that it almost all of the other actors became mere puppets. Yes folks, I am talking about Johnny Depp. He is just amazing as Jack Sparrow. It is not that he is amazingly funny or something, but he just manages to surprise you over and over again. Then there is the accent and of course not to forget that strange way of movement he has throughout the film. Jack Sparrow might be quirky but he is not ?in your face' quirky and that is something I also liked about that character. Johnny Depp ruled as Jack Sparrow and outshone all but one of his co-stars who became mere puppets in the ?Jack Sparrow Show'. The exception was (of course) Geoffrey Rush, who was very solid and did a good Job as Captain Barbossa. The rest of the cast, well I've said it and I'm not sorry for telling the truth: you acted decent, but in the presence of Mr.Depp you faded into the background.Concluding this review I'd have to say that the acting was the only surprising thing in this film. There are some typical one-liners which either fall flat or which I just do not consider funny (SPOILERS AHEAD), like when the pirate in the cave says: `I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!' (SPOILERS END). This sort of thing simply does not do it for me. Also I thought that I, as a viewer, was not ?involved' deeply enough in the love between Elizabeth and William. Jack Sparrow was just too overwhelming and I feel that the film could have actually done without about everything but Jack Sparrow, without losing it's appeal. This is well made, light-hearted summer entertainment though and not some film you are supposed to think about. Worth watching once, maybe even twice (for seeing Jack Sparrow again most likely), but then it should be left alone.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why's this film rated so good ???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as you can see I've not rated this film bad because there is a few qualities about it such as Johnny Depps acting as the pirate Jack Sparrow is quite comical and the graphics were good too. there was a lot of floors to the film too, a lot of cheesy bad acting is the worst. i just hated some things about it. its well overrated too, to be rated 8.0 on IMDb is a very lucky achievement for this.Orlando Bloom as Will Hunting and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan are also among the cast and do a fairly good job. i do think Johnny Depps acting in this clouds over the other actors, he has done a very good job of this. the action and graphics have a big part to play in this almost epic feature.overall this film does deserve a watch but has been well overrated.... a good thing about the film is that there isn't really anything like this film around. was a good watch.......... 6/10......... j.d Seaton</fullReview>

This is the role that people will remember him for.He improvises the character to wonderful effect and is joined by fun performances from Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Gore Verbinski has proved himself to be adept in the big league and even though the sequels clearly lacked inspiration,the best of his talents are on show here as he allows his Depp to work his magic.The following films have somewhat tarnished the look of this film by being overlong and largely boring but as a standalone pirate adventure film, look no further than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is undoubtedly the best pirate movie of all-time- and this is including the Errol Flynn films.Yes, Johnny Depp does make a better pirate than Errol Flynn as well.Depp is the charm of this movie, which only adds on to a film that has a lot going for it: Disney-ride charm, endearing and classical characters, fantastic shots, courtesy of Jerry Bruckheimer, and an engaging story. Standing on its own, separate from the debated other two pirate films which make a trilogy, 'Curse of the Black Pearl' is a treasure that should last for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my family first got this out, I thought it might be okay. It. Was. Brilliant. It's an interesting plot, but, as you can probably guess, it was Johnny Depp's slightly odd, Keith Richards-based, cunning Jack Sparrow ('scuse me, sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) who steals the show with his madness and classic one-liners.However, this does not mean that Depp was the only good member in the cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley work well together and Geoffrey Rush is his usual excellent and versatile self. Plus, the script was good. It was really nice to see a Pirate movie that's made for the modern-day audience, or even a modern pirate movie at all.I recommend you watch this; it really is a work of genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my single favourite movie in the entire world. I'm serious. Ever since I got it on DVD just a week ago, I've watched it every single day. I'm close to memorizing all the dialogue and I know every shot. As I write this, it's paused on the television in my room.The reason I love this movie so much is mostly the character work. The cursed Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) instills such fear in me, and at the same time, draws a burning sense of pure pity for his plight. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), while a fine lady in all respects, is feisty and vivacious as well. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is a good friend and a fine man, modest and brave.However, the character of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is by far the most excellently played character I've ever seen. You can see deeply into his personality, simply by the motions Mr Depp goes through. It is clear that Jack, while a pirate, is indeed a good man. He is honourable and stands by his word at all times. His main goal in life is simply freedom; all of his crimes were to further that goal. He also dislikes taking away the dignity of his adversaries. He would never commit mutiny or murder for that reason.The one thing I even remotely disliked was Orlando Bloom's wooden acting. He seemed to be only able to deliver his lines in one tone, one personage. It was fine for the first half-hour or so, but after that I was mostly just waiting for his parts to be over and so we could get back to Jack Sparrow's screen time.The score for this movie is absolutely STUNNING. It's filled with powerful strings and strong brass, and it has been soaring through my head ever since the first time I saw this movie.All in all, this is a masterpiece. By all means, I encourage you to see and purchase this amazing film. You will not regret it, I guarantee you of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp and Rush shine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody likes pirates! (Well, not the music industry, but whatever...) Johnny Depp shines as Captain Jack Sparrow, a cleverly klutzy pirate who is in search for the Black Pearl and the crew that mutinied it from him. Leader of the mutineers is Captain Barbossa, a mean dirty pirate with a curse that sends him searching for the pieces of some ancient Aztec gold... and the blood of a good pirate's son.It also involves a side story about that young son (Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom) and the love of his life (Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley), but nobody cares.Honestly, Johnny Depp MADE the movie. His perfect characterization of a quirky swashbuckler is both funny and memorable. His personality and charisma shines from screen to screen as he tries to figure out how to get what he wants when everybody else seems to be against him.Depp by himself, though, would have made for a strained and bad movie indeed. Even a good actor with a good character can be dire and silly in a movie that doesn't compliment them. Thus we have Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa, the driven evil that compliments Depp's Sparrow well. Rush obviously had a lot of fun with the role and it's a real joy to see him, especially when working off of Depp.It also has some pretty good dialog, stuff to make you laugh in between action moments. Very quotable, stuff like, "Where's the rum?" which is bound to stay in fanboy lingo for ages to come.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow who in the first scene is looking to steal a ship because his previous ship was stolen from him. Bloom plays a blacksmith who is in love with Knightley but she is the daughter of the Governor and is asked by a top guard to the governor if she'll marry him. Their is a lot of plot to the movie and at almost two and a half hours the movie doesn't even seem that long. Rush makes a great villain who tried to kill Depp before and Depp is looking for revenge. It's a good movie and i can't wait for the two sequels coming out next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie did everything right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie when it came out. Everyone was talking about the SFX, noone really mentioned the story, so I didn't consider it worth watching in the theatre. However, when a friend borrowed me the DVD, I changed my mind completely.Nowadays, when a movie comes out, it usually falls under at least one of these categories: a) it's made after a book (or a comic), b) it focuses on SFX rather than on storytelling, and c) it belongs to a genre which has been completely exhausted during the last couple years. Now none of these points mean that it is a bad movie, however when at least two points apply, it's mostly bound to be a flick you watch once and then forget about. It was truly refreshing to see a movie which for a change didn't apply to any of these categories.Meanwhile I bought the DVD, and I catch myself watching the movie or parts of it over and over again. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' basically does everything right. It has a gripping, immersing story, a great cast and dedicated crew, great photography and a wonderful musical score. It belongs to a genre which has been nearly extinct in the last years, it has a story which strays from the usual stereotypes, and it uses SFX to make the movie better, not just to show off with latest technology.Johnny Depp is just brilliant in the role of Jack Sparrow, he makes you laugh over and over again. As does Geoffrey Rush, who plays Captain Barbossa. Some of the cast stay a bit pale, like Orlando Bloom, who I think can do better. The SFX blend perfectly into the movie, these skeletons are great. The music is wonderful as well, worth buying the soundtrack. The score is so catchy, I find myself humming or whistling parts of it constantly.This is entertainment at its best. Not an alltime classic, it doesn't have too much of a message, but that wasn't the goal of making it anyway. Worth watching several times, since you discover new details every time. Right now it ranks pretty high in my favourite list. 8/10 stars from me for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp adds needed ingredient</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This easily could have been your run of the mill pirate movie but thank god Johnny Depp is not only a terrific actor but one that adds real "Character" to his characters. Film starts out with a young boy found adrift at sea with a gold medallion around his neck and an old ship which looks like a ghost ship is spotted. Years later the boy Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is working with a blacksmith and in love with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and she is the daughter of Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) who would rather see his daughter marry Cmdr. Norrington (Jack Davenport). One day at port a strange sailor shows up as his small vessel sinks and he is found out to be pirate Jack Sparrow (Depp). They want to hang him but that night the town is attacked by pirates headed by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack has a personal beef with him. Seems as though Jack was the Captain of the ship Black Pearl but the crew performed a mutiny and left Jack on a deserted island which he escaped from. Two of the pirates grab Elizabeth because she has Will's medallion and while questioning her she says her last name is Turner. She discovers during her kidnapping that the pirates are really the walking dead and in the moonlight they appear as rotted cadavers. They think she is related to "Boot Strap" Turner who was a pirate that they killed and they need the blood of his offspring to become human again. Jack and Will steal a ship and go to recruit sailors so they can save Elizabeth and Jack can reap the rewards as well. This film is directed by Gore Verbinski and along with "Mouse Hunt" he demonstrates a real flare for lavish sets and decorum. The sets are terrific here and the special effects are pretty good as well, especially some of the underwater shots looking up at the bottom of the ships. The big problem with this film (Besides being too long) is the script. How many times did Depp get captured by either side and then have to talk his way out? And the romance between Bloom and Knightley is just so cliche. Knightley is particularly dreary. She's a fresh pretty young face but in this film her role could have been performed by any other actress and it would have been the same. She showed much more spark and left an indelible mark in the film "Bend It Like Beckham". Here, she's just a forgettable pretty face. What saves this film is Depp and Rush. Thankfully these two remarkable actors add so much imagination to their roles and they give the film the added flavor it badly needed. Can you imagine this film without them? Depp has stated that he played his role in the nature of a drunken Keith Richards and with the eyeliner he wears its a joy to watch him. Rush also does a good job and with that monkey on his back he seems to be having a good time. Some of the other pirates are played on a comedic level and one that stands out is the pirate with a glass eye. The film doesn't take itself seriously and this attitude works to its advantage. This film came very close to being very routine but with the performances of Depp and Rush they together save it from being predictable and stale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum! That's what I feel like having watched "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"! I have to admit that I don't know any other pirate movies, but this one gives the genre the best possible name. It's mainly due to Johnny Depp's ultra-neat role as swashbuckler Jack Sparrow, but there's other things too.It all begins when a little girl retrieves a medallion from a boy; she doesn't realize just how important this particular medallion is! Several years later, we see that this now grown-up girl is Elizabeth Swann (the ever gorgeous Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. Unfortunately, that's when the pirates led by Capt. Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) storm the town and take Elizabeth hostage.Enter Jack Sparrow and his brave companion Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). These guys may be oddballs, but boy do they know how to fight pirates! Depp based his characterization on Keith Richards (yes, THE Keith Richards), and he plays the role to great effect. "POTC: TCOTBP" is a real treat from beginning to end. Gore Verbinski is proving himself to be a very interesting director, with this movie - plus "Mouse Hunt" and "The Ring" - to his credit. Now that I've seen this movie, I almost might like to try out a little swashbuckling myself. A pirate's life just might be the life for me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie for the second time and decided to write this review. I don't think it's a good idea to write one just after you saw the movie for the first time, because you can be too impressed by the movie and therefore not thinking clearly.The movie is nice, very nice, and I'm sure I will see it multiple times more, but to say »it's the best movie ever« is as ridiculous as the fact that all three movies of the »Lord Of The Rings« trilogy are in the top ten of all times on this site. A great movie, in my opinion, is the one that raises important issues and forces you to think about them and generates strong emotions together with superb acting. So, by definition, I tend to like dramas a lot. I know I can't expect this kind of things in an adventure movie. So, I saw POTC just to have fun and I had a great time. It's a movie which was designed to make a lot of money and entertain the whole family (like Disney's parks), and it did its job perfectly. I can imagine it must be so magical for the kids. Jack Sparrow, brought brilliantly to life by Johnny Depp is so charming and witty. I bet there are children out there arguing at play because everyone wants to be the Captain. Bloom did all right but that's it. I'm kinda romantic guy, so I did like scenes between Orlando and Keira, but I can understand they were very pathetic for some people. She did much better in them, he was basically just staring at her.The story is interesting enough, it has golden treasure, curse and pretty good twists, effects are impressive, movie is also very funny. So, if you are looking for some fun, this is the right choice.</fullReview>

Sword clashing adventure and off beat humor coupled with some very good special effects makes for an interesting escape from the real world. Depp proves himself a master craftsman. What role can't he play? The cast also features Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jonathan Pryce and Damian O'Hare.

		<fullReview>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It is not really great, but every single aspect is terrific and that makes sure you don't see its flaws very easily. One of the flaws is the logic, but in a film like this things are not supposed to be logical, so why bother asking that kind of questions.The story, pretty standard with the usual twists, is actually quite good, or at least good enough to keep our attention. I could tell you about it but I think it would sound too silly; it kind of is. We have stories about a curse and a pirate ship called the Black Pearl with its Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), we have a pirate named Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), we have a young man named Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who loves Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). She loves him too but she is about to marry Norrington (Jack Davenport). Her father is Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce), not the most unimportant person.What curse there is on the Black Pearl you have to see for yourself. Neither am I going to say why the curse is there. Let me just talk about the good stuff. The visual effects are marvelous. Everything looks (and sounds) great. Locations, costumes, makeup. The sword fights and the battles between the English and the pirates are exciting, there is never a moment you are bored.It is not all fighting and visual effects. In the quiet moments we have the most wonderful performance from Johnny Depp. His Jack Sparrow is one of the characters from the movies you are going to remember and the fact that he earned an Oscar nomination for this part says enough. He is so good you almost forget the other actors. Geoffrey Rush comes close to Deppp as the villain Barbossa and actors like Bloom and Knightley play their parts quite well. Unfortunately for them they are always in the shadow of the perfect Depp.There are more good things that make this film entertaining, but I would have to go in detail. I think I have given you enough reasons to see this film (and believe me, Depp alone is reason enough). For a very good time 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black pearl' is as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never believed I was going to enjoy CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL as I stuck it in the DVD player . After all it was produced by Jerry Brukheimer who's only real critically acclaimed film BLACK HAWK DOWN is down more to director Ridley Scott rather than producer Bruckheimer and let's not forget he also produced Armageddon and PEARL HARBOR two of the most obscene wastes of money Hollywood has come up with in recent years . In fact I would have paid good money NOT to have seen either of these films The production team seem to have taken a leaf out of the Peter Jackson book of film making by casting hunks as heroes with Shakespearian trained actors in the supporting roles . The cast are very good . Johhny Depp was atrocious as an English police inspector in FROM HELL but here as Jack Sparrow his camp English accent is entirely in keeping with the tone of the film . It also makes good business sense too , just think of the amount of 20 something woman who'll go to watch Depp play a swashbuckling rogue . Same with Orlando Bloom who's incredibly popular with a teenage girl audience . Keira Knightley ? Yeah she's really fit but like these other much hyped English Roses such as Julia Ormand in LEGENDS OF THE FALL and Kate Winslett in TITANIC I doubt if she'll be a household name many years from now , she is good as the ballsy heroine in this though . The always under rated Jonathon Pryce is slightly disappointing probably because like so many great stage actors he's not very good with camp humour . By an ironic contrast Geoffry Rush gives the best performance as the villain , a performance that may see him get an Oscar nod as best supporting actor There does seem to be a lot of debate as to how well this film will do at the Oscars . I very much doubt if it'll be up for best picture or director ( It is a fantasy film and this genre is always over looked by the academy ) but it does deserve a handful of technical award nominations in the fields of cinematography , editing , sound , costume design and special effects . Unfortunately it's going to be up against RETURN OF THE KING and MASTER AND COMMANDER which means a probable empty treasure chest for these pirates which is a pity ***** SPOILERS *****No review of mine is complete without a few grumpy complaints so here they are : Once again the Brits are shown to be stupid and incompetent but that's Hollywood for you , while there's a serious plot hole at the end where it's revealed that Jack Sparrow has been suffering from the curse all along so how did he manage to stay out of the moonlight without anyone noticing his skeletal state ? And how did he manage to get drunk on rum ?But no matter I liked this movie and I thought I'd I never say this but I hope to see the words " Produced by Jerry Brukheimer " a lot more in the futureUpdate - Sorrymy mistake . Jack wasn't suffering from the curse all along . Thanks to the forty or so people who wrote to me pointing this out</fullReview>

The movie jumps from one topic to the next without any logical sequence. The characters are not properly developed. Keira is excellent, but cannot save this non-product. You expect a pirate movie - not necessarily full of romance, but this film lacks any trace of it. For instance: if you don't love Norrington, who then do you really love? A writer could do better than this. The movie is definitely not based on Disney's P. of the C. Anyone doubting that should go and visit the Real Pirates at Disneyland. I saw some bad movies, but this one beats a lot of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great shallow movie. No pretensions, great action, great jokes, pretty good actors. Directed by the well-known Gore Verbinski (no? not well-known? C'est la vie) and starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, and some woman I forget.Like Tommy Lee Jones, Johnny Depp has pretty much stopped acting and started playing the same role in all his films. (Tommy Lee Jones is now acting like Richard Crenna in Hot Shots! Part Deux or Wrongfully Accused or maybe Rambo IV, I forget.) But I digress. Depp here plays Jack Sparrow beautifully (and famously as Keith Richards), and the film kept me laughing from the opening scene to somewhere near the end.It's a great buddy film, although lacking the ensemble acting of "The Princess Bride." The bad guys are not really bad, the good guys are really, really good, and our hero gets the girl. The special effects are excellent and used to good, uh, effect: creepy when they should be creepy and hilarious when they should be funny. I was sorry when it was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Pirates of the Carrabean is really entertaining. It has a lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of special effects. All the characters are creative. Will Turner, a blacksmith trying to find his childhood friend, Elizabeth Swann, a hot heroine who certainly isn't a Damsall in Distress, and Captain Jack Sparrow, a wity, crazy pirate that can get out of any situation. There are many other characters too, but they would take too long too explain. My only problem with this film is the problem everyone seems to have with the third film, it's hard to follow. So I don't really care, I just watch the action, and effects. If you're one of the six people who haven't seen this movie, buy it on DVD, it's fun, entertaining, and is just plain great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As children everyone liked Disney everybody liked Disneys stories . This one was very impressive and maybe curious . Pirates of Caribbean are bringing some new dimension and the are really entertaining . This is one good classic and I really liked it . Scenes were impressive and they are well made . Whole movie is very adventurous and it is so good . Maybe movie will look like some fairytale but it is so attractive that I wanted to watch and other movies from this serial . Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow had stunning performance . Keira Knightley was also very good but maybe sometimes too childish . Orlando Bloom didn't impress me so much because of his maybe too uninteresting performance . Other characters were looking simply good . This movie in comparison with others is maybe too simply.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, and probably will be, one of my favorite movies. It's fun, the characters are likable, it's light-hearted, and let's face it: there aren't nearly enough pirate movies being made anymore.The plot isn't the most serious of stories ever written, but it wasn't really meant to be. Besides, it works well, and it kept me interested for the two and a half hours it went for, and it's better then a lot of stories I've seen done in movies.When I first saw this movie in the cinemas; I was impressed. Seven years later, watching it on DVD at home, I'm equally impressed now as I was then, though the CGI is a little outdated now (not that it's a problem).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Disney ride becomes a full length theatrical hit that may be as if not more exciting than the ride. Pirates throws you right into the action and never stops.We begin with a young Elizabeth Swann, daughter of Gov.Weatherbee Swann who's ship rescues a young Will Turner from a wrecked ship which was destroyed by our villains which I will mention later. Eight years fly by and Elizabeth and Will are young adults.Elizabeth is set to be engaged with Beckett a side character in this who plays a more important role in the sequels to come. Jack Sparrow makes his "grand" entrance by sailing to Port Royale on a sinking ship, tries to commandeer a new ship, then rescues Elizabeth.After his heroic attempt, it is discovered he is in fact a Pirate and is sentenced to death. That night, the villains seen earlier make their appearance in Port Royale as they are looking for cursed aztec gold which Elizabeth possesses. Believing she is the descendant to Will Turner's father who's blood was needed to undo the curse, she is taken hostage. Will breaks Captain Jack out of jail and they set foot on a journey that takes them to many places and battles. I will not spoil the rest.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is the first in a trilogy of movies based on the Disney ride of the same name. This movie features pretty decent performances from its actors; Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Kiera Knightly. It features some great swashbuckling action but some of the swashbuckling scenes aren't so greatly choreographed which brings me to some flaws of the movie.Captain Barbossa really isn't that menacing of a villain. He is charismatic and charming sometimes wicked even, but he's no Joker, he's no Darth Vader, by far no Hanabal Lector. Sure the scenes were Barbossa and his crew turn into undead pirates are great example of the special effects in this movie, he really isn't a menacing villain and he doesn't have much of an evil plan. This movie is just meant to be fun. It doesn't have a complex plot, its a very simple plot even, but it is just meant to be good ole brainless(well I can't call this completely brainless though) summer fun.Once you see this, you will be wanting to get on this ride again, I promise you. This is definitely one of the best Disney movies in quite sometime due to the declining quality of Disney movies excluding Pixar who has yet to make a bad movie to date. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, despite the flaws I mentioned(the good by far outweighs the bad here), 10 swords out of 10! Coming Soon, my review for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End. Which one will be the best of the three? Find out soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie piracy that really isn't a crime but does have some really bad eggs in it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gore Verbinski directs a movie based on a theme park ride. You could be forgiven for thinking that there wasn't going to be much to enjoy (and to see how horribly wrong things could have gone just watch The Haunted Mansion as a prime example) but you would be very, very wrong.It's all here. Young love flourishing between the governor's daughter ,Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). A young man who takes great pride in his work (Jack Davenport) and looking to make examples of any pirates he may come across. And a bunch of cursed pirates led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who are wanting to lift the curse and regain the pleasures of life they have long since stopped experiencing. Oh, and there's some other pirate chap called Jack Sparrow who's played by a little-known actor called Johnny Depp. Jack wants his ship back from Barbossa and the crew who mutinied against him a long time ago.At a little over two hours long, this movie never feels dull or as if it's overstaying it's welcome. It is, in fact, one of the best all-round pieces of simple entertainment I have seen in years thanks to solid direction, excellent special effects and a script that balances comedy, action, thrills and characterisation superbly. It also has to be said, as it has been said a hundred times before, that Depp's performance elevates the whole thing to another level. Every time he's on screen it's a major bonus and, luckily for viewers, he gets a large share of the screen time.Pirates are a fun subject matter for movies and it's a shame that they have never really been better treated by modern cinema (hey, I enjoyed Cutthroat Island but I know I'm on my own with that one). Well, this movie and it's sequels has finally corrected that. Swashbuckling, ribtickling, goosebump-raising, it has it all and it has it all in spades. Hats off to Verbinski, to the writers and to everyone involved (including the likes of Mackenzie Crook, who I may one day forgive for his appearance in Sex Lives Of The Potato Men thanks to his fun turn in this movie).See this if you like: The Adventures Of Robin Hood, Captain Blood, The Goonies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son." This was mentioned by random raven in his review.I would like to explain the reason why the curse can be broken only by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. The only way to break the curse of the black pearl was to return all the medallions back to the treasure chest of Cortex AND to repay the blood of all those who had stolen the treasure. Under Captain Barbossa, the Black Pearl had been searching for the last medallion (which incidentally, Elizabeth Swann came to possess at the beginning of the movie). Captain Barbossa had killed William Turner (Senior) by strapping him to a canon and firing (hence the nickname "Bootstrap" Turner) BEFORE they felt the curse of the treasure. Once they realized his blood was needed to break the curse, it was too late but they were aware of his son who floated on the water on the night of the mutiny (again, the opening scene). So, since William Turner (Senior) was dead, they needed the blood of his son (Orlando Bloom) to break the curse. The blood of William Turner Sr. flows through the veins of his son WT Jr. Assuming that all the others had repaid their blood debt, the blood of WT Jr. was the last remaining to be repaid and remove the curse.Hope this clears up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time! I never was really into pirates until I saw this movie.Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the most comical characters I've seen! Half-drunk all the time, stumbling around, and charming the ladies, Sparrow is never boring to watch.The chemistry between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is amazing! Kiera Knightly did a fantastic job, and Orlando Bloom was very good too, and very handsome! They were perfect together, I think.The story was very creative and original. It's very piratey and exciting. The special effects are incredible, for the early 2000's. I enjoyed watching the cursed pirates going in and out of the moonlight, changing from normal humans to skeletal undead things. The action sequences kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.This is truly a classic. I'm sure this movie will be remembered for a long long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a fantastic film. I think Johnny Depp got his first Oscar nomination for it. In my opinion, he definitely deserved it. Johnny Depp is mostly the reason why I gave Pirates of the Caribbean such a high rating. Not only is it an amazing film, Johnny Depp and Geoffry Rush make it very interesting. Depp and Rush play Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa, two rival pirates who are still having at it after so many years. Both Rush and Depp are great. The Plot: A medallion needs the blood of William Turner, who's father put the curse on this ship. So Will teams up with the greatest pirate legend, Jack Sparrow, to save his love Elizabeth from the crew and stop the curse. I love Pirates of the Caribbean. I actually love the entire trilogy, though the third film was weakish. The original film was the best without a doubt. The film wasn't a critical success, though it was nominated for five Oscars. Screw critics, Pirates of the Caribbea: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great film, without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, but you have heard of me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crew of the Black Pearl are cursed by something most unimaginable, the only way to lift the curse is to return a lost Aztec coin to its treasure chest home. In the way of them achieving their goal is the British Governor's daughter, the son of Bootstrap Turner, oh and a former comrade by the name of Captain Jack Sparrow who the crew had left to die on an island some time ago.It's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, tho that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn. Into the broth goes romance, comedy and striking adventure, and director Gore Verbinski even manages to give the children watching little slices of horror, not enough to keep them up at night, but enough to bring on an uneasy grin.It's unashamedly commercial, produced by that purveyor of OTT entertainment values, Jerry Bruckheimer, it was to be expected, but few blockbusting movies of the new age can lay claim to being such an out and out reason for having fun, and this this is the reason why Pirates has few peers, it knows its reason for being, it's not taking itself seriously, the audience is not being hoodwinked in any way, it is having fun because so is the film and so is crucially, its impressive cast. Johnny Depp as Sparrow is having the time of his life, basing the character around the dubious mannerisms of Rolling Stone icon, Keith Richards, it works to its highest potential and Depp is simply wonderful in the role. Keira Knightley {perfectly cast}, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce and Mackenzie Crook all do what was asked, which is essentially say your lines right and have a blast with it, it really is that sort of picture.The subsequent sequels would forget what made this first offering so enjoyable, foregoing the outrageous sense of fun for a dark sheen and character development. That is a shame, but at the least we still have this wonderful picture to go back to time and time again, to lift you up when one is down or to keep one happy when one is already in that happy place, The Curse Of The Black Pearl is a joy from start to finish. 9/10</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is at a sheer peak performance as the whizzy 'Captain' Jack Sparrow and one that got him an Oscar nomination for best actor. Depp clearly steals the show and brings down the house with an all amazing performance.It's story is a blessing for this certain genre and thank god Verbinski did it right. He nails it to the point where you wouldn't presume it's a normal story but still treats it in that fashion.But it's the knife-sharp dialogue that plays the real part and Depp unsurprisingly pulls it to the top (Savvey?)Verdict:Pirates of the Carribena: the Curse of the Black Pearl is a pure adventure to watch. Depp at his all time best, unforgettable dialogue and Keira Knightley in a corset. How could you go wrong?*****Classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much from a movie that was made after an amusement park ride, but I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised. This is one of my favorite movies. It has everything. A great cast, a great story, great action, and wonderful visuals. You'll believe you are back in time and living with cutthroats. But wait there's more, you also have a supernatural element that makes this like Lord of the Rings meets Black Beard the pirate. The whole idea seems ridiculous, but with Johnny Depp as CAPTIAN Jack Sparrow, he makes it all work. Too be fare Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is the actual hero of the story, but without a doubt Depp is the star. The movie would not work without him at such a great level. Then there is Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, who is as lovely as she is adventrous. Knightley really is a great actress and her character is essential to the story so she isn't just another pretty girl in an action movie, though undoubtedly she is absolutely beautiful. I won't go into the story since others here have already, but I will say that if you love pirate movies or action movies or comedies or romance or horror movies, this movie has it all and it's all top notch. This is a must see and one of the best in the decade it was made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best pirate movie of all time??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to adventure-type movies, Pirates of the Caribbean takes the cake. With its quirky characters, great storyline, and realistic setting, it's no wonder why it spawned a sequel. So what's this movie about? A pirate, Jack Sparrow, is on an adventure to take back his ship (The Black Pearl) after his nemesis Captain Barbossa stole it from him. Barbossa also kidnaps a woman named Elizabeth. Turns out, Elizabeth has a coin that Barbossa and his crew are after. Meanwhile, a man named Will Turner joins Jack in an attempt to get Elizabeth back home safely. I truly can't think of anything negative about this film (hence the 5 star rating). The first thing I have to point out in terms of what's to like about Pirates of the Caribbean is the actors/characters. I truly feel that each and every actor that was cast in this film was made for the roles they were cast for. From Elizabeth's innocent yet strong personality, to Will's tough yet lovable side, and to Jack's overall silliness, everyone will find something they like about the characters. When it comes to pirate movies, there's only so much you can do with a storyline. So, of course, this movie's storyline has to have something dealing with bad pirates as well as treasure. Although the storyline may seem typical, there's enough twists and turns to keep you watching. Aiding the twists are a generous amount of jokes and humor to keep the whole family entertained. Additionally, the setting and props and costumes are incredibly realistic. So much so that I *wish* I could be there with them. After you watch Pirates of the Caribbean-The Curse of the Black Pearl, you'll be rearing and ready to watch the sequel. I just can't get enough of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp and Rush play 'Pirates'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A charismatic and hilarious performance by Johnny Depp is the icing of the cake in this terrific, if somewhat overrated, summer flick.After all the talks, the publicity and all else in its hype, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN premiered in theaters during its release date with a bang. This is a summer movie with a hype that reaches the moon, but this one actually lives up to it. PIRATES is very long, too long in fact even for a big-budget event film, but for half of its running time, PIRATES is a good ride.Special effects and action scenes galore, the real treat is Johnny Depp, delightful as the drunkenly quire Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who lost his ship, the Black Pearl, to another captain (Geoffrey Rush), who is also curse with eternal damnation when they are damned to walk the earth as undead seafarers. After the crew of the Black Pearl invade the peaceful town of Port Royale and kidnaps the Governor's Daughter Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) aids the help of Sparrow to find her and get her back. Swashbuckling action and a lot of special effects ensues.In fact, so much of these action and effects occupy the entire picture, yet the film does what every summer movie does: more. So much more of the stuff that already is plenty in this film gives us too much of the bargain. Special effects after special effects do get tedious after a while. Still, for a summer movie, PIRATES kept its promise, and, here's the question: Did it live up to the hype? Sure it did. Although imperfect, legions of fans will not be disappointed. Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>typical pirates story, but astonishingly catching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Sparrow is a pirate without ship, the evil Captain Barbosa has stolen the Black Pearl (jack's ship) and he wants to recover it. Qill Turner is a young smith that is in love to Elisabeth Swann, the noble of the island. When she is kidnapped by Barbosa, he and Sparrow will work together (more or less) to defeat the evil Barbosa. This is the curious thing that surprised everybody, it has anything new, special effects are nowadays typical, it should be one senseless unknown film, but it had a great success. Why? Depp's acting as Jack Sparrow was just superb (nomination to Oscar included), he is able to make o charismatic character that all becomes easy when he is by there. Showing us one of the best character presentation in the last years, he is the one who really supports the movie. Rest of characters are correct and charismatic, but it is not SO impressive, this is the main thing of the movie, all actors make a good and catching part. In addition, the special effects are fabulous (as expected in such a expensive-to-make film), it is filled with stupid funny jokes (which you laugh because they are them) and a very confusing plot (who is friend of who??), but the result is funny and absolutely enjoyable.</fullReview>

While many/some have dismissed Johnnys performance here as being gay, I do think his intentions were others! That's not only because he himself said so in an interview (his inspiration being Keith Richards as he said), but also because I saw him as crazy, but genius guy, who was different.But kudos have also to go out to Gore Verbinsky. First of all, for resurrecting the pirate movie "genre" (maybe genre is not the right word, but you get what I mean) and also for sticking to Johnnys decision to play Sparrow the way he did! It's know that the studio didn't want Johnny to play it like that. They were afraid, that Johnny's performance would destroy it at the box office ... quite the opposite happened! Captain Jack Sparrow is the one who saved this thing from drowning (excuse the pun)! If you haven't watched it yet, go out and see it now! A great adventure with a crazy/great guy in the middle of it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The summer of 2003 had this film which came out of nowhere it seemed and took the box office by storm. Nobody gave a film about a Disney ride much of a chance. But through the force of a great story and even better performances, we got a very pleasant surprise.Nothing more to say about Depp that hasn't already been said. He is the force of the film. His "Jack" pushes the film from being a really nice ride to being a great adventure of a film. But praise doesn't end there, Rush, Bloom, Knightly, Davenport and the rest of the supporting cast are absolutely great. The other performances can be lost in the tour-DE-force that Johnny gives with "Jack", but the other players brought their "A" game as well.The effects are fantastic here as is the score. Every element of this film belied the perception that came from the industry and fans waiting on it alike. Who would have known that a film based on a ride would be this good? Verbenski deserves a lot of credit for taking this film serious and not giving audiences what the protractors and doom sayers said would be delivered. Instead he brought back the pirate movie in a huge way. One of the best surprises in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl is without a doubt one of the most fun rides to come along in quite some time. Starting from the Disney ride, the filmmakers have fashioned a good old fashioned pirate romp that combines action, adventure and comedy almost perfectly. Johnny Depp stars as Captain Jack Sparrow, a flamboyant pirate searching for the ship that was stolen out from under him when his crew mutinied. First off, this film belongs to Depp. His performance is s near perfect that it is almost divine. He brings such a character to Sparrow that you can't help but love him even though he is a pirate. Starring as the new captain of the titular pirate ship is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He is truly the evil pirate that you love to hate and if anyone comes close to Depp's performance it is Rush. Rounding out the main cast are Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. While they try, they are just not in the same league as their more esteemed co-stars. Still, Pirates is good fun and a throwback to the old days of cinema. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney more than redeems themselves after the mediocre "Country Bears" and "The Haunted Mansion"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that, personally, The Haunted Mansion has always been my favorite Disney ride and I was quite excited when they announced the making of a film based on it. Sadly, instead of a spooky good time we got an effects and cliché-ridden comedy that is only good to watch when there's nothing else good on. After the failures of both "Country Bears" and "The Haunted Mansion" at the box office, it seemed only natural that the announcement of a film based on the popular Pirates of the Caribbean ride be met with a lot of negative feedback. But instead of being just another waste of our precious time, this 2 hour + adventure turned out to be a slam dunk.Pros: Spirited performances from all involved, especially Johnny Depp who earned an Academy Award nomination. Aside from a few slow spots, the film moves along nicely. A great, pulse-pounding score. A great sense of humor. Top-notch special and visual effects. Breathtaking scenery. Some very exciting and well-choreographed action and sword fighting sequences. Excellent costume and production design. A few good nods to the ride.Cons: The pace does drag in a few spots. It's also a tad overlong and could have been trimmed down a little. If you've seen a lot of pirate movies before this one you might not find a lot of new things, but don't let that ruin the experience because a lack of originality isn't always such a negative thing.Final thoughts: As I said before not everyone was thrilled with the project happening, but despite that it went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide and has spawned two sequels and tons of merchandise. Now if that's not a success, then I don't know what is.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Best Movie Ever Based on a Theme-Park Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, which was based on a popular theme-park ride at Disneyland, came out about four years ago now and was really not expected to do very well. However it managed to become one of the major box-office hits of 2003.Set, presumably sometime in the 18th Century, the film depicts the Caribbean port town of Port Royal attacked by pirates, who kidnap the daughter (Keira Knightley) of the town's governor. Of course, the local apprentice blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) determines to save her with the help of flamboyant pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).The film mixes action, adventure and fantasy into a very entertaining whole. The film is very well-made with some superb special effects and production design, it's also fairly well-acted especially Johnny Depp successfully blending ridiculousness and heroism as Captain Jack Sparrow. it manages to balance the humour and action pretty well, for the most part, although the film is at times overlong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best. If you like boring pointless movies this is not the movie for you. Curse of the black pearl is an awesome film full of humor, the acting is incredibly well done and the cgi for the moonlight effect is just spectacular. Johnny Depp really gets into the character of Jack Sparrow, to his rocking boat walk to his slurring speech, I can't imagine Jack Sparrow any other way. The story is also very well done, pirates cursed for an eternity unless they return all the coins and blood of those who stole from the treasures of Cortez, and ironically Jack was saved from this cruel unrelenting fate by being betrayed and abandoned, and by killing bootstrap bill turner they got rid of the coin and blood they so desperately needed. Overall this movie is by far the best movie in modern times, filled with action, comedy, suspense and enough twists to keep you entertained but not enough to confuse you out of your mind, want to see a good movie, this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A resounding live action comeback for Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Walt Disney's death,the Disney company has continued to produce films that can be considered classic,but the majority of those films are animated and you know what they are.As far as their live action films,there has been a steady decline in quality over the last thirty years.In Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl,we have what we can safely call a resounding comeback for the Disney company in the live action department.it is a virtual retelling of a classic Disney story,but it is nonetheless appealing.Johnny Depp exudes an inescapable charm as Captain Jack Sparrow,and a lot has to do with him shaping the character after a certain Rolling Stone band member.The remaining cast,Keira Knightley (who is nothing short of lovely here),Orlando Bloom,Geoffrey Rush,as well as the countless others play off of Depp very well.The cast,the action,the humor,and overall storytelling are outstanding.I would not recommend it for smaller children,as it can be somewhat violent in places,but you and your older children will have a good time with it.Walt Disney would be pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely am in love with Johnny Depp and this movie. This man is so unbelievably HOT. I've seen so many of his movies and he is a brilliant actor. The way he captures his character as a drunk pirate, a good guy one moment bad guy the next, just amazes me. He is the ONLY person on EARTH that could fit this role... he is perfect! OH, and did I mention how incredibly gorgeous he is. WOW. I have been in love with him for SO long, and he just keeps getting hotter as years pass. I can't get enough of Pirates one and two. I have both movies on my iPod and I watch them constantly. I know everything there is to know about these two movies. Go ahead, ask me anything. I cannot wait until the next one comes out, it is going to be so incredibly amazing. I can't express my love enough. The writers did and excellent job (I love Disney movies) and the actors did just as good (especially Johnny). I love it! It is so sexy the way he talks. I love it when he says "Welcome to the Caribbean love." Ohh la la! His body movements and facial expressions are picture perfect and no one could have done it better. I think I am head over heels in love. Every girl is in love with some actor and Johnny is the one for me. And he is just SO SO SO SO INCREDIBLE Forever and ever BABE</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that POTC is a very good movie if you are looking for a good laugh. The antics of Captain Jack Sparrow are hilarious, as are the antics of the two "dumb" pirates. The costumes are fantastic, as are the sets. The plot may be a little campy, but it adds to the fun. A great movie to see with kids, the MPAA rating is a bit higher than it probably should be. This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time, and the writers did an excellent job keeping the plot moving along. The movie is quite long, but it flies by. After watching this, I couldn't' wait to enter the world of Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann once more. There are also many inside jokes from the Disney World attraction present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the best movies Johhny Depp has been in, showing a new side of himself as a drunken, self centered, and very determined pirate. He, Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom travel all over the Caribbean. Though Orlando Bloom never shows any emotions (as usual), this is still an incredible movies that you'll want to watch again and again. The action and suspense never stops, with Keira Knightly's screaming. This Disney movie is the first to be rated PG-13, so it's got to good, and there's no singing in weird dances involved in this Disney classic. Just drinking, guns firing, swearing, and my personal favorite, suffication by corset</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. It mostly centers around 'Captain' Jack Sparrow, who is obsessed with rum and is as crazy as they come. He also has his good and bad parts (like a Han Solo from an alternate dimension :-D), courageous and selfless blacksmith Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful daughter of Governor Swann. Captain Barbossa was an excellent villain, the kind of person you love to hate. Pintel and Ragetti also added a fair share of comedy relief to the movie, especially Ragetti. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys pirate movies. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. Also, be sure to stick around after the end credits for an additional scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film for all ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I was hesitant to see this movie because the idea sounded a bit childish, but upon seeing the commercials, I was hooked, and even taped one during a show just because it looked interesting to me. I waited until the movie was released on DVD before watching it and I sorely regret it!! After viewing ten minutes of the film I was hooked and rented the movie that very night. I then went on to watching it again and again, even renting the movie a second time just so I could watch it more.Johnny Depp is brilliant as daft Captain Jack. It is obvious that he truly enjoyed the character. His acting steals the show, even though the film is based around Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Geoffrey Rush is equally hilarious and evil as the undead Barbossa. Kevin McNally is thoroughly enjoyable as the older salt Joshamee Gibbs; the superstitious, story-telling pirate that Jack Sparrow visits in Tortuga.I truly believe anyone with a creative imagination will have a lot of fun with this movie. It takes you out of reality and throws you into a thrilling dreamworld with pirates, sea-faring, a love story, and hilarity.</fullReview>

The drunken pirate Jack sparrow played by Johnny Depp is exciting to watch and you feel at ease from the outset of the film. I also think that the sexy Kiera Knightley was fantastic and played a very convincing role as Elizabeth Swann.Captain Jack Sparrow's idyllic pirate life capsized after his former first mate, the wily Captain Barbossa mutinied and commandeered Jack's ship, the Black Pearl and Captain Jack will do anything to get it back.I've always believed that top actors make top films and this film reinforces this point.Fantastic deserves nothing lower than 10/10.

		<fullReview>When my family first watched Pirates of the Caribbean at the theater, we weren't expecting anything great. In fact, we fervently believed that it would be terrible. The commercial looked awful and the fact that it was modeled after a Disney THEME PARK RIDE almost guaranteed a flop. Boy were we wrong.*SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD, BUT NOTHING BIG*Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible movie and an amazing achievement in cinema work. It combines the best of every genre and has something for everybody. I laughed my butt of when I watched this movie during its many comedic scenes, and I nearly screamed during the skeletal attack on the British ship. The action sequences are many and excellent, such as the thrilling sword fight between Bloom and Depp and the sea battle between the Black Pearl and the Interceptor. The love affair between Bloom and Nightly wasn't the movie's best part, but it won't make you cringe like Attack of the Clones' love scenes.Special effects wise, POTC is very good. The skeletons are quite disturbing and the battle scenes are extremely well done. POTC doesn't set any standard for movies, but it still looks excellent.The cast is absolutely stellar. Bloom and Nightly do very admirably and could easily be related to. The support actors are great, particularly the stuck-up British commodore and captain Barbossa. But Depp really makes this movie shine. He delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as captain Jack Sparrow, a hilarious, daring and enigmatic figure with a strangely feminine attitude. The fact that he didn't win an Oscar for this one is a sure sign of the coming Armageddon.Bottom line, Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best movies in history. It will blow you out of your seat and make you laugh until you throw up and is great for the whole family.15 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch this film without knowing anything about it, except that my brother said it's some sort of historical fantasy about pirates: And I'm pleasantly surprised. I fell in love with the Jack Sparrow character right away at the start even though I didn't know yet if he's a baddie or not.Another surprise is the minimal amount of blood and gory (considering this is a pirates movie), and instead I get plenty of laughs. I only like funny movies only when the actors look and talk seriously but actually acting funny (do you get what I mean?), and this is that kind of movie.The story have plenty of twists so sitting for more than 2 hours didn't bother me at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie flat out rocks. It has all the elements of a great blockbuster. This is what a summer movie is supposed to be about. Tons of comedy, action, and enough light-hearted fun. Johnny Depp is unforgettable as strange Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow has got to be one of the best and most original characters ever created. Geoffrey Rush is good bringing teeth-gnashing to an utmost evil yet playful pirate. Having Depp and Rush on the screen provides most of the films energy, which is more than enough. Orlando Bloom is fine in a light part, and Keira Knightley just plain enjoys herself as Elizabeth. The cinematography and special effects are remarkable. They are all convincing and entertaining. When matched with Klaus Badelts score scenes like the first time we see the sailors in full skeletal display take on an eerily lifelike quality thats unlike anything I have ever seen before. Just go out and get it. Turn your brain off for two and half hours and just enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

I would also have to say that the roles of the villains are also amazing, with spectacular make ups, which creates good imageries of pirates. The visual and special effects throughout the entire movie are also great.

The plot is a little contrived, based as it is on the ride of the same name at DisneyLand. That said it is thoroughly entertaining. Johnny Depp is unsurpassable as Captain Jack Sparrow and basically makes the film.The storyline is essentially a rite of passage for all three main characters - Sparrow, Will Turner (Olrando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), who work their way to a secret island burgeoning with treasure to break an Inca curse inflicted when the crew of the Black Pearl took Inca gold and spent it for their pleasure. After collecting all but one piece the crew of the Black Swan encounter Miss Swann who holds the remaining piece.After all sorts of complications the inevitable conclusion occurs with the curse broken and a number of potential plot lines left open for a sequel.This film stands on its own as a classic, any sequel will have a lot to stand up to.</fullReview>

It is funny and easily keeps you interested and despite its long runtime (more than 2 hours) it is never boring."Pirates of the Caribbean" is a very ironic movie which uses almost every pirate cliché there is. It parodies action movies with great self-mockery. Some lines and scenes are hilarious and the plot is creative. A very well written adventure, with twists and turns, and with memorable lines and characters. (love the theme music) I loved the character of Captain Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp who gives a brilliant performance. Keira Knightley also does a fine job. However, I did not like Will Turner, the character played by Orlando Bloom. I'm not sure if it is Bloom's performance and the way he says his lines that annoys me or if it is the lines themselves that do. He has some really cheesy lines.Funny and entertaining comedy/adventure movie. Honestly! **** 8.0/10 ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS Of The Black Pearl* I had heard of POTC: Curse Of The Black Pearl when it first came out, but it sounded cheesy, and I never liked pirate movies, so I gave it a miss.But 3 years later, after having heard everybody singing its praises and taking the chance as it was going to be aired on TV, I recorded it, and watched it.I had to rethink my opinion of the movie, since I found it great.The story? The story is based on these Pirates who happen to be cursed because they robbed a treasure which had been cursed by Maya Gods, and they want to get rid of the curse.To do that they need the blood of a pirate, not just any pirate but the son of legendary pirate Bill Turner (who Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) killed because he had opposed to Barbossa's mutiny from Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), right before finding out they needed his blood to get rid of the curse) - William Turner (Orlando Bloom).Mistaken for Bill Turner's child the pirates capture Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the daughter of the Governor, who said her surname was Turner because she was in love with young Will, and take her hostage, while William teams up with a Rogue pirate, who is none other than Jack Sparrow, who is on a streak for revenge against Barbossa (can you blame him?). In the meanwhile they are all being chased by the British fleet.Will the curse be broken? Will Jack Sparrow manage to get back his ship, the 'Black Pearl'? Will Elizabeth and Will get together? All I can say is that great fun will be had by all.Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl: 9/10.</fullReview>

In fact, the acting was so good, it couldn't get any better! The special effects were spectacular. The make-up was awesome. The editing, the music, the story, everything was just fantastic! Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer definitely did a good job on producing this film! Not only was this movie totally filled with action, but there was a lot of humor in it, too. Johnny Depp did a great job with the acting and the funny humor and the hilarious disgusted or happy facial features. You'll have to see the film to get what I mean with the whole facial feature thing.Anyway, I recommend not letting any child under the age of 8 to see this film. There are a lot of scary images of rotting flesh and undead corpses.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl definitely deserves a 10 out of 10 starts.

		<shortDescription>Walt Disney's Classical Films since "Mary Poppins"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, is one of the action and adventure films I ever saw. Orlando Bloom's performance as Will Turner is great, and Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow is brilliance. This film is like taken over by Johnny Depp and his character Jack Sparrow. He'll make you laugh with his hilarious, NOT Mediocre, jokes. He'll take adventure to the next level. This film should be seen with the family unless you don't want your children to see scary, frightening moments in the film. This film is still one of the most classical Disney films since "Marry Poppins", "Peter Pan", "Beauty and the Beast", and "Snow White". This film will make you laugh and make you guess what's going to jump out of the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word: great. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is the best Disney film I have ever seen.The story was somewhat complex and contained less action than I had hoped for, but turned out to still be good. Johnny Depp played the fantastic Jack Sparrow (that's Captain Jack Sparrow!)a pirate who loves his ship and his rum! With the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), he must fight captain Barbossa, the owner of his ship, and save Elizabeth Swann from his cursed hands! The movie is a little bit scary for children, but it contains great humor, great action and a great story. Disney has finally proved that it can create an amazing film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is masterpiece. Jonny Depp is just the best pirate there could have been. He is witty, slightly charming and a ferocious sword fighter. This is a film for all ages and all ages would enjoy it! It has the lot: Sword fights, an evil pirate captain, treasure and a terrible curse. Orlando Bloom is a good choice for a shy, handsome, young blacksmith, who falls for the governor's beautiful daughter (Keria Knightly), who is eyed by the more respected Comodor Norrington (Jack Davenport). This is ideal for family entertainment. A funny, exiting and enjoyable film10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My very favorite movie!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am absolutely in love with this movie!!! I love everything about it!!! Before I first watched it, I was skeptical. I thought, 'What kind of a movie is this?' I originally thought it was going to be the kind of movie that Disney intended it to be. You know with all the swashbuckling pirates and nonsense like that. But oh boy was I wrong. When I first watched it, I immediately fell in love with it! I loved Johnny Depp as *Captain* Jack Sparrow even thought at that time, I was in love with Orlando Bloom! I instantly became obsessed with that movie and everything about it! And now, a few years later, I am still completely obsessed with it, but I have also picked up an obsession with the ever-so-amazing, Johnny Depp. Now that the second movie has come out, I am going to see it as many times as possible. I am absolutely amazed by all of the sword fights in those movies and also how amazingly believable Johnny Depp is as Captain Jack. I found it remarkable that he pretty much created that character! This movie is so amazing!! So amazing, that, in fact, I watch it every single day! I am now in love with Pirates II! And i'm pretty sure that when the 3rd movie comes out in summer '07, that I will be completely obsessed with it too!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was great. My favorite characters in order are....Will, Elizibeth, and then Jack. I loved Will he was really cute and nice as well as a little funny(Orlando Boom),Jack was really funny and gross but still.....weird(Johny Deep),and Elizibeth was great and sweet and gorgeous yet very proper(Kira Knightly). I really liked the part where Will got hit on the head by the pirate with the glass. The whole movie was really good. I cant wait to see the second. I think Will will come out of his shell a little bit, Jack will get funnier, and Elizibeth will get taught sword fitting. I just hope they make the movie series all the way up to 7, Mab even more than that. I'm truly it's biggest fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining blockbuster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean tells the story of a group of cursed pirates who kidnap the governor's daughter and take her aboard a ship called The Black Pearl. The woman's young suitor, Will Turner, teams up with the flamboyant Captain Jack Sparrow, the rightful owner of the Black Pearl so they can both retrieve what is rightfully theirs. A journey filled with action and adventure unfolds, and along with it, one of the most entertaining films of 2003.What fascinates me the most about this movie is how great it is, and how much of a success it is, and it's based off a ride at Disneyworld! The first movie based off a Disney ride, The Tower of Terror, was a TV movie with Steve Guttenberg. The three that followed, Mission to Mars, The Country Bears, and The Haunted Mansion, were all flops. When I heard about the Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I wasn't very excited. After seeing it however, I was blown away. The movie is a visual stunner. The special effects are awesome, and the set pieces are some of the most amazing things I've seen on film. The dialogue is witty, with a few jokes meant to go over the little ones' heads. Not only that, but they actually managed to get a great story out of it.The acting is amazing. I was never a fan of Orlando Bloom, but he does well in this movie. I really enjoyed Geoffry Rush as the evil Captain Barbossa. As always, Johnny Depp proves with a knockout performance that he can play any role he wants, however he wants, and it will be great.Overall, this is an amazingly entertaining film, perfect for all ages. I recommend it to everybody.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS TO BLACK PEARL BUT DOES HAVE A SPOILER FOR DEAD MANS CHEST!! Read if your bored....long story To start of, i don't start my own threads so i hope this is the right thing...haha well anyways, i'd like to share a (what i find to be a very funny story) of what me and a friend and my brother did in celebration to Dead mans Chest. It was about a week before July 7th, i suppose and we were all very excited and wanted to do something to celebrate, but as we were camping there wasn't much to do. So, what we did do, was pulled up a long log that was fairly thick and named it the Black Pearl. From there, we sat on the log (in the water) and paddled it out for almost 1Km. Soon it became dark and freezing cold and we weren't thinking straight.As we realized we could die (we were sooo tired and cold) we began waving at speedboats that passed. Finally, after an hour and half, a boat picked us up. And so, yes it really happened, i abandoned the Black Pearl just like Jack meant to do. I almost cried. It was very funny though. So yeah, my dad gave us hell when we got back, but it was a good laugh and we gave Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Mans Chest a life threatening expedition in its name. Hope you enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One pirates life for me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie based upon a Disney theme-park ride? The day I see that would be? well, now; Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, takes the world of swashbuckling pirates, from a theme park ride as I have stated, wraps in some humour, and produces one of the best films to grace the silver screen.Pirates of the Caribbean is about the rescue of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa, the captain of The Black Pearl. To her rescue is Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who recruits the help of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together they set after Barbosa and his crew only to discover that they are undergoing a curse, which keeps them alive forever. From beginning to end, Pirates of the Caribbean is a roller-coaster ride of laughter. There is never a joke misplaced, and it sure makes one's views of the world of pirates, far more entertaining. Fighting sequences never detract from the comedy, as there are a couple instances of humour within battle. This humour is brought to the table, most of the time, by Depp's awesome portrayal of the ingenious, yet bizarre Jack Sparrow. All other actors bring immense life to their characters, and what you get is a film where acting is at its best. However, all is not well: the length of the film is questionable, as it appears to drag on for far too long then it ought to. This is sadly due to some bad editing. There are one or two scenes which weren't required in the final cut, and almost every other scene is exposed for being a few seconds too long. While some perfect editing wouldn't cut the length of the film where one would notice, it would make for some faster pacing. Perhaps the editing division was given a little more freedom then expected, and is something which should be tightened up upon in the future.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is successful on many levels that other films are not. It's not going to be the best film of our time, but will surely go down as one of the most entertaining. Comedy is carefully placed amongst times of story development and times of battle. Many will easily be reciting their favourite parts over and over again. However, due to some lazy editing, the film seems too long, but it's not a problem to get yourself tied into a knot over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Entertainement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was great to see Jonny Deep back playing the sexy and mischievous character of Jack Sparrow. I did think at times the humorous lines were lacking a little enthusiasm when played, but Jonny still put them across nicely with his expressions (with those wonderful mascaraed eyes!) The introduction of sea-creatures as characters was a coup d'etat in the real sense of adventure into the unknown. It reminded me of my childhood stories when you longed for the unknown or unrealistic things to happen and wanted to travel to those far off lands... (like flying on the magic carpet with Aladdin) to the point where these adventure nearly seemed real. Then the climax at the end when Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) entered, you new your adventures were going to continue into the next episode. An entertaining film for the whole family...without the killings, swearing and overdone explosions !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is so unfortunate this movie releases alongside LOTR. Otherwise it was bound to snatch up many many awards. Black Pearl, is in all respect a classic. A super super movie, coupled with Johnny Depp's massive skills, it is just mind blowing. Its a pity that a actor of his caliber hasn't got an Academy Award in his belt. I though expect that it wont be far away.The movie brings up many legendary facts, which makes it so fascinating to watch. Instances which speak of the secret Pirates Code known to none but the pirates themselves, and curses that the pirates suffer under the consequences of trying to steal a cursed treasure and lastly treachery. The movie fills you end to end with excitement. Johnny Depp is the evergreen Captain Jack Sparrow, probably the most unfortunate pirate in history, because of his ill luck, with which he always ends up loses his ship. But no one knew about his colorful past, when he was the captain of the most feared pirate ships in history, The Black Pearl. Even lesser knows of his consequences, where he was left stranded on an unhabitated island with a pistol loaded with a single bullet. He escaped by making ropes with his own hair, and he comes back to take back his ship, the Black Pearl. And with some help from young Will Turner and the aristocrat daughter of the ambassador Miss Elizabeth Swann, he succeeds in killing Captain Barbossa, and evading capture by the British army.The movie is extremely well done, with a superb plot, superb direction, superb screen play, and some excellent on screen performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. He really does deserve some special recognition. Klaus Badelt does a good job with the music, and with some pretty neat visual effects. This is just a movie which you cannot afford missing.8/10 !!!</fullReview>

You couldn't have asked for a better movie in all of the world. This movie was made for the Duo, It is the perfect Movie! I love Pirates!!(in at least this movie) It had the perfect ending to, everything was finished, I can't reveal to much or you will know what happens. EVERYONE DIES!! just kidding. But it really is the best ever movie and you should really watch it. I have seen it about a million times and I am able to quote along with this movie, and still things surprise me. The smallest things are hidden in there that you never see until the fifth or sixth time watching it. You'll want to watch it again and again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a true, memorable summer blockbuster than MUSN'T be missed!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Johnny Depp was amazing in this movie. He totally deserved his Acadamy Award nomination. But credit must also go to the two other costars of this movie: Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom. They also delivered amazing performances, considering that Keira Knightly was only 18 when she got the role and Orlando Bloom had just started his movie career a few years previously. The three actors, as well as pretty much every single supporting actor and actress, gave totally believable performances.Also to be credited is the absolutely wonderful screenplay. It's full of foreshadowing that really binds the movie together and helps every part make perfect sense. True, there is the fact that the pirates under the curse aren't supposed to feel anything, yet they still react to hot coals being poured on their heads and stuff like that. But that can be explained away with a little imagination, and it was pretty much the only notable mistake in the movie. Otherwise, the script is very effective and full of little subplots and extra tidbits that make a movie so fun to watch a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. time.I am very sad that this movie didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations. I didn't quite expect Johnny Depp to win, because his nomination was so much of a surprise in itself. But the other nominations (sound, sound editing, visual effects), and makeup were totally deserved, and it makes me cry to realize that it didn't stand a chance when going up against LOTR. If it had been another year, it would have most certainly won at least a few of those awards. Oh well.In closing: this movie is bound to be a classic. It has romance, adventure, scary moments, sweet moments, great visual effects, great music, and great everything-else-that-makes-a-movie-fun-to-see. DON'T MISS IT!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Praises not Curses on the Black Pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favorite movies. I forgot how much I truly loved it until I watched it again to prep myself for the sequel. Here are a few reasons why it is a such a great movie: 1. Original - A lot should be said for original movies. One of the things which makes this movie so great is that it is an original movie. In this generation of re-makes, comics turned movies, real-life stories turned movies, it is wonderful to be able to watch an original piece of work which is different from others you may pull off the shelf.2. Good mix of genres - This movie is an action movie which uses wonderful humor, and yet also has a sort of sci-fi feel to it, with dramatic undertones. This is a difficult task for movies to accomplish, and the people who worked on this movie did a wonderful job of it. I think they used appropriate amounts of humor and drama mixed with a lot of action to keep you involved at every emotional level.3. Great acting - Johnny Depp is my favorite actor. He has an amazing ability to transform into his character. In this movie, he displays this ability to us yet once again. It's like you forget Johnny Depp is in the movie and you think that Capt. Jack Sparrow is a real individual. Some people I have spoken with thought he was a little over the top, but it was his extreme acting that helped make this movie such a success. When you mix in the attractive, well-acting Keira Knightley (who looks stunning in this movie) and the superb acting of Orlando Bloom (I'm becoming a big fan of his) and Geoffrey Rush, you have a melting pot of great acting.4. Fun story - Sure there may be a hole or two in the story, but if you look hard enough, you'll find some in every movie. That being said, this was an amazingly fun story. I could not help but to be entertained as the story moved along. I didn't want the story to end, and thanks to the second and third movies coming out, it won't! 5. Clean - There are not many clean movies made anymore. It's nice to have a great movie which has no language issues or sensual scenes. This is almost impossible to find these days. This movie is proof that you can make a great, clean movie for both adults and children (if they don't get spooked easily) to enjoy.I could add some more items, but these 5 should be enough to show why this was such an excellent movie. I can only hope that the second and third ones match up to the standards which the first one has set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Epic of all Pirate films...brilliant, a classic for certain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean I think came as a surprise to a lot of people. Had Hollywood gone too far...basing a film on an amusement park ride??!! Slapping a 150 million dollar budget on it and putting huge stars in the mix?? Well it wasn't a mistake and Disney knocked one out of the park with this incredible swashbuckling adventure that completely invigorates the "Pirate" film, not that I can think of any others at the moment. Pirates is possibly one of the greatest adventure films I've ever sat through. Completely unashamed of it's 2 1/2 hour time frame and although still to this die hyped as a kids movie it's pretty brutally violent at times with freaky undead pirates and plenty of sword play and guns blazing. Director Gore Verbinski creates this entire Caribbean world with all this legend and lore and it just draws you into it's people and places and the adventure ahead of them. It is non stop adventure!! On top of all this is a guaranteed cinema classic character...the one, the only Oscar Nominated performance of Captain Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. How can you sum up Captain Jack Sparrow, he's an anti-hero...not quite a good guy, tries very hard to be a bad guy but also has a very high moral standard according to the Pirate Code. One of the great lines in the film is when they think Jack is screwing up an attempt at stealing a ship and a naval office comments "That has to be the worst pirate I've ever seen.." and then tides change and they realize Jack has duped them and taken off with their ship and the same officer exclaims moments later "That has to be the best Pirate I've ever seen.." Depp brings the character of Sparrow to life in a way I've rarely seen. Jack Sparrow is a brilliant, vibrant, fun, hilarious, tough hero with such a unique personality. If for no other reason he makes this film and Depp IS Sparrow and deserved that Oscar nod for this. Orlando Bloom is the young handsome swashbuckler/blacksmith who gets involved in this adventure over the love of a woman. Bloom plays young William Turner who doesn't realize he is the son of a famous Pirate. Bloom who I often find rather drab and low brow seems to make that work for him in many roles and this is no exception. He still manages to be subtly vibrant and him and Depp play such an incredible duo playing off each other in action scenes and comedy all at once. This is the pirate version of a buddy cop movie and Bloom and Depp are perfect together. Bloom's performance is in many ways the exact opposite of Depp's Sparrow and it works wonderfully. He is the perfect hero...handsome, in love, quiet and strong. Keira Knightley is the lovely Elizabeth Swann, daughter of the Governor and a bit of a dreamer when it comes to adventure and pirates. Secretly in love with William Turner she is being promised to another man who is a "better match." Knightley is terrific as Swann because she is as strong a character as any of the male leads. She holds her own against all of them and her character is feisty, strong and holds her own in battle. She does all this while still appearing lady like as to the time of the film. The absolutely phenomenal Geoffrey Rush plays Captain Barbossa, Jack Sparrow's brutally evil nemesis who has stole his ship and crew from him but has been cursed by a treasure. Barbossa is Captain Hook with a shot of evil in him. He's brutal and convincing and Rush is brilliant. Him and Depp have terrific chemistry as enemies and he is a great adversary and probably one of the best movie villains of all time.The chemistry and performance between these four actors make this film as brilliant as it could be. Add into that an absolutely stunning story and script that mixes true action with laugh out loud comedy, physical stunts and special effects. Being a huge anti-fan of CGI I was a little disappointed with the hokey look of the undead Pirate Crew, I think they could have done more with good old fashion special effects. The crew looks clunky and fake when they are CGI'd out but even still it doesn't ruin the film by any means. Adults will love this just as much as kids if kids should even see it. There is plenty of the good guys specifically the English Navy who die at the hands of pirates and the pirates are pretty brutal as well and there are some really creepy scenes and I think adults will love this one!! Don't let the Disney stamp scare you away because you can't get adventure better then this one...I guarantee it...savvy?? 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Pirates of the Caribbean trailers first started showing, it looked like a good, fun, pirate movie. Nothing incredibly special, but still a nice looking movie. After all, everyone loves pirates ;) But after seeing it, you realize it IS incredibly special, an unbelievably entertaining, exciting, suspenseful, action-packed, funny, movie. Johnny Depp is absolutely phenomenal as he plays the role of Captain Jack Sparrow, who is an immensely funny character. Everyone else does great as well! Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom do a great job together! Pirates of the Caribbean has everything you could ask for and more, and at the end of it you feel happy and complete. Gore Verbinski did an excellent job and it moves nicely. Everything seems to be in the right place at the right time and it rolls smoothly towards the end with no real plot holes. What small errors there are you most likely won't even notice due to the fact there is always something going on, so you won't find your eyes wondering other places. I gave it a 9 of course which is pretty much the highest rating I plan on giving until the perfect movie is made, and who knows, it might just be Pirates of the Caribbean 2! Or to sum it all up, it belongs on anyone who likes movies top list! ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean is an ultimate movie! Johnny Depp's sexiest performance ever. Seen it four times and am absolutely dying, YES DYING!, to see number two and three. If you've heard of the film and thought it looked like too much of a kiddy's film, honestly, think again. The pirates aren't stereotypical eye-patch and wooden sword characters, their originality is what makes the film. Jack Sparrow is a loyal yet unpredictable part played by Johnny Depp, and made me laugh throughout with his hilarious random jokes. Best pirate film of all time in my opinion. Captain Jack Sarrow, Wil Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) all search for what they're looking for in the Caribbean until death gets in the way!</fullReview>

I am very excited about the 2nd Pirates of the Caribbean to come out in July and I'm sure even the 3rd one in 2007 will have just as much to offer. My only fear is that this trilogy will be become mindless like so many others have(Mission Impossible.)But with a cast like Johnny Deep and Orlando Bloom, I doubt it will go south.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific movie, worth watching!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie in definitely one of my favorites. i have watched it over and over again and the plot never bores me.if you are looking for a worthwhile movies to rent out for the night or even to buy then this is the movie to choose. the acting in this movie is extraordinary. the only down fall is that i watched it and i thought it maybe should have been rated MA because there was quite a bit of violence. apart from that it is still one of my favorite movies of all time. johnny depp is absolutely amazing in this movie and i have never seen anyone act drunk as well as he does. he pulls off the pirate character perfectly. orlando bloom and keira knightley are amazing in it to and orlando is an absolute heartthrob and will get you watching it time and time again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Rules to Follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end, and we're ready for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugely entertaining film. Depp as always is fantastic and his take on his character makes the film in my opinion.Great special effects, good twist on the pirate story, although its still typically Disney, the same formula is there,but hey its for the kids! The only grievance I have is Orlando Bloom,who is becoming very annoying (why do I always think of Percy from Black Adder!). He just comes across too goody-goody and doesn't seem to be able to give anything different to his characters. He should take a leaf from Mr Depp in that department!I am looking forward to seeing the sequel because I reckon there's a lot of miles left in Capt Jack Sparrow.8/10 (9/10 if Orlando wasn't in it, sorry girls!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film with great acting ability, 10/10. cant wait for numbers 2 and 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw Pirates i was expecting a more master and commander themes. However once it started, the acting ability of Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush were shown from the start. I do believe that Geoffrey Rush has been forgotten for his perfect display, it was he and Depp who made the film what is still is. This movie brings a whole new dimension to pirate movies, there hasn't been one for a while and this really did set Johnny Depp onto a fligher. The acting of Kira knightly and Orlando bloom was ordinary, but they fitted perfectly into the script and had the odd descent one liner. Pirates 2 and 3 look hopeful yet i fear it could be ruined, as not every film made is capable of having sequels. The matrix was a good tell tale fact for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney Drops Anchor, But Not The Ball!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though we were too late to get tickets for it, my partner and I had the good fortune (and timing) to be in Anaheim when the world premiere for PIRATES was taking place. It was his umpteenth time at Disneyland, my very first, (at age 43, yet!!!) For him, it was a revelation about seeing the Magic Kingdom through adult eyes vs. the awestruck vision of a young teenager. Even more so for me, since coming to the Magic Kingdom had been virtually all I dreamed about after seeing it so many times on "The Wonderful World of Disney." Needless to say, though I pretty much enjoyed myself there, a lot of the more kid-friendly attractions simply left me cold, or at the very most, lukewarm. At the top of the list of things that left me less-than-impressed? Pirates-of-the-Caribbean: The Ride.The goofy joy tempered with thrills and chills that I remember, seeing the ride on a show about Disneyland itself (which has been thoughtfully included on the POTC DVD extras) was totally dissipated by a sense of ghastly horror...horror at the fact that the ride hadn't changed in nearly twenty years!!! You could even see the places on some of the animatronic figures where they had simply been patched up with spit, chewing gum and chicken wire! Even after seeing the previews, which were exciting in that bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer-way, I remember thinking as I got off the ride, "Ohmigod. Disney is gonna lose their shirts on this one." A big budget feature based on a dilapidated theme park attraction, set in a genre that had been considered dead since that disaster known as CUTTHROAT ISLAND? What chance could Disney have of possibly turning this sow's ear into a silk purse loaded with gold doubloons? Not a single one. But miracle of miracles, they pulled it off!!! Every so often, Hollywood puts together a project guaranteed to be an absolute disaster. The director is anything but a veteran, the leading man is way too quirky, unpredictable or just plain difficult, the script comes from writers who are hit-and-miss at best, and the producers are known for their plot-free, bloated behemoths of sunscreen-weather blockbusters. The end result? Like a Rube Goldberg contraption, the damn thing may actually work, but that doesn't mean it will do anything or go anywhere.Yet, with Gore Verbinski (THE RING, MOUSE HUNT) at the helm, Jerry Bruckheimer (BAD BOYS 2, ENEMY OF THE STATE) producing, a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (GODZILLA) and the inscrutable Johnny Depp in the lead, PIRATES takes the disgraced and abandoned niche of pirate movies and brings it back to life with a bang and a "yo ho ho!" in a way not seen since the days of the original TREASURE ISLAND or CAPTAIN BLOOD.Not only that, but the film still manages to give plenty of 'nudge-wink' references to the ride upon which it is based, while still entertaining you in a wildly reckless and gleeful way that all but obliterates the memory of the original experience from your senses. Should they ever redesign and revamp the ride, they now have the blueprint for it.And speaking of blueprints, I'm astonished at myself for actually looking forward to the sequel, (and that's even without the famously rumored appearance of the Stones' Keith Richard as Jack Sparrow's miserable excuse for a father.) Bringing back the fresh, naive heroism of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who could use a solid hit right about now), the feisty sexiness of Elizabeth Turner (Keira Knightley, who has become famous for that very quality in her heroines) and the murderously jovial sensibility of Geoffrey Rush's scenery-chewing Captain Barbossa is the smartest move the filmmakers could've made.Let's just hope that for this series, PIRATES 2 is more like THE GODFATHER 2, and not SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this film, I have to say I felt underwhelmed. Another movie based off of a Disney ride, oh what fun! Despite the presence of Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom giving "Pirates" a little star credibility, I believed that this movie would be sunk* at the box office.However, after I saw it, I had a complete change of heart. It was as funny and as exciting as most of my friends had avowed. "Pirates" is a light-hearted action filled romp, perfect for idling away an afternoon. Certainly, some of the acting was a little over the top (i.e., Depp and Rush), but that seems fitting for this movie. I am now eagerly awaiting "Dead Man's Chest" and hoping that it will live up to the standard that its predecessor set.*I apologize sincerely for this terrible pun. I couldn't help myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect too much from this film, but I do have a soft spot for pirates and I got to see this one at a drive-in, so I figured I had nothing to lose. It turned out to be a really pretty good film, both for its stirring action and its witty dialogue, played to a tee by Depp and Bloom and bunch. Depp is great and very appropriately over the top as a pirate captain out for revenge on the crew who abandoned him on an island for dead. The curse that has been placed on the crew requires them to find every peice of a particular treasure or they will have to live forever as zombies. This isn't a movie you could say a lot about, but it was a whole lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again, hopefully this time with a bottle of rum!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the previews of this one I thought it would be a nice fun adventure and as it turns out it was. The person though that stands out the most in this one though is Johnny Depp, he was great has Captain Jack Sparrow. There wasn't to many moments in this one when he was on screen that didn't make me at least chuckle. He really made the film for me, though the rest of the cast was good to with Geoffrey Rush as the bad guy and Orlando Bloom doing excellent jobs as well. The female lead was great too. This one though was just a purely fun movie to watch. The scenery was great too on the open seas. The only thing I had problems with are some plot points and the movie did run a bit long. I still am not quite sure why they needed the one guys blood and there was something else that didn't quite fit together as well, like what was up with the compass, but these are minor problems I had with it and in no way do they diminish the enjoyment I had watching this one. Great swordfights in this one as well, as I love a good sword fight in a movie. This one is also good for the whole family, and I am still wondering why it was rated PG and not PG-13 as I think the ratings board these days is a bit crazy. If the last two Star Wars movies were PG then this one should have been as well. All in all a great time to be had by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, except for Johnny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been absolutely fantastic, except for one thing -- Johnny Depp's unfortunate choice of playing Jack Sparrow as a drunken, mumbling git. The movie (though a bit long), is great fun, with swordplay, gunplay, zombies, cannons, and witty dialog -- this last spoiled in part by Depp's insistence on mumbling all his lines. Although apologists say that the character was supposed to be crazy with the sun (for an incident we later learn was only 3 days long, and well-provisioned at that), it seems to me that it was just a completely bad choice of characterization. Better by far to have picked as a model the Burt Lancaster portrayal of Captain Vallo "The Crimson Pirate" (1952 -- as I suspect the writer intended -- "Vallo" --&gt; "Sparrow"). In that movie, Lancaster was perhaps the ultimate "Ha-HA!" character, with the same winking- at-the-audience kind of verve that the Jack Sparrow character sort of had. (Indeed, the walking-the-boat-across-the-bottom scene is right out of "Crimson Pirate", along with the generally acrobatic ship scenes.) This and various plot holes (which involve massive spoilers, so I'll leave them out) took a possibly great movie, and made it a so-so experience for me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp Is Ready for His Close-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"From producer Jerry Bruckheimer comes 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl', the thrilling high-seas adventure with a mysterious twist. The roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) idyllic pirate life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), steals his ship, the 'Black Pearl', and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping the governor's beautiful daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley)."In a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the 'Black Pearl', Elizabeth's childhood friend Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) joins forces with Jack. What Will doesn't know is that a cursed treasure has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead," according to the DVD sleeve description.This first "PG-13"-rated Disney film unexpectedly became the first of a "Pirates of the Caribbean" feature franchise based on one of the company's amusement park rides. It's Disney off the Jerry Bruckheimer production line (so, plan accordingly), and is eye-pleasingly well-produced. The screenplay, by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, is quite a nice modernization of the classic "pirate" story.The film's greatest strength is Mr. Depp's slosh-buckling, swish-buckling, swaggering, and staggering "Jack Sparrow".Depp's characterization cuts through the screen with uncommon, original charm. This part made critics strut up and take notice, with Depp being rewarded with several "Best Actor" awards and nominations. This was also the film which vaulted Depp into the Quigley "Box Office" Top 10 stars list (#6, with a bullet). Actually, it conformed something already a reality among moviegoers - Depp in the cast made a film worth considering, and Depp as the star made a film worth shelling out the bucks to see.******** The Curse of the Black Pearl (6/28/03) Jerry Bruckheimer : Gore Verbinski ~ Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush</fullReview>

Nevertheless, I was a little entertained by some of the fight sequences and many of the lines and attitude of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow character. I'm not completely sure he deserved the Oscar nomination for it but hey, he finally got the public recognition as a result so it's all good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush are also adequate here so this movie was a little enjoyable to me though I couldn't completely connect the disparate sequences that seemed to meander throughout. Still, like I said, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was pretty enjoyable so maybe I'll watch this again someday...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most favorite movie I have ever seen. The stage is surroundings of the Caribbean sea of the 17th century. Elizabeth and Will love each other, but it is not possible because they differ in social standings. One day, Elizabeth is kidnapped by Pirates who lead captain Barbossa because she has Will's gold skull medallion. Then, Will go to save Elizabeth with Jack who is a pirate put in prison?.This is an action-packed movie. Viewpoint is Jack's performance. Jack, played by Johnny Depp, acts marvelously. Viewers are probably almost heart-stopping. One thing I regret is the plot. It is also a Romantic Comedy, but the plot is a kind of basic rescue story. Anyway, I love this movie. I think it's definitely worth watching for everyone!</fullReview>

It's funny, suspense, fast-paced and overall, simply brilliant. Disney's Best and most well done movie is not "Snow White" or "Alice in Wonderland". In fact, not even "Steam-Boat Willie".

It's politically correct Disney all the way with this watered down and convoluted family fun fare which has delighted the critics and public alike. However, there was no black eye patch, no peg leg, no hanging from a yard arm, no pieces of eight or dubloons, and its common knowledge that planks were always walked blindfolded which was a big part of pirate fun. Also, what's up with sword fighting someone you can't kill? Good stuff even if it was an encyclopedia version pirating as opposed to the more real good ol' Hollywood version of the buccaneer.

Orlando bloom is flat and monotonous, and keira is just the eye candy. Plus, the movie does'nt seem to end, EVER!!!! It just goes on and on being smug and thinking it's funny. I guarantee people will look back on this film in a few years saying "what the hell was i thinking?" If you are over the age of 21 than there are good odds that you will not, i repeat WILL NOT enjoy this film.When i heard of POTC, i was expecting something witty, adventurous, surprising, romantic, exciting and full of great characters. Something along the lines of The Princess Bride but with a huge budget. But, instead we got this twaddle. A film that did well in America but comparative poorly everywhere else. I've learnt my lesson now. I'm not going to watch a film if it is doing well in America and just okay everywhere else. Don't get me wrong, i love America, but sometimes i have to wonder at the intellect of it's youth! (meet the fockers made $277m in America and only $113 in the rest of the world. Need i say more?) Another thing i will do before i go and see a film is look it up on IMDb and see who the writers are and who the directors are. If you don't like their previous work, you probably won't like their new film.What has happened to Hollywood. It seems to me that 1999 was the last great year of Hollywood with original ground breaking movies like The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, The Green Mile, Toy Story 2 etc.But i guess, now with dvds, Hollywood producers know that if a movie sucks at the box office, it will find an audience on DVD and eventually make it's money back. I guess thats why they'll give the go ahead with any movie idea these days. I just heard that they wanted to make POTC back in the 1990's, but the script was rejected. 95% of the movies i've seen in the last five years i hate. I officially hate Hollywood!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the effects were slightly admirable, this movie made virtually no impression on me. I don't really remember the names of the characters, let alone why they did or felt what they did. I never could figure out why people kept getting into sword fights and shooting at skeletons they couldn't kill. Wouldn't you run away if you shot some guy in the head and he just shook it off laughing? Clearly nobody in this film caught on. Overall, I was not entertained. It wasn't even so bad it was funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best pure fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and its nothing more than pure fun. The sequel was not as good but watchable the third one was utter crap (and that's me praising it if anyone could figure out what was going on in that movie they're doing better than me) but now onto this movie.This movie follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, but the fierce and clever Barbossa has been cursed. He, along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made.This movie is one of the few movies on IMDb that I agree with it's overall rating sometimes crap on there is overrated and some good movies are underrated on here</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>score one for (Captain) Jack Sparrow and the Disney brain trust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is simply a lot of fun due to the legendary premise, not fully understand until it is right in front of our nose, and how can you not adore Johnny Depp's dead pan Keith Richards impersonation as a pirate for Disney and their theme park mentality. This odd combination is one of the funniest screen personas ever created, adding a prideful element of egocentric status to this likable adventure. Orlando Bloom is noble as he chases the beautiful Keira Knightly, but it is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa that adds the fairy tale element as the smart and commanding villain pirate, while the silly British army, always a step behind, adds a bit of comic belief. The Disney special effects complete the fun and certify this film and The Black Pearl as Disney magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembering being completely uninterested when I first heard of this film. Understandably, seeing as how a movie from Disney based off of a ride from their theme park didn't sound as if it'd provide the strongest foundation for a feature film. It wasn't until my girlfriend of the time convinced me to watch it that I finally agreed and I'm really glad I did. This movie was nothing close to what I was expecting, blowing away every expectation I'd set for it...it was funny, exciting, engaging, and wasn't as PC or family-friendly as your average Walt Disney film. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as he embarks on a quest to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). What Jack doesn't know is that Barbossa and his crew have since acquired a curse, giving them immortality...at a price. Honestly, the story actually appears to have stronger ties to the characters of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and William Turner (Orlando Bloom), but let's face it...the pirates are better.Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have really outdone themselves with this film. They have managed to bring together some incredible elements to create a memorable film that was easily one of the best movies in 2003. The production value was incredible, with excruciating detail apparent in everything from the costume design and make-up to the beautiful set design. Throw in a cast that was top-notch (and that includes the supporting players) and you've got a great conglomeration. We all know how hilarious Depp was in his iconic role as the not-as-clueless-as-he-seems Captain Jack and he alone is worth seeing this movie at least once. Equal in every way is Geoffrey Rush as the evil Barbossa, who's performance I don't feel is getting enough attention. The movie could've focused on Depp and Barbossa without all of the other plot devices and it still would've been great based on the skill of the two alone. Keira Knightley was beautiful in her role as Elizabeth and seemed to pull her weight against the heavyweight stars; Orlando Bloom, on the other hand, didn't wow me but he also didn't weaken the film. I'd wrong not to include kudos for Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally and the rest of the great cast who brought the film to life.Seeing as how the major plot device involves undead pirates, the special effects were a crucial element. For the most part, they never disappoint. There are a few moments where the CGI was a bit too apparent and it throws you back into reality for a moment but only for a moment before the characters draw you back in. Writers Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert did an awesome job turning nothing (an amusement park ride) into something and Verbinski took that something and created a fun, funny and most importantly memorable summer film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undoubtedly entertaining and swashbuckling fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) seeks the help of a pirate (Depp) to rescue Elizabeth Swan (Knightly) from the most haunted ship in the seas, the Black Pearl.Nominated for 5 Oscars, the first instalment of the Pirates trilogy is a fine swashbuckling adventure that depicts the legend of pirates in a way that is dark but also humorous and dramatic.Johnny Depp (Ed Wood) is Oscar nominated for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow, the pirate with a muddled agenda, and a humorous muddled personality. Depp depicts the Captain in a way that is outrageously funny, none more so than the first viewing as you will have never seen anything like it before. The improvisations by Depp including a fine last line are superb. Timing and sophisticated approach to the man without a plan is sweet acting at its very finest and though the sequels have diminished the protagonist (not to mention awful parodies in spoof films) he is undoubtedly different.Keira Knightly (Pride and Prejudice) and Orlando Bloom (The Calcium Kid) are as poor as each other and are always in Depp's light. Geoffrey Rush (Shine) is almost as fine as Depp with a talented depiction of evil and wisdom.Depp's performance aside, the best element of this 2003 picture is the story. Though for me it took a couple of watches to fully comprehend, the narrative revolves around a haunted ship known by the folks as The Black Pearl. This element of the film is a symbol of freedom and an element of mystery that gives the characters chance to look upon and hope for the best. But it's the use of Aztec gold that really gets your mind working. The puzzle of the curse that is affecting the crew is a weird and wonderful element of the narrative that raises as many questions that it doesn't answer. There are twists and turns, none more so than right at the end in a final showdown if you like.The plot is mainly consistent but the political edge frequently undermines the tale of legends and pirates.Based on a theme park ride, Pirates produced millions on release and wasn't long before two sequels were drawn up. These undermine this first with poor scripted and effect driven stories, but will never take the shine of this fantasy adventure, which is a mostly finely acted and frequently entertaining picture with a certain character that you won't forget in a hurry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's successful bet on 21st century cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's recipe for a multi-millionaire franchise: Mix some good pirates, with Johnny Depp as the main ingredient, (make sure they're warm-hearted and technically losers), with a few infra-world evil pirates, in a semi-real Renaissance world, spiced with a love story and with lots and lots of laughs. Heat it up for 2 hours approximately and you'll win more than any President would earn in a lifetime.If that sounded a little bit too rude for you, I assure my intentions weren't bad. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is a very entertaining and funny story about the 4 most appreciated treasures of life: love, family, power and money.Jack Sparrow is one of the most interesting characters in movie history, an eccentric but in a very strange way, a human being like ourselves. Special effects, make up, music, costume design and art direction are just magnificent. The villain, excellent. Plot and direction are quite good. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are just nice.Even though, we find in "Pirates..." a very different face of Walt Disney Studios, more mature and quite changed for trying to adapt to the 21st century audiences. I must say: Nice way to go, Bruckheimer, keep up the good work and I'm looking forward to watch another high-quality franchise like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geoffrey Rush's performance better than Johnny Depp's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm probably the only person on Earth that believes this, but I think that Geoffrey Rush's performance in Pirates of the Caribbean was better than Johnny Depp's. I agree that Depp is spectacular as Captain Jack Sparrow, and his performance makes the movie much better, but Rush's performance as Captain Barbosa is by far the most outstanding in the movie. The movie wouldn't be nearly as good without Rush's performance. The next time you watch the movie, pay special attention to Captain Barbosa (his mannerisms, the way he delivers his lines, etc.). You'll agree with me. Geoffrey Rush is very over-looked and under-rated in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp channeling Keith Richards), a deposed and left for dead pirate joins blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on the hunt for the cursed Black Pearl, Jack's former ship until his lecherous first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wrestled it away from him and left him stranded on an island. Jack wants his ship; Will wants the jewel of his eye the lovely Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) now held captive by the scurvy Barbossa. But these mean hombres are a bit harder to crack than usually thanks to a nifty curse that turns them into the undead. Arrrr! It seems that Walt Disney Company somehow had gotten their memos crossed when they sent 'Pirates' sailing into production (the ride comes AFTER the film, not before). But no matter what is cranked out by the Bruckheimer machine is a fun romp through the spray of the Caribbean. Director Verbinski (hot off success with 'The Ring') creates an action packed walk down the plank that occasionally gets a bit long in the tooth but you know the next big sequence is right around the corner. A lot of nifty effects (the dead crew of the Black Pearl for instance) round out a nicely created production and design. On the acting front while Knightley and Bloom are fine in their roles Depp (as often is the case) steals the show as the staggering Jack whose a crafty sort but more lucky than anything. Rush chews the scenery in his own right leading up to a knock-down, drag-out with Sparrow. Good fun for the family, just keep your hands in the car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far be it from me to judge films like a specialist, but POC is quite an experience. Throughout the film you will obviously notice what makes it good, but perhaps not what makes it fairly appalling. Johnny Depp takes the part of a half maddened pirate who lost his ship years ago and subsequently arrives on an Island whereupon he encounters the blacksmith who has no expression. Keira Knightley is just as poor as her majesty's fellow servant. Luckily, Johnny Depp is so good, you don't notice the other two who are just terrible. All in all, the film is enjoyable, although the story lacks any real twists. How can you guys have rated it 8.1?</fullReview>

The cinematography was beautiful, the story was very interesting, special effects were stunning, and most of all, Johnny Depp didn't just play Jack Sparrow, he WAS Jack Sparrow. Giving all due credit to the other members of the cast, Geoffrey Rush who did a great job, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, although not nearly as experienced, still held their own, I feel comfortable making the assumption that most people felt Johnny Depp was the highlight of the movie. Facial expressions, attitude, dialogue, etc. coupled with the copious amounts of makeup made him the star.Overall, if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you rent it the next time you have some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was something really different for the movie-goer crowd. It's not everyday that you see a pirate movie. A good motto of Hollywood is do something no one's done before. That's one of the many good points of Pirates of the Caribbean. The fact that it's supposedly based on the Disney World ride is kinda lame, considering it's no much like the ride at all. A weird, deranged pirate by the name of Capt. Jack Sparrow is our hero. At first I didn't think he was reliable to the story line. Actor Johnny Depp claims he derived the character from the lead guitarist of the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards. The plot is rather confusing and has one or two holes in it, never mind that at first it's hard to follow. Once you get the gist of it though you become swept away in the story line and the characters. With the main stars Johnny Depp, Geoffry Rush, Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom it's rather hard to go wrong, regardless of prederived thoughts. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my favoritest movies- I got pulled into the drama and I fantasied with the characters. I'm not very hard to please so I give this movie eight stars out of ten. They could have made it easier to follow and understand. Other than that...</fullReview>

However this is not a classic film.This is an enjoyable action adventure with some comedy thrown in (and some skeletons too). I must say just because a film is mildly enjoyable does not mean it is worth in excess of 6/10.I did not find this film to be anywhere near as good as "The Mask of Zorro" and Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow was a bit over the top &amp; eccentric(which was obviously the intention). I found this film to be of a similar level if a little better than "A Knights Tale".It seemed to me though that having been made by Disney it was aimed at 10-16 year old viewers and although entertaining did not appeal to me as a film I would watch many times over.</fullReview>

A blacksmith called Will Turner joins a recently captured pirate named Jack Sparrow and goes off searching for Elizabeth. It's isn't until they all meet up, that they discover the real terrifying truth behind the Aztec gold, and why they need Will Turner and not Elizabeth Swan.One genre of films which you do not see a lot of are pirate movies. This could have helped the success of this movie. No one would have seen a high quality, big-budget pirate movie. Disney really pulled out all the stops on it's stars. There are a huge range of talent here from big stars like Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom, to talent from the likes of Jonathan Pryce, Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport. The story is beautifully written. There are some great scenes with some wonderful witty dialogue. The special are impressive too with the skeletons looking so creepy with their creeping bones.

		<fullReview>It makes me wonder why there was no "pirate movie" until the Pirates of the Caribbean came out in 2003. I really missed that kind of movies with ruthless and bearded pirates, mystical adventures out on the sea, fighting for money, power and treasure... I really missed that all these years. Now, The Pirates of the Caribbean were made by the Disneyland attraction by the same name, so I didn't expect a lot from the movie. First of all, it came from Disney studios, so I didn't expected to see angry and ruthless pirates and really scary adventures. So when the movie came out, I decide to gave it a shot.Overall, the movie is not so bad. Johnny Depp is now probably one of them most talented actors and his acting as goofy pirate Jack Sparrow is really great. The environment of beautiful Caribbean islands is also great. Special effects are solid and some of the scenes from the movie are really scary (of course, from the Disney point of view).The problem of the movie is in the story. The story of the movie is really predictable, even for the Disney movies. One poor guy is in love with the rich girl. The girl is taken away by the "evil" pirates. The poor guy decided to bring the girl back. Of course... the girl is a governor daughter and he's a nobody, but then he finds out that he's a son of a pirate. Predictable. Even worse.. the poor guy is played by two worst actors on the planet: Orlando Bloom and the rich girl is played by Keira Knightley. You know the rest.The second problem are the "bad" guys in the movie. They're really not "bad", they just look like a bunch of dorks, being at the wrong place in the wrong time. There is no "evil" in this movie. The pirates are shown as a rum - drinking fat morons with bad sense of humor. They're not evil and not even convincing. The only good character is Jack Sparrow and even him became annoying with his bad humor after a hour and a half.Pirates of the Caribbean are good adventure movie, but nothing more than that. The characters are annoying (Knightley with her really annoying British accent), there's a lack of real "evil" in the movie and the story is a complete breakdown. Despite good acting from Depp, this movie is not a real "pirate movie". This is not Treasure Island, it's a mix of Disneys fairy - tales and pirate movies.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp was the best man to cast as Captain Jack Sparrow, he really grabs the character and brings him to life. The action sequences in the movie were extravagant, how Orlando and Johnny danced around sword fighting and the visual effects of battle between two 18th century battle ships.

She tells them her name is Elizabeth Turner. But it isn't. Turner is the name of the boy her family find in the water, some years ago. The boy, Will, doesn't know he is a pirate and now he is a friend of Elizabeth and her family. The evil pirates, think Elizabet is a pirate, because she is named Turner. They are taking her to a cave, together with the necklace and there they are going to take some of her blood and they are going to cancel a curse that rest over the evil pirates. But it doesn't work. So now they know that Elizabeth is not the right human to take blood from, she is not the daughter of the Turner (the father of Will Turner). Now they start searching after the pirate who can cancel the curse. Will Turner, who's working as a smith in the town where Elizabeth lives, meet Jack Sparrow one day. Jack is a pirate too, and they take a ship and go away to look after Elizabeth. On the ship Jack tells Will that he is a pirate too, but Will isn't believe him at first. But afterward he recognize that its true. Jack and Will goes out on a big adventure, and Will is prepared to die to find Elizabeth, and save her..I think the film is a good film. You can see it in nearly every ages and its both funny and exciting. The actors is very good in acting, and of course it makes the film been better. This movie is definitely worth to see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't express how much I hate this movie. To start:1)Man the sword fights sucked. Boring, no one hurts, we know who's gonna win. This movie is rated PG-13 not PG. Throw some suspense into it god dammit.2)The story is dull. The storyline is so unoriginal and again predictable. If you know what's gonna happen, what's the fun in that? I mean come on, throw in some surprises.3)People love it. I hate that anyone even likes it. . .that it's in the top 250. They give it a 10 because it was good. But there are better blockbusters, greater movies that get no recognition.4)It tries to have class. But it doesn't; it is actually brainless.OK, so Johnny Depp was good, wow, how exciting. People are starting to love him for his role in this crapfest (no names mentioned).My rating: 0 out of 10. But see it as you're bound to disagree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it "The best". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great. Great visuals, a nice interesting story, good performances, good make up, but it is still and will be another blockbuster film. 7.56/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many many years ago, the stories of pirates died in Hollywood, the interest and freshness just left it, and the name of swashbuckling piracy gathered dust in a box on a shelf in the back of a closet. Then, in 2003, Jerry Bruckheimer found the old box, dusted it off and said to himself "Hey I could use this!" And use it, he did. With an all-star cast and the best crew in town, Jerry set out to do the unthinkable, resurrect the pirate name. Many people, upon seeing the footage-less teaser trailer thought the film would be so bad it would be a joke, but the director, Gore Verbinki proved them all wrong. Through jolly musical themes, a surprisingly creepy plot, a fantastic cast, and awesome bits of nothing-but-fun action, Pirates of the Caribbean successfully leaves the viewer stunned, and wanting more (which, they brought, twice). If you liked Transformers, Night at the Musiem you will probably like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl is not only the best pirate movie you'll ever see, it's also one highly entertaining and enjoyable film.The acting is great all around. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is so crazy and comedic, he's destined to be remembered for that role for a very long time. Orlando Bloom is very good, as well as the beautiful Keira Knightley. Geoffrey Rush is also evil and grand as Captain Barbosa.The score is okay. It certainly can sweep and have some soaring romantic cues, however, it's very redundant. I only recommend it to collectors and fans.The ghost pirates provide for some amazing CG sequences, and are the high points in the film -- yet, Sparrow's first couple minutes on screen is the funniest and most brilliant part of the picture.The writing is very good, though there's many points in the film that could've used a rewrite or two, as thing's become confusing, silly, and improbable. Gore Verbinski's direction is nicely done, though is highly unnoticeable with all the bombast going around.All in all, with some ridiculously funny characters and moments, as well as some jaw-dropping visual effects, and a cool story, The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great family film. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun, swashbuckling, exciting, well-acted, well-plotted, obsessive and dramatic film, good for grown-ups and teens. Before you start watching this, remember that this is not for the faint-hearted.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) are the stars of this pirate film, all with very different personalities and good acting. Captain Jack Sparrow, in this film, has been a pirate for some time - and is very good at it. He leads the film on with his daring deeds, plunders and sword-play. Will Turner's character has the most surprises. He is thought to be a humble blacksmith, but instead he turns out to be a good swordsman and later, a good pirate. Elizabeth Swan is the governor's daughter, but soon it turns out that she is captured by pirates. She is very firm, brave and is not the kind of person to give up. Though she has grown up good and posh, it seems she has a bit of pirate in her too...I'll save most of the plot as a surprise for you, but be prepared for a little bit of gore (but not a great amount) and some rather scary skeletons (depending on how you see them).I like this film because of the actors, the adventures, the lines from the characters, the plot and the way this was made. There are some very good graphics here which work incredibly well (sometimes a little too well).I recommend this film to people who are not too scared by action and just that little bit of horror and who like funny bits in action films as well. Enjoy "Pirates of the Caribbean"! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This swash-buckling tale follows the quest of Captain Jack Sparrow, a savvy pirate, and Will Turner, a resourceful blacksmith, as they search for Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth, the daughter of the governor and the love of Will's life, has been kidnapped by the feared Captain Barbossa. Little do they know, but the fierce and clever Barbossa has been cursed. He, along with his large crew, are under an ancient curse, doomed for eternity to neither live, nor die. That is, unless a blood sacrifice is made. Full of edge-of-the-seat action and swashbuckling adventures, this is a movie you won't want to miss! this is movie good i guess.not my favorite but some scenes are really funny and skeletons are made terribly good.i recommend it.</fullReview>

So unique and new. He is the most talented actor of our generation. All of the sets and fight scenes were superb and so well in detail and the other pirates looked like what you would imagine that pirates of that time would look like, with their teeth all dirty and nasty.

		<fullReview>Very good action epic from the Caribbean.After seeing the preview I was expecting a "lets make a movie for the sake of it" mentality with lots of special effects. I was somewhat surprised when I actually found it to be quite an entertaining and easy to watch film.I was also very impressed with the effects, but especially the skeletal effects (believable without being gory). Johnny Depp's grasp of "Jack Sparrow" is to be commended however I feel he was let down by the lacking and somewhat forced performances of two other characters. It is for this reason alone I give this movie an 8 instead of the elusive 10.Interesting story with interesting characters, whats not to like?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>didn't deserve so much hype in the Summer 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like musicals, the pirate movie fell a little into oblivion these last years. There were endeavors to revive it but ended either in artistic failure. "Pirates" (1986) by Roman Polanski enters this category, a project whose preparation was long and arduous and in the end, it was a very impersonal amount and Polanski's absolute nadir of his career with the desultory "What?" (1972). Then, "Cutthroat Island" (1995) was a contender for the genre but ended in a financial fiasco. Nearly a decade later, Gore Verbinski with whom, a good majority of cine buffs had unearthed in him palpable skills in directing with the chilling "the Ring" (2002) and under the command of the Disney firm embarked on a new ship. Direction: the pirate island with the well-intentioned will to restore once for all the reputation of the pirate movie. Unfortunately, he didn't arrive at the end of his trip. His ship fell through. It was a profitable blockbuster for the mighty producer Jerry Bruckheimer who once again lined his pockets. Artistically, well let's be as nice as possible and it will be hard because I had relied on the director of "the Ring" to rejuvenate the pirate movie and to deliver a solid entertaining film. My hopes were blighted.It was maybe a mistake to have entrusted him a big-budget film. He seems to have been dwarfed by Bruckheimer's omnipotence. However the latter's trademark is present in virtually each shot, each image of the venture and there's nothing wrong about it: exotic landscapes, lush scenery, lavish costumes, grand score, a whiff of epic movie, pursuits galore, naval engagements, a dash of fight and fusillades sequences and of course, perhaps the indispensable element: swashbuckler which was a specialty of French cinema in the sixties, helped by the unparalleled Jean Marais. There was everything in the same package which brought out a conducive odor to entice and charm the greatest number of viewers.Alas! "Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" is partly plagued by a derivative directing which can't live up to the enormous means and budget the film had at its disposal. Verbinski had been more inspired with "the Ring". However, one can feel a buoyant will from Verbinski to film his story. It's true, there's a perennial humor difficult to resist, fast-paced action. There were also visible efforts on the costumes and scenery. Everything to inspire a good amount to dream, liberty to the audience. But Verbinski sedately shoots Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom)'s adventure to find again Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and in the end, the whole smells the reheated. The movie also could have gained by being curtailed of about half an hour.Verbinski's vehicle is also handicapped by its scenario and it's perhaps what hampers most the success of the film. "The Ring" had a quite strong screenplay in store but here, it's a snap, slick one. Yes, there are some neat twists to keep the audience interested until the tail end but it also encapsulates major, unacceptable drawbacks which are nonsensical in the story as a whole. So, the malicious pirates took Elizabeth hostage to help them to find a treasure which would make them human beings again (at night, they turn into living dead) but isn't it an excellent opportunity for them to reinforce and establish their power? No, instead they want to become mortal, flesh and blood men again. Then, in the first minutes of the film, after Elizabeth took Will in, she's looking at the sea and as the mist clears away, she can see a pirate ship because of the black flag. The pirate ship is close enough to enable the crew on board to see Elizabeth's ship, so why isn't there a naval engagement? It's also hard to swallow the story of Will's father and the scenarists could have found a better and less far-fetched way to make Depp and Knightley meet. The latter wears a dress with a more than fitted waist and because of this, she falls (from a high height) into the sea (you have to see the sequence to understand it and to realize how ludicrous it is). But fortunately, Depp was in the surroundings... you can guess the rest. There's also some filler in the scenario (when Depp and Knightley are on the desert island).The actors partially redeem the whole. Johnny Depp plays his game well. His mix of gravity and mockery spices up the story. Geoffrey Rush also takes the lion's share about the quality of the acting. But Orlando Bloom delivers a rather wooden acting and Keira Knightley doesn't really display skills of thespian."Pirates of the Carabbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl" is plagued by a shoddy story which should have been more stringent. There are also flashy special effects and a mundane directing. To some extent, some qualities of "the Ring" which had contributed in cementing its stance of winner have turned into drawbacks here. Once again, there's no accounting for taste but this blockbuster isn't the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie. But the majority of the audience doesn't seem to have this problem. A sequel will reach the streets this summer. Will it be worthwhile?</fullReview>

I especially liked the bonus features, too: there were the bloopers ("Is that a plane?????" - Johnny Depp heard a small jet rocket by the ship), and of course, the excerpt from "Walt Disney Presents," which I actually remembered seeing on the old Disney Channel one night in 1998.Buuuuuut, there is a problem. (OH NO!!!!! is right!!!!!)This is a "BAD PERIOD" movie!!!!! That's right, for one, this movie totally changed the way we go to the parks now!!!!! The ride was changed to make it look like the movie now, and even worse, there are rumors that the Tom Sawyer ride at Disneyland will go away with - get this - a new ride based on this film!!!!! Plus, the worst part????? IT'S RATED PG-13!!!!! Yes, you heard right!!!!! A "Disney" movie, given such a controversial rating so that families can't see this or any other movie in this series because it's too scary!!!!! So basically, Disney now robs of its usual audience in the "Bad Period.""PIRATE DVDS OF THE EAST: THE CURSE OF THE MPAA'S FOCUS" is a film that, while it appeals to us adults, JUST DOES NOT APPEAL TO CHILDREN!!!!!

Sheer fantasy that might appeal to those who want some mindless escapism. There are better films to spend your 140 minutes on. The special effects seem to be derivative of other modern action or horror films like Matrix and The Mummy. Most of the acting in this film is rather wooden and the actors seem to be just going through the motions, hoping it will soon end. But it doesn't. It just keeps going on and on and on. The musical score is the best part of the film. It is hard to believe they are making a sequel to this movie, but money talks. It was obviously a big hit and must have brought in a ton of money at the box office. I will take a rain check on the next installment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Naturally, computer graphics had to get in there --- pirates alone could never be enough for the modern child. She has to have pirates who are ghouls as well, so that the film is a messy hybrid of horror and adventure.The combination of men who can't be killed fighting endlessly with characters made of wood while a symphony orchestra goes crazy is utterly tedious.It's so sad that worldwide youngsters subject to the American global market have only this junk-food to consume on DVD.Throughout the whole deadening two and a half hours, there are about five seconds of shots of the Caribbean. The picture might as well have been shot in Disneyland.Johnny Depp is even more pathetic here than in his next role, The Libertine, in which he played a sex-crazed poet who never touches a woman throughout the whole film.His British accent, predictably, is a mess (as in The Libertine) and his role in this film is to spend long periods in a cell while everyone else gets on with it. The idea that he is some kind of commander of men is ridiculous. He simply camps up the whole picture and makes a mockery of it.Naturally, the plot is the most ludicrous imaginable, it's not even worth discussing. Suffice it to say that it is full of holes you could navigate a ship through.As for black people who populate the Caribbean, just two appear in this picture: one a glimpsed female pirate captain (!), the other a glimpsed huge stereotyped brute with a studded face and massive muscles. So, take your pick: cheesy stereotype or politically correct cut-out. As for the other millions who inhabit the Caribbean, they don't exist.If there was a scrap of history that validated this film as a nostalgic romp, it might be excusable. But since it is a farrago of fantasy and faux-fairytale, it is to be roundly condemned. Everyone who raves about this film is doomed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been so much hype about this film, but in reality (well, in my opinion anyway) it is seriously bad. Let me explain myself...Firstly, Johnny Depp, who everyone thinks has given some career-defining performance, simply hops around dressed as a woman and makes cliched little comments that really grate. Secondly, Depp and Bloom's swordfight near the beginning of the film is horrifically dull. They spend the first few minutes exchanging limp jibes (physical and verbal) walking indifferently around the set... one is left half-asleep. I know the action comes later, but this dull, empty screen-time is unusual for Disney. But the most laughable element of the film (so far) is this absolutely ridiculous idea that between the ragtag, thieving bunch that pirates were, there existed a 'code of honour'. We see in the film one of the characters asking not to be killed because, according to 'the code', she has the right to 'Parley' and can be saved from death and have a nice chat with the captain instead. When the captain later tries to distance himself from this and says that the code is 'less rules...more a set of guidelines' I was crying into my chips. This is Final Destination-quality craziness.Anyway...just thought you should all know this film really ain't that great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) ** 1/2 (out of 4) The evil pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps the daughter (Keira Knightley) of a Caribbean governor and heads off but the woman's admirer (Orlando Bloom) asks Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to help him track them down. He reluctantly agrees because he wants revenge against Barbossa who led a mutiny against him years earlier. The first paragraph in Roger Ebert's review perfectly sums up my feelings on this movie because he makes it clear that there's a nice 90-minute "B" movie trapped inside an incredibly long and drawn out 142-minutes. Seriously, 142-minutes for a pirate movie? I know this movie has a large group of fans and I know it made hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the world but there are so many great things here that I can't help but feel that they're all wasted simply because someone didn't know how to shout cut and then leave stuff on the cutting room floor. We'll start off with all the good stuff and one can't help but be visually entertained by everything going on. I really loved the look of the sets, the pirate ships, the costumes and of course the dead pirates look terrific as well. I'm not a fan of CGI but I thought they did a pretty good job mixing up the make-up with the special effects and the visual look of the pirates is incredibly good and quite realistic as well. Another major plus is that you can't help but feel as if you're really in the 17th Century. I thought the filmmakers did a terrific job with all the outfits and this here helped add some creditability to the movie. The action scenes are all incredibly well-staged including a terrific bit where the under-maned Sparrow boat must go up against Barbossa's using any item that they can. Another terrific battle happens at the very end but with a summer Blockbuster you expect the action to be good. Then we have the nice performances by Rush, Bloom, Knightley and various other supporting players. I thought Knightley was incredibly good coming off quite sexual as well as being believable in the toughness of the character. Then there's Johnny Depp who picked up an Oscar-nomination for his performance. I can't say I'd call it that great but there's no question that Depp makes the role all his own and even manages to make the performance original, which isn't all that easy to do with a pirate. I really loved the tough of Keith Richards that he threw into the performance and I think any fan of The Stones will enjoy it. However, most of this is wasted because everything just gets dragged out so long that after a while you can't help but feel as if you're got some great eye candy but nothing that tastes overly good. Edit out thirty-minutes and I'd say you'd have a much more entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An eccentric pirate (Johnny Depp) rushes to the rescue when the British governor's daughter (Keira Knightley) is kidnapped by his former shipmates. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Depp.Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is an enjoyable action adventure, based on a Disney theme-park ride, that barely has a coherent plot but still hits the spot - especially as Depp's Jack Sparrow, in this first film of the franchise, has the advantage of surprise. His mascara-lidded, swaggering, cockney pirate, a rock star by any other name, is a truly original creation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly... underrated (yes, still - despite 8.0 average!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this movie brilliant, a true work of art. And the same applies to sequels as well. Unfortunately many people are totally unable to see past their stereotypes (or are just plain dumb), which is the sole reason for so many negative or subtly negative reviews. 'Oh, it's Disney? Based on a ride? 5/10 then', 'Not written/directed by someone famous? 5/10', 'I can't get what it's about... hmm... 5/10 for J.D.' And so on, and so on.In fact, "Pirates" is a movie with meaning, not only with much action. There are many action scenes, sure. But it's also highly symbolic (whether it was intended or not). I'll give just a couple of examples:***SPOILERS BELOW*** Jack's arrival to Port Royal on the mast of a sinking boat. Can anyone say something like this never happened to him in real life, even if it wasn't that spectacular? Then Jack has to bribe a customs officer so that his name isn't mentioned in records and right after that he steals a small money-pouch. There're people walking around but the theft seems to go unnoticed. This isn't illogical as it may seem. Or at least it's not any more illogical than our society where all people steal from each other in more or less obvious ways and everyone pretends to notice nothing.Likewise, Jack's ship - Black Pearl - is a metaphor of freedom. (When it's first mentioned there's funny guards' conversation about 'is it real or not' and 'can any ship with black sails be the Pearl'. The Pearl is elusive, 'nigh uncatchable'. It hardly brought Jack anything but trouble, not to mention the price he had to pay for getting it. Yet he settles for no other ship.) I could mention more of such interesting ideas (for eyes to see that can), but don't want to spoil too much.Still people choose not to think. Indeed, why to make your brain work when you can easily criticize, that Will is a smith's apprentice instead. (Actually to anyone familiar with mythology it does make sense that a young hero is a smith's apprentice. And yes, I know why people are against something that actually does make sense. But that's off-topic here.) Bottomline: I loved pretty much everything about this movie and its sequels. 10/10 from the heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a really popular attraction at the Disney theme parks in Paris and Florida, this is a really good film from director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring). A long while ago, a ship crew found a young boy floating in the ocean, he later became a blacksmith. By the way, when he was found as a kid, the young daughter of the ship to a necklace he was wearing with a piece of Aztec gold. Now years on Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) the blacksmith one day meets the man who knows about the gold, and the pirates that seek it. Jack Sparrow (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp) and Will are now on the trail of these pirates when they kidnap the daughter (with the gold), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). The pirates are on the so-called cursed ship called The Black Pearl, lead by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Basically they want the piece of gold because it is the last one they need to lift a curse off them. Also starring Jack Davenport as Norrington, Jonathan Pryce as Governor Weatherby Swann, The Office's Mackenzie Crook as Ragetti and Lee Arenberg as Pintel. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Makeup, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best Sound. Johnny Depp was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Orlando Bloom was number 17 (with Viggo Mortensen), and Depp number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Depp was number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Bloom was number 5 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Keira Knightley was number 9 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and the film was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lighting and color was OK in some areas but for the most part it wasn't colorful enough and the lighting was underdone. There needed to be more focus on shiny appearance of gold and classical cherry wood and golden lighting.I remember some of the Disney stuff from the early 80's a picture book in particular that features the dog holding the keys at a dungeon and a massive cave system with beautifully illustrated treasure. This movie was nowhere near the standard of that. It came off looking as synthetic as the black pearl pirates in their ghost form.I'm all for CGI in movies but it was very poorly done in this movie, some of the worst I've seen.I wanted this movie to take me to the place i remember from the picture book I had as a kid unfortunately it failed miserably.

		<fullReview>This film starts off nice and calm with a young pretty gal looking out over the ocean from the bow of an English Vessel with all its sails blowing in the wind. This young girl is Keira Knightly, (Elizabeth Swann) who notices someone is floating on a raft in the waters below and summons help to rescue him; Elizabeth then proceeds to steel a metal object from around his neck and never says a word about this incident for many years in the future. The rescued young boy was Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow) who has a secret past relating to his father and his associations with men on the seas who had Cross Bones and a Skelton as their flag. There is plenty of sword crashing steel and creatures resembling Draculas along with things you can not even imagine. Errold Flynn would never be able to complete with Johnny Depp, but Errold was good way back in the 1930's and 40's.</fullReview>

Also, with the exception of Jack Davenport and Geoffrie Rush, not any actor or actress should act again. Is so terrible to see all the people considering this one as a masterpiece, when they never see The Crimson Pirate, and never give time to see the great heroes acted by Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Gene Kelly. All the movies in the present are made by the same rule: put any thing you think all the mass will love. Is terrible. Some goofs: when the Black Pearl show his flag, the flag has aspect anti past (any artesan should see this fact). In some shot, the principal actress show his finger nails, and are painted with pink colour. In that time, that thing was impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely monotonous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers. I could only endure about an hour of this movie, before I walked out of the room where I had been watching it with my family. Why? First, the movie lacked a plot. It was strictly about the everyday lives of a group of pirates, and had no extraordinary plot elements. Instead of being a movie, it should have been made a sitcom. At least sitcoms ARE generally about the everyday lives of a person or group of people. Movies should have something more. Secondly, this was one of the most monotonous movies I have ever seen. Most of the hour that I watched was the same dialogue, paraphrases over and over: "I'm a pirate." "Are you a pirate?" "Is he a pirate?" Hearing the same word in ALMOST EVERY SENTENCE grew very tiresome after an hour. Lastly, constantly hearing the word "pirate" was only half of the problem with the dialogue. Much of it was JUST PLAIN CHEESY. I could not see how any educated writers could have come up with the dialogue that was used in this movie. If you want matching corny plot and dialogue, Pirates of the Caribbean is the right movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How sad. I was so looking forward to this movie. I love Pirate Lore. From the director of that smash hit The Mexican, this movie sucked. It should have gotten more Disney treatment, or none at all. The story was so shallow, the characters were so shallow, that it would have maybe been a terribly entertaining film for the kids, but the movie was too dark and violent for the little ones. I thought Depp would work wonders with this, but the script was so inane. There wasn't enough meat for the adults. I didn't care at all about any of the characters. I kept wating to hear "Ding, please turn the page." Some nice moments, but just a few. Over all, a let down. Rent the Musketeer for swordplay, or rent Mutiny for munity. As for pirates, even the Pirate Movie starring Kristie McNichol was more engaging than this. And it was a musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing film:(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in My opinion is not one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, it has a huge budget, a different cast (which included Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Jonathan Pryce!), great special effects, and a lengthy two hour plus run time but this film never did anything for Me and here are the reasons why it didn't.The following is in My opinion.1. Johnny Depp is a good actor but I just didn't know what to think of his character whether I should like him, hate him, or feel sorry for him.2. I'm an action movie nut and there was a lot of action but the action just wasn't exciting enough that its so great it'll be one of the films I'll see over and over. In other words nothing special or spectacular happened in this one.3. The music by up coming composer Klaus Badelt was ok but most of it was just recycled of Hans Zimmer's one of a kind score from the greatest epic called Gladiator (2000)! Badelt composed an excellent score for the Time Machine and retooled the music and this is what we get for this? Why?4. Some of the things that happened in the film was supposed to be funny but I didn't think it was and I didn't think the comedy stuff was needed.5. The late great Trevor Goddard had a brief role in this movie and I believe it was his last one. Why give an actor with an incredible muscular build, a unique accent, and amazing talent a scene where it makes him look like a complete joke?You may be thinking why I am saying this. How can I say this about a movie that is so high in fame and stature? I am just saying how I feel about the film. The film had all the potential and everything going for it but it just didn't do it. I wanted to like the movie but it never changed. I don't agree about it being on the IMDb's Top 250: #235! In fact, I think it shouldn't even be on the list. There are many other films that deserve to be on the list more than this film! You mean to tell Me that this is on the same list with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? Plus there are many more movies with much more excitement similar to this movie like the Planet of the Apes (2001), The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, and Cutthroat Island! In My opinion Pirates of the Caribbean's competion The Hulk and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines was so much better and exciting in My opinion! Anyway I feel if you wanted to watch a much more epic pirate movie instead see Cutthroat Island, its much more exciting! I hate to say this but Pirates of the Caribbean is awfully dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspiring, it has no depth, and it should be avoided like a flood!</fullReview>

And Johnny Depp's performance was bad in every way. Just because you manage to speak in a way that is hard to understand does not mean it is good acting. What was the Academy thinking have they completely lost their mind. As much as I thought Return of the King was ridiculously overrated after this abomination I am starting to respect it. After such a bad decade of bad and unoriginal movies people must have broken critical fuse and mistaken this atrocity for a great movie.

		<fullReview>This movie is among the most utterly overrated piles of garbage I have ever seen. Containing one of the most linear plots, Pirates seeks to appeal to the most basic of minds, while most people of average or better intelligence hope their feet fall asleep so they have something to take their minds off of the movie. I had no intention of ever seeing this movie, but my sister wanted it (for what reason I do not know) so I got it for her for her birthday and decided to watch it. I can honestly say that I would have felt better burning the $10 I spent on it and watching the pretty flame for a few seconds. Action movies are inherently bad, but this one shines among the worst of them.This is the type of movie that would keep President Bush contented for hours, but if you want to see a real movie that will tickle your senses, I suggest you pick up Shawshank Redemption or Donnie Darko.</fullReview>

That was about 5 minutes into the movie, it all went down from there. It was just boring to me, pirates who were cursed and now need the blood of a certain fellow to lift it, whoooo. Orlando Bloom was annoying, I can understand pre teenage girls waving their "Potc" flags because hes oh so hot(those would be the imdb users with reviews like, "omigawd this is like tha best movie EVER, orlando bloom rules!!!111".My confirmation came when my sweet mother, who never has a bad word to say about anyone or anything proclaimed, "it wasnt really good", when an hour rolled around we had both lost all interest and i was reading comic books, glancing at the tv now and then to see if anything interesting pops up.

		<shortDescription>Poor Historical Accuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I found this film to be a great disappointment. I am something of a history nut and so was disappointed by the amount of inaccuracy of the movie. For example:1) Every cannonball in the movie exploded, yet they were all fired from long guns and so would just have been lumps of metal hurtling through the air.2) Norrington had a huge ceremonial promotion to commodore. A commodore was not a permanent rank. It was simply a way of distinguishing between a captain who had been given /temporary/ command of a squadron and one who had not.3) There were never enough sailors on any of the ships. Most ships of that era had literally hundreds of men aboard. The Black Pearl would have had at least 100 as a skeleton crew (no pun intended) and they would not have been able to use the guns or mount any sort of assault. It would have a full complement of something like 500, if not more.4) All the sailors were bedecked in ridiculous uniforms. All of the sailors seemed to be wearing their dress uniforms all the time, which simply would not happen on any ship. As if this wasn't bad enough, some of those who weren't marines were wearing red, which would make them an anathema to all the other men in the ship.However, action-wise, the film is very good, though Depp does begin to get on my nerves after a while.</fullReview>

I thought Johnny Depp with all the eye makeup looked like a girl with a moustache and acted too silly to be a real pirate. And the computer simulated scenes took it into the realm of fantasy and more like the Disneyland ride it was based on. I realize that, by today's standards, Captain Blood looks campy but the famous sword fight along a spit of sand between Blood (Flynn) and Captain Levasseur (Rathbone)stands as a Hollywood classic which none of POTC comes near.</fullReview>

I saw it (better to say some parts of it) yesterday and to say I was disappointed is to say nothing. After about one hour my dad said he can't bear it anymore and walked out. I followed him, but later returned, since I had to kill time somehow. My mother and 19 y.o. sister moderately enjoyed it (or may be just thought it would get better), but after less than two hours said they will watch it sometime later (read 'never') and stopped it.Well, my impression was that the movie was pretty stupid and cliche. May be not the worst script, but nothing to write home about. The acting was either over the top (Johnny Depp) or bland and boring (everyone else). There might have been some brilliant special effects that I missed on the cam-copy, but I doubt it. There was hardly any sea worth looking at, and everything else was taken out of the Hollywood library of generic effects.If you have nothing better to do, see it on the big screen, may be it will look cool (it probably won't). Don't pay much for the tickets, though.</fullReview>
