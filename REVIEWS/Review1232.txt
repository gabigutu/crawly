		<fullReview>"Catfish" is a difficult film to talk about without spoiling. The sensationalist trailer gives a deliberately one-sided peek at a film which is ultimately defined by its ending. Expectations should probably be mediated, however?"Catfish" isn't going to blow your mind. In fact, the outcome of this social networking mystery is rather straightforward, but no less brilliant for it. This is a film where palpable suspense cedes way to an unconventional and thought- provoking character study. Maybe the best introduction I can offer is that I really liked it.Arriving in a market practically gorged with tongue-in-cheek faux documentaries, it's initially difficult to take "Catfish" at face value. The story begins innocuously enough; Yaniv "Nev" Schulman has just had his first picture published in the New York Times when a package arrives at his office containing a painted replica of the photo. The artist is a 12 year- old admirer, and her correspondence begets a peculiar Facebook friendship. As Nev becomes involved with her and her family, however, he begins to notice certain inconsistencies with the perfect lives they lead online.Much of the build-up feels stagey, and surely something is amiss, because either filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman are considerably more talented directors than they portray themselves as, or they are not being entirely forthcoming. The prevalence of the camera during seemingly random moments that become key scenes seems perhaps a bit too fortuitous, and the placement and framing of the shots themselves seem too precisely calculated to have been captured on the fly for this amateur guerrilla venture.Yet it doesn't matter in the slightest. "Catfish" is about calling our willingness to accept unsubstantiated information into question, and thus encourages a skepticism and natural inquisitiveness towards itself. The entire thing could be fabricated, and its creators have a built-in ace in the hole. Falsifying a non-fiction film about false identity could add a brilliant meta layer to the puzzle.That being said, I don't believe that Joost and Schulman invented the whole thing. Somebody get these guys a pen and paper if they did. Rather, I tend to identify with the prevailing online rumor that suggests the ending was shot first, with some or most of the first half consisting of retroactive reenactments. But though I question the authenticity of certain moments, whether or not they are genuine seems beside the point?"Catfish" is an effective film.The foundation of that success lies in its solid technique. The gradual rationing of information and the introduction and unraveling of the central mystery is surprisingly well handled. The plot is obtuse and intense when it needs to be, and the suspense is so potent that some have even been let down that it never becomes an all-out thriller.But suspense has the tendency to be undervalued in an of itself, and the suspense in "Catfish" is an exceptionally executed, integral part of the ride. The film, on the whole, works not only because of its moments of seizing, visceral tension, but because of the greater message it evokes. In hindsight, scenes like those exploited in the trailer featuring Nev and his buddies arriving at a quiet farm in the dead of night seem downright silly when compared to where they eventually end up."Catfish" has been getting a ton of very positive press recently, and it deserves much of the praise it's received. But backlash follows hype like a shadow, and I have a feeling that those swayed into seeing the film who might not have otherwise will enter with unrealistic expectations. It is a fascinating, offbeat experiment, but it still appeals to niche interests. The extent to which we let ourselves believe that the internet is a direct extension of our preceptory senses can be dangerous?But I'll say no more. I don't want to spoil anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Catfish," I Can't Tell You What It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A shattering conclusion." "The best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never directed." These are a couple of the tag line quotes that appear in the trailer for "Catfish." The movie poster tells us "Don't let anyone tell you what it is." Watch the trailer and it seems like this is going to be the next "The Blair Witch Project." Really, go to You Tube and watch it right now. I'll wait ? What do you think? It looks suspenseful and frightening, doesn't it? Well, it ain't, sister. The marketing department for "Hit the Ground Running Films" did a number on twisting this two-minute trailer around to make it seem like you are going to see the next big documentary thriller. What you will see is a study in social media and the human psyche that is using modern technology (such as Google Earth, Facebook and texting) to bring the story together."Catfish" is a documentary by three aspiring filmmakers. The story begins by introducing us to Nev Schulman who is the main focus of the story that his brother, Rel Schulman, and friend, Henry Joost, are producing and directing. Nev is a young, charismatic photographer in New York City. One of his photos he had published made it all the way to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This is where an 8-year-old girl named Abby sees the photograph; she draws a painting of it and sends it to Nev. As having been the father of an 8 year old myself, I could tell something was rotten in Denmark from the quality of work this child was producing.Nev and Abby start a pen pal relationship via Facebook. Nev befriends Abby's entire family on Facebook and even talks to her mom on the phone. He becomes close to Abby's older, attractive sister, Megan, and starts having feelings for her over the phone. Hey, it happens. There is an accurate scene where a nervous Nev calls Megan for the first time. Within today's culture of meeting people online, it is exactly how these phone calls play out. People meet online and text and e-mail back and forth until the day comes where they exchange phone numbers and there is an awkward human connection. It's a norm for this generation and they will easily relate to Nev's nervous behavior while tripping over his words when he is speaking to Megan.Nev and the filmmakers start putting the clues together from Megan's e-mails. Through some detective work on You Tube and other various sites they are slowly realizing that someone is playing them like a squeezebox. They get the bright idea to drive to Michigan to confront Abby, Megan and the rest of the family.This is where the movie trailer leaves us hanging. After a long trip, the trio of filmmakers arrives at the barn by Megan's house in the middle of the night. They peer inside the barn...and... and?sorry I can't tell you what it is. I have an agreement with a movie poster. But, what I can tell you is that it's not some 20 year old standing in the corner of a basement in an abandoned house in the woods. That has been done before. It's not even startling, not in the sense that I would expect it to be.The rest of the film spends its time explaining how Nev and his mystery solving team react to their findings. If you pay attention (and, it's pretty easy to do) you can pick up on where the movie was going.There was no big "wow" moment nor was there "a shattering conclusion." It was simply people explaining their actions on why they did what they did. At the end the audience is rewarded because the film's title is explained. Trust me ? the end does not justify the means.Should you see this movie? Only if you want a movie that has a lot of build up and very little climax. It would fare better in a small, independent movie theater rather than on Megaplex screens. In fact, I could see a professor using this as a teaching tool in a Psychology 101 or Sociology 101 classroom. It made some valid points about how people can manipulate one another on the Internet. The point is well taken, because I certainly felt manipulated by the movie trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember in the very late 90's discovering the world of Yahoo chatrooms ... talking this way and that way with total strangers, sometimes being myself, sometimes lying through my teeth. Creating new usernames as a female to talk to lesbians every once in a while seemed a fun thing to do as an 18yr old lad, never succeeding to convince any to talk dirty to me. HA! The things we do.And that is where this movie comes in. Meeting people online ... checking out their profiles and thinking ... "yeah ... not bad", talking more online and getting to know them and developing feelings for this entity, god knows where on the planet, typing their words to you and maybe, just maybe feeling the same way.And how much of it is true ... ?This was an intriguing watch, playful and suspenseful and by the end, full of heart that is a far cry from the gripping thriller documentary style movie portrayed in the trailer (which I saw after at one reviewers request) but none the less, I enjoyed the movie for piecing together something many of us have done ... but just not to these extremes. Give it a go ... =]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If somebody made me choose a favorite film genre, psychological thriller would quite possibly be my answer. Films that include incredible twist endings (Oldboy) or have elaborate story lines that make you think (Inception) are definitely some of the best times to be had when it comes to an entertaining movie experience. Catfish was marketed as a film that was not only a thriller, but also contained "a shattering conclusion" that was compared to Alfred Hitchcock. In the end, it didn't really have either of those things.Catfish had this vibe the entire film like it was leading towards something dark near its conclusion. As Nev makes his way to Michigan, you get more and more anxious as he nears his destination. Even the music gets really unsettling. Is Megan's family going to be a bunch of chainsaw wielding cannibals or have Angela and Vince been keeping a kidnapped girl named Megan chained in their basement for weeks to lead young, single guys out there for them to torture as some sort of twisted way to get off? No, it's nothing like that. Catfish never really became thrilling or even came near diving into dark territory.What Catfish winds up being is an interesting character study presented as a documentary. The film's heart resides in who Megan really is and how the entire experience affects Nev. Once the pieces of the puzzle are put together and everything falls into place, Catfish turns out to be a very raw, emotional, and heartfelt film. What's intriguing is the film revolves around Facebook and with The Social Network hitting theaters in about two weeks, it seems like a bit of a bold move.What is arguably the best scene in the film is when it's actually explained why Catfish was chosen as the title in the final minutes. It is a pretty incredible explanation and fits the film perfectly.Catfish isn't necessarily a bad film, in fact, it's pretty powerful once it really gets going. It probably isn't what you're expecting though. While Catfish is laugh out loud at certain points in the film, at its core, it's a documented love story that mostly resides on the internet. Maybe it just comes from personal experience, the way the film was presented, or the on-screen presence of the characters in the film, but Catfish felt genuine which isn't something that can be said about many films that have come out this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A documentary about meeting someone on face-book and wondering if they really are who they say they are. Surprisingly Gripping.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary about a man (Nev) who starts a relationship with a woman he meets on face-book, and starts to wonder how truthful this person is. If you watch the trailer for this movie it is very misleading, not to say its a bad movie but it's not at all what I expected. This is a true life account that I'm sure has happened to many people. An 8 year old girl named Abby starts to send Nev paintings she has done after seeing a picture Nev took in a newspaper. Out of that Nev begins to talk with Angela (Abby's mom) and it carries over to Megan (Abby's sister). After quickly falling in love with Megan, Nev soon discovers Megan may not be who she says she is and plans a trip to visit her and find out the truth. Every once in a while a movie comes along that you just have to keep watching and your not sure why, and when it's over your not sure why it had this grip on you, this is one of those movies. This is not for everyone, being that it is a documentary and slow in parts, but it is very interesting and has an ending that sneaks up on you and affects you in a way you can't explain. At least it did to me. I give it a B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that I'm not allowed to request a refund or sue the producers of this movie for the entirely misleading, and at some points, outright lying trailer!If you have seen the trailer, you would expect a thriller movie with the real story happening at some point after they find the empty farmhouse. The trailer states that:"The final forty minutes of the film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride that you won't be able to shake for days". Sure, being surprised by the lameness of the final 40 minutes, and then angry about this kind of tricks could be described as an emotional roller-coaster."A bizarre and completely unpredictable mystery" Unpredictable because the trailer is deliberately misleading."A shattering conclusion" Who was shattered by that conclusion? Can you imagine a more anti- climactic conclusion?And when you find out what the movie is actually about? Sure, some people may enjoy exploring the "unknown variables in internet relationships", but are those the same people that would go to see a thriller movie, based on the trailer?Maybe we should cut and copy together all of the love scenes from Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, and then make a trailer portraying it as a romantic comedy!!!Seriously, they might as well have put a picture of themselves at the theater exit, laughing and rolling in piles of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguous Spoiler -- CATFISH - The Ultimate Bait &amp; Switch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the edge-of-your-seat preview in which CATFISH gives you a taste of the suspenseful meeting of a random Facebook friend in person? The text appears on screen: THE LAST 40 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND. Intrigued by the preview scene of the dark rural Michigan town, one naturally would assume the last 40 minutes of this movie would be a climactic mystery of disturbing horror and/or suspense. With the authentic camcorder cinematography and relatable cast of twenty-something-years-old New York guys who share the common human vice of an over-curious mind, one might also assume the film would be the long-anticipated, non-supernatural version of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity.Unfortunately, the only participants in this film who deserve a pat-on-the-back would be the trailer editors. Like most people, most of your excitement stemmed from the two-minute masterpiece of a preview or maybe the ambiguous two-sentence synopsis dangled in front of your noses. If you took the bait, I'm sorry. Truly, I feel your pain. Sitting through the second half of this movie is a bit like waiting for the bus: you somewhat feel the urge to pass the time by inserting your iPod ear-buds or asking the bum next to you for a swig of whatever he has in his brown bag. I suppose the only difference in this case would be that the bus never comes, no bums can afford movie theater prices anymore, and you just paid 10+ dollars.Without giving the ending away (because I do feel a sense of enjoyment when other people share my painful experiences, similar to if I trip over a crack in the sidewalk, it is quite funny to watch the unsuspecting walkers behind me do the same), it would be apt to say that this movie could have been a two-hour nightly news investigation. Before the credits began to role, I somewhat expected Ann Curry to appear on the screen stating, "This has been Dateline NBC, I'm Ann Curry," in her frighteningly dramatic, deep voice. And it would have been a damn good Dateline.Despite the sheer disappointment this movie will leave you drenched with, the first 40 minutes of the movie deserve an A+. The characters are easy to relate to, the story unfolds at a decent rate (in the beginning), and the suspense is subtle yet recognizable. As the film progresses, the development of the characters is spot-on and the mystery begins to unfold. Then, much to the horror/suspense-goers disappointment, the story hits a brick wall. Here, you might just want to walk out of the theater because the entertainment aspect of the film has ended.Overall, even though I admire the creators of CATFISH for their ability to outline the problems of technology and social networks through an intriguing story, they should have just sold it to Ann Curry. Whether you are Catfish or Cod, do not take this bait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Try to avoid as much plot details about this dark, and compelling documentary as possible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film centers around photographer Yaniv "Nev" Schulman, recorded by Ariel Schulman, and Henry Joost. This is all I'm going to reveal about the plot, because I strongly believe that you should see this movie knowing virtually nothing about it. If I even gave a synopsis, I'd be giving too much away.It's a film with a rather dark tone, and smartly edited by Zachary Stuart-Pontier. The documentary does make some strong points, such as "Who is this person?" "Who can I trust?" "What's real, and what's falsehood?" It makes one wonder what length some will go to hide the truth, and wonder what they would do in a situation like Nev's.The film starts off rather charming, but eventually the film ends up becoming so nervously unsettling, and emotionally devastating that it's painful to watch. I know it made me not want to know what happen, because it just so hard to fathom, but I just decided to grit my teeth, and keep watching. The film is highly thought provoking, question raising, and the tone Joost, and Schulman set helps the film immeasurably.The film is hardly ever pretty to watch, but am eye opener to be certain.I give Catfish *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once You Know It Is Fake, It's Just A Run Of The Mill Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at Sundance, and no, I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but the real issue is that is being marketed as "true" when it is anything but.If it was a true story, it would be quite shocking. When I first saw it, I didn't see the ending coming. But once I did some more research, I realized that, as a written script, it was pretty tame. Imagine a Lifetime Channel movie of the week, but shot in documentary format, and you'll have a good idea of what "Catfish" is.Of course, I had to do some digging to see there was no truth behind the story. For one, Angela's Facebook page mentions nothing of the fact there is a movie coming out about her or her daughter, which would be something you would tell people about, if just to dispute things that may cast her in a bad light (The Facebook page was last updated on July 29th 2010). Also, in the movie they watch Youtube videos of her daughter, but after looking up these videos I saw they were uploaded around the same time that the filming of "Catfish" took place, so that is pretty convenient as well, and with only 35 views, does not make sense because. . .well I won't spoil that either. (BTW The Facebook profile of Angela that I checked was posted on this Youtuber's account, so it was not a fake one made after the filming by a fan.)The big thing, though, is that with such a shocking ending, I find it unbelievable that Angela would sign releases allowing her full name and image to be used. All in all, it was a mediocre film, and that is the real truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is my opinion that this awful crap-fest belongs on a dung-heap. What were the (ahem) filmmakers thinking? Honestly, really.First of all, this is not a thriller at all. It is not suspenseful. It started out interesting but lost me after the deceptive reveal. Not the storyline's deceptive reveal--the marketing dept.'s deceptive reveal. But by that time, it's too late. I mean, come on, disguising this movie as a thriller was the first sin.Secondly, once I was there, at the point where I knew it was too late, I was stuck watching a real bore of a documentary about real people with really boring lives. Okay, so the catfish story was pretty cool, but for crying out loud, I had to wait until the end of the movie to get the story? And...it was the only redeeming quality of the movie. Other than that, it was an otherwise absolute snorer.Finally, this movie should be up there with some of the other bad movies on this site, including: Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2, Manos: The Hands of Fate, and Daniel - Der Zauberer. Although, this will probably never happen...not so long as there is vested interest in promoting this movie as a thriller and not as what it really is: a lame excuse for a documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most human beings have two eyes. One left eye, and one right eye. Catfish pries open your third eye above the two you were born with. That eye is the eye to sense bulls*** from a mile away. It makes you think about the people you associate with online, and the people you come across with on Facebook, the oh-so popular networking site.Upon finishing this film, I was unsure of what to think of it. "Real or fake?" was the question that popped in my head. Could this be just another false documentary teaching us a lesson, but using actors to portray realistic people? Or was this an authentic documentary showcasing one person's real life experience on the site, and having his brother and friend film it all? My opinion is that this is reminiscent of a reality show. Some scenes are fiction, but somethings are authentic. I really can't say if this is real or fake. But I assume 70% or less is real.The plot is one of those like Paranormal Activity where you can't reveal too much or the whole thing is ruined. Basically, Young New York photographer Yaniv Schulman's life is put on film by brother Ariel Schulman and friend Henry Joost. They show his relationship with a supposedly eight year old girl on Facebook named Abby who is a child prodigy when it comes to painting. Yaniv will send pictures to Abby, and is told Abby paints them with remarkable talent.As time passes, Niv shows extreme interest for Abby's family, including her alleged half-sister Megan, and the mother Angela. Once he uncovers some evidence I won't spoil, he goes out to meet the family. There is when the movie becomes a total enjoyment.Whether fact or fiction, the film makes you think. It succeeds in making you ponder or contemplate the people you associate with on the web. Being an avid reviewer, a social networker, a Tweeter, a Facebooker, a Youtube personality I wonder who is watching my videos. Of course my personal information is nothing but private unless I have a strict build up with the person I discuss with. I haven't ran into any true problems on the web. I consider myself extremely grateful and lucky for that.Catfish succeeds in being an entertaining time capsule of what will soon be the once popular social network. Facebook will eventually die out just like Myspace, but we will have this film to look back on. While 2010 had one more movie based on the site called The Social Network, Catfish deals with Facebook and it's people. TSN was all about the creation of the site, and the problems Zuckerberg and his friends ran into. That was a totally different film, and well worthy of the Golden Globe wins. Catfish is a one of a kind species that shouldn't be thrown back into the water.Starring: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman, Yaniv Schulman. Directed by: Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler.I had a lot of doubts about the truthfulness of this movie from about 10 minutes in. I knew there was a "twist" and guessed what it was pretty quickly. Still could have made for an interesting story if it were true. Personally, I think it was completely made up. As I said, I had my doubts right away. However, when they picked up the mail at the farm, my doubts were absolutely confirmed. First, how did the post cards just happen to be there after they had been in Vail for two weeks? There was only one other piece of mail in the mailbox so it's not like no one had picked up the mail in a while. Second, why where there post office stamps about returning to sender why they were still in the mailbox? That gets stamped by the post office after you write "return to sender" on it and stick it back in your mail box.Bottom line, the movie is completely made up.</fullReview>

And if it is indeed real, the motivation of the filmmakers themselves are unclear.But there is a truth in Catfish that reflects a lot about ourselves. For most, the Internet is a place to merely extend their social life. But for some, it could be the only place where they could find it. We are called to be mindful of these people. This is a movie for our time. 4/5 StarsNote: The trailer is indeed misleading, which may have caused much disappointment to viewers with a specific expectation.

		<fullReview>The trailers in the theater lead me to believe that it would be be a suspense/thriller type of movie. When I saw the film it was totally a drama film about a crazy woman's life drama. When I saw the trailer, I thought it was about a young guy meeting a girl online and then in person, but when he met them in person something horrible was going to happen (like the blair witch project). It turned out to be a crazy old lady trying to get some attention because of her own boring life. After, the guy in the film find out he was speaking to a fake, he continued to try and figure why she was a fake. Well, the movie is not suspense, scary, thriller, or anything close to it, I which the marketing would have made the trailer as drama and not suspense, very misleading.</fullReview>

This movie starts with documentary style and video shot using handy-cam. We all friends were guessing in the whole movie that now some good twist will come, some real exciting will happen, but the movie is deadly boring and awful. This kind of movie, I believe any person can make at home with a normal script. Neither the script nor the direction is worth watching. I mean horror is no where, not even anything exciting.

I nearly hit the eject button thinking that this was nothing more than an amateurish attempt at an 'artsy' film. Just stay with it and you will soon be drawn into an intriguing real life story with a surprisingly emotional twist at the end. The film stirs up a range of emotions that you rarely experience in todays high budget, digitized action flicks. I wish that I could tell you more but that would spoil the whole thing! I will only say this; the film could not have been done prior to the days of social networking where "friends' can pour out their innermost thoughts for the world to read. A very humanistic portrayal of the strengths, talent and weaknesses behind the faces that you see every day at the grocery store or walking down the street.

So it's clearly not a documentary except for the fact that the woman in the second half of the movie was being documented. The issue with the movie is that it sells itself as a documentary, yet the actor has a grin on his face the entire movie, never disappointed or sad that he's been scammed. The moral of the story is don't pay money to hear this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie I wish I didn't sneak in to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw Catfish, Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. I wish I could say that this "reality thriller" or as noted by most a "mockumentary", was worth the free ticket I used. But the whining of Yaniv Schulman at his director for "pushing" him through the film was anything but dramatized. Of course the initial plot was very intriguing, a guy starts to fall for a woman he met online. He talks to her, and her family, and even buys paintings from the 9 year old sister. Going into the film thinking it was a thriller like most things I had read beforehand, I was holding high expectations that were soon shot down. But unfortunately all I could think of toward then end was man I hope some huge Hillbilly comes out of the barn later in the movie with a banjo and someone dies. The "actors" in this movie, as I try to portray this as a documentary, were anything but real life. The emotions of everyone except for the mother , Angela, were dull and put on. I do give it to Angela for having both the creepiness and sadness to make you have a different outlook of her. But I don't have much to say of Yaniv who throughout the movie was trying to portray, very unbelievably at that, a heterosexual man. There was constant reading which made him hard to believe he was in a documentary.This movie isn't even worth wasting a free code for one of those DVD boxes, let alone seven bucks at your local theater. Since there really wasn't a climax to the movie since you go in knowing that the woman he fell for was fake, and there's really no resolution to the film I cant even recommend this film to high-schoolers looking for a place to make-out, for fear of death by boredom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspires Awe/Revulsion, Difficult to Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Awe is from the reality uncovered behind the mystery the first half of the film is devoted to investigating. There are a few moments of fantastic surprise.The Revulsion one will likely discover occurs during the thinking/discussion that occurs after the film, when they realize the amount of manipulation by the filmmakers on both their subjects within the film and the audience. With their endless pasted-on smirks, its hard to discern which of the two they perceive to be the bigger dupes. Unlike films (like the comparably classic MAN BITES DOG) that explore similar themes of manipulation and non-fiction/fiction blurring with intelligence and dignity, these filmmakers have taken a story with a real humane potential and bankrupted their morals to create a sensational tabloid-like experience, more likely to titillate certain members of the Youtube Generation/make a few bucks/create some buzz. Inevitably, Catfish is a challenge to review because to continue to discuss why the film inspires such varied emotions would be to give too much away. And to encourage one to see the film in order to further the conversation would be to promote the careers of people who have no business meddling in non-fiction (or is it? In this case, who cares?). If only there was a way to see it for free... I'm sure the Youtube Generation can think of something.</fullReview>

There IS no surprise, no shock, nothing that would be of interest to anyone with half a brain..... I mean, I realised what was happening in the first TEN minutes of the film, and I am not normally so intuitive, believe me! I really cannot believe that the 'revelation' came as a shock or even a mild surprise to anyone!! It was all so LAME....!! I truly regret that I wasted my time sitting through it.

		<shortDescription>Disingenuous and mean-spirited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironically I found this to be a very disingenuous and mean-spirited film from the start.Initially the film makers make the case for an adult man striking up an innocent online mutual appreciation with an 8 year old girl who also appears to be a talented painter. Very early on we are given several scenes where the main participant and his friends are filming their surprise at clues that all is not as it appears with the little girls story. But their body language and giggly, childish demeanour suggest to me that they have already done much of the "investigating" that would later come to pass in the narrative. Their big joyous grins and covering of stifled titters at the situation suggests a prior set-up of these early moments on film. This isn't a problem had they then continued their google detective work and simply exposed their stalker-slash-victim as just another online Baron Munchausen. But we are later treated to a cringe-worthy 'look through your fingers if you dare' scene where the central participant reads private texts between himself and the beautiful older sister of the girl whom he has struck up a sexting relationship with online. By now we know, that they know the whole thing is a fake, so why we are given this scene where he lays shirtless in bed reading aloud and mocking masturbatory texts between himself and the target, knowing all the long this online profile is a lie? It is very unsettling. Who is fooling who here? When they meet the target, we are given enough evidence to deduce that it is in fact not the youngest daughter who is the painter in the family, that would be the plain, unglamorous mother who is not a slim, ethereal beauty as imagined in her portrait. The older daughter and love interest is of course nowhere to be seen and can't be reached by telephone. We deduce she is entirely a romantic fantasy persona of the woman's creation.Her deception is of course deplorable, but the film crew go on to perpetuate this online fantasy as much as she has, and furthermore have hunted her down, attempting to confront her but afraid of the consequences. After several polite but awkward meetings, it isn't until an hour in to the film that we see any hint of humility from the film makers, where the truth about the her online fantasy life finally comes out in the "open", well - filmed from afar without her knowledge. Later she is interviewed on camera and pretty much bares her soul to these virtual strangers in a tearful full confessional. Yes, she was a foolish woman, but this took guts and at no point did she ever seem antagonistic or volatile after her lies had been exposed. Let me be very clear - The woman was a fraud. She seems to be leading a very hard life looking after a young daughter and two severely disabled step-sons. Finding a creative outlet in painting to relieve her daily grind, and taking an online flirtation WAY too far appears to be her biggest 'crime.' I feel like they catfished this woman as much as she catfished them. I sympathise with her as a struggling mother and carer of disabled relatives, and not with the three smug, smirking New York art student types who in the end exploited her as much as she initially fooled them. They knowingly perpetuated this fake relationship as much as she did. And early on in the film they make it pretty clear what is going on when they discover the songs the daughter character had passed off as her own work are simply ripped from youtube by other artists - they could have ended it there, but they were clearly too invested in making a global mockery of this unfortunate and foolish woman, when the sensible thing would've been to just gently cut communications with her online, or at least curtail them to simple passing pleasantries. Instead they continued a pseudo-romance and sexting relationship with her, all the time filming a condescending one-sided interaction just to for their own amusement and a juicier documentary.I felt a strength of character from her that I never picked up from the chattering, giggling immature film makers. To open up about her silly lies so candidly on camera is a very brave and honourable thing to do. Ironically, I never felt like we got to know the film makers as truthfully as we did her. Although the film makers put themselves in this unusual situation and took it way further than most would, they always had the security blanket of the camera, they were never laid bare like their subject was. I applaud her for allowing them to make this documentary.What I take away from this movie is that today, many people are out for themselves and whether you're posing as a pretty young singer/artist online or exploiting strangers for your student film career - you had better be on guard and be out for yourself because someone out there is looking to f*ck you over unless you do it to them first. Neither party gets my full sympathy, but if anything I side with the woman as the more innocent party since she was clearly already a very damaged person with immense responsibilities and chronic low self-esteem. A trio of young, single privileged Millenials in New York who perpetuated and inflamed this woman's fantasy deserve nothing from this, but I hope they at least learnt from the experience and put their talents to better use in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dishonest trickery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a few months since I saw this film, and I've had some time to process it. As plenty of folks have noted, the trailer is absolutely misleading -- almost funny, since the entire PREMISE of the film is "dishonesty" (something the filmmakers express horror at). This is not a shocker, not a horror film, the "reveal" is not surprising at all.I have also noticed that nobody (here or in paid professional reviews) has noted that filmmakers Henry Joose and Ariel Schulman are most famous for making the "fake documentary" horror film, "Paranormal Activity" (and the subsequent big money sequels). The original was a scary little low budget ($11,000) indie film, that was picked up by Steven Spielberg and shot to fame and money for the two filmmakers. That was in 2007; the events of this documentary happened inbetween the first two Paranormal films. I guess time weighed heavy on their hands. It also explains why the three young adult men seem to have oodles of free time and no apparent form of gainful employment.As noted, it is hard to believe extremely smart, college-educated, tech-savvy young hipsters in Manhattan/Brooklyn were naive enough to believe this story (about a child prodigy painter in Michigan) and her hottie teen sister, without the slightest research or fact checking -- or that they had their cameras turned from the earliest part of the story.....at a point where there was no reason to believe some big "mystery" would ever be at the other end. For all they could have known early on, this would be nothing but filming brother Yaniv ("Nev") Schulman's internet hook-up with a teenager. (Ew.)So in fact, my gut feeling is that everything here is staged, and even re-created, to make the documentary -- not too shocking in a pair of guys who filmed a "cinema verite" horror story and made millions off it. The only real part is that I think at some point, they DID get a copy of a painting (done by the adult Angela, not her 9 year old daughter) in the mail. I think that got them interested enough to start communicating with the family, and after that, the idea of exploiting them for a film mocking Facebook relationships must have seemed irresistible.That just gives the whole thing a glaze of slick, urban contempt for "those awful low-class people in Mid-America" (who are so unlike cool, honest Brooklyn hipsters) and makes the film come across as exploitive and cruel. Angela never really scammed them; she wanted some attention and some innocent (non-physical) flirting with a handsome New Yorker half her age. There is no indication she asked them for money, even though her situation (caring for her husband's two profoundly retarded and handicapped teenage sons) appears to be just wretched.Clearly, Angela has some serious mental problems as well, that they also exploited. Flirting is one thing; flirting in the identity of your OWN teenage (estranged) daughter online is deeply troubling, even incestuous.I also agree with some other posters that the final speech, given by Angela's husband, is both scripted and fake. He must be the most tolerant man in Michigan, to allow 3 creepy strangers into his home, hear about their association with his wife, expose his handicapped sons in a very unflattering way and then confess all this stuff about his wife. Why isn't he furious? Why doesn't he throw them off his property?The storyline of the homely, unattractive person (almost always a woman, though there is always Cyrano de Bergerac for the fellows) who masquerades in secret, to able to flirt with a handsome/beautiful and unobtainable partner, is a very old one and very popular in films and novels. Nothing new here, except the allusions to the internet and that Facebook lets you lie to people (yawwwn....). Like we didn't know that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dual Deceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken at face value, this is a documentary about how a young photographer was deceived by a lonely housewife... how he gently confronts her, discovers her desperate existence and gets a tearful apology.The way it unfolds is engaging. We do allow this woman some latitude. All of us can relate in some degree to the deep loneliness of a simple kind and the equally simple need for escape via fantasy.What we cannot allow is the deeper deception from the other side, the side of the filmmakers. This kind of documentary is becoming more common now, and that's too bad because it is a hard form to manage. The structure inserts the reporter as a key agent in the story, making it all but impossible to not be overtly manipulative.In this case, these three guys knew the Facebook character was fake, and decided to exploit it. They got lucky in some respects, but in others they made conscious decisions to extend the the story for the film's sake. I can understand this, but we have to be fair. There is manipulation and deception on both sides here. The drive in both cases is the same: to make a good enough story to hold a situation that selfishly sustains. They pretend to deliver insight on only one side of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other facebook movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marketed as an indie documentary about a mysterious facebook relationship, "Catfish" is actually a profound meditation on loneliness in the age of computer-assisted social networking. Nev (pronounced NEEV), the focus of this documentary, is a young, attractive photographer who is contacted via facebook by an 8 year-old girl who has painted a rendition of a photo of his that has appeared on the cover of a magazine. In rapid succession, Nev befriends, via facebook, the girl, her mother, her sister, and a group of their friends, all of whom live somewhere in Michigan. While in Colorado on a filming assignment, Nev, his brother and their friend (who are filming this documentary as well) begin to question the veracity of the emails and phone calls Nev has been receiving from this family. They rashly decide to go to Michigan to meet the family and get to the bottom of the mysterious facebook friendship that has blossomed. What they find is more poignant than shocking, and it will force you to confront the ways in which technology in the 21st century is ultimately powerless against genuine loneliness.</fullReview>

While the trailer is quite misleading it does not retract from the fact that this is a superb character piece. Even though it does show that social networking sites aren't safe and you shouldn't trust people online blah blah blah. I don't think that was the goal of the filmmakers, I think it was just to show the nature of human character. And to all those saying that it's fake, it's a pretty touching story even if it is (which I doubt because Nev would be the greatest actor in Hollywood if it is), just don't go into it expecting a thriller.</fullReview>

It is obvious to me that the director is in love with his brother, the lead actor. I don't think even Meryl Streep had so many intimate close-ups. That, to me, was the most fascinating part of the film. Deconstructing their relationship.In addition, there was a Forensic Files episode with a very similar storyline that resulted in a real life murder. It's a true story and was much more shocking and well conceived as a documentary than this movie ever becomes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catfish" is a really nice straight forward look into our new modern lives where we can create our own identities. Some, obviously, have more to run from than others. But NO ONE can claim they are innocent of complete and total truth.This movie left me with a very sad melancholy sense of how we identify ourselves. Without giving away much, I felt that there isn't a person in this world that wouldn't trade it for one they could control from scratch. To that, we see a lot of false hopes, broken dreams and reality that hits us too hard in the face. In essence, we feel more sympathy for the ones who would be deceptive over the ones that attempt to find deception since not one of us can deny we dream of others' lives. And sometimes, we believe it's better than our own. In this world...you can't blame the person for wanting a better life, if not even just imaginary.I really liked this movie. But I really don't like the people who made it. They seem to take joy in wanting to humiliate something they've already come to know. I do feel the redeeming value is when you do get the "real" story at the end. And it's heartbreaking and truthful. And you take all the supposed betrayal you feel and find that it is sometimes good that people will challenge your perception. The title doesn't give you an idea of what the movie is, but the explanation within the movie sure explains this idea.</fullReview>

The whole thing is clearly a rip off of two other genuine real life documentaries - 'Talhotblond' and 'My Kid Could Paint That.' Watch those instead and avoid this. (Unless you are happy to accept that it is fiction and ignore the fact that the film makers are trying to hoodwink you!) I hate being conned and felt cheated by this film. The smugness of Nev Schulman throughout the film is extremely annoying too! If he wished to make a film about the perils of the online world, he should have presented this as a work of fiction, rather than trying to replicate the techniques employed by the makers of 'The Blair Witch Project.' At least the people behind 'Blair Witch' revealed fairly quickly that their film was not actually real, whereas Schullman has continued to lie about the authenticity of his work. There are many obvious 'plot holes' which give the truth to the lie, but I will not list them here as I do not want to have to use the 'spoiler alert' banner!</fullReview>

Major spoilers ahead... The first half is truly amazing. It makes you wonder who the main character is really talking to and whether it is really a real person or if it's a pedophile. The tension is great as step by step they uncover the lies the other person has been creating. Then the movie slowly becomes bad, particularly when they set off to the person's house. The story then turns into a major WTF. Then momentarily after that it turns into a sob story of why she did it. This movie could easily been a truly terrifying experience if the people were some psychopaths like Texas Chainsaw. The buildup was great but the secret was not so secret.

		<fullReview>Everything surrounding this film gave it the feel of a cult classic and with a trailer that declares "The final forty minutes of the film will take you on an emotional roller coaster ride that you won't be able to shake for days". How could I not be intrigued? I was initially sceptical of the films realism, the acting seemed a little too awkward and the timing too slick for a "chance" documentary. For the first hour or so I was patient as the story slowly developed, but my patience began wearing thin as the predictable story unravelled and the infamous final forty minutes proved to be more of a gentle bike ride than emotional roller coaster. I wasn't sure what to expect as a "twist" but to say I was sorely disappointed would be an understatement of gargantuan proportions. The real/fake debate will long continue and that will probably be the most entertaining part for many, I personally found it to be possibly the most disappointing film I've ever seen.</fullReview>

The cinematography and storytelling style is very modern and reminds of creating a video blog. Also the implications of social media in everyday life does certainly play a role in the plot. But I wouldn't say that the movie is too self-reflective or pays too much attention for the online media. The emphasis lies on the real social relationship that is developing between the characters and the lies on which it is built.

Essentially, this film is one big lie (once again, including the trailer.) A filmmaker has no right to complain that he is being lied to while patching a hidden microphone to his chest. He bemoans being made a fool after a series of too-good-to-be-true incidents occur. But when it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have stumbled upon some deeply disturbed sickness, they continue to shoot for the sake of not being "lazy" and completing a film. It's akin to the age-old question of "Is it right to televise executions?" Some things are just not meant to be filmed. I do recommend the film "tallhotblond" which tells the same type of story to much better effect in a jaw-dropping manner. I guess the moral of Catfish was don't befriend eight year old girls on Facebook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of a man befriended on Facebook by someone posing under a fake identity sounds as if it should be a story of our times. But there are problems with 'Catfish', not least because the story is filmed as it happens, the victim is the brother of the film-maker, and so one can't entirely trust that his own behaviour is entirely genuine, or at least, uninfluenced by his desire to produce material for his brother. Indeed, the whole film has a sort of student-project feel to it, and the eventual truth is sad and predictable, not particularly interesting, and there's a kind of uneasy sympathy for the perpetrator, who is treated gently but of course, also very publicly exposed. There's no real questioning, on the other hand, of the motives of those on the other side. There must be better stories lurking on the internet than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I call shenanigans!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two huge problems with this movie:1) It is advertised as having a "Sixth Sense" type of surprise twist that you "must see" before someone "spoils it" for you and that you will be taken on an "emotional roller-coaster ride" for the last 40 minutes. None of that is true, there is not a big bomb dropped at the end. What happens is slowly built up to. To use the roller-coaster analogy, two thirds of the movie is a slow ascent to the top, then the last third is a straight, unsatisfying, plateau. I was not totally surprised or shocked at the last part of the movie (they basically hint at it long before) and it was a HUGE let down if you go by the movie's advertising campaign.2) This is not a documentary; at least a large part of it is not. The story has a lot of holes and you can catch the main guy acting, but there are also several technical give aways. This is supposedly shot with several cameras at the same time, all of varying sizes that produce various degrees of picture quality. One of them is of extremely high quality, very professional looking, and another looks like an ordinary small photo camera that happens to shoot video. At one point, we are supposed to believe we are looking from the angle of the cheap camera, yet the image is high quality!!! In a couple of places they used sound effects to help the story, and if they embellished the sound, you have to ask, what else did they embellish? I have used one of the cameras they have and when you are holding it and you move to place yourself in a better position, there's a certain look to that movement. The way their camera moved looked completely fabricated and unnatural, just like "Cloverfield", trying to achieve the "documentary" feel. In several spots, the lighting was just too good for something that was supposedly shot as it happened. The framing constantly looks heavily planned. There are some out of focus shots that are meant to suggest a "raw footage" feel, but were obviously on purpose.I would probably had liked this movie much better if it had been released as a movie shot in documentary style and they didn't have this whole charade about it being real and about how awesome the ending is supposed to be. It has its moments, but there's no need to insult people's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chappy Watched: Catfish - Movie + Seasons 1-3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard of catfishing and what it meant but never really knew the story of how it all began.This was a show I stumbled upon just flicking channels and decided to watch. After watching about three episodes on TV, I decided to watch the movie and then after watching the movie of Nev's story, I marathoned all three seasons.Wow.I'm just blown away by some of these stories. I've never been catfished and I can't understand why anyone waste all this time and energy into being this different person?So after Catfish: The Movie explored Nev's story, he joins his brothers buddy Max, who was not in the film, to travel across America to help people in the same predicament as he was.Nev and Max make a good team; they would have to with all the together time these two would have filming this and Nev seems to be the hopeless romantic of the pair while Max is the realist.One thing that kind of annoyed me, they're always try to find some deeper meaning to the catfish. After dealing with the person who emailed them, they head off to talk to the catfisher and get their side. Most times there is a story but sometimes they try to dig to get one when sometimes, people are just assholes!As the show started airing and word starting getting around, I started to wonder about the truthfulness of the stories in the later season; how much of it was really people in need or people just looking for their 15 minutes of fame.I don't think you can have a 'relationship' with someone without having seen them, let alone one episode where a couple were 'engaged' without even meeting each other.And that takes me to my next point: Webcam not working? Bullshit! Most modern computers with webcams, most modern phones come with cameras and even if they don't, webcams are dirt cheap to buy.On the rare occasion, some of these people even brought gifts or sent money to the catfish! They were the moment where I just wanted to reach into the screen and shake these people.I did like how, even being a MTV show, they still accepted gay and lesbian catfishes.The soundtrack is pretty cool too with a mix of pop and alternative music, with the artist and track listed, in case you want to buy it.It is a good show, eye opening, but good. Not something I would watch again though but I will watch more if and when it airs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant film about lonely people creating meaning in their lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly stopped watching the film after twenty minutes because I don't have much interest in a documentary about the lives of privileged 20-something boys. I am so glad that I continued to watch (because I had paid $3.99 and I was determined to get my money's worth). Very soon after I began fast- forwarding to see if something might catch my interest, the film took off in a new and fascinating direction. It became an absorbing and haunting mystery, though not in any way the thriller implied in the trailer.Last spoiler alert here.Is the antagonist mentally ill or just so burdened with the hardship, isolation and emptiness of mainstream American life that she developed this unusual creative outlet? If she had not infringed on the lives of other people with her rich fantasies, would we have any reason to question her sanity? The question arises throughout the film as to whether Angela is being exploited by the filmmakers, but their kindness, compassion and lack of judgment (at least while cameras are rolling) absolve them of wrongdoing. I remain concerned that the viewing public is now aware of her name, the names of family members and her home address (not carefully enough obscured during the making of the film). Hateful narrow-minded individuals in our society can behave like trolls online and in real life. I will not be surprised if some IMDb reviewers discuss revulsion at her physical characteristics in contrast with Megan's. Angela is so vulnerable that I question whether she was capable of giving informed consent to having her real identity revealed. I can only hope that her identity and location were falsified by the filmmakers.By the end of the film, Angela emerges as a woman of quiet courage and strength willing to accept much (not all) of the responsibility for her behavior and its impact on others. Her sincere tears are not hidden from the camera. At no time does she slam the door on the filmmakers or ask them to leave out in shame or anger. At no point is she humiliated or vilified by those she has deceived. I hope that audiences will be as gentle with her as the makers of the film were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow, this did surprise me, not the story or really its enactment - but the ending. it was so thoroughly unexpected to find that the best most profound words should be given to the least developed character. it is difficult to say anything about this movie without giving everything away suffice to say it was so wonderful to receive such insight at the end from such an unexpected source. and that i think is what pushes this film above its peers. here is a story that we have all heard before, all experienced. the internet is a treacherous beast and frankly we believe our virtual friends at our peril. but the story doesn't end there. firstly we see who these people are who decide to invade our world with their make believe. and we find that perhaps they are also special as we learn just what might make them behave in this way, and then we find that really the people who are the losers are not the people who make the stuff up, but us for never believing in them face to face in the first place. oh this is a wonderful film, and i hope that everyone can watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This generations social media it is hard to see and believe that someone is out of reach or unknown. Half of the population in Australia is on Facebook, this is certainly guaranteed. But what if the person you thought you knew turned out to be the unknown? "Catfish" is a documentary of 2008. In Schulman's and Joost's journey of self discovery, "Catfish" is the documentary of this generation. "Catfish" is a thrilling and an engaging documentary.the story follows a young man called Nev, as he develops an online relationship with an entire family, as the story slowly unfolds it leaves Nev going miles to find out who these people really are. Most of the filming is done by Nev's brother Areil and Henry, although there is quite a few raw pieces in the film i have to give them credit for not giving up on the quest that they have had. This documentary really tries to bring the elements of the genre together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story goes fish mongers use to take cod from Alaska and ship it in a vat to china. They would turn mushy after all that time so a man had an idea to put catfish in with them to keep them agile and tasty. Going through life we meet people that keep us on our toes, keep us interesting, these people are the catfish in our life now as a reviewer I am going to tell you Nevs. Told through the eyes of Schluman and Joost's the classic story of a journey to the unknown into social media. This outstanding documentary describes the events of Nev as he develops an online relationship with an entire family hundreds of miles away. The story that unfolds as he drives to Michigan in a quest to find out who all these people really are. The open and closing scenes are both interviews of Nev and his feelings towards the Wesselman family, this depicts the change mentally of Nev from start to finish. Super imposed titles were used in this documentary to show information about Nevs journey. The documentary explores the theme of self discovery and deception to depict what can happen in social media as Facebook had just became popular, this shows the positives and negatives of instant messaging and the ways we use social media. Many people will feel "Catfish" by Schulman and Joost's is a sensitive documentary about Nev and the positives and negatives of social media and the deception of families and the people in lives that are our catfish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish Review - Maybe "Spoilers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish: A documentary of online relationships, and finding your unknown partner. Is she real? In this day and age of social media it is hard to believe that anyone is out of reach or unknown with around half the population of all of Australia on Facebook, this is even more guaranteed. But what if the person you thought you knew all about actually turned out to be the unknown? This is the premise the 2008 documentary 'Catfish' (introduces the text). In a dramatic thriller with an interesting storyline likable star and an engaging story of self-discovery. The story follows a young and promising photographer and his online relationship with a little girl named Abby whom share paintings and photographs. Only adding her entire family on Facebook and getting into a relationship with her half-sister 100's of miles away. Starting to get attached to this Megan saying I love you on numerous occasions without actually knowing this person or seeing her face-to-face, and the adventure of going to Michigan to see Megan, and finding secrets that don't add up, finding secrets about Angela, Abby and Megan. This film started out as practice for young filmmakers Joost and Schulman, but as the story kept going it turned into a juicy story that at the time was unbelievable, and started their film careers. This film may seem raw in some places, but it is a credit to them as buddy filmmakers. One aspect I really enjoyed was the contrasting of the music between the beginning and the end of the movie, it's a light tune at the beginning and dark at the end Catfish was a great and wonderful thrill ride and it was a decent documentary with interesting plot lines and a great story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Online realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish follows the story of Yaniv Schulman (Nev) who agrees to be the centrepiece of a documentary for his two friends who track his online friendship with Abby, a young painter who sends him paintings. Soon however he is introduced to her family online and Nev starts to build a strong online friendship with Abby's sister Megan, only something is amiss.This documentary is something many people can relate to in this modern age of social networking. Managing and building contacts online, forming friendships and relationships and sometimes everything works out great, and sometimes there are surprises, and this 2010 film brings about many surprises for Nev and his friends.The technical marvel of this film shows the scary nature of what the average individual can accomplish online. Through searching through people's friends on Facebook to analysing people's own recorded songs to those that have been implemented from other websites, but more so the ability to simply use other people's photographs for your own personal use is something quite scary, and yet people do it for their own personal reasons, and in the essence of this picture, we are watching people's emotions tested in this marvel of online story telling.There are many boards and forums depicting the true nature of this documentary, whether it is faked, scripted etc. Whilst the realism of the whole story is quite shocking and maybe difficult to comprehend, I myself have used online dating/friendship sites and can testify that not everything is as rosy as it appears on screen.But Catfish isn't necessarily about whether it's fake or not. It's about the story and the very real aspect of our current online mastery. And this film depicts that through the use of Facebook, through the questionable phone calls and all technical aspects that make the internet such a phenomenon. And through this Catfish is a very entertaining story that depicts the technical age through some wonderful and varied editing, picking up on Google, Sat Navs, Facebook etc and is quite different from anything that's been done before.This film spurned a TV show in which Nev and his brother travel across America to meet people and to give them help in meeting their online romance, which for the record is shorter and usually more interesting than simply watching Nev and his hairy chest for over an hour.Nevertheless this is unique and if you've done the whole online thing, it makes it quite interesting to see someone else go through it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Concept - Falls flat of Delivering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not much you can really say about this film without including spoilers. However, the basic plot follows "Nev", as he starts a new friendship/relationship with a family online (namely over facebook). Throughout the film we see this story develop, until we see that not everything is as it seems.As I watched the trailer and got a grasp on the basic story, I thought the film had masses of potential. As a regular user of social media, I found the 'documentary' in places a bit unbelievable. The last 40 minutes of the film suggests like the story is building, but for me, it never fully delivered.A truly great concept, but for me it didn't quite live up to expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fish Out Of Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It doesn't feel right to give Catfish three stars, because it may be many things but 'Average' is not one of them, and yet going as far as 'Good' seems too far somehow, and 'Just OK' would undervalue a thoughtful piece of work. It is an intriguing film, and certainly holds the attention. Is it really a documentary? Are Ariel and Henry really filmmakers and Nev the aspiring photographer? In the end they are convincing enough, as is the whole premise, but the questions that Catfish asks are spoken as soft and subtle enquiries rather than loud demands for self examination, which perhaps they should be. The outcome is eyebrow-shifting, but not really a surprise and it seems like arch naivety for the filmmakers expect us to be shocked. Despite this Catfish is a touching piece of filmmaking and worthwhile sticking with to the end, even if it's only to find out where the name comes from, perhaps the most interesting aspect of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catfish is a great film about trust and online anonymity and how it can be taken to advantage. This film follows the relationship between Yaniv (Nev) and Abby, an 8-year old girl who loves to paint. These two individuals expand their knowledge of one another.This film is great with some good character moments especially with Angela near the end, I love how the filmmakers chose and observational take to make us seem like we are following Nev's life. Everything in the film feels real because this could easily happen to other people and it probably does. Nev takes it one step further by surprise visiting the family. Catfish is a heart-wrenching film done in a very good way. 8/10 Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I got 'catfish' into watching this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a name like 'Catfish" I wish the documentary was about good seafood cuisine, but it isn't. It's about the shiftiness of truth and lies on the Internet. It's seem like it would be a great documentary about the psychology of people who live through personas online and how the anonymity of the internet can allow them to make their persona life seem bigger than their real life, or say or do things that they couldn't do in public. The movie barely touches that; instead we get a documentary about a young man name Yaniv "Nev" Schulman who trying to meet a woman name Megan in real life, after a long affair with her, online. Filmed by his brother Ariel Schulman and business partner Henry Joost, the documentary crew guerrilla style filmmaking followed Schulman on the journey of falling in love with a girl he meets on the internet, but later finds out that she may not be exactly who she claimed to be online. The movie was market as if a thriller-like terminology. The trailer acts like it was an Alfred Hitchcock's type of suspense as if Megan end up being a serial killer or psychopath. It may have been a tad misleading. The story is extremely contemporary. Anybody who dealt with people online such as having a Facebook or Myspace account, knows that some of them might be lying on who they are. It's nothing new. Without spoiling the movie, in my opinion the ending wasn't really that shocking. It was pretty damn predictable. Still, there is questions how real the documentary is. Some viewers believe Catfish to be a fake documentary or a hoax. Even famous documentary director Morgan Spurlock thinks they knew beforehand who was Megan was, due to the obsessively documenting Nev's online relationship due to the release that there might be highly good chance that she might be a fake. Anyways the results of finding out who she is, isn't scary, but sadder and more melancholy about how one woman's life dreams dies and how hard her life is now. It just shows that some people are so lonely that they are willing to do anything to feel connect to somebody. Some people needed a fantasy world to get through their own misery. Anyways, the movie became such a success that Schulman teamed up with MTV to produce a reality television show similar to the idea of the documentary but which focuses on the lives of others who have been entangled in an online relationship with another person. His brother and his friend Henry Joost end up directing Paranormal Activity 3 and 4 after this. Even the word 'catfish' got famous- as it's now known as someone who pretends to be someone and create false identities on social media, particularly to pursue deceptive online romance. The title of the film comes from the story about how when fishes are caught and are transported in tanks, they would often die because they wouldn't swim around and keep themselves moving. So, people would put catfish in the tanks with the other fish to keep them stimulated and moving around. He says that catfish are people who keep you on your toes. Like people in your life who will keep you going in all situations. Overall: That's the best part of the movie. I didn't like how it was promoted as "A riveting suspense thriller with a jaw-dropping twist" with neither riveting nor suspenseful twist. I felt 'catfish' by this movie's marketing. Still, it's a pretty good movie worth watching so check it out if you want to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating and eye opening---very entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked to discover all the controversy around Catfish and the validity of it. I never questioned while watching it whether it was real or not. I questioned how much it was edited certainly. The film starts out completely blindly. What I mean is unless you know the ins and outs of the entire story, you will really have no idea what is going on. But still you will find yourself completely riveted by this story unfolding. Then gradually you will start to put together the pieces and it will shock and rivet you and parts will make you angry and while the film makers seem to really go out of their way to make this woman and empathetic character, I personally felt no empathy for her. She committed fraud and played with this man's emotions and who else knows who else she manipulated. My only complaint with this film/project is that I don't feel they handled her very well. They basically let her go scott free from committing fraud. But regardless you will be completely entertained, it really is an eye opening experiment in online social media and how far a person can go to manipulate.One of the things that makes this documentary so successful is that subject and co-filmmaker Yaniv Schulman (Nev) has really great raw chemistry on screen. He just feels like a normal, every day joe and he's easy to watch and you'll feel like you are there with him. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost are the people behind camera. I feel like Henry had barely any point in the film, other than the occasional appearance and Schulman makes minimal appearances either. But most likely both men had a lot to do with the film behind the scenes and they deserve credit for editing and creating a really interesting project. Angela Wesselman-Pierce is our fraudulent villain although the film does not make her a villain. Instead she is painted as being a sad, lonely woman who struggles with her life. I get all that but she is also a complete liar and manipulator. It is amazing she allowed this film to be released but I suppose it made her famous.In a world of documentaries that have become main stream and ever increasingly popular this one holds its own. Certainly you would think that a film like this would have been made and then done and done again but its the first of its kind I've seen. Considering its very important message and how extreme the situation is, it is a timely and eye opening message to everyone who uses social media. And above all else it is entertaining and that is the goal of film...to entertain and it does that. A must see for documentary fans and anyone looking for a captivating film. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish - Just Watch with Open Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains SPOILERS.OK, 5 out of 10 only because if you want to sit through this film, all along thinking it is real, then you are in for a treat. If you wish to sit through it with seeing the trailer and hoping for a reality-thriller, then you may be disappointed. Look, Catfish is about as good as a found- footage movie is to a 15 year old who loves Facebook as Cloverfield is to a time traveler from the early 1900's watching some crazy sci-fi thriller from the future. If you take any time to watch the special features with the "documentarians" talking about their film then you will know it is all a farce. As they talk about their "experience" dealing with Megan and Angela, it only takes a few seconds to realize they are just a bunch of freshman filmmakers who have us all duped into thinking this is "real." A little bit of advice - stop snickering on a one-take studio set up and we might not think your story about contacting and talking to "Megan" is BS. I mean, what other found-footage movie takes itself seriously enough to have the Universal intro as a simulation of Google Earth with the familiar music and intro? I have been watching and making indie films as long as I can remember and watching these kids talk about "talking" to Megan and all of their useless misadventures along the way is about as pointless as a peeing section in a pool. It is great that someone can make a movie and really grab the attention of the person who sits in front of their computer late-nights, calculating on Google Street View, and wondering what it would be like to talk to the people who occupy said-building in Michigan. But, really?! Would some 40-something year old crazy lady living in a suburb of Michigan really be smart or scheming enough to purchase several Blackberry's, all with different purposes and identities, only to use them to get attention from some horny 20- or-something-year-olds who show up at her doorstep, only to find out that he is one of about 25 she has done this to before? At least make something crazy happen at the farm house (like you hinted to in the trailer) Perhaps this is like some elaborate scheme to reel in kids for the slaughter. That would have been much more exciting than a movie that made itself out to be a reality-thriller than one turning out to be a wanna-be documentary on the subtle craziness of the online, over-horned, Facebook fiends your parents warn you about. Just a warning to those that take this movie as a reality submission - remember - does real life sound this scripted and end at 90 minutes with a pretty, edited bow?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is what and what is not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Queries sustain interest. New York filmmakers Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost talk Ariel's brother Nev into letting them make a documentary of his fledgling photography career. Boredom is fleeting when an eight-year-old Michigan child prodigy named Abby sends Nev a painting of one of his published photographs. Abby and Nev converse back and forth through Facebook and then phone calls. Nev keeps receiving paintings from Abby, who introduces her 19-year-old sister Megan to him. Through Facebook Nev and Megan start a romantic relationship. When Megan sends Nev MP3s of songs she has recorded; it is determined that the songs are not really Megan. Now Nev wonders about Abby's artwork; is it really being sold at art galleries like her mother claims? Nev decides to take his "film crew" to Michigan and let Abby and Megan become part of the documentary. Nev has mixed emotions about the unexpected visit. He needs answers and what he eventually finds out is oddly outstanding. This film/documentary seems to start slow; but it doesn't take that long to have you hooked on the line and awkwardly reeled in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie for the Facebook era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, first thing's first -- you need to go into this movie knowing as little as possible about it, although at this point a vague idea of the plot is unavoidable. So I'm going to click the little spoiler box and spoil away.At its root the shock reveal of Catfish is almost a clich -- the hot chick on the Internet turns out to be anything but in real life. Although it's taken to extremes in the film, the basis is a pretty worn-out punchline by now. So it's surprising that the film manages to make an effective story out of it.The key is that rather than being simply a horrific image, Angela is developed into a human being whose actions I can kind of identify with. Certainly everyone, especially the introverted computer nerds among us, have built up elaborate fantasy lives, although we rarely let others into them. And the life she makes up is nostalgically attractive enough to seduce the film's protagonist. But moreover, she's symbolic of the new culture of social media -- where we lose the ability to determine between real and fake friends, and where such a distinction ceases to matter.Like a lot of documentary films, its quality is less a result of the filmmakers' talent and more in their serendipity in stumbling across a compelling story. Joost and Schulman's editing of the film manages to keep the shock building in the eerie middle segment, but they spend too much time explaining everything repeatedly at the end. But it's those act-two moments of unease that really stick with me, where things just stop making sense. I seem to be feeling that more and more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do believe this movie is based on a true story, just not the one they portrayed. Or maybe it was a variation of it. Regardless, this sounds awfully similar to the story of Nancy Nusbaum, also known as:Aglaia Alexis Stanton Alexis Sinclair Mary Anderson Jill Gabriel Nancy Keegan Alexis Lux JadeThis woman is infamous on the internet for scamming men online, pretending to be a young hot woman who leads an interesting life. In reality she is an unattractive older woman seeking to scam people out of their money, time and affection. It seems she has run every scam in the book, even pretending to be a spouse of a 9/11 victim.There were websites dedicated to stopping her and news stories about her if you do some searches by her numerous aliases. Search for Den of Angels and the story in the Trentonian for a start and the comprehensive story is on the Newhouse News Service and entitled Web of Deceit Unravels by Robin Gaby Fisher.As far as why I know this, I think I had the unfortunate experience of getting to know her back in 1993. At that time she was known as Alexis Stanton and allegedly living in Newport Beach, CA. She is real good at what she does and real twisted.This movie was excellent and really brought back some memories.</fullReview>

There's mystery involved here, yes, in the story of the perils of Internet dating, but the outcome is sad/poignant rather than frightening in any sense.Plenty has been made of the documentary's realism, and indeed transgressions have been made to give it a more "cinematic" feel. Some scenes are obviously staged, but nevertheless the editing is very good, giving this a well crafted feel with a linear beginning, middle and end. CATFISH sheds light on the human condition in a way I found insightful and engaging, so it gets a thumbs up from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie does what great documentaries do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catfish" is an odd, strange and very moving documentary that begins as a portrait of the 21st century online romance, then turns into a baffling mystery worthy of Hitchcock and then emerges as a touching portrait of human identity. If that all sounds too complicated, relax, the film is one of the most approachable documentaries you are ever likely to see.The story, told without narration, begins with two young twenty-something brothers Ariel and Yaniv Schulman (nicknamed "Nev") and their friend Henry Joost. They run an office in New York where they make videos and photographs of dancers in their element. One day Nev gets a painting in the mail of one of his photos from an 8 year-old girl in Michigan named Abby Pierce. They begin talking on the internet - she is very wisely accompanied in her correspondence by her mother Angela.Through this correspondence, Nev discovers that Abby is a child prodigy who's talent for painting is beyond astonishing. Through Facebook, Nev also meets several members of Abby's family, including her father Vince and her much older half sister, a breathtaking beauty named Megan. It is with this older half-sister that Nev's attention quickly focuses. She is a model and a multi-talented musician and she and Nev quickly form an online romance. They correspond on Facebook, through text messages and through emails. She sends him hundreds of photos and occasionally records covers of songs for him. Through Photoshop, he crops photos of the two of them together, apparently topless. Eventually, he is able to talk to her on the phone.Let me stop for a second. Here is where I am going to discuss some crucial plot points of Catfish that may be spoilers. I won't boldly give away anything but if you're intent on seeing the movie cold, you may want to stop here.Nev gets excited about Megan, he talks to her constantly and is thrilled that she is so eager to talk to him. Yet, as their correspondence continues, he begins to get an odd feeling that something isn't right. He is perplexed after their first conversation on the phone that the voice sounds "a little too mature". When she sends him a song that she says she's recorded for him, he is disturbed when he uncovers the same recording on another website under a different name. Nev and Henry and Ariel begin to suspect that Nev is being buffaloed, that Megan isn't quite what she claims to be. If this is not Megan, then who is she? What follows is a step by step investigation to uncover the truth about Megan, beginning with her location in the small farm town of Ishpeming, Michigan. Nev, Ariel and Henry pile in the car and head for Ishpeming and pay Megan a visit. What happens next, I won't reveal except to say that what started as an interesting expose into online romance turns quickly into a touching human drama. What the guys find out about Abby's family is heartbreaking, especially Abby's mother Angela who is one of the most endearing people I've ever met in a movie. She is deep, complex and achingly sad. What we discover about her and her family is very odd because it affirms the idea that things are not always as they seem, in life or on the internet.I know that it sounds like I have given everything away but as the mystery of Megan and Abby and Angela unfolds it only gets deeper and more profound, especially during the closing scenes when all of the pieces come together. Even as the closing credits emerge, the mystery is still unfolding and some of it we watch with bated breath.The thrill of "Catfish" is the narrative. We meet these three guys and all through their journey we only know what they know. The film does what great documentaries do, it uncovers amazing facts and fascinating people through the simple process of investigation. Some have questioned the validity of Catfish, of whether or not the facts are real or fiction. Is this all made up? Did these guys stage all this in order to make a compelling documentary? Well, I will let you judge for yourself, all I can say is that I bought their story. I found it fascinating, heartbreaking and very moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even taken at face value, Catfish is a let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film taking it at face value, but even on that level Catfish is a let-down.It's essentially a tale of a filmmaker/photographer striking up a relationship with the older sister of a "child prodigy" who's been sending him paintings of his photos. Except that it turns out she isn't who she says she is and made a whole load of stuff up.Of course, the devil is normally in the detail. Iin this case though, the detail just *isn't* of that much interest.It's clear early on that it's probably just some sad individual making stuff up, and essentially that's what it is. We don't need the overpadded and overlong middle section with them driving around in a borderline creepy manner making a big deal of their investigation. It smacks badly of the "make something seem more important by making it longer" school of filmmaking, and indeed the whole film could- and should- have been half the length.(The three flatmates also come across as particularly unsympathetic here. It's clear to us- and them- that "Megan" is likely a sad individual with problems, but they're going around with perma-smirks treating it as a game to amuse themselves.)Catfish isn't interesting or intriguing in terms of Nev's involvement in the online relationship with "Megan"; he twigs very early on- and very abruptly- that she's not who she says she is and immediately switches to amused incredulity. No slow reveal, shock or betrayal.And once they meet up and eventually confront Angela/Megan, the most likely explanation turns out to be true. The online "Megan" was essentially made up by Angela, a circa-40ish woman trapped in a domestic life looking after her two mentally disabled stepsons. One suspects- as does Nev himself- that she has a crush on him, and that she did the paintings, not her "child prodigy" daughter. Who'd have guessed? (The fact that the resolution of this almost-forgotten last point is so mundane, when it appeared to be of significant intrigue early on, sums up the film perfectly).People have made a big deal about Catfish saying something about social media etc. It doesn't; people have been making up rubbish about themselves on the Internet for over 15 years, and the fact that this one was done through Facebook doesn't make it fundamentally different. Maybe it's news to people who only got on the net more recently, or who are very naive about Facebook etc.One might argue that you can't criticise something that was (supposedly) real for the way it turns out. No, of course not- but that doesn't mean I want to watch a padded 90 minute film about it. I've seen one-hour documentaries about other false-identity cases that were more interesting than this.If Catfish *is* fake, BTW, you wonder why they made is so pointlessly mundane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish: Faux or not it still is Fresh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are those people who are catfish in life, and they keep you on your toes. I thank God for the catfish because we would be droll, boring and dull if we didn't have somebody nipping at our fin. Catfish is yet another one of those documentaries that really hooks you with its premise and despite not delivering what you expect from the trailers, it still manages to be intense and surprising. The trailer made me think it was yet another faux horror documentary film like The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity, but this in nothing like that; it is more of a suspenseful drama about online relationships and the way we communicate virtually with our friends. Many Facebook users will probably think twice about beginning a relationship with someone they've met online since in today's virtual world not everyone is whom they seem to be. Catfish can be educational since it serves as a sort of character study on human behavior and interactions between each other. I think Detroit News movie critic, Adam Graham, best described this film when he said it tells a devastating story that couldn't be more relevant to our times; who we are in real life versus the way we present ourselves online. I think the best way to enjoy this documentary is not knowing much about it before hand so I won't give too much information away about the plot. Just watch the film first and then read the reviews because Catfish will probably be enjoyed more the less you've heard about it.Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost are aspiring filmmakers who decide to make a film about Ariel's brother, Nev, who is beginning an interesting online relationship with a family he met in the virtual world. Somehow they thought documenting his relationship with the Wesselman family was an interesting idea so with Nev's permission they begin to film his story. Nev works as a photographer in New York and one of his pictures gets published for an important magazine. One day he receives a painting of his own picture from an 8 year old girl named Abby. Nev is impressed by the painting and therefore begins to communicate with her mother Angela who claims Abby has made a lot of different paintings and sells them at an art gallery. This is all narrated by Nev since Ariel began documenting the story once his brother already had begun speaking frequently with Angela. Nev sends Abby several pictures and she sends him different paintings of his pictures, and thus their friendship began. He becomes friends with Angela and her family on Facebook and begins to have feelings for Megan, Angela's nineteen year old daughter with whom he begins to interact frequently. Everything seems to be going well until Nev discovers some of the things Angela and Megan have been telling him aren't entirely true. Henry, Ariel, and Nev decide to travel from New York to Michigan and surprise Angela and her family in order to try to make sense of everything or uncover their lie.I do not want to give away anything that happens later in the film but that is basically the set up that the trailer gives us. Many people who have seen this film claim it is all fake, but in my opinion at least half of it is real, at least the part where the kids travel to Michigan to meet Angela. They probably figured out they had a decent story to tell and went back and acted the beginning so we could understand what was going on. Either way, real or faux, the documentary manages to hook our attention and keep us guessing as to what is going to happen next. It also serves really well as a social message as to how far we can go with these virtual interactions. There is a lot to be learned from Catfish and the movie really was satisfying in my opinion as it kept the intensity and thrills throughout the entire 90 minutes. The less you know about the film before seeing it the better. Even though you might predict what might happen when the kids get to Michigan, it's impossible to predict the reaction that both the Wesselman's and Nev are going to have. I really thought this was a very interesting documentary and it kept me hooked even though it wasn't at all what I was expecting from the trailers. 2010 was a great year for documentaries, and perhaps Catfish was forgotten due to all the competition it had, but it still is a documentary worth watching for its story and educational value.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and controversial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot of good comments about Catfish but it failed to live up to expectations.From watching the trailer, we are made to believe that the film is thrilling when in fact it is very slow to develop.Also, it's hard to tell when the actors are acting and when they are behaving "naturally" because it seems like they are often faking emotions when the film has been marketed as a true story.The reason why I didn't give it 1/10 (which I was tempted to do!) is because the theme of the film- how an internet relationship is not always what it seems- whilst not the most innovative of ideas is still a intriguing one.I do think the way the main actors behave in the 2nd half of the film to be disrespectful and tasteless (you will understand if you bother to watch this film but I wouldn't recommend it)and I think that their arrogance makes it difficult to sympathise with them when they discover all is not what it seems (with regards to the internet relationship) All in all, I think that the film had a brilliant theme which failed to translate into a top-notch, inspiring film. But for a low-budget film, it's not too bad I guess...I'll leave you to decide!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cathfish is the true story of a young photographer, Nev, who forms a growing online friendship with various members of a distant family: a child artist, Abby; her attractive older sister, Megan; and their mother Angela. The talented family, and the relationships that form, are interesting enough for Nev's buddies, film makers, to start documenting the story of the contact.Events lead Nev and his friends to conclude that they must cross America to meet the family face to face.Nev's journey of discovery, which plays out with growing tension, is well worth travelling with him. What he might find, and how he could respond, asks questions we might well ask of ourselves and will have you thinking and discussing long after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filming style aside, 'Catfish' is not fake, and you'd best think about it seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch "Catfish," your first inclination will be to doubt its authenticity. There's no way Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost just randomly began filming Ariel's brother Yaniv and his online friendship with a 9-year-old artist and it happened to evolve into this fascinating story, right? Well, whatever you think of the movie's self-involved documentary style, what it reveals about the online world we live in is both culturally and humanly powerful, and the more you surrender to the truth of it, the better it is.You don't need to know much going in because it's a documentary, but Yaniv "Nev" Schulman is a photographer in New York City who specializes in dance photography. One day, he receives a painting of one of his pictures in the mail and he learns it's from a 9-year-old girl named Abby. Nev starts to commission pieces from Abby and they develop an online friendship. Soon, however, they make a discovery that leads them to be skeptical of Abby, and Nev, Ariel ("Rel") and Henry begin to search for the truth.Nev becomes deeply involved in this online friendship, connecting with Abby's family including her mom, Angela and older sister, Megan, who is extremely attractive from what can be seen on Facebook. Nev starts to become really close with Megan, which adds a layer of romance into this online thriller of a story.The Internet and social media have never been more prevalent in a film as they are in "Catfish." Schulman and Joost also employ techniques to remind us of how steeped in the digital world we are. Much of the time you're looking at a pixelated computer screen at messages, images and words being typed. There's also the use of Google Maps to show how the three of them are traveling. We're so familiar with Facebook and Google Maps that they can evoke certain feelings when utilized to tell this story in a compelling way."Catfish" stands out from other documentaries in that it's not about an issue, there's no secondary footage and no one is being interviewed in a formal way. It's much more like a found footage movie in the way that the people behind the camera are part of the story and the purposes of the camera's presence are known to all involved. That's probably a large part of why people resist embracing it as authentic; we're used to seeing this style in fictional movies.The direction enhances what's already a compelling story. We yearn to know the truth once we discover there's reason to think Nev's very believable situation is in fact just a facade. As evidence begins to mount, it becomes no less intriguing because we have to know exactly what's going on and more importantly, the truth of the "who" of what's going on.What awaits is something you'd never expect. At one point you wonder if it won't take a turn for horror ? it's that suspenseful. Instead, something powerful emerges that speaks to the world we live in today as well as the connection between the online world and the human experience.At this point, it sounds weird to call "Catfish" generation-defining. But as it continues to age, it will only be seen more and more as the film that hinted at what life has become now that so much of our world and thoughts and feelings exist in a digital space. I watched this film just three years after it came out, and already we have a huge real-world example in the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax. That should be a pretty clear sign that "Catfish" isn't fake and that this exists in our world."Catfish" will continue to be an important film the more and more that we use the Internet to forge our identities (no pun intended) and try to make meaningful connections with others. For now it seems like a rare occurrence, something factually vague in which blame should be primarily placed on the one who has been deceived for not being skeptical, but it's easy to say it would never happen to us. Just imagine as more and more children are born into the online world and how inextricable their online identity will be with their real-world one. It will only be harder to discern truth from fiction.~Steven CThank you for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish is a documentary to see for all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you consider yourself a catfish? It's a puzzling thing to ask, but after viewing the film, you begin to wonder if you are one...or if you indeed know someone that is. I do hate when I miss out on the chance to watch a lot of great films late in the game, meaning until they're put out on DVD or on TV years later. While Catfish is not necessarily an "old" film, I was so captivated by it that I wished I could have seen it sooner. Like other reviewers have described, it's a weird film to describe without giving it away, but it's a great documentary nonetheless. But it is quite simple once you think about it, in a boy meets girl kind of way. A photographer becomes Facebook friends with a young artist who made a painting of one of his photographs and ends up "friends" with this young girl's family. He soon become involved with the Megan, the girl's sister, but he soon discovers that Megan isn't really the girl she's made him to believe. It's a film that surprised and saddened me to see. It doesn't take a real "dark turn" once the facts begin to reveal themselves, but a quite sad and painful one to see. I felt varied emotions about the truth: shock, disbelief, but mostly...empathy. After viewing, it makes you ponder how one's venture out of loneliness becomes too much to hide and checking one's facts early on can save a lot of hurt in the end (the internet is pretty amazing in that respect). People have doubted the authenticity of the documentary, but I enjoyed it and found it quite refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull pseudo-documentary about nothing much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two very irritating Jewish brothers make a film about the relationship between one of the brothers and a young girl who is supposed to be an artist. If you like to watch people playing about with all the boring paraphernalia of the Internet, and having arguments while crouching over laptops and Blackberries, this is for you. If you want to watch people discussing whether the picture of so-and-so on Facebook is really them or not... you'll be enthralled.This is a 'celebration' of the makers' own solipsism and vanity, and it exposes the cultural banality of the 'new technology.' It's a film about making a film. It's about chasing phantoms on the Internet - made by people who like (and live through) that sort of thing.Do you care whether this is a hoax documentary or not? Do you care whether Schulman gets to meet Megan? The 'authenticity' of the film is no more interesting than the film itself.Visually, it is dull. Mostly, you see 1) Schulman's very hairy chest, 2) Schulman's teeth, and 3) various computer screens. The supposedly brilliant paintings (who cares who did them?) are competent - but dull.As in the minds of people who perceive the Internet as a thing of interest IN ITSELF, dullness pervades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Catfish" is the story of a 24-year-old man in New York, Yaniv Schulman, who gets involved through the Internet with a family in Michigan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 8-year-old girl of that family, Abby, makes initial contact with Yaniv, who is a photographer of modern dance. Abby tells Yaniv that she found a picture of Yaniv's online, liked it, and painted a picture from it. She sends him a copy of her rendition, he is charmed, and the two begin an email friendship.Soon, Abby's mother, Angela, takes over most of the correspondence. Besides Angela the mom, there's Vince the dad, Megan the 19-year-old sister, and cousins and friends. Yaniv enters into their lives in a pretty big way, exchanges 1,500 emails with them over 8 months. Or maybe that was 1,500 emails just with Megan. The correspondence with Megan, which also includes phone calls, gets hot and heavy.The Pierce family becomes a big part of Yaniv's life, and so Yaniv's brother Ariel and his friend Henry Joost ask Yaniv if they can make a video documentary of his relationship with this family as it develops. Yaniv consents reluctantly. With Yaniv's life under close inspection it's only natural for all of us to start looking at this vivacious and artistic family from Ishpening (rural, Upper Peninsula) and wondering if they're really who they say they are.The three young artistes from N.Y. eventually make a surprise visit to the Pierces' home in Ishpening, and the family they find is indeed named Abby, Vince, and Angela, but they're not at all as they have portrayed themselves. In fact, everything was a hoax invented by Angela. She's embarrassed but amazingly gracious. She allows the filmmakers to keep filming even as she confesses that she'd made up everything. Angela isn't what she pretended to be, but if she had been honest with Yaniv online, it's unlikely she would have had such an intense relationship with Yaniv, would she? And her relationship with Yaniv, though a complete fantasy, was the best thing going in her life. Her real life is hard and sad.If the boys anticipate feeling any glee in confronting Angela and exposing her fraud, it is short-lived, possibly not lived at all, not a peep of glee. They're good boys, and it's to their credit that they can't muster any outrage at Angela. They catch on right away: If they had a life like Angela's they might be tempted to pull a like ruse, create a fantasy life online.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting &amp; enthralling all at the same time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do like a good documentary and this one certainly entertained, enthralled and amazed me all at the same time. It got quite a lot of notoriety when it came out, but I deliberately tried to avoid a lot of the comment spinning around the web at the time. I wanted to watch it (relatively) untainted by everyone else's opinions. I'm really glad I did because I found a really interesting film about love and deception that has the added bonus of being a true story (although some say not).Nev Schulman is a photographer who lives in New York. When he receives a painting of one of his published photographs, he is intrigued. When he finds out it was painted by an eight year old girl, Abbey, he is amazed. Abbey lives in Michigan with her mother, Angela and her father, Vince. They become friends via Facebook and Nev gets to know Abbey's mother and her half-sister Meg. As time progresses, Nev and Meg start to develop a bit of a relationship. Around this time the filmmakers, and Nev, begin to suspect all is not what it seems. They decide to go to Michigan to meet the family? and I guess that's about all I can tell you here.I really enjoyed this film, it's very well made with lots of nice little visual touches to offset the unfolding drama. As I said at the beginning, there was quite a bit of debate when this came out. It primarily revolved around whether it was a true documentary, or the filmmakers were making up a story. Well, from my point of view it looks pretty convincing to me, but I won't be entirely surprised to find out it was all a hoax. Either way, I had an enjoyable 87 minutes and so I can't really complain? Recommended.My Score: 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Props to the promoters ... no one would watch this movie without the deceiving trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to think that Buried (horrible movie) was the worst movie ever made. Now, that award goes to Catfish. It is a documentary and basically set-up similar to Blair witch project (with no climax). I think I wouldn't be so bitter if the trailer didn't say the last 40 minutes was going to be so scary. The last forty minutes are literally just when they meet the family. It's not even a twist as anyone could tell what was going to happen ten minutes into the film. There was absolutely nothing that was "thrilling" in the movie. I'm not even sure why they would bill it that way as not one person could come away from this movie feeling scared. People lie on Facebook? Is that really news? The movie was horribly directed and edited and it was hard to even make it through. The only reason I stayed with it was for the ending. I thought something incredible would happen. But just having the person cry and say I messed up is hardly a movie. Not only that but the title of the movie comes from a 1 minute clip in the last 2 minutes of the movie. Not one mention is made to "catfish" before that. This movie is basically something that a 6th grader would do as a project. I have a movie I made in ninth grade that would blow this one out of the water. Unfortunately for all of us, they had money to make this movie. They must be the ones tweaking the reviews on it as well as no one in their right mind could even consider this a movie. I could sum up everything in one minute and make it more interesting. Do not waste 90 minutes of your life on this movie, or I promise, you will be sorry!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had Too Much Going Against It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to make it clear that I'm going to come at this review as if this is really a documentary and not a fabrication. That being said, this was a film that really had a lot going against it from the start. First, it's a documentary. Now I like good documentaries. But few of them are worthy enough to actually deserve a theatrical release and a running time that exceeds 60 minutes. I could be wrong, but I think most people probably share my opinion on that, and so when a documentary comes along that is opening in theatres (and thus is going to empty a wallet of $10) and runs just a shade over an hour and a half, most people are just not going to show up (although in this case, not many people showing up still garnered the film over 3 million dollars, and I have to believe that that made it a pretty decent profit). Second, in this day and age of many a mockumentary, the makers of this film were starting behind the 8-ball as far as believability is concerned (Yet, I don't find too many elements here that seem fabricated). Finally, Catfish was described by many to be a thriller, and was even marketed that way, and yet, although there was an element of suspense about half way through, it was mild and certainly wasn't found throughout the film. So, if people went in to this cinematic experience expecting to see a genuine reality thriller, it's no wonder that they would have been disappointed. So, all of that to say this. I thought Catfish was pretty good...not the greatest documentary that I've ever seen, but it still kept my attention and made me want to stick around for the conclusion. That's more than I can say for many fictional films, let alone documentaries. And I thought it was a pretty disturbing snapshot of just how distorted things can get when people connect with someone on the internet they do not know, and are careless in their interactions. The lesson here: Check out the people your interacting with to make sure they are who they say they are (to the best of your ability anyway). Even though the end result here was not negative, and could even be described as somewhat touching, I dare say that there have been many other instances where the consequences of not being careful about internet relationships were tragic. All in all, a pretty decent effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect to be shocked or thrilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catfish" is one of those stories where things are not as they seem. It's deceptive, exhilarating, shocking, thrilling, and unsettling. Or at least that's what the producers have claimed.I'm assuming by now, most people have seen a fair number of reality, documentary stories where the people they have met online are not what they claim to be. I've seen "Talhotblond" and now that was unsettling, but comparatively, "Catfish" was bland, boring and ordinary. It's not thrilling because the filmmakers so gradually come to understand the deception that is occurring, that the audience realizes it at the same time or shortly before they do - which is very early on in the film.However, it's still good because this is what independent documentary filmmaking is all about. These filmmakers were looking for a story and when they found one right in front of them, they jumped on it. The result is that we were able to see most things unfold in real time and that makes it interesting in a much more real way. Our hero is Nev, he's the type of guy that we can really get behind and he's not just blindly falling in love but questioning and being skeptical when he should be, and that's good filmmaking. These filmmakers also wanted to show the good in everybody and that was just so refreshing that I expect better things from them in the future, and I might even recommend "Catfish", just don't expect to be shocked or thrilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never felt like watching an actual documentary. This is perhaps because the movie does not impose on you, it does not try to drive a point down your through as so many documentaries do. It has no agenda and even when you would think that there is a clear cut case there is still no culmination that will drive you to a stereotypical conclusion. The movie creeps into your mind while the issue of lies and betrayal lingers.Catfish is an honest, intelligent and deconstructive look into the modern social networking. But it is also a look into the human reality, choices we make and the consequences of our actions. Catfish is just one small step away from being a brilliant work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-watch for all Facebook and social networking fans. As is mentioned in the documentary's summary ? "This is a shocking product of our times'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I agree that I have been going a bit overboard with anti reviews related to Facebook and social networking in general. However, I guess this one would complete the trilogy and is supposedly a true-life example of the dark-side of excess (shall we say) ? Facebooking!According to the movie summary, filmmakers Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost document a story involving Ariel's brother, Nev, a 24-year-old New York-based photographer, and Abby, from rural Michigan who contacts Nev via Facebook, asking for permission to make a painting from one of his photographs. Then starts the online romance between Megan (Abby's older sister) and Nev, which leads to shocking revelation finally.I don't want to discuss much about this film, as it would become a major spoiler otherwise. I have no idea how true this documentary is, but it does give a good feeler into the power of social networking and the influence it is having on people's lives in modern times. The ending also indicates why the documentary is called as "Catfish", and it is quite an interesting one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching this at first because the description was vague and I suspected this was a "Blair Witch" kinda documentary. But within the 1st 15 minutes, it's clear that this was a real situation unfolding in front of me. Understanding that strong emotional connections, even love, can be found online and feel as true as any real-life relationship, I was totally intrigued by this journey they took me on. This was so well done that I felt an emotional investment to see how the relationship would proceed after meeting. Trying hard to not give anything away, it's amazing how different a fantasy relationship, that has overtaken a human heart - giving hope of love and happiness, can be so different when face to face with the real people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this movie had me thinking how phony it was. The lead actor was not convincing. His dialog, his expressions were unrealistic and contrived.Then he meets his internet friend in the flesh. Again, I don't believe some of the film footage here either but the actress who plays the Internet friend is spot on perfect. Her line readings and her expressions are absolutely spot on perfect. As I say in the title, if she is reading script, she deserves the Oscar for the best acting of the year and as good acting as I have ever seen in any movie ever.I am with the filmmakers all the way from this point on. Whoa, she's not like her facebook page but as we get to know her and see her in some of the close-up shots, she is actually beautiful.Then the bonus self-interview with the lead actor and his film-making friends. If they are acting here, it is light years better than in the movie itself. Which speaks to the film's authenticity... which I am not saying what that is... see no spoilers : = )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absorbing counterpart to The Social Network</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first question: is it real or staged? This story of a group of film- makers documenting a friendship midwived by Facebook has some plastic, contrived corners worthy of the hand-held aesthetic. What's interesting though is that it might not even be possible for the group of friends making the film to decide what's real and what's contrived. The film itself questions whether playing a role mediated by a computer or phone - and by extension, a film - renders the characters unreal. As in the recent Kiarostami film Certified Copy, or even the audition scene in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, there may be a point at which assuming a role where the role becomes fact. It depends upon the others' perspective.That perspective is what the film tacitly examines. The men who go in search of a person they know only through the internet are actually going off to validate their own vanity. Working in photography, film and communicating with an artist, they are image-fixated anyway: additionally, they're often on camera bare-cheated and the principal, Nev wears a brace for his teeth. It's to their credit that they deal with what they discover in a mature fashion, and makes us sympathetic for the drama of heartbreak - a universal storyline in a 21st century format.The film doesn't pan out how I was expecting it to, but this is a quirk of some very canny marketing. And the Catfish? There's an equivocal explanation at the end of the film which suggests that we all need to keep some interest in our life to prevent complacency, although I'm not sure how relevant or focused it is. On the whole this is a good-natured, perceptive and rather serious film that is an excellent, non-fictional corollary to The Social Network. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about Catfish, I was in the dark. Completely unknown to what would happen in it, and I always peeled myself away from it the best I could to ensure the best experience when I finally seen it.Having seen Catfish, I think the best way to start this off, is to say that I loved it! Catfish is a subtle, unusual story that is completely ? COMPLETELY ? unpredictable from the word go. Every action is unforeseen, every corner holds a twist, something that makes you question, makes you think ? everything you've ever thought about would happen in a film, never happened here, especially the way you thought it would. And man, is this one hell of a roller-coaster of a film! I would actually go as far as say its honest, to say the least without spoiling it.Without spoiling it, Catfish is a beautifully shot, unique documentary that is what we need nowadays, and especially with so much Hollywood films out these days, I can't help but feel? relieved that this came out.It had suspense, it has surrealism (when you see it, you'll know what I mean), and deep down, this is a story that makes you aware of your surroundings on the Internet.Honestly, I had no idea how this was going to pan out, desperately trying to make sense of it all. You knew that it didn't just? make sense from the word go.And, to see that this is actually a TRUE documentary? (Or so they say?) That's frightening. That's what we need nowadays. None of this "Found footage" stuff, this right is a gem in a haystack, and once you watch it, you'll actually appreciate the greatness, the honesty, the strangeness ? you'll embrace it, and once the credits stop, you'll sit there, thinking to yourself: "Wow." Would I go as far as say "Most shocking film of the year"? See, this is where I stopped and thought about it. It's shocking in a way that none of us are used to ? if you mean by "Shocking" by horror and thrill? No comment. "Shocking" as in something else? Yes. Absolutely. 200%. Once you see it, you'll know what I mean.Without saying too much? Loneliness can make us do things we don't usually do, but only do it to make-up for the fact we're lonely.So are you looking for a unique, strange film that dabs in sadness and honesty? And then Catfish is the film you should watch! Oh, and one last thing, make sure you're more aware of who you add the next time on your on Facebook!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish, the debut documentary from filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, has been hailed as "the best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never directed," and toting it as something "you won't be able to shake for days." That's at least what the filmmakers chose to put in the trailer.We follow Nev, a young photographer living in New York. He is contacted by a young girl living in Michigan who finds one of his photos and does a painting of it. He is instantly impressed and begins a correspondence with the girl, eventually leading to a correspondence with her mother and sister. They send photos and paintings back and forth, sharing messages and pictures via Facebook. Nev particularly gets romantically involved with the sister, leading to phone calls, text messages, and song writing.When Nev becomes suspicious of the truth behind a lot of what the "Facebook family" is saying, he decides to surprise them with a visit. I'm going to stop here, in part because this is where I have been instructed to stop by critics. I can't recall a film being hushed like this since Hitchcock's Psycho. I don't get why there is a need to disclose the ending more than any other movie. For me, one of the ultimate crimes a person can do is to spoil a movie.But I digress.The real crime here is what the powers that be did with the trailer. If this movie was presented not as a horror/thriller but as a documentary/social commentary, I would have been a lot happier. In the trailer, there is a moment when they show Nev walking up to the house of the "Facebook family." The picture fades, revealing Chris Bumbray at JoBlo.com's response to the film:"The final forty minutes of the film will take you on an emotional roller coaster that you won't be able to shake for days."To intensify the impact of these words, the filmmakers use some of the music that Mark Mothersbaugh wrote for the film, a great score in its own right, but inappropriate for this film. It belongs in a more traditional horror/thriller than in this documentary.The trailer plays a little on the same theme as Paranormal Activity did, though this is claiming to be a true documentary. Regardless of it's truth, what the filmmakers (or those involved with making the trailer) led us to believe is that this was going to be an intense, shocking film that would, as promised by JoBlo.com, something that would stay with us long after the film ends.I should have read that statement more closely. For the final forty minutes of a film to shock you, that would either give you a heart attack with the amount of shock and scare value, or it would be like letting the air out of a balloon slowly. What you get with Catfish is a creepy story about how communication and technology has evolved in such a way that people can virtually do anything they want to do.For those who haven't seen the trailer, DO NOT WATCH IT. It promises something it can't deliver. For those looking for a "hard to believe this is real" documentary, by all means enjoy. I was lead to believe this would be a thrill ride unlike any other. This is actually a nice companion piece with The Social Network, showcasing how much our world has changed from this one website.</fullReview>

Assuming you already know what the film is about, these three phonies make 3 million dollars off the back of some poor deranged woman who OBVIOUSLY is not normal. The crux of the story revolves around three snobs from NYC poking fun and getting a barrel of laughs out of a mentally deranged woman. The woman is mentally ill and rather than doing what probably everyone one else would have they make a fool of her in front of the whole world. They essentially get rich by bullying a defenceless woman looking for an escape from the harsh world she lives in. If there is any justice in the world we live in, these three will loose the lawsuits and be forced to compensate the woman they harassed. These three jerks deserve to rot for getting rich off the backs of the week and defenceless. THIS FILM WILL LEAVE A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the point, or missing the movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After catching "Catfish" this afternoon I was curious to read what other viewers had to say. But I only bothered reading the first 10 or 12 reviews here because each one was negative and dismissive. Each writer had little to say and precious few insights to offer beyond dismissing the film strictly according to the subjective criteria of "It's obviously made up, so it's fake and can't claim to be true." So therefore it's no good. But in their eagerness to judge (and to be the first to condemn) the filmmakers' veracity, the aforementioned reviewers completely missed the film's subtle intensity and dramatic tenacity. Perhaps those reviewers expected either a stereotypical "Silence of the Lambs" popcorn thriller or a dry-as-Sudanese-sand documentary ... and this film is neither, thank goodness. The climax is nothing short of a laconic tour of sublime dread and uncontrolled dissonance: That CAN'T Happen to Me. Reviews variously describing the film's climax as "fake," "a letdown" or "a manipulation" only serve to underline the film's theme: we're most vulnerable and susceptible when we can't see what's already happening to us.That the film is so unlike anything we've seen only hints at the reason why so many reviews focused on artificial issues ... like the minutia of lighting set-ups (if any), pixel resolution discrepancies (when apparent) and hints of post-production ploys and manipulations, rather than addressing the predicament exposed in the film's unsettling and ego-rupturing climax, which I found disturbing almost beyond belief.I'm rating this film 10/10 and a definite must-see, at least for mature film-goers who retain the imaginative willingness to leave their preconceived biases at home and who're also unafraid of spending 90 minutes continuously challenging themselves "What if?" ... because ultimately the answers will prove both provoking and intensely unsettling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is over hyped as a thriller but I can honestly say that the only thrilling part was right before the reveal of the twist. The story it built up very well and the acting is pretty great. I laughed at many point of the film and it definitely hooked me into the story and I felt almost nervous for what was going to happen since all the trailers and promos talked about thrilling scenes. I was kind of disappointed at the fact that it was nothing close to actually being a thriller. The twist was very interesting, and close to the heart since I know it happens in real life. This is a more extreme version of internet communication gone wrong. I won't say what happened since it is an actual interesting movie, but don't expect the movie to be a thriller, or else you will leave the movie with your head down and wanting your money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never saw the trailer so I didn't find it misleading but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...This is the single most worst piece of filmmaking I have ever witnessed because it is contrived. Firstly, it is not a documentary so why use the label? Documentaries are movies made by people like Michael Moore, Attenborough, Gore. They normally involve an exposition of a subject and crucially the filmmaker is in charge of the filing ad editing. Here we have three randoms: one pretends to be an internet sap who chats to an 8 year old then falls for fit older sister; random two, decides to film this on his camcorder/phone/any other shaky device in order to feign authenticity; random three, seems to be filming the other two on a professional camera. Classic documentary format: no, just a home movie trying to tell a story. Shows like "The only way is Essex", "Big fat gypsy wedding" are contrived reality shows. The people are really doing that stuff but the guiding hand of the filmmaker dictates the scenarios and direction. I've seen filming of gypsy wedding when the horse drawn cart had to go around the block several times as the producers struggled to get the material they wanted, hardly reality. In a similar vein catfish is carefully staged story, screenplay and storyboard is prepared and the actors are given some wiggle room to appear authentic. The only logical reason to call this home movie a documentary is in order to avoid it being called a home movie. The simple way to actually make a documentary is to allow independent third party film and edit the protagonists. Once I was aware I was being inveigled I lost any sympathy and did not trust anything on screen. Had they billed this as based on a vague true story I would have found it mildly watchable, but to call it a record actual events is a sin beyond redemption.</fullReview>

I can see where it provides the entertainment value for others since some of the scenes create a feeling of awkwardness or suspense for the viewer as the actions of the filmmakers make you nervous!Whether the filmmakers admit to it or not, it is a work of fiction using a reality TV show style to capture "raw" moments, which are mere re- enactments, conveniently filmed making it seem like the filmmakers got extremely LUCKY when they decided to begin shooting the footage. I applaud the filmmakers for putting together a mildly entertaining, slightly unique film that scored them a reality TV series with MTV. This is not a cult film, however, that will be viewed as a classic contribution to film, but it is worth the watch if you are bored.</fullReview>

That includes me, but to dwell on that subject primarily would be a waste, for there are many things about "Catfish" that we can be sure of.

		<fullReview>In my opinion, clearly a fake documentary in the mould of Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity (without the scary bits). &nbsp;And it is this controversy and doubt that is the real point of the film, miss that and you miss the main plot device.The question weaving itself around every character and element of the plot is the ethical and realistic boundary between appearance and truth, care and exploitation; what we want it to be and how much it matters. That extends to the film itself and ripples created by it. Are any of the characters any more or less 'guilty' than any other of blurring these boundaries? Are the producers? Are the marketeers? Are the journalists? Are we?The film's plot poses a number of areas to ponder. What is beauty? What is vanity? What is authenticity? What is friendship and love? How genuine are people with voyeuristic, superficial and creative occupations ( photographer, film maker, model, artist, dancer, musician)? How real is a filmed life? Why are the paintings of photos of performances? When is a song-cover an authentic artwork in its own right? How real would model and performer Megan be if she had existed? How real is a relationship based on a photo, texts, post cards and Photoshop? &nbsp;How genuine are feelings that evaporate when a person's appearance changes? &nbsp; How genuine is the concern of a brother when he coerces his sibling for selfish reasons? &nbsp;How much do we know about our family members? When does fantasy become adultery? How much are we entitled to know about other people? Are we entitled to create fantasies and facades? What is the Facebook profile? Are YOU the Facebook Family? Is this film real? Are the Facebook pages, accounts, reviews, blogs, articles, interviews, marketing about it real? And finally, do we want lives of bald truth or does it make us less nimble? There are many deliberate and non-deliberate clues to the lack of authenticity which are fun to look out for - why no disabled ramp on the porch stairs or a converted vehicle? How did the post cards get to be stamped with "return to sender" and post cards don't have a sender address on them. Why read out the sex texts at that point in the plot or turn up at the creepy house after dark? How were the phone conversations so audible to us when Nev claimed he couldn't hear properly on a chairlift of all places? Why phone not Skype? Most tellingly perhaps, Nev creating a Photoshopped relationship called "the future?". But the main one being that the odds against three film makers who specialise in docudramas happening upon a highly engaging fantasist with a husband with a good relevant catfish anecdote in time for a film festival are exceptionally high. I'm not sure what the odds would be of a gay guy falling for a girl.A&nbsp;clever and intriguing film on several levels that will keep you thinking for days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining &amp; A Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this on DVD this afternoon. At first, I thought I'd made a bad choice of movie. I checked the DVD cover, realised it was a documentary, so I somewhat begrudgingly stuck with it. The young men making the film are bright eyed and bushy tailed in a non affected kind of way. I watched a bit more, still unsure how long I would last. The initial camera work is youtubey, and there's little ready narrative to latch onto. Don't let that put you off. Opening scenes spend a lot of time in the filmmaker's office/studio where the lads speak rather off handedly about this Facebook connection brother Nev has made with a Michigan girl who's sending him paintings. This moves to his making contact with other members of the Michigan family, Nev speaking with them by phone. We share the filmmaker's surprise and growing intrigue at developments in this relationship and the continuing arrival of paintings. Nev reads for the camera the correspondence with the mother, older daughter and of the wonderful success young painting daughter, Abby, is experiencing in the family's hometown. Nev begins more intimate phone texting with the older daughter, Megan, who sends him songs to serenade their mutual affection. It's on her sending him quite accomplished songs on request, Nev gets an uncomfortable itch he needs to scratch. He searches the songs on Youtube, discovers Megan isn't the musician or singer of those songs, and the rest is history of a type you won't have experienced before. Here, I really begin liking this documentary. For the story to continue the only way forward is to unravel the mystery. So they do. The film makers seize the opportunity to take us to Michigan and a surprise visit to Angela, Megan and Abby. What is revealed is shocking, but what transpires is a genuine triumph for the viewer, made possible by the even handedness and whole heartedness of the film makers, particularly Nev. I'm rarely convinced or moved by attempts at absolution in film (Amadeus excepted). Catfish achieves this and more, without artifice. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if Ariel made a preproduction agreement with all the characters and made the whole thing up, the way the suspense was built and worked on my mind was worth the price of admission. Anyone who "spotted this as a fake from the first" should be checked for lack of imagination and generosity of spirit. Give the filmmaker a chance to get you to suspend belief, and give him credit for what he accomplished.If you have any experience on the internet, you run into people who have been sidetracked in life and seize the opportunity the technology provides to take the road they didn't travel, even if the experience is less than having actually traveled it. And on the other end, there are people who are open to a relationship that doesn't include physical proximity, but is purely of the mind. What would happen if these two have the opportunity to meet for real?That's the question the movie proposes, and it provides it's own unique and quite plausible, and even gratifying answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those docos that will keep you talking for a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish is a documentary that follows the Facebook-born Internet relationship between Nev Schulman (one of the directors' brother) and Melody, her mother Angela and the rest of her family. The title refers to the catfish, a fish used in the transportation of live cod to keep the latter moving and agile, and, by derivation, to define those people who keep others on their toes by giving them emotional or intellectual stimulus.Although the documentary has been accused of being a mockumentary, or at least a staged story, the directors continue to deny it. To me, the important fact is that, disregarding whether this is a real doco, a re-enactment or a mockumentary, the film poses the viewer poignant questions on our modern culture, the Internet, our online persona, social networks and human communication. Catfish poses many interesting questions about self-perception and identity through the Internet: Is the image we present to our Internet buddies our real self? In which way? In which degree? Is our edited life profile a real representation of who really are deep down inside? Is it necessary to present our real self to the world through the Internet to communicate with others? Does the way we present in real life and the virtual life differ and in which degree? It also shows the need of modern society to hide to connect, and to connect using a enhanced beautified portrait of ourselves. It also portrays the ugly face of many online dating experiences, those that dating sites forget to mention, or the people involved forget forever.This is is one of the best documentaries I have seen in the last 12 months. It is very entertaining, very real, in the sense that is a sort of visual video-diary, and the experiences and feelings that Nev shows are naive and raw, as flawed as ours could be, very human and believable. Moreover, the editing is fantastic as well as the tempo of the story. It is thanks to those, not just the story, that the viewer gets hooked on a film that is visually not very pretty looking or interesting a priori.A very engaging, warm, fresh and intriguing documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Catfish yet, then I would advise you not to read this review or any other. But, you can save yourself the disappointment if you're expecting some grotesque twist, because it really isn't too bad.Catfish succeeds in being an engaging, chilling and thought provoking documentary, exploring the dangers of the Internet, specifically targeting the grotesque Facebook! Part of the fun in "Catfish" is knowing as much as the protagonist, Nev, you don't know what's going to be up when he goes to this house and the suspense is incredibly well drawn out.Like "Audition" Catfish is a build-up. A build-up to a sort of disappointing climax (unlike Audition) but because it is so believable (well its a true story for Christ sake) it becomes quite chilling. you actually end up feeling sorry for the "fake" lady. I was expecting it to be some sort of mutant alien, a sadistic cannibal or even a satanic cult leader, but instead I got a human response. It actually paid off because the realism is so hard hitting.The acting is solid, you believe the people, you might even question if it is real footage. But I don't think it is. Overall, Catfish will engage you and leave you in suspense building you up to a climax that's real and quite chilling. Best of all Catfish has a message in it, a message that couldn't more clearer if you stuffed it into a metal pole and walloped you round the head. You shouldn't be disappointed, but you might be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in the shadows of David Fincher's The Social Network (2010), Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman's Catfish (2010) was at the top of my list of highly anticipated films this year, so I was completely stoked when it dropped into the Champaign area. This reality thriller tells the haunting story of Nev Schulman (Himself) and his budding cyber-relationship with Megan Faccio (Herself). All of the hype over this movie revolves around the shocking 'twist.' A twist so unsettling, you will leave the theatre with complete unease and a handful of questions. Well, folks, they are not lying. However, I have to say that the trailer is entirely misleading. You are actually in for a way better treat than you are expecting. This documentary is absolutely haunting, but in a completely different respect from other hand-held horror flicks (The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Paranormal Activity (2007)) because it is real. It is a product of our time. We live in a world where human interaction is just an emoticon away. You can completely connect with someone without actually ever seeing his or her face. This review is so difficult to write without containing spoilers, but I highly recommend this film. It is a true exploration of identity and the need for human compassion. Catfish will turn you from investigator to voyeur in a mildly suspenseful account of tragic and disturbing manipulation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Worlds (Real and Virtual) Collide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Catfish" is a sometimes creepy, sometimes sweet, ultimately deeply sad cautionary tale about social networking.Nev Schulman is the film's central figure, a photographer whose pictures are admired by a little girl who contacts him and with whom he strikes up a cyber friendship. Over time, he becomes friends with the girl's mother and then strikes up a virtual relationship with her sister. But once odd and slightly disquieting inconsistencies begin to emerge, he goes with his brother and friend on a surprise visit to this family he's never actually met to uncover the truth for himself.I won't spoil that truth in my review, though I can't imagine what happens has remained much of a secret. Let's just say the film illustrates how completely the world of fantasy offered by the Internet can tempt those who are unhappy with their realities. The problem comes when the two worlds merge and a person is no longer able to differentiate one from the other.There seems to be a lot of debate about whether or not this film is a hoax. I have no idea, but I will say that if the whole thing is faked, then the acting is fantastic and the point is no less powerful.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what i expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish was not at all what I expected; you watch the trailer on youtube and it seems like it's going to be the next Paranormal Activity. The movie starts in 2007 with filmmakers Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, they start to see a documentary unfolding with Ariels brother Yaniv (Nev). Ariel starts talking with a young girl Abby via Facebook she is a young artist, he then starts talking to her older sister Megan that he falls for and then starts txting, calling and sending pictures to each other. Nev starts off facebooking with Abby and sending her pictures to paint, as he is a photographer, the quality of her work is outstanding for an eight year old. Nev slowly starts to add Abbys entire family on Facebook and even talks to them on the phone, as he meets Abbys family he meets Megan and falls for her as she does for him. While this is going on Nev talks to Abby on the phone and her mom and is exchanging numerous paintings and pictures with Abby. I can't really reveal much more of story or ill ruin the film for you.This whole film is based around the idea of meeting people online and how it can or can't be dangerous. Facebook is used a lot in this film whether its showing the new characters or showing what Nev is saying to Abby, it is an interesting way of introducing characters because most of us can relate to Facebook and the "Add Friend" function. This movie makes you think of the power of Facebook and what it has enabled us to do, you can keep in touch with friends in other countries or even make completely new ones.There has not been many good documentary's of late and personally I wouldn't rush to see this film again id rather see something like The Cove, Food Inc or Winnebago Man (All great Documentaries by the way if you want to see a good one). This film is quoted as "The best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never directed" which are big shoes to fill so go check this film out and see if you agree with this quote. Catfish will be in New Zealand Theatres 12th May 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish may not feel like the most authentic documentary. But then again, when you're dealing with the internet relationships, it kinda comes with the territory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish is a "d o c u m e n t a r y" about Nev Schulman, a photographer living in New York. He rooms with his pushy filmmaker brother Rel and another friend. One day Nev gets a painting sent to him of a photo he published in the New York Sun. The painting is from an eight year old girl living in Michigan named Abby. Abby asks Nev if he can send her photos so she can make more paintings. Nev's says sure and from then on Abby's mother Angela consistently updates Nev about the family and they basically become pen-pals / Facebook friends. Rel speculates this talented 8 year old girl would be the perfect subject for a documentary and begins to document their growing relationship. As Nev's ties with the family develop Abby's older sister Megan, who is quite the "hottie" based from her facebook photos, starts to build a separate relationship with Nev. The relationship starts to become romantic as the two to talk and flirt, both online and on the phone. As Nev's feelings for Megan deepen he tries to arrange an real physical get-together. But when Nev and his roomies find out Megan has been lying about her singing talents, a little bit of investigation starts to unravel a list of lies. With an abundance of curiosity and a desire to conclude the documentary the three roommates decide to take a trip out to Michigan to discover the real truth. It's difficult to talk about Catfish because you really can't talk about it without giving the second half of the movie away. However I can say that Catfish was a enjoyable thrill ride of twists and turns. The trailer is a bit misleading, taking a sort of horror tone, but I feel it fits the theme of this film, which is illusion and deception. When the group finally gets to Michigan, you may be surprised at the outcome but I promise it's worthy of the mystery. There is a lot of discussion about whether or not this film is actually a documentary and I do have a strong stance on that notion, but revealing it would would take the fun out of the film. Honestly whether your on one side or the other Catfish still manages to say something poignant about life and relationships, and isn't that what all documentaries strive for?Who this film is not for: -People not interested in the softer and more sophisticated aspects of the human condition</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Catfish follows a young photographer whose Internet relationships with an eight year old girl who paints pictures inspired in his photographs, her nine-teen years old sister and their good-looking mother involves him in an identity mystery, always accompanied by both his brother and another friend who continuously film the whole experience. Despite its interesting and thought-provoking messages about loneliness, the pursuit of happiness and Internet relations, the first thing that popped up and surprised me is that we can't say if the story, the characters and the situations developing on screen are real or not. Even before starting to see the film, we are convinced it is a mockumentary, a false documentary; but as the film develops and our characters develop and finally expose themselves completely to us we can't help but notice it's all too human to be fake. It would take a genius screenwriter to have scripted what goes on on a character's mind whose name I won't spoil.As I said before, the film also makes statements about loneliness and the ways of achieving happiness while feeling lonely, a matter in which the film expresses itself very clearly and that ultimately reduces itself to what Roger Ebert wrote: ''We deserve to share happiness in this world, and if we supply it in the way it's sought and nobody gets hurt, is that a bad thing?'' It's very difficult to talk about these themes of the film without revealing its main plot mystery, which is what ultimately makes the film an engaging and very entertaining one.As for the technical aspect of the film, the hand-held camera is quite irritating towards the beginning of the film, but as the plot develops this becomes a very minor complaint as our interest and attention is solely in the film's story and characters rather in how they are presented. The editing is fast moving and the inter-cuts of computer inserts and Facebook images at the pace of the music are done effectively. I found myself rather frustrated and disturbed as I didn't find the note on the credits saying that all characters and plots are fictional, which appears on all films and false documentaries, and it just made the film's message hit me on a gut level as I actually thought that these people exist, and that such ordinary people are capable of these (seemingly) not ordinary things.Catfish is an identity mystery - character study documentary with thought-provoking themes, and engaging and moving plot and a disturbing reality.Rating: 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Catfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12A - 87mins - Documentary - 17th December 2010 Before you start reading this, check out the trailer first and then come back to me. Right trailer watched? Then lets continue. On the trailer alone your assumptions are pushed towards this being the next Blair Witch Project or something similar but you would be wrong. This is actually quite a hard movie to review without giving away too much of the story but I shall give it my best shot.Catfish is a documentary following 3 men- Henry, Ariel and in particular Yaniv aka Nev. Nev is a published photographer and one day receives an excellent painting of one of the photos that he has been commissioned for from a young girl Abby. Over several months, he sends her more photos and in return receives more paintings. Through Abby he gets to know her mother, father, brother and older sister Megan as well. The 'Facebook family' as he so aptly calls them.Henry and Ariel, Nev's brother, are small-time film producers and notice this internet relationship developing. Like all good filmmakers they decide to start following Nev around, much to his discomfort and make a film about it. However it slowly becomes apparent that something is not quit right about Megan and her family so due to a work commitment nearby, they decide to go and visit her to find out exactly what is going on.I have to say that at some points I was trying to work out whether this movie was being staged as several parts play out that way. Conversations seem slightly forced and not quite natural which you obviously would not get if you were just recording real life. Some believe that the whole movie was staged but I tend to another hypothesis that says that the end of the movie was shot first and then the beginning was shot to set up the ending.Having expected one thing and then been thrown in a completely different direction deserves credit in itself for some very good advertising/editing from whoever put the trailer together. The one issue being that it is likely to draw in the wrong crowd and alienate some of the people who would appreciate it more. They seem to hope to dupe extra people into watching their movie which is a shame because done another way this story could have been told better.The movie makes use of the internet with programs such as Google Earth, Facebook and Youtube being heavily relied on to connect the scenes together enforcing the impact that the internet has on the story being told and on everyone's lives in general.This is not only a hard one to review but in some aspects also to rate. It had me gripped but then lost me towards the end. Regardless it does open up some interesting points for discussion about who is on the other side of the computer screen but I would have preferred to see it either as a docu-horror or a documentary done in another way. And why is the movie called Catfish you ask? Well all will become clear if you watch it.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish: Interesting view on today's social internet society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello fellow film goers. Well I First saw this film being advertised at the theatre, and yes I felt something suspenseful from the trailer, but maybe that was the marketing ploy they wanted to use. If you really think about it a bit this is exactly what this film is about, some person you don't know advertising themselves with a facade of being something else.I really don't care about the reviews for this film that totally put down the whole film just because of some teaser trailer, and some of you critiques out there were even mad because you thought it was real. Well if you saw the trailer that I did and so did many others. It says in big letters on the screen "THIS IS NOT A TRUE STORY". But I'm sure over the years this has actually happened to people. As far as I'm concerned the actors in this film seemed really likable and believable. When Nev and his brothers were talking to each other this acting seemed real and genuine. I know I couldn't act that good, in what I call reality acting. Well, it is scripted, but in a way to make it seem like if you were to have an everyday conversation with anyone you know. They pulled this off with flying colours, and made me feel like this is not a cheesy or fake conversation, like I said genuine.Yes, there are a lot of people out there who feel cheated or ripped off. But if you just put the trailer for this film aside, then clear your mind, it's really a cool story. How many of you out there actually told someone in a chatroom on the web your real name. I'm just trying to say when it comes to meeting someone on dating sites or getting to know someone on facebook, a lot of people out there hide tons of personal info. But this film just takes that simple idea and just expands upon it and going full force with the whole idea of making a fake identity.I also thought when they met the real lady, Nev and his brothers handled it in a very respectful way, and didn't go down the other road, by making fun of her and her family. Yes we all know she lied to the extreme, but I think that she maybe was just lonely because of her family situation, with the mentally challenged children, and just dealing with that. She probably thought her paintings wouldn't get any attention from some guy in New York if she didn't slap a pretty girls face on her profile picture, or the innocents of a young girl 8 years of age painting some art. So when you boil things down, this lady was just a very sheltered woman looking for attention, but just making a mistake by lying about it. But when Nev confronted her you could see she felt like a fool for making all this up, but I really did think she learned her lesson, and that lesson is, if you want people to notice you or simply like you, just be yourself, and if the other person doesn't like that then to bad for them and just move on to somebody that does respect you and value your friendship.After watching this film, I really thought it was a really nice watch, with some humour, and good character plot. Very well filmed, in a documentary style, with added little tid bits of todays technology mixed in. I read a lot of reviews before I rented this, and a lot were good and a lot were bad. But in the end I listened to my gut instinct and just gave it a go. I'm not sorry I did.Very well done I gave it an above average rating, a 6 out of 10, it's a little lower than I wanted to go, but to me it's only just a one maybe two time watch. It's just one of those films where I found it intrigued me and made me laugh. But it's not really a story I want to repeat over and over again. What I'm trying to say is, yes, well done, like I said, got the point of the film, and now let's move on.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you suspend disbelief and just go along with the story, then, as many of the reviewers before me have detailed, the film is enjoyable--rather like a well-set up mystery film.For me, it's just too well-plotted to be true--for a documentary. Every element that such a documentary would need to be effective was there--and more. I had to keep reminding myself that the camera somehow just "happened" to "be" there--and the difference between reality and fiction was so severely blurred at times that I watched the film twice to try to see what was really going on there--for me as a viewer, anyway.Some actor reactions seemed incredibly real; others obviously not so.This is what I think about this film, (alas): Either the filmmakers discovered a lot of what was going on before they went on their field trip... and so knew that they had a reason to make the film before they started out; or they fully scripted out most of it before they got there. Yes, they had a few surprises once they got there--but for me, anyway, we, the viewers, were played with in the same way that the young man might have been. Three young filmmakers take a field-trip and what they discover "accidentally" makes a film such as this...the odds boggle the mind!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fascinating and thought provoking cinema verite-style documentary looks at the consequences and pitfalls of the explosion in social networking sites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This low budget, fly on the wall documentary is the antithesis of David Fincher's award winning drama The Social Network, which chronicled the origins of social networking site Facebook. This fascinating and thought provoking cinema verite-style documentary looks at the consequences and pitfalls of the explosion in social networking sites and the whole cyber communication phenomenon where technology has replaced face to face communication for this generation. This is also a cautionary tale that points out the very real dangers of sharing personal information and intimate details with a stranger via social networking sites. You can't always be sure you know who you are talking to. Catfish comes from three young aspiring New York filmmakers, and documents an on-line relationship. Nev Schulman is a New York based photographer who, in2007, received an e-mail from an 8-year-old artistic prodigy named Abby. She asked permission to paint a picture based on one of his photographs that had been published in a magazine. Nev agreed, and was pleasantly surprised when he received a painting in the mail a short time later. Thus began an on-line correspondence between Nev and Abby. Nev also got to interact with the rest of her family, including her mother Angela, her father Vince, and older sister Megan, and shared details of their life on-line. There are lots of photographs of Megan on her Facebook page, and Nev becomes infatuated with her. Nev's brother Ariel is a film maker who always has a camera around, and he and his business partner Henry Joost began to document this long distance relationship, with no idea where it would take them. After a few months though Nev and Ariel began to grow suspicious that not all was kosher and decided to dig deeper into Abby's life via You Tube and other on-line sources. During a trip to Vail, Colorado, to shoot a film about a dance competition they decide to take a side trip to Abby's hometown of Ishpeming in Michigan to check things out for themselves and put their fears to rest. They were not prepared for what they discovered. There is an element of tension as the brothers journey into the unknown in their search for the truth. The film ventures really deeply into the personal lives of its central protagonists, and the real details of Abby's family are quite touching, even if the filmmakers seems a little unsure of how to effectively use the material here. Since Catfish premiered at the Sundance Film festival, it has created something of a sensation, and has raised questions about its veracity. Debate has raged over whether it is real or yet another fake "documentary". How much of it was re-shot after the fact? The Schulman brothers disingenuously insist that it is all real, and shot as it happened. The film raises a number of ethical issues about the whole phenomenon of on-line socialising, the loss of privacy, and is also a poignant exploration of loneliness in this technologically savvy world. The meaning of the title becomes clear towards the end when Vince speaks of how a catfish nips at the heels of cod, and that they make life more interesting. "We'd be droll, boring and dull if we didn't have someone nipping at our fin," explains Vince. It also helps that Nev is quite a charismatic character with a natural screen presence, even though he seems a little gullible. However the details of the on-line relationship are a little humdrum. The film itself is also quite well constructed and slickly edited by Zac Stuart-Pontier, and its rough edges somehow add to its raw appeal. Ariel and Henry use digital cameras and hidden microphones to good effect. The pair shot over 200 hours of footage, and edited into a brisk 89 minutes the film never outstays its welcome. Especially clever is the way in which Schulman and Joost have incorporated several technological aspects, like You Tube, Google Earth and Mapquest, into the narrative. The trailers market the film as another "found footage" type thriller along the vein of The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity, but nothing could be further from the truth. Catfish is the type of film you should know little about before seeing it, so as not to ruin the surprises or the denouement.</fullReview>

I love the feeling of being swept away in a movie, regardless of the genre.The story itself is nothing new...this kind of absurd, desperate behavior on the internet is as pervasive as the common cold. Catfish does, however, bring to light an emerging theme in our now global society that is finding its wings amidst the "Social Network": the vast, abysmal disconnect between the unquestionable genius and creative virtuosity driving technological advances in communication...and the vapid, insidious stupidity of content that is actually communicated through this technology, for the most part.10% of the brain in use?

		<shortDescription>On and off the screen Catfish is a disturbing documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a documentary detailing how a photographer named Nev Schulman started a relationship with a family through the social networking site Facebook. The recordings were started by Nev's brother Ariel and filmmaker Henry Joost after Nev posted a photograph on the Internet and was then contacted by the family. A little girl named Abby supposedly saw his photograph and then painted an impressive replica of the image. Through the exchange of images across the Internet, Nev grew closer to the entire family, particularly with Abby's older half-sister Megan. Nev and Megan started talking on the phone and commenced a more intimate relationship. But as Nev's belief in the authenticity of the paintings diminished, he decided to travel across state from New York to Michigan with his camera crew to see if he had for months been led astray. On and off the screen Catfish is a disturbing documentary. This is in part because of the material but equally the motives of the filmmakers. After its release in the US, there was high speculation about the film's truthfulness. It's a valid concern. The film has been very scrappily made, shot mostly on hand-held camera, with distorted angles, to give it an on the fly feel. But it also cuts corners, leaving holes in its mirror of reality. Little is known about Nev himself so his entanglement with Megan seems peculiar. As a grown man living in New York, doesn't he have any real life relations to distract him? Even when the documentary reaches its big revelation, one the press releases have urged people not to reveal, Nev reaction is weirdly muted. He's either not a very good actor or he's suddenly stopped caring about a person he's been communicating with for months. The former is more likely. There are some minor technical gaps too. Look at the shot of Nev's trio when they are all on screen in a car ride. Who else is there filming them? And why isn't Angela more concerned about the cameras in her house when they come to visit? Listen to the language of a conversation that Nev recalls between himself and Megan too. The diction sounds intimate and polished, at odds with the fragmented dialogue shared online. The falsity of Catfish leads to deeper moral concerns. If this really is a facade, what are the filmmakers trying to accomplish other than to blatantly manipulate our emotions? It seems as though their film exists to shock and disorientate. It's effective in that sense but just as creepy and rather sickening in its exploitation. In the final quarter I really felt for Angela. She comes off as far more interesting than the laughing hyena Nev. But she also left me wondering how someone her age could become so detached from reality. Catfish touches the surface, attributing her behaviour to her domestic problems. But a set of more mature filmmakers could have explored this with deeper insights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These (3) guys made a sensitive, honest, and clever film about subject matter that affects every human life in one way or another, therefore a large demographic should be able to enjoy this film and see themselves or someone they know in it. The plot unfolded, in proportion to the mystery, and the audience is led deeper into the plot with visually pleasing footage, and a great story. And that's entertainment. A thriller? There are thrilling moments, but it's deeper than it looks at the outset, and at times became very uncomfortable to watch. Isn't that the true test of good film making? To reach the audience, and make them feel? That's all part of the adventure of being drawn inside somebody's art, somebody's creation, and allowing it to unfold. A cross between human interest/thriller/and comedy, my 22 year old daughter and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry; or laugh until we cried. At the same time, I was moved by the maturity these three young men brought to their art in situations that would be awkward for anyone under the best of circumstances. If this film was a hoax as the skeptics like to say it was, then maybe less skepticism = more enjoyment, and every film should be approached with a fresh open mind because art takes many forms. Making a film appear natural and a little clumsy like life naturally can be, requires skill. Sometimes the best actors make it look easy, so it doesn't appear to be acting. This rings true in Catfish. I could not take my eyes off this film and Yahniv Schulman is a captivating and natural actor...who still wears his retainer at bedtime! What a nerd! How adorable! And the relationship between Nev, Rel, and Henry seemed very affable, natural, and imperfect. The irony is in the film's title, because this film IS a CATFISH. And if viewers don't get that, they may want to watch the film a few times until they DO. Bravo, guys!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Catfish" is a tough film to review, as you understand upon watching it that it is not one you should spoil for other people; it is a film best experienced as a mystery. That said, I have seen this approach done far better, and as much as people will try to emphasise the importance of the film's mysterious allure, speaking personally, I think that, as with "Shutter Island", if you do not have some idea of what is happening fairly early on, you are not trying very hard at all! Please see my review of "Shutter Island" to understand this is not a dig at that movie, which I liked very much; the fundamental difference between the two, apart from being totally different styles of storytelling, is that Martin Scorsese was fully aware of the clich of the tale, and made a solid thriller around it, rather than trying to do a "Shyamalan" and outsmart the audience. "Catfish" is a different thing entirely, and I get the impression the film makers think what happens and where it goes is a BIG surprise, when actually I was not shocked at all! It is supposedly a real documentary, which may never have existed had the subject matter not become so intriguing to the film makers. Without spoiling anything, young film maker Ariel Schulman charts his brother Nev's online relationship with a girl named Abby, which began with his receipt of her little sister's painted impression of one his photographs.To say more is to spoil it, although as I say, I don't think there is a great deal to spoil; aside from a couple of small details as to why certain things are happening (details which surprised and endeared me to the film a bit), I really did see everything coming. With regard to this type of film, I much prefer "Rec", "Blair Witch Project" and dare I say even "Cloverfield". Now, this will of course lead you to wonder whether this is a horror, or thriller, and I will not confirm this for fear of ruining your experience.Whether you enjoy the direction the documentary takes is very much a personal thing, although it is fair to say that if this is indeed real, it is not like the guys had much control over it. If this is staged, I think it is a surprising piece of writing that would have been so easy to have taken in another direction. No matter what, the film's look at how big a part of our lives online communication is, and people's capacity for compassion, makes it worth at least one look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it first - then read reviews - easily spoiled, fantastic film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just knowing the genre takes some of the experience away.That being said, if you go into this knowing nothing at all about it - it will be one of the most rewarding movie experiences(as well as unique) in your life. If you're reading this and haven't seen the movie yet STOP RIGHT NOW and see the movie. You'll be glad you did.Catfish is the best movie I've seen in a long, long time.This weeks rental haul was 'Catfish','Conviction', 'Red', 'Restrepo', 'From Paris with Love', 'Felon', and 'Devil'. It was a good week for rentals as 'Red' was the lowest score at 6/10. Catfish, however, was the clear best at 9/10, and a movie that had the same impact of Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, Pi, or Roger and Me. An original film with multiple layers and one that evokes many different emotions along the way. I had no clue this film was a documentary until the characters on screen gave me no other option.This film made me laugh, and it also scared the crap out of me. One moment in the middle of the film is extremely suspenseful, and on a real level; and after the film there is another level of creepiness that sets in.I can't give enough props to the filmmakers here for giving us something that is fresh/unique, and something that seems so relevant following the fact-twisted and far more publicized 'Social Network' - which nearly got nudged out as the best film that I saw over the last year. Actually, I ranked Temple Grandin as the best, but it was made for TV.Catfish is great, but in the 'Sixth Sense' kind of way that can be easily spoiled. It's been a long time since a movie stuck with me like this. A better comparison would be 'King of Kong' - another documentary that shouldn't be relevant or interesting because of its' subject matter, but it JUST IS.Can't recommend this highly enough, but it's best to know NOTHING going in.85/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not particularly illuminating "documentary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having no knowledge about this movie and its campaign, I rented it based on the online raves about it. While the "documentary" (really yet another reality type of show) is OK, it's immediately obvious for anyone who has used the Internet for a little while, especially for those who had used something called Usenet where people faked profiles that actually waged flame wars against each other (i.e. one guy was behind it all) to draw people in. Therefore the entertaining part of watching this film is to try to figure out whether or not the filmmakers were doing a documentary or yet another flavor of reality TV - they based the story on something vaguely realistic, but staged/scripted the events to capture some viewers' interest. Some people may find the story fascinating, but I found it a waste of time to spend almost 90 minutes on something that could be covered in one or two paragraphs without missing a single detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rating 3/5 Especially when it comes to documentaries it has to be an exceptional job to move the viewer. Documentaries are vastly based on natural and real life events. And Catfish is one of those documentaries which actually gives you goose bumps at one point and makes sure that you will remember it for a very long time. And when it's all about social networking and internet in this Facebook age the toll seems to be higher.Yaniv Schulmen (Aka Nev) is a New York based photographer who shoots dancers and dance events. Over Facebook he gets to know one of his 8 year old fan named Abby (From Michigan) and eventually introduces himself online to her whole family including her hot step sister. Nev's brother (Ariel Schulman) sensing that there is some interesting aspect in this online relationship, decides to make a documentary and they starts to keep a visual diary and tracks of the events which takes place within the next 8 months.Nev eventually starts to like Abbys step sister and so they start sharing more intimate information, views and the rest over the phone, internet and Post. The documentary is all about how their relationship evolves and the events which takes place after Nev decides to really go and see this girl in person.There are several twists to the story and knowing it was true events you may starts to wonder how fragile we all can be in the online community. But it's severely hard for me to give you any further insight without giving out any possible spoilers so I have to keep this short.We all know what internet is and we all are contributors to it. With the vast popularity of sharing more information via social networking we have become slaves of our own online addictions which sometimes may not be the best for us.Keeping that in mind will make us more aware of the abyss and 'Catfish' is a wonderful contribution towards knowing life a little bit better.Read more reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CATFISH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another mockumentary / documentary this year (following 'I'M STILL HERE' and 'EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP', which are both superior films). The filmmakers (Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost) at first claimed that nothing in the film was staged but later admitted certain scenes were reenacted, which draws serious question to the credibility of the entire film, but they of course want to sell the film first and admitting the movie is staged could hurt business and effect the power of the film upon first viewing. If you've seen the movie you know things are a bit fishy form the get-go; everything is a little too perfectly timed and staged and it just feels like it's being acted out. Still the movie, like most fake documentaries (at least the current fad of them), is entertaining and worth the watch.The film takes place at the end of 2007 and revolves around a 24 year old New York photographer named Yaniv Schulman. It's directed and filmed by his brother Ariel and his friend Henry who claim "they sensed a story unfolding" with Nev (as they call him) but as the movie opens there's no legitimate reason to think anything they're filming will evolve into an interesting film. They begin filming Nev because a twelve year old girl from Michigan named Abby Pierce contacts him through facebook asking permission to do a painting of one of his photos. This develops into a strong online relationship not only with Abby but her mother Angela and older sister Megan, who romantic feelings evolve with as well. Nothing is as it seems though as deception is unveiled and Nev and the filmmakers decide to travel to Michigan to meet the family. Saying anymore than that would be giving away too much.The film is advertised as sort of a thriller, which is grossly misleading; nothing in the film is that intense and it's actually more of a sentimental drama than anything else. The climax is touching and the build up is compelling so whether or not it's fake doesn't really matter, it's still an entertaining film. Some speculate that the end was filmed first, and is real, and then the rest was filmed and staged later. I'm not sure what I think but I know it's definitely not all genuine. If I had to guess I'd say the entire thing was at least manipulated; some of it may be real but it's definitely tweaked to make for a better film. Still that's no reason to discredit the movie. A staged documentary can be just as enjoyable and entertaining as a true documentary, usually more so. This film is not quite as good as similar films released around the same time (like 'I'M STILL HERE' and 'EXIT THROUGH THE GIFT SHOP') but it's still a decent mockumentary and film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ucFFzQlT1c</fullReview>

As these relationships develop the stories they tell begin to unravel leaving a lot of unanswered questions, moving inevitably to Yaniv travelling to visit and find out exactly what is going on.If you set your expectations at zero, better still (too late now if you are reading this, but if you are going to watch with a friend give them this advice) read nothing about this in advance and don't expect much.</fullReview>

After the photographer grows closer to the eight year-old girl, her older sister, and the rest of her family over a period of eight or nine months, he decides to travel to Michigan with two of his friends along to document the trip.If you are interested in seeing Catfish, please try to avoid any and all spoilers that go beyond my brief plot outline above. Three-fourths of the entertainment of the documentary will be destroyed if you know too much about it. Just know that this is (in my opinion) well-worth watching, and tells a rather unique tale about the possibilities of our online society. Fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Facebook Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not be as thrilling and surprising as shown in the previews, but it does teach each and every one of us about the harsh truths about Facebook. Catfish is a documentary filmed in the traditional single camcorder style about a photographer named Nev Schulman. Nev meets an 8-year old girl on Facebook who begins painting pictures of the photos he has been posting on Facebook. They form a very mysterious relationship as they start communicating through email and as she mails him her work. Nev then meets her older sister and begins to strike up a personal romantic relationship with her. Everything seems to be going great when things start to become very ambiguous and not make sense. His whole outlook of "the Facebook family" changes and everything he thought he knew isn't what it seems. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost direct and film the documentary as the story unfolds creating this simple accidental documentary. As stated in the preview the film is not based on a true story it is the true story following the actual events as they transpire. Therefore, the content in the film is very real. This also allows the film to connect with the characters and learn a lot about the limited number of characters in the film. The film is very well put together creating great continuity. The flow of the film is very important to the film and the fact that the documentary is edited in a way that creates a full-fledged motion picture drama with one single camera. The ending of the film was very inspirational and answers the question all audiences are asking themselves; "Why is it called Catfish?" The film also sends a very good message to the audience, but may not be what the audience is expecting from the previews.Trailers and previews are very important to film because they are a form of advertisement that grabs a hold of the audience and persuades them to see a movie. Catfish's trailer is no different, however, the trailer has misrepresented the film multiple levels. After the trailer was released everyone was looking forward to a film along the same lines as Paranormal Activity creating a psychological thriller. The trailer says "the final forty minutes of the film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride that you won't be able to shake for days," (Chris Bumbrey, JoBlo.com) which has been misinterpreted into making people believe that this is some sort of horror film. The last forty minutes are emotional, however, the twist is not as exciting as it has been made out to be.The film Catfish is very relevant in today's society and is able to connect to society today very well because our world revolves around the Internet and social networking sites such as Facebook. The film shows the audience that the world's reliance on the Internet is not necessarily a good thing. Instead it is a very dangerous place that we need to be aware of. I recommend seeing this film, however, do not get your hopes up as the ending starts to unravel, or you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

The nature of documentaries nowadays makes the characters and the situations in the movie seem unrealistic regardless of whether it's fabricated or not, all thanks to 'I'm here'. Regardless of this, Catfish does make an impression on the serious moviegoer's minds and the closing moments of the movie reveals a few gems of thoughts to ponder upon.On a closing note, I will say to catch Catfish (sorry for the pun) on home video.

		<fullReview>Real or not, this is an incredible film watching experience. I decided to check this out after being relatively impressed with Paranormal Activity 3. The film starts as a documentary about the friendship between a photographer, Nev, in his 20s becoming friends with an 8 year old painter, Abby, that does recreations of his pictures. As their friendship starts to blossom, he gets to know Abby's whole family over Facebook. Most importantly, Megan, her older sister. A relationship of messages, phone calls etc. blossoms for 8 months. However, one night Nev discovers something that will change their entire relationship. I'll leave the synopsis there, as I knew nothing about this film so every second had me gripped and was shocking. The film seems innocent at first, but soon ominous tones start to set in. It really does feel like some kind of horror movie, and the more that is revealed the more I was gobsmacked. As the fear levels rise, it then turns into something completely different. Schulman and Joost certainly have an ability to create tension, and get some emotional resonance too. Out of a documentary, that's pretty impressive. I could not have predicted where this was going at any time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are truly interested in seeing this film, do not watch the trailer first. It is very deceiving, and gives you too much (I guess to look forward to??). Do not go into this expecting anything, it may make the experience better. I was completely disappointed with the lack of...everything in this film. Whether it is true or not really doesn't matter in the end. Could it be? Absolutely. It happens every day, which I think makes it very lackluster. You can expect to come away with no real emotional attachment to this movie whatsoever, and there is no amazing and unexpected plot twist (honestly most people will pick up on the "twist" very early on). Although easy to pick up on, you may feel as though you need to continue watching just to see if you missed something or if craziness will ensue. Don't worry, it won't. Actually once you figure it out you can just go ahead and shut it off because the confrontation is mind numbingly boring, and I promise you will have missed absolutely nothing. It's just a guy who meets a girl online, goes to see her, and realizes the person he was talking to lied about it all. At this point, you may expect something to happen. But does it? NOPE. Sorry, all you get is what feels like a very skimmed over wash of what just happened.I'm sorry, I just can't stress enough that NOTHING HAPPENS in this movie. I would've at least settled for waterworks, or for the guy to be ticked off...and I couldn't even get that satisfaction. It basically builds up this internet relationship and then, oh, wait...she's faking it all? That sucks. Really, I might as well break out my camera and start filming my friends doing mundane things with no real enthusiasm or emotion.Frankly, I don't feel it is worth watching. Make your own opinions, and perhaps you can take something (anything) away from the 90 minutes I feel I just wasted.If anyone has seen this film and liked it, please comment. I honestly would love to hear what anyone could possibly get from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's tempting to write Catfish off as a gimmick: an exploitative, cheapo doc thrown together for no money that takes advantage of its subject.But that's a bit too easy. If we can accept that this is a true blue non-staged documentary effort, Catfish is quite possibly one of the most important and timely films to come around in a long while, issuing a salient warning about the life-changing and damaging fiction that is possible to create with just a few bogus Web entries.New York photog Nev and his two filmmaker buddies, Rel and Henry, after discovering a few holes in the picture-perfect lifestyle portrayed by Nev's incredibly hot Facebook friend Megan, set off for the wilds of Michigan to get the real story.What follows are revelations that --- while not being "worthy of Hitchcock" as the trailers insinuate --- are actually far more painful, raw, and compelling --- exactly because they contain infinitely more power as Real Life. If anything, the studio's insistence that Catfish is a thriller will ultimately do it more harm than good.Catfish does something only really good documentaries can do: they reel you in, hook, line, and sinker, because their subject is so immediately relevant and their technique so fearless, guerrilla, and personal. Schulmann and Joost really get in people's faces and focus until the lies peel away. What is left is hard to watch, sometimes ugly, but ultimately riveting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the documentaries to be accused of falsehood, this seems a weird one. The subject is so mundane, what little could be faked just doesn't seem to matter. It's obvious that the meat of the film, what makes the film worth seeing, was not fake. If certain bits of the film around the center were recreated, that's a bummer, but not a dealbreaker. Anyway, this is the story of a young New York man (Yaniv Schulman) who starts to receive painted renditions of his photographs from an eight year old prodigy from the UP, Michigan. He is fascinated with the girl's talent, and begins to connect with her family, eventually beginning a virtual romance with the girl's older half-sister. The film began when Schulman's brother and friend (the three are roommates who often work together in the world of dance) became interested in the child prodigy, but the film became something else when Schulman started to discover some weird inconsistencies in the family's dealings with him. The story uncovered may be somewhat mundane, but it's definitely interesting and affecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Caught In The Virtual Hullabaloo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think Paranormal Activity, Blairwitch Project or the more recent Inception if you'd like. These are the films that one would assume this tragi ? dramedy, "Catfish" would be like. The tag line of the film's wickedly deceptive poster reads, "Don't let anyone tell you what it is." Do we, as a novice audience buy it as an edgy, unconventional, eighty some minutes camaraderie, yes we do. Going by the trailer, it is safe to state a statutory warning : Whatever shown in those two minutes of eerie clip shuffle, the marketing honchos are just messing with your mind. Surely they are a tad indulgent. Do not get presumptuous right away. Watch the whole nine yards and then form your opinion.Catfish defies and criticizes the blindfolded, deliberately ignorant social networking, Youtube generation's presumption that the virtual world is a safe haven. Unlike various number of sitcoms and tabloid articles running similar stories, this film takes the whole idea of awakening the drowsy, web connected globe by documenting the entire episode of busting a "Catfish", a person who is not quite what he appears to be. While reviewing this intriguing film, it sure is an ordeal not to give too much away. Catfish indeed doesn't blow your mind, instead it's just a modest tongue in cheek mockumentary, a social networking mystery with authentic camcorder cinematography, serving as a treat to sore eyes, that have seen unforgettable films, for all the wrong reasons.Touted as the film that shook up the Sundance Film Festival, Catfish traces three aspiring filmmakers, including Nev Schulman, a young charismatic photographer in New York City as its protagonist. A film that sets out with its heart in the right place but turns out to be a heartbreaking, twisted romance, an odyssey with deception as the key ingredient. Stranger than fiction, in most places with characters one can completely relate to instantly. A story about "you and me". An insightful look at the social networking camouflage from a human prospective, told through the story of Schulman and an 8 year old seemingly prodigious painter Abby, whom he befriends along with her family on Facebook. The ambition of Mark Zuckerberg in 'The Social Network' seems insipid and ungrand next to how life on Facebook really is. Catfish is riveting and emotionally raw, packed with a "throwing one off the seat" magnificent twist, tucked in its well edited rucksack. It leaves the viewer with a think bubble at the end, that it certainly doesn't hurt to play the wise man, treading your steps carefully when your apparent "friends" are really strangers. To take someone on face value clearly is a lost cause. As a final curtain call ? Don't let banal criticism suck you in, give this film a go, you might already have lived some of it or in some uncanny way, most of us are already living it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish - The Facebook Documentary Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of hype around at the moment surrounding new Hollywood blockbuster The Social Network and whilst it may be popular, the real Facebook film you should be looking out for is Catfish.The film which has caused a stir at America's Sundance Film Festival and The BFI London Film Festival this year was created by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost in 2007, when they decided to document Nev Schulman's online experience as he gradually became friends with a family in Michigan via Facebook. Throughout the documentary it is revealed that Nev is starting to have reciprocated feelings for a member of the family, Megan; they talk on the phone, online and send each other texts, but it's not long until strange discoveries about the family arise. What follows is a series of strange events as Nev eventually meets the family and the saying "people aren't what they seem" springs to mind.The three central protagonists Ariel, Henry and Nev are all very likable, funny and soon into the film the audience begin to sympathise towards Nev and his quest for the truth. The film is enjoyable, and does well in creating suspense throughout as the viewer and filmmakers start to learn more about "the facebook family", although the twist revelation near to the end of the film isn't quite as shocking as the trailer makes out, but it is still is an interesting one.Catfish is shot using a camcorder to begin with, which can be quite disorientating and distracting but towards the end of the film the quality improves. There has been much deliberation as to whether this is really a documentary as has been claimed. It could be argued it is fictional because the content could appear to be unbelievable, and also because there seems to be a large amount of brand names used in the film such as iphone, Blackberry, Google Maps, Apple Mac and Supermarche ? which might suggest these companies helped fund the film.Whether or not it really is a documentary Catfish is still highly entertaining, and teaches a good lesson to be more internet aware, and to not take people at face value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. A brilliant piece of marketing for what actually is no more than a film school project, "Catfish" can be analyzed from many perspectives. What I can't do is put any of those perspectives in written form without taking away from the marketing gimmick of not letting someone tell you what happens.Make no mistake, this is not a thriller by any stretch. It's not even particularly well made as a film. It is, all skepticism aside, a documentary made by some 30-ish guys from a Manhattan loft office. Their film is based on interactions with a Michigan family after they receive a painting of one of their web-posted photos. The artist is an 8 year old girl named Abby. The photographer is Nev Schulman.Nev and Abby begin corresponding through Facebook. The correspondence spins off to include Abby's 19 year old sister Megan, and their mother Angela. What is unclear is whether Nev and his filming co-horts (Ariel and Henry) are as naive as they appear or whether they smell a real story. Either way, they continue on with the back-and-forth until a real cyber-romance blossoms between Nev and Megan.Next, we find our boys in Vail and they decide to "stop by" Michigan on their way back to New York. And don't we all just love surprise home visits from strangers? What follows is the core of the film and some insight into human nature. The reactions of all parties may surprise you, but there are no major plot twists involved if you have been paying attention.There were only two ways this mystery could go and neither is all that interesting. What we really see is that there are lonely people out there. There are naive people out there. Neither of these type of people are necessarily bad. I believe this film is every bit as insightful into the real Facebook as "The Social Network" is. The only difference is that movie tells the story of those who built it, while this one tells the story of those who use it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'other' Facebook movie; absorbing navel-gazing look at a cultural phemonenon (and its catutionary tale)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CATFISH (2010) *** Part social experiment, part quasi-documentary this absorbing navel-gazing character study and glance into the funhouse mirror of the Internet ? specifically a Facebook acquaintance relationship becoming something even more as not-so-reluctant subject Nev, the brother of filmmaker Ariel Schulman and friend of co-auteur Henry Joost, finds himself in a unique situation: an infatuation with a seemingly very open and artistic Mid-western family who seem to get their emotional hooks into his unsuspecting yet yielding good nature for the best of him until some events just don't add up. What results is a fascinating culture-clashing neo-Hitchcockian investigation into the psyche of a nation's latest fixation with a fairly novel yet addictive service (a Facebook account, to wit) and the ramifications of being open and closed at the same time. Until the third act's fairly predictable yet illuminating conclusion the film holds up very well (despite the ham-fisted promotion as a 'thriller' with its very misleading and unfortunate trailers) as a barometer for what it means to take a leap of faith and what a friendship (should)entails.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have appreciated this movie had it been a documentary solely about the young artist with whom the photographer dude exchanges art &amp; thoughts - but in this narrow-minded narrative (i.e. two arty "hipsterish" New York brothers documenting their utter amazement that the Midwest actually is inhibited by REAL, thinking, "beautiful" and creative people) this documentary (but NOT the blooming artiste) is, in fact, both awkward and feeble.The main problem is the (well-meant, from the parents point of view, I am sure) anonymization of the girl who provides the art and letters for the film. This limits the possibility for the viewer to get answers to the more interesting questions that the film raises (at least in me): who is she? It is obvious that her family really cares about her, but is she considered an "outsider" in social settings with peers - and if so, does she even care? Or is that why she seeks reassurance in NY adults?Having been "that weird girl" myself, I find myself constantly distracted by the filmmakers' failure to address these issues, and I realize that the documentary I expected to see after reading about the background to the movie, just vanished in a director-generated narcissistic blur. I really don't get what the buzz is about, you norms!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much about Catfish until it was recommended by a friend of a friend - so I didn't see any trailers or hear any hype except for the tag line.However I was still a bit disappointed - this movie, marketed as a documentary, really had a forced attempt at naturalism and I never once accepted it as based in fact.It was also one of the most anticlimactic films I've come across! I believe another reviewer mentioned the same thing; I kept hoping that Nev would look in the back shed and find Angela's mangled victims or something. But it just never happened, and the actual "climax" comes way too early on to feel cathartic.I did enjoy Catfish while watching it, as it definitely had some good moments of giggly nervous tension. But all in all it seemed rather bland, and didn't even leave me feeling creepy afterward. And I had to walk home in the dark! If you want to see Catfish, go ahead and see it, but if you don't, don't feel like you're missing out on a whole lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a little bit about this film when it was mentioned on Film 2010 with Claudia Winkleman, some bits about the "plot" and they said some positive things, so I had to see it. Basically this is a documentary made by Ariel 'Rel' Schulman and Henry Joost as they filmed Ariel's twenty four year old New York photographer brother Yaniv 'Nev' as he made a new "pen pal" style friend, possibly internet love on Facebook. Online he meets a little girl named Abby from rural Michigan, who has a talent for painting, and the friendship spreads to the other family members, including mother Angela Wesselman-Pierce, her husband Vince, and more significantly Abby's attractive older half-sister Megan, a veterinarian, a dancer and a songwriter from Gladstone. Things seem fine for a while, but after she sends Nev a sample of one of her songs, he searches the internet for more of her stuff, and he discovers from YouTube that it is not actually her singing, so he wonders what else about her is real. Time goes by and there is no contact from "Megan" or "Abby", so he and the filmmakers decide to go to the location on the map they searched where the family are meant to be living to find out what's going on. They arrive and it seems the house really exists, as do mother Angela, who also cares for two disabled sons as well as real daughter Abby, but things they remember online are not what they seem in real life, such as what Vince looks like, who actually does the painting, and of course who Megan really is. Angela confesses all the truths about what she has been doing on Facebook calmly, she used Facebook to get away from the real life hardships, I can't remember whether it turned out Megan was real or not, but the end text said that Nev stayed friends with Angela. The concept is very intriguing for a real life film, but I agree that it is so weird and sometimes uncomfortable viewing that I cannot decide whether it is real or a big hoax, but it is quite an engaging documentary. Very good!</fullReview>

It's an okay film that is probably too long at 90 minutes. For me the early scenes of the filmmakers and Nev wore me down. It wasn't until the the three friends reach their destination that the film became interesting and rather sad.For me one of the weaknesses of the film is that it takes too long to tell it's story. As I said the 90 minute run time is too long.I liked it but I'm glad I didn't pay 12 bucks to see it in a theater</fullReview>

Basically a guy that is so proud of his network friends that he feels the need to drive cross country to confront someone uninvited because he feels cheated. I only hope this was a stunt because if not the guy was completely insane and near criminal in his actions. We change the actors a little bit, i.e. the family HE was stalking was a young pretty girl - it isn't hard to imagine prison time. Basically a story about a loser that is on a mission to prove there are people worse off than he is. No accomplishments in the movie, nothing profound. Just some punk with an attitude that apparently has connections in the film industry. The only people who deserve appreciation are the trailer architects - they managed to make this piece of @#$@ appear to be worth watching. Forget the $1 wasted, I want my TIME back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super Sad (Possibly) True Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline on Catfish's deceptively dark poster read "Don't let anyone tell you what it is." The studio is totally correct in saying this, but make sure everyone tells you how good it is. Catfish is a wild pastiche of genres crammed into a brilliant criticism of the Youtube Generation's presumption that the internet is a safe place. Unlike many other TV shows and newspaper articles that have tackled a similar topic, Catfish takes this criticism to a whole new level by documenting the entire process of catching a "catfish," a person who is not quite what he seems to be. Although the movie should be questioned in terms of its veritableness, it is thrilling, sad, and often funny account of a Facebook romance with a person who does not match their profile.*Catfish is a hard film to describe without giving too much away. In short, the film's advertising inaccurately portrays the film. It is the supposedly true story of Nev Schulman and his Facebook friend Megan Faccio. Nev, a photographer that lives in New York, met Megan through her half-sister Abby, an eight year-old who sent Nev a painting of one of his photographs that was published in the New York Times. Nev begins to become romantically intertwined with Megan. But the more he finds out about her, the less he realizes he actually knows about Megan.Filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman have done an amazing job making this film. From the films pixelated studio credits to the film's closing shots, each sequence is more interesting than last. Emotions run wild in this film from the characters, but also from the audience, most of which is done through clever editing and unique filmmaking methods. The best example is the garage scene shown in the trailer, which so brilliantly constructs suspense through quick cuts and dark shots. Catfish is dissimilar to other documentaries because it does not rely on interviews for this type of emotion, but it instead relies on the audience to react in a certain way. It does not demand a loud or obvious reaction, but rather a subtle one, something that can be discussed with friends afterwards. And unlike many other documentaries that simply present the facts, Catfish supplies a interesting commentary towards the end of the film.Catfish is all the proof one needs that documentaries are not always boring. This documentary is fascinating in many ways, most of which cannot be said without revealing the end. I have many more things to say about this film, but a lot of them deal with the ending, which is jarring, but not exactly the big reveal that Rogue Entertainment's advertising has depicted it to be. The movie sometimes verges on being a little too real. And by this I mean that it could follow in suit of I'm Still Here and be a complete hoax. Whether or not it is fictional does not affect my feelings about this movie, but it certainly did not feel like it was entirely a true story all the time.How well do you know your Facebook friends? Are you sure they are who they say they are? Catfish leaves you in a state of paranoia wondering if the internet is as safe as you thought it was. In a time where people are worried about identity theft and take so many precautions online, Catfish could not be a more timely film and one that definitely needs to be seen by everyone. It probably is best to go into the theater without seeing any advertising, but the film can still be enjoyed (if that is the correct word for it) regardless of seeing the advertising. Though The Social Network may have overshadowed Catfish by being the bigger Facebook movie, Catfish is arguably better in some ways and more worthy of attention. Sad, suspenseful, and dramatic, Catfish is never short of amazing, making it easily the best documentary of 2010.*Note: The summary above and the trailers do not spoil the movie's plot, however it is recommended the film should be seen with as little knowledge as possible.</fullReview>

You'll get dragged in and excitedly wait for what comes next. This film had my undivided attention throughout the whole time!I thought the filmmakers did an awesome job filming everything with detail. Providing evidence of texts that were exchanged, to phone calls, and maps, added an extra feel on knowing exactly what is going on. Great job inserting video of google maps!!

		<shortDescription>The audience that knew too little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've come to the conclusion that the direction of the marketing campaign for Catfish might have faltered a bit. Not that the trailers and posters weren't ideal, rather I think that they intrigued the audience more than they wanted to. Catfish is not a thriller. It's not scary, suspenseful, or violent. There's no blood or guts. But a movie can be mysterious without having any of the previous mentioned attributes. Yes, Catfish is very Hitchcockian like the trailer states, which seems to be upsetting people after having seen the movie because they thought that it was going to take a drastically dark turn. If Hitchcock were alive during the Facebook era, I think he would have made a movie like this. People seem to forget that Hitchcock directed romances and not just slashers like Psycho. The main conflict revolves around a young man and his friends paying an impromptu visit to a woman whom one was having a virtual online relationship with, only to find out things are not as they seem. Or maybe I should say that since they were beginning to get suspicious of her before they visited anyway, things were not as they thought they were going to seem even though they expected the unexpected. Catfish clearly respects all of its characters, including the character of Angela, who is quite remarkable without ever intending to be. She's one of the most interesting people I've seen in a movie in the past decade. The credits role and you leave the theater with great questions in your mind. Why do we have Facebook if we really think we know ourselves that well? What things about ourselves do we like? What do we think other people like? And most importantly, we realize that the things we do everyday without thinking are what make us truly amazing. Look, I know a lot of people will disagree with me and hate this movie. If you're looking for a scary thriller, don't see it. You'll be disappointed. There's no scares to be had here. But Catfish is a surreal and oddly touching social commentary on our obsessions with social networking.</fullReview>

Not knowing where the documentary was headed, Ariel's determination proved itself to be worthwhile. More than half of the film is a guy chatting with a girl online, so the premise may make some uncomfortable. But the last 30 minutes of the film unravelled some disturbing moments that you could only imagine. Catfish proved that online dating isn't helping anyone with a problem yet damages them even more.

For me this movie was an intense experience and I would compare it to the way I felt after seeing the documentary GRIZZLY MAN. Not that the films are alike in any aspect other than the way their images haunt you. There IS horror and pathos in this story, monsters even, but the film is not MICHIGAN CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I saw CATFISH within a week of seeing THE SOCIAL NETWORK and the two complement each other, but, as others have noted, CATFISH is the film that is truly "shattering" in its impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catfish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catfish is an engrossing documentary in two distinct acts: clever dissection of personality circa 2010, and heartbreaking portrait of disappointment and compromise. The less said about either element the better, suffice to say that it mostly succeeds in all of its contradictory ambitions. The film is ostensibly made up on the fly, which speaks to its fractured tone and ever-evolving intentions. This is not to say that the film lacks in story-telling; the action unfolds lucidly and is cleverly unified through footage of Google Earth and Facebook. The limited perspective of the camera combined with the seeming omniscience of the internet is a compelling pairing, and lends itself quite aptly to the film's central questions of to what extent you can ever know or love another person. Some will find Catfish's conclusion tasteless, perhaps even morally questionable. I happen to think it's damn good film. Art strives to convey truth, and this finale is loaded with it--sad, hard, beautiful truth. How fortunate that the Catfish team happened to stumble upon it in reality. -TK 9/23/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insensitive Gray Gardens., contrived and a bit too smirky for my taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately unimpressive documentary, reminiscent of Maysles brothers direct cinema approach to film. Unlike Grey Gardens, and the Maysles sensitive treatment of the relatives of the Bouviers, the filmmakers failed to sensitively explore the psychological back story, which used photos of the past to humanize the character who'd taken them on the journey. They failed to represent the complexity and sadness of what led their trickster to connect. They simply dove into the other world in order to get a documentary about it. After the Q and A with the filmmakers, I was even more disappointed to see that they were standing behind their own lies, pretending as if they didn't know that they were filming a subversive story. They remained a bit too smirky and self-satisfied with the research they did on clearing up the lies they'd been told, which the audience had already been let in on by the way the documentary was treated. The brothers found it an extraordinary feat, and wre less devoted to the actual story they were telling. It seems to be marketed as a suspense film, and one would only hope the documentarians could be as clever as we'd want them to be in navigating us through a social commentary about the reality of connecting online. Although it seemed to move in a moving direction, it lacked the sweetness and genuine warmth of a Maysles documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and real as this review!?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt that this documentary hit this point head on, we're loathsome of ourselves so we put all these electronics between us and each other to hide the fear of rejection of who we really are. This is an anthropological snapshot of the 21st century and how we interacted between one another and how we are still shooting arrows in the dark looking for something(or someone) we feel we need. The story was riveting and I loved everything about it, including the ending! But, then again, I could just be someone with a vested interest in the movie or a stalker of the filmmakers or who-knows-what! I think thats the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Catfish" is an thought provoking look at the relationship between the internet and our society today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest hush hush and most talked about films from Sundance this year was "Catfish." Every article I read about this film didn't say much about the plot other than a guy who meets a family from the internet. The truth is "Catfish" tells the true life story of Nev Schulman, a regular guy who like all of us enjoys chatting and mingling with people online through various social networks such as Facebook. One day, Ariel Schulman, Nev's brother decides to document Nev's relationship between him and this online family he has been talking to from Ishpeming, Michigan. What Ariel and Nev soon unravel is not only fascination but a rather interesting look at the relationship between people today and the internet.I know you guys and gals expected me to give away the film in the above paragraph but the truth is I can't do that. This film is a great watch and I recommend anyone who uses a social network to check this out. While the film is marketed as a thriller/horror film, I will warn you now, it is NOT! The film will haunt you and stick with you but that's not because of the horror behind it. The truth is this film really says a lot about our society today and tells the dark side of human nature. Its an interesting film that very few will probably appreciate when all is said in done."Catfish" is shot as a documentary style and while this alone will make most people avoid it, I would argue to give it a shot. Even though it is documentary style it's intriguing and keeps you interested. You won't be bored like I was in "Paranormal Activity" because the story is fascinating and isn't fake. Go ahead take some time and Google this story after you watch the film. It's all real, its haunting, and it's even a bit depressing and sad. The way the film is shot basically adds to the emotional feel of the film, if this was actually shot with real film cameras, it wouldn't work as well in my opinion.I have read a lot about this film and most people have given it high marks. Does the film live up to all these high marks? Almost but it is a little over hyped in my eyes. While I appreciate critics and avid film buffs viewpoints, I do want to know why very few haven't questioned some aspects of the film like the editing. Obviously, the film was edited to make it more interesting and suspenseful but I wonder how much of the film was edited to make us feel a certain way towards the characters, not to mention if any of it was edited to stretch the truth. I guess at the end of the day it doesn't mean much because it is a film but I am a smart movie addict and I question things like this. I would say that's my only gripe with the film.At the end of the day, "Catfish" is a cautious tale of people and today's technology. Its misleading marketing probably helped the film make more money than it would have without it but it's nothing like the trailers lead you to believe. It's not a horror or thriller but rather an in-depth look at social networks and the relationships people make on those sites. Those who enjoy thought provoking films that really stick in your mind when all is said and done should check this one out. This is not a movie for everyone but I think most people who are familiar with the internet or social networking will appreciate the story here. Its a film that really makes you think and makes you question humanity but at the same time almost makes you feel bad for everyone involved. It's really hard to explain without giving anything away. For independent film lovers, this is a must see. For everyone else, I think it will be hit or miss depending on how much you enjoy documentary style films. I personally appreciated the story and truly think its an important film for today's generation to see. Check it out! MovieManMenzel's final rating for "Catfish" is a solid 8 out of 10. On final note, if you want to know where the title came from? Well that is explained at the end of the movie. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A temptation from a human desire for happiness! *No Spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello", a girl answers the phone. Boy says, " Megan?". Megan replies," Hi, how are you?" Astounded boy says, "Your voice is not at all what I expected." Follows a introductory conversation for the first time between new York city photographer Yaniv 'Nev' Schulman and a country girl from Ishpeming, Michigan Megan Faccio. They previously knew each other from facebook when Megan was tagged in her 8-yr old sister's pictures. Abby previously requested Nev to send a picture of himself so she could paint it. When Nev received the paining in the mail he is instantly feels a friendly connection. Follows a facebook family of Abby, Megan, their mom Angela, her two sons and so on. No need to mention Nev falls in love with Megan and they share text messages over a period of 8 months. Nev almost decides to quit his life in the city to live with Megan as a cowboy. What follows is a series of events over the course of this 'so called documentary'. Anything else and I will be spoiling the 'film'.Ever since Cannibal Holocaust (1980) premiered documentary style film-making with above average, by Hollywood standard if I may, story lines and plots were presented to scare the crap out of audiences with a 'how real it is' phenomenon. The Blair Witch Project reached audiences in the farthest corners of the world with film making perspective of handy cam that started a series of such films up until Paranormal Activity (2007). The filmmakers have always been questioned about the authenticity, if they claimed it is real, of their work. Whatever the response they had one thing is for sure that these films in a way created a cult following, if not made buckets of money like Blair Witch or Paranormal. Catfish is such a movie/documentary that fits into this genre.What makes Catfish different than these films is it makes human characters in it extremely believable. It uses those characters and drives the story. A story of some predictable, some unpredictable, some bizarre, some painful, some disappointing (for all characters), some awkward and one very unique and beautiful outcome. This outcome gives you the meaning of the title and how everything in this 94 min show bonds together. It may be half filled to some and half empty to others. But the meaning of the Catfish is essential for the film's credibility in its entirety. If you think about it then it could be argued that a celluloid creation that makes a point in the end is usually a 'film'. Not a documentary. Recall Bowling for Columbine, Up series or An Inconvenient Truth. The viewers are shocked and shattered through each frame of the film. They do have a finale but the point is made way before the ending. The whole prospect of following a journey in those documentaries was the pleasure source. Catfish could be true as its makers claim. Catfish does drag you in and deliver. But the avalanche like finale of last 10 minutes almost makes it stand in the category of a film. Like Hitchcock's Psycho. Tony Perkis' character confronts to give meaning to almost every single frame of the film and so does Catfish. Be warned that this does not make Catfish Hitchcockian or with one of the best mysteries. But it is definitely as if the filmmakers previsioned the whole attempt to create their celluloid creation.It cannot be predicted how true or made up Catfish is. Maybe it is genuine or maybe the creators will take a secret to their graves. It does not matter. It is a thriller that has its source from the very thing that makes us human. The unique perspective on human character and a temptation to human desire for happiness that it portrays makes viewing experience absolutely unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CATFISH ? CATCH IT ( A ) We watch documentaries every time but Trust me I don't think anyone has ever seen anything like that before. Boy becoming friends with a girl over the Facebook comes to know that the girl he knows and talked over the phone and Facebook never actually existed. It's totally a Jaw Dropping and Mind Boggling docu-movie and best thing about CatFish is, its 101% true and not fake like Blair Witch Project &amp; Paranormal Activity (which were initially projected like true events). The documentary is very fascinating from the beginning and I appreciate all three main guys for shooting in a complete natural way and making it engaging throughout. The Editing of the movie is really good; it's perfectly done to create suspense, romance, joy and sorrow. It was a thrill to watch how Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman, Yaniv Schulman and Angela's story unfolds. Trust me in the end you will feel the heart breaking story of Angela and why she needed an Internet Aliases to feel love or important Again! Won't expose much of the detail and suspense so just watch it as soon as possible. It's a ride you don't want to miss on any cost!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Less You Know About "Catfish" Going In, The More You'll Be Intrigued By It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen "Catfish" already, and there is still a lot I don't know about it. I could not tell you whether it is real or fictitious, because I really don't have a clue. I could do a Google search right now on Nev Shulman and see if he's a real professional photographer, and if his brother, Ariel, is a real documentary maker. I don't really want to, though, and if you want this film to take you in as much as it did me, neither should you."Catfish" is an intriguing film to say the least. Like last year's "Paranormal Activity" (2009), it's a film that feels real because it is shot with a hand-held camera, and there are no special effects or dramatic music to tell you when you should feel scared or not.To tell you, the reader of this review, too much about the movie would really ruin the hold it puts on you as you're watching it. However, to Universal Studios' credit, the previews for the film (which can still be seen online) are like a cheerleader's skirt: long enough to cover everything, but short enough to be interesting.For starters, Nev Shulman is a 24-year-old photographer who had one of his photographs published in a magazine. He receives a very good painted replica of his published photograph from a six-year-old named Abby, who is from a small town in Michigan. He soon friends Abby on Facebook, and he sends her more of his pictures for her to paint.Ultimately, Nev begins to friend other members of Abby's family on Facebook, and eventually engages in a flirtatious correspondence with Meagan, Abby's older half-sister. Meagan's Facebook profile picture is gorgeous, and it is when Nev's brother, Ariel, and his friend Henry Joost, start documenting Nev's pursuit of a woman he doesn't know that the story begins.It is also when Nev visits Michigan to meet Meagan in person that you really feel how creepy and disturbing the story ultimately becomes. Nev, being a real person, seems to be well aware of Internet scams, and has a healthy dose of skepticism. The naive sorority girl who wanders into the dark room where Jason Voorhees is lurking, he is not. In fact, he probably would not venture into Michigan if it weren't for his ambitious filmmaking brother and friend.And that is all there pretty much is to say. To tell you any more would permanently ruin the film for you if you wanted to see it. I am even afraid to give away the film's weaknesses because most are incorporated greatly into the most surprising aspects of this movie.If the film is real, as the previews boldly assure us, then it is filmed very well. In fact, the editing of the film was great, especially when the added Google maps into the mix, and made clear close-ups of words on a computer screen as they were being typed. Revolutionary? Probably not, but still intriguing and perhaps made the story juicier.If the film is in fact fictitious, then it's not necessarily a bad thing. Making the film into a faux documentary was perhaps the most creative way to bring a smart guy in the middle of nowhere to meet a mysterious girl. Also, if Nev Shulman is an actor, he's very good and very real.But whether the film is real or not is beside the point. "Catfish" is a solid film that really keeps you guessing, and even managed me to feel the same way as Nev &amp; Company. As the crew is driving into rural Michigan as it gets dark, Nev comments, "I feel like I'm waiting for my S.A.T. scores to come in". My immediate response was, "Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel too."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Listed as a spoiler....as it is better to not know anything before seeing the films....To quote Harry Knowles, "this is a damn fine story". The background on Catfish is that you aren't suppose to know what the background is. I thought the film was funny, thought provoking and powerful. Can you say all those things together without being clich? Maybe some of my strong reaction is because part of the film takes place in the Upper Peninsula, or the cuteness, the child prodigy, or the love story. The filmmakers throw all your different emotions in a garbage can and make some wapatuli.Go for the ride.Drink some wapatuli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it is real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In response to the review by deadrabbitrecords, claiming that he's found supporting evidence that the film is not real - it is definitely real. The press on the film has just been highly controlled and all of the parties featured in the film are in support of the film, so they, I would very strongly assume, have been compliant with the requests of the marketing team.I just went to a prescreening and Q&amp;A with the filmmakers, and there is no doubt in my mind that these guys are for realIF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING:To deadrabbit: My best guess as to why the video only had 32 hits is that Angela had posted all kinds of weird things from her alternate profiles as comments on the video, and she wanted to escape from that after the experience in the film, so she deleted the video she had originally posted up and reposted it. In the Q&amp;A, Nev said that she finally put up her own website because the next day after they left, she took down everything and decided to just be herself from then on. She's glad that the film lets people see her in a human light (I personally think it brings understanding to internet addiction in a way we haven't seen before) and agreed to be filmed, since she'd researched the guys before they came and knew that they were filmmakers and figured they might be making a documentary. She was just so deep in the fantasy world that she didn't know when it would be the right moment to stop. It's a sad, sad situation, but very real and touching.If you're still wondering and can't take my word for it, they talked about a lot of extras that will be coming out on the DVD that, if you saw, I think would convince you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amateurish cinematography to be sure, but expected using a hand-held camera. Thankfully, it got less annoying as the film progressed. That aside, the homebrewed nature of this film added to its everyman interest, as the guys making it could have been anybody. I think that was the best and most interesting part of it.The three filmmaker "boys"(20-something NYC kids) in this documentary were a bit too smartass, smug and pompous for my taste, primarily Nev, but the story soon overcame that negative and showed well a peril of Facebook, which to me is a notorious bore and waste of time at my age, but can be an idea machine of the highest order for young artists with the creative drive to see its potential as a way to demonstrate their creativity. This story showed some very strange events that started with a posting on Facebook, and also showed that what could happen also might get a bit weird.I would bet money that some of this "true" story was contrived for dramatic purposes, it is entertainment after all, but the story of how one very life-challenged mother tried to escape her crushing homelife reality by taking on the alter ego of an artistic and multi-faceted fantasy family primarily to gain some escape and perhaps also a taste of the creative life she earlier wished for herself was a fascinating story that progressively riveted my attention due to its Ponzi-scheme complexity and real human pathos. I was troubled for days after seeing this story, and thought of it often with many questions in my mind. That is the true mark of success of a film, even if you are not sure you liked it. It worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>New York City photographer Nev Schulman's brother Ariel is a filmmaker, so when Nev begins a friendship with an 8 year old girl from Michigan named Abby, and her 19 year old sister, Megan, via Facebook, Ariel and Henry Joost start documenting it. Lucky us. Abby paints a picture of one of Nev's published photos and sends it to him. From there, well, it's the sort of journey best experienced with Niv, so it's difficult to say much more without detracting from the experience. The best I can do is say it's about social media and connections.Catfish is hilarious, moving, and thought- provoking. I loved it. It's unlike any documentary I've ever seen.

I know there has been some talk about the film being real, but once you see it for yourself you can tell that this film is authentic. It's a new type of documentary that could only have been made now because of the accessibility of HD cameras and the popularity of social networking. Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost have really set a new standard with this film. There is no question that a new style of film-making is quickly becoming all the rage.
