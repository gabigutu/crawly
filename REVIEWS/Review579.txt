		<shortDescription>The Government vs Ross Ulbricht</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is very interested in current events, politics and world history, I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I did not know anything about Silk Road or had even followed the trial of Ross Ulbricht. Yes, I did read the headlines announcing the verdict but it was only after watching this fine documentary did I learn about the trial and the issues surrounding Silk Road and the charges against Mr. Ulbricht. The "facts" are placed in context and many questions remain but what is presented in this film should be seen by all Americans and people seeking justice. This film is a must see even if it's only to get your footing on where Internet technology is heading and the dangers that lurk out there for all of us. Again, this is a "must see film" and I implored everyone take the time to view this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silk Road uncovered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Even those of us who consistently obey the law have a general idea of how criminals work: robbing banks, stealing cars, kidnapping people, even hacking websites for personal information. Additionally, the vast majority of us have at least a rudimentary understanding of how the internet works, and the steps we take to increase security. Documentarian Alex Winter combines these two topics as he takes us inside the deep web ? specifically Silk Road on the Darknet.The Surface Web vs The Deep Web - the film exposes what most of us have very little knowledge of. The simple explanation is that the "surface web" is what we use on a daily basis: Facebook postings photos of our latest meal and YouTube video sensations showing cats fighting their mirrored reflection. The Deep Web is what lies beneath. This is the (mostly) untraceable technology where the underground marketplace site known as Silk Road exists. To be clear, most of the ongoings on the deep web are legitimate and in good faith ? used frequently by journalists. However, the other side is how it obtained the nickname "ebay for Heroin". Yep, untraceable transactions for illegal drugs definitely happened (and still do). It turns out that Bitcoin is the ideal underground currency for this commerce, as it can be as untraceable as the drug orders.You might recognize the name of director Alex Winter as half of the classic movie duo in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). Mr. Winter released a documentary a couple years ago entitled Downloaded, where he explored the rise and fall of Napster and the effects of downloaded music. This current topic is much more dangerous and secretive, and he wisely brings along his old buddy Keanu Reeves as the narrator. Winter's approach here is initially a bit confusing, as the focus seems uncertain ? is it a tell all about the deep web, or is it a profile of Silk Road, or is it an analysis of the arrest and subsequent trial of possible Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht? Most of the attention goes to Ulbricht, better known as the Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR), a pseudonym snatched from the classic movie The Princess Bride. Is/Was Ulbricht the DPR? Winter is content to leave that mystery unsolved, but the real story here is how the government put the case together against Ulbricht ? fabricating charges (later dropped), circumstantial evidence, and a probable breach of privacy.The general belief is that we should have a free and open and secure internet, though most of us never stop to think what a ludicrous demand that really is. It's the lack of privacy and ease of breach on the surface web that led to the development of the deep web ? an anonymous and mostly secure environment. At least it was until the government went hard after Silk Road. Shutting down the non-violent drug transactions justified the law enforcement and political attention that the drug wars along the border never have. Is this a good thing? Is Ulbricht the DPR? Does it matter that after his arrest, his void was quickly filled by other opportunists? Do you believe you are secure on the web? Winter presents an exceptional amount of information that deserves even more discussion and explanation. That alone makes it time well spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deeper Web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write about cybercrime and cyber security, I took a special interest in this film. It is far different from the usual fare. In the usual cybercrime movie, there is always the scene where the hacker-hero sits down at a keyboard, begins typing frantically away, then turns to his eagerly awaiting colleagues and says something like, "okay, we're into the Pentagon's computer network". If only life were so easy. The movie may be good in other aspects, but the hacking scenes don't usually hold up.Documentaries on cybercrime are a bit different. Some of them are quite good, though they often come with an angle. By this I mean that they are not really trying to be objective, they are trying to make a case. In The Deep Web, it is clear early on that Alex Winter has an angle. The angle is that the deep web, the Silk Road, and Ross Ulbricht have provided a valid, honest service that does not undercut social values and, in fact, may have re-invigorated them. On the surface, this might seem like a difficult case to prove, but, to his credit, Winter does a remarkable job. Winter portrays the deep web as a new cyber nation where anonymity, freedom, and relief from the burden of government surveillance can thrive. It is, or can be, the true libertarian utopia. Although the film is hyped as being narrated by Keanu Reeves, he actually has a limited role. This is more of a marketing ploy than anything. In fact, a significant part of the film is carried by "consultant producer" and Wired magazine writer, Andy Greenberg. Greenberg was the first person to actually interview Ulbricht when he was only known as Dread Pirate Roberts. He believes that Ulbricht was sincere in his libertarian philosophy and truly felt that an open drug market would reduce the violence that was connected to illegal drug use. You'll have to decide for yourself if Greenberg and Winter makes a good case for Ulbricht or not. Winter does try to balance his pro-Ulbricht stance with interviews of various law enforcement officers connected to the case. There is some good and somewhat rare footage here of interviews with Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua Dratal, Ulbricht's parents, and some of Ulbricht's friends and admirers. There are even some home movies of Ulbricht himself that show he was more than just a drug dealer looking to make quick money. The one interview lacking is the one of Ulbricht himself. The crux of the film, at least for me, was the insinuation that Ulbricht received, to put it lightly, something less than a fair trial. He makes you wonder about two key points: the objectivity and competence of Judge Forrest and whether or not Ulbricht was railroaded. At times, Winter makes you wonder if there was not some sort of collusion between the prosecution and the judge; they just seemed to work so well together. Again, you can decide this for yourself. If there is one weak point in this documentary, it is trying to portray Ulbricht in too positive a light. I have read his Tor chats, even the ones he released after his sentencing to show that he was not only concerned about making money. From these alone, you can see that Ulbricht is not the aw shucks, golly gee, kid next door that Winter makes him seem to be. In short, like everyone, he has his positive and negative characteristics. That said, this is a good documentary and one that should be watched. I would recommend The Deep Web to everyone, even those who do not know much about the deep web, Ulbricht, or cybercrime. Winter makes the viewer consider the basic values that have created America and whether they have been dismantled to build something other than a free society. It could be that the Ulbricht trial was the crucible in which these fundamental American values were put to the test. Overall, The Deep Web is a first-rate documentary. Go see it. It will certainly give you a lot to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story, not about the deep web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked Alex Winter's Downloaded, as I thought it gave a very good synopsis of the Napster story. When I saw that he was doing one about the deep web, I was pretty stoked, especially sine this is a subject that is in it's early stages, unlike Napster. I heard Winter on Adam Carolla's podcast talking about it, and he spent most of the time talking about the Ulbrecht trial, which I was unfamiliar with. Still, since Ulbrecht was a major figure in the deep web, I thought it was going to be a substantial part of the documentary. I was mistaken. Ulbricht's story comprises 90% of this documentary, with various opinions on the war on drugs comprising another 8%. The remaining 2% actually talks about the deep web, and that merely serves to provide a framework and reference point for Ulbrecht's story. I hope that someday there will be a documentary about the deep web that isn't about one particular story or person, unfortunately this isn't it. That said, this is still really interesting, especially to people who have never heard of Ulbrecht's case or the deep web in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be called "The Trial of DPR"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested in watching a documentary explain the constructs and concepts of the Dark Web. However what I was presented with was the case breakdown against Dread Pirate Roberts(DPR) and the Silk Road Drug Trade. This would have been okay if they had spent about 15 minutes on this, instead the documentary trawls through parents, friends of DPR and the case construct, interviews with law enforcement and senators blah blah blah...I was bored after 20 mins and just fast forwarded to the relevant bit of which there was not many.This documentary is really about DPR and Silk Road. Not about the Dark Web, Tor or Hacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing about the Deep Web</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie about the Deep Web. This is not the movie for you. It was more about a guy getting screwed over by the government. It was nicely done and made it's point. But it never answered anything about the deep web. I was hoping for something other than the stuff that you can find on the web or you tube videos. As far as the government's war on drugs it's never going to win. People that want to get high are going to find a way to get high. It's just like if someone wants someone else dead it's going to happen and you can pass 1,000,000 new laws and it's not going to change a thing. I made my first rifle when I was 8 and that was without the Internet. Just a Public Library and the Dewey decimal system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely misses the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a documentary that's called "Deep Web", this documentary completely misses the point.In the first couple of minutes, it explains perfectly what the deep web is for. It explains that there are far more actually useful ways of using it then there are illegal ways of using it. After that, unfortunately, the documentary goes downhill.It talks about the Silk Road, about the trial of Ross Ulbricht, about the suspicious government activities while building the case against him, about the drug wars... A minute after minute it goes further and further away from the actual topic and talks about the things that have weaker and weaker connection to the actual title. I did my best to watch it until the end, but about an hour later, I just couldn't take it anymore.If this documentary was called "Silk Road", I'd understand it (and I would probably have never tried to watch it since Silk Road is not that interesting topic to me), but for a documentary that's called "Deep Web", it completely misses the point and talks about... well, everything else.I do understand that the Silk Road has been in the news a lot and that it became the most recognizable site that represents what could the deep web be used for, but this documentary (like many articles I have read) talks like the deep web is nothing more then a synonym for the Silk Road. In reality, deep web is far move then that. Silk Road is just yet another website that operates using the .onion domain. Not the only one. The only reason it became this big is because we talk about it constantly. It wouldn't be such a gigantic business if it weren't for the medias that talked about it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Points Brought Up Go Nowhere, I'm Totally Confused About More Than The Title Being Mis-Leading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dark Web is a red herring title as the documentary here is almost in it's entirety about the dark net web site Silk Road and it's alleged founder Ross Ulbricht. Perhaps 10% of the movie speaks to the actual creation and on going nature of the so called "Dark Web". That said, the case involving Ross Ulbricbht is just as interesting, maybe even more important as much of how anyone's freedom in cyberspace will play out.If like me you've read several articles about Ross Ullbricht and The Silk Road you likely vacillated between believing he's a criminal or martyr. You'll be a bit more in the middle post viewing The Dark Web, even leaning toward thinking he's a naive idealist in the pursuit of a fantasy world with total freedom and non-oppression for all. No matter how guilty or innocent he may be he was convicted of, the fact that this idealism was tied to a lucrative drug trade, It doomed him. If he could have set up a marketplace for just about anything legally acceptable he would be a visionary. So, in the end you feel he was somewhat unfairly crushed by the powers that be, but he actually went too far by asking for it. Perhaps his goal to be a martyr was achieved as his ideas live on. In the documentary The Dark Web you feel less than impressed however. You really didn't learn much about the actual dark web and you are really conflicted as to if Ulbricht got what he deserved or was a victim of grossly misused judicial power. This is a confusing piece of film from the title to the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deep Propaganda....and the Mis-titled movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st, let me start off by saying this is NOT a movie focusing on the Dark Web. This movie focuses on Ross Ulbricht and his trail and conviction.The movie title is meant to imply it covers the content of the web, aspects and issues...It scratches some of the "manifesto" concepts of the web and freedoms and that is about it.The movie goes to extreme lengths to color Ross as a victimized patriot, exercising what he feels is freedom and marginalizes the other effects. It plays off the Silk Road as a way for drugs to be sold without violence and mentions decriminalization several times.What it does not mention is the numbers behind the claims. I find it highly improbable that your average heroin addict can tell you what bitcoin is, much less grasp the idea that 1 coin has a value of $230.00 per coin. The fact that the prices on the Silk Road were at the top end seems like it was simply a way for white and blue collar people to obtain drugs without risk of violence, more than the poppycock the movie tries to smear and portray as a universal truth.The movie also tries to place doubt of guilt on Ross by CONSTANTLY quoting the defenses concerns over the location of the Silk Road serves and the movie REPEATEDLY tries to convince you this information was never submitted in writing or court...which is a lie and nothing more. What they SHOULD say is we disagree with what was STATED IN COURT as the method of which the servers location, via IP, was obtained, which they do, but not in the movie.This is simply a pro-Ross Ulbricht movie, meant to swing opinions prior to the appeals process as far as I can tell. It is rife with misinformation, lies and falsehoods, under the guise, again, of safe drug transactions, freedom and the right of anonymity.My suggestion is simple. Anytime a claim is made, concerning the legal end of Ulbricht's situation, to research that claim. All...and I mean ALL of the documents from the court proceedings are EASILY obtained online. There are claims against the Federal government and they may be valid, but to say that the Feds never said WHY and HOW is misleading with an intent to convey the theme that a law was broken to catch a law breaker.The show is done well, camera work is flawless, it is the method of delivery of the content I have issues with. I would think any person who's focus is truth, would also have issue with the manipulation used in this "Documentary"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Title is misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is not about the deep web in general, but rather more tightly focused on The Silk Road and Ross Ulbright trial.Like all documentaries based on this subject it gives you clear instructions of how to go on the deep web using Tor and buy drugs using Bitcoins. The reporters always claim its for educational purposes but I don't see why anyone needs a step by step guide on how to buy drugs online unless they really want to do that. I think this is wrong and can only be harmful.Youtube is full of documentaries and guides like this that claim to be educational in order to prevent them being taken down.If the media hadn't blown the lid on the Silk Road, there wouldn't have been heaps of school kids buying drugs who didn't know about it before. FACT This is a documentary you do not want your kids to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cleaning an underlying crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can't be possible to think that because apparently there's no substantial evidence of a particular crime is enough to undercharge the same accused for an underlying crime. It can't be possible to think that avoiding some side effects of criminal acts, these acts become good and healthy. It's not ethical. I think that absolute privacy it's not a goal for people who live in a society and that interact with other people and institutions in a normal and legal way. Wasting time in order to achieve a high level of complexity in new coding internet transactions methods appears useless for common people that only need enough security to avoid hackers attacks. The suggested relation between some coding activities with an outstanding operative system is misleading and unacceptable.</fullReview>
