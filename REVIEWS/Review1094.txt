		<fullReview>"Now You See Me" was a personal guilty pleasure of 2013, it was absolutely unpretentious and unbelievable but it knew it was so and with the help of a talented cast and a couple of good characters and story beats it turned out as a fine time at the theater. Its sequel starts out with the same unpretentious and fun vibe of the first only to slowly escalate up to what becomes one of the most lifeless and visually painful experiences of the year.As I said the movie started out really fine, in the sense that it was doing what I wanted it to do. Nobody should or would walk into this film expecting the new "Heat", I just wanted to have some dumb fun, with a self referential film that doesn't take anything seriously and up to the fist two set-pieces of the film that's what I was getting. The cast was working the best they could and the action felt fluent and visually pleasing, there was a rhythm to it and a reason for it in particular.Yet, as soon as we start getting into this film's second act things fall apart to a mind numbing degree and I mean that literally, my mind went blank with the level of stupidity and inconsequentially of what was going on, I watched this film in a state of trance where I couldn't tell if I was dozing off or simply bored to death."Now You See Me 2" takes the levels of suspense of disbelief to a whole new world where not even laughing at the film proves to be of any kind of satisfaction, everything going on is just visual noise and other than being filmed in the most uninteresting and unstylish way possible, it has no momentum, no character, it's just there for the sake of extravaganza and it keeps going on for unbelievable amounts of time and it never proves to be any kind of pleasant.And we haven't even taken into consideration the logistical implications of what happens. It is just crazy. There is no grit of grounding of actions, stuff just keeps happening on top of other stuff and without any kind of character or story implications the film becomes more of a showcase of dull visual tricks. Not to mention the story twists it spices in which are preposterous to even think about and sprinkled with silly clichés and dialogue that not even Ruffalo or Freeman, two of the greatest actors, manage to make even passable.I got a head ache from this movie, it was a terrible experience, I don't recommend it and the shortness of my review is reflective of how lost with words I am about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big giant mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the thing about 2013's "Now You See Me," I didn't hate it but I wasn't completely wowed by it either. Mildly entertaining is how I'd describe it. It's heist caper like Ocean's Eleven but with faster sleight of hand. So to say that "Now You See Me" didn't have its amusing moments, would be a lie. But this sequel however, NOW YOU SEE ME 2, is a big giant mess.In NOW YOU SEE ME 2, the four horsemen Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan, after a year of outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. But a certain revenge plot threatens their impossible heist yet.The first film had more mystery, thriller and intrigue, so at the very least it kept you engaged, but NOW YOU SEE ME 2 resorts to cheap laughs and a build up that frankly kinda insults our intelligence. The film would like to make you believe that it's smart, it even thinks itself that way, but in its attempt to give you a seemingly intricate and elaborate trick and a big reveal, it gets lost in its own process.Isla Fisher's Henley whom I thought was a strong female character, got replaced by Lizzy Caplan's Lula who's more concerned about getting laid. For some reason, they had to present Woody Harrelson's character's identical twin brother, also played by Woody Harrelson. I think that was a poor decision on the filmmakers' part. It's bad enough that they had to resort to this annoying unlikable family member, on top of that, they couldn't just get another actor and have it be a brother, instead of identical twin?! Woody Harrelson is a great actor, but watching two of him bantering, that's the point when I stop taking this movie seriously as a piece of entertainment. This franchise says that the closer you look, the less you see. Well, if you step back a bit, you'll see the big picture that NOW YOU SEE ME 2 is not as crafty as it's cracked up to be.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the first installation was enjoyable, the second one does not live up. The plot was bland and dull and dragging. The dialogue was dry and just downright stupid. The magic tricks were OK (and unnecessary), but there was no wow factor. No jaw-dropping revealing or mind hack or anything like that. If the first movie keeps you guessing until the final scene, then Now You See Me 2 just basically tells the whole story in a straight line. It's just plain badTo pair with the bad plot, the acting was also horrid. Lizzy Caplan was beyond tragic. There is no charisma in her character at all. Replacing Isla Fisher was a really bad move. And when you thought: "Well, at least Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman will provide some top-notch acting?", you were wrong. Their characters are just so dull that even their talents can not save them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable ? And Not In A Good Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is undeniably visually dazzling, arguably to the point of being exhausting. But what I'm taking from this dubious new genre, if you could call it that, is that filmmakers shamelessly exploit and yet devalue the nature of real-life illusionism (i.e. "magic"), in which the magician actually has to make something work that looks impossible or highly unlikely (it's a trick), by making use of the nearly endless possibilities of film, in which things that would be impossible in real life can actually be accomplished on screen. So we get things like Lizzy Caplan apparently vanishing into thin air in Atlas's apartment, and since magicians, of course, don't divulge how they accomplish their tricks, the film takes advantage of this by doing things that in all likelihood really are impossible ? no explanations or credibility necessary. Since we all know that you can do all these things in the movies anyway, what's the point of making them into magicians, when you can watch a Harry Potter movie and you don't really have to wonder how people in paintings can move?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't find the wow factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a group of magicians who are going to reveal the secrets of a corporation. However, they get outsmarted and blackmailed. They have to try get an upper hand in a seemingly difficult situation. I enjoyed the first "Now You See Me" because I was wowed by the mystery and suspense it had. This installment, however, does not provide me with the same experience. This time round, the film spends a lot of time introducing the new characters and to set the picture. Then, there is a constant stream of trickery, which are unrealistic and unlikely. The plot becomes so far fetched and random, events happening so conveniently that it loses believability, which is the key that made the first film great. There are some scenes in here that's good, but most of the time I am left to wonder when the film is going to end. Unfortunately, I can't see the wire factor in "Now You See Me 2".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the first movie was good, i love it in fact. All the tricks were kinda impossible, but at least its all make sense after they showed us how they did it and added with an interesting plot twist at the end. Now you see me 2, however, went to the next level of bull tricks and meaningless story line with "crunchy" jokes. It was boring and confusing. I wasted 2 hours for nothing. I used to think that the characters in the first movie were good and well tough out - they were good as a team and fun to be watched. Now, they are just annoying and try soooo hard to look cool with their crappy dialogue and outrageous tricks. Its a movie about magicians right? Not witches nor wizards. I mean, can they really throwing cards from one to another without anyone noticing? Can a card slide through your body that easily?To summarise, the movie is bad in everything (story line, acting, dialogue) Don't even bother to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 5 worst movies I have ever paid for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so poorly written, I felt the need to make as many people aware to avoid paying for it. I think I have written a handful of reviews but here is my short take on it...It was a story line that never developed, childish "illusions," and attempts at humor that made me roll my eyes. The characters were painful to watch act as the lines and script was so awkward, they could not even make it look good. My friend summarized the "entertainment" best by imitating the illusions saying, "It's not in this hand because look! It's in my other hand!" That corny. I watched two different couples walk out before they delivered some illogical obnoxious explanation on the "eye" and then my friend and I walked out asthey continued to explain. The first movie was very entertaining but this may be the worst sequel ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing computer magic..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the first one, which had a few plot holes, but a fairly convoluted and charming plot, this one is empty.The characters are lacking in substance, the magic acts are now obviously computer generated and thus boring. I mean if you go for computer generated magic, go full harry potter. The plot is predictable at times, cliché (evil twin? what is this a soap opera?) and face palm worthy the rest of the time. And it actually detracts from the art of magic. Which is a shame.Acting is not bad, Morgan Freeman can't go wrong really. Woody Harrelson always a fun actor to watch. Anyway , it is the script and impossible without CGI magic acts that ruins this for me. Hope they make better decisions in the 3rd part. Which I sincerely hope they will do , if not for anything else , to make amends for this one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Caricature of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I didn't like the first "Now You See Me", but I would rate it a 6/10 just for the fact it was SOMEWHAT enjoyable. The sequel is a movie that probably nobody asked for, but yet they did it anyway. 2 hours of poorly directed and written nonsense.SOME vague spoilers ahead, though you won't care about them at all.THE PLOT The plot tries to twist and turn a couple of times, but it is just a straight line. To try and spice it up they tried the twist with Morgan Freeman's character, but nobody believed it, not even Mr. Freeman.THE MAGIC A movie about magic should not be a movie about CGI, which the first movie was and now the second. The Illusionist and The Prestige were doing their magic tricks for the audience IN the movie, for the crowd in that universe. This one does the tricks just for the people watching the movie. Need to make someone disappear? Of course there will be a cut. Need to make someone escape? They simply transform into water. How? Who cares, a magician never reveals his tricks (hint: CGI). THE LOGISTICS A bunch of random magicians can take over the whole of London on New Year's Eve in half a day without preparation. They can also somehow broadcast their tricks LIVE all over the world, on all TVs in all city centers, etc.THE PANDERING TO THE Chinese MARKET Yes I know that "entertaining" movies nowadays always have something for the Chinese market: a character, a vase, a flashback scene, etc. But this one went all in: mystical characters that know and see everything, they help the protagonists without a second thought, etc. Oh and did I mention they are literally going to China for some reason, just to show what a great place it is?THE HEIST SCENE (FLYING CARD) God please make it stop. A 10-minutes scene with a quintillion number of ways it can go wrong - everything works out. How to prevent a heist like that? A single security camera in the room and an underpaid guard watching it. Done.THE FEMALE CHARACTER Jesus Christ, don't get me started on Lizzy Caplan's character. With a couple of attempts at witty lines about misogyny and discrimination, her character was a caricature of a female character.JESSE EISENBERG No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a movie about magicians, and are not 12 years old, I'll recommend The Illusionist or The Prestige. If you like superhero movies - watch one of those. This is kind of a mix.I guess what I'm trying to say is:If you like movies that are fast paced, where they try to cram as much as possible into the movie in as little time as possible, kind of a movie directed by a hamster or something, then you'll probably like this movie.If you suspension of disbelief comes easy to you, then you'll also like it. Because there is really nothing very believable in it. All the magic tricks smell of CGI and "movie", and there is never doubt whether it's gonna work or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this movie even received a 7 rating is a good example of how the studios clearly pay people to stuff the ballot boxes. Don't be fooled by the great cast. This one is straight to VOD and everything in this film says "cash in on the mild success of the first." What makes fun is the "how did they do that?" question. But in this one, they tell you. It's only possible in a movie like this where you get the help of CGI and ask you to believe that the dumb things you see and know couldn't happen just happen. They will definitely not make a third.The first movie in this series was something of a failure because it decided to foolishly allow it's "heroes" to pull of feats of wonder that were simply impossible without help from CGI. Hollywood seems to think that pushing the limits beyond is a good thing, forgetting that most of us with a brain get bumped right out of movie land magic once a movie shows reminds us of how false of a premise it is. The suspension of disbelief is gone and you're left just with disbelief.So this film has a problem that is evident early. How can we top the preposterous nature of the first film with something even more improbable and ridiculous? Ten minutes into the film they use CGI twice in one scene that is so absurd that you can't help but feel insulted. No!!! It really IS magic! THIS is what you should expect from this movie. And if you can buy this lazy effort and pretend as if the totally super cool amazingly impossible is somehow possible -perhaps you'll like this film. It's the kind of magic that only superheroes can pull off. And that only works because it's never meant to be real like this is. I hated it. I only stayed with it because of company. Save your money. And even if it's free, save your time. And if you're really curious, just wait for that scene 10 minutes into the movie to decide whether you really want to be dumb enough to waste another hour plus. The script is bad enough and the acting lazy so that you can make that decision easily. At least I've helped you gauge whether you want to watch this film or plan on having an alternative plan to escape from this movie.... like magic.</fullReview>

The dialogues was dry and cringy. The magic tricks felt pointless(unnecessary) and no wow factors.They built up for a plot but it was absolutely terrible...They had many great actors and therefor this movie will probably make it's money back but the movie itself was horrendously bad (I don't understand how it can have score of 7 so far)Lizzy Caplan acting was horrible or they just wanted her role to look like trash...1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NYSM2 is no where near the prequel. Few wow factors and jaw dropping scenes. Dialogues are dry and unnecessary. The new horseman tries too hard to be liked. The most unbearable plot is turning Bradley to a good man! So ridiculous! I so enjoyed the plot-twisted at the end of prequel and now you are telling me that is not the truth?? I re-watched 1 after getting home from theater. I am sure that when filming 1, Bradley was set to be a villain without doubts. Filmmakers wanted to make more money but ran out of ideas so they stupidly changed the character. I regret to watch this movie because not only it's poor written and acted, also it ruins my good memory of the prequel :(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why Morgan Freeman has such a passion for making movies with 'GOTCHA' endings that fall so completely flat and bloodless, but it feels like a recurring theme in his otherwise wonderful career - this movie, just like its predecessor, charges with great fun and energy towards an ending it would be almost impossible to care about, a finish that you would struggle to predict even if you ever wanted to. So many talented people in this film given absolutely no help in making themselves likable, this movie doesn't even have the clever, engaging 'was that magic or movie making' successes of the first film. It reminds me, actually, of the Ocean's 11 sequels - where everyone involved appears to be having a great time, except the audience, who is ignored or disdained at every turn. A bummer. Disappointed in myself for ignoring the lousy trailer, and daring this film not to waste my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The little depth which was exhibited in the first movie, has become so shallow in this installment that it almost seems like throwing your money away. At least the first one had great tricks up its sleeve to amaze people. This one just lacks creativity of plot, of magic, or of mystery.The characters are plain with no sense of mystery or dimension. I don't know how it plummeted from what we saw in the first movie. Even Mark Ruffalo seems to be clinging to a stick, and here we all knew him as the mystic man behind the show. Jesse Eisenberg, manages to bring his signature style of acting to a new level of boring. Daniel Radcliffe seems like a confused child whining away with no sense of direction. Woody Harrelson and Morgan Freeman are fine (as usual), but even they can't save the movie from its uni-dimensional plot.Ah and God, a Deus Ex Machina at the end. Please! The plot had so much possibilities after the first movie, and you end up with this emotional melodramatic crap. All in all, only the first-half before the interval was worth some good laughs, and after the interval, the movie plummeted like Mark Ruffalo's character in the sea. Lizzy Caplan is the only takeaway from the movie who at least did a great job being the new bubbly horseman.1.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say was that this film was really boring. I guess the main reason that I saw it was because I ended being caught up with all of the advertising, and also I was wanting to kill a bit of time on a Friday night (and my local cinema has a permanent half-price on all tickets). I had seen the first film in the series and it was okay, but nothing all that spectacular, however, not surprisingly, the sequel ended up being a lot worse.Like most sequels, this film begins about a year after the first film ended, where the Four Horsemen became members of a secret society of illusionists (the film is not so much about magic, but rather about illusions), however they are also on the most wanted list. The thing is that they are really bored and want to get in on a bit more action, and then an opportunity arises ? a telecommunications firm is releasing a new smart-phone, however what this smart phone does is that it takes all of your information and sells it to the highest bidder. So they crash the party and attempt to expose the fraud for what it is.The problem is that somebody is way ahead of them and end up exposing not only them, but the ring leader (who is still masquerading as an FBI agent). They flee, jump into a chute, and suddenly discover that they have been magically transported to Macau. Remember, the film is about illusion, not magic ? all of the magic tricks in the film actually have a rational explanation behind them, including how they managed to magically travel from New York to Macau in what seemed like a matter of seconds.This was probably the most interesting aspect of the film ? how they actually performed the illusions, but that didn't actually do all that much to save what is in effect a really boring movie. Like most sequels, the main characters, including the bad guys, come across from the previous film, though there are a few new faces, including Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame. The problem was that Radcliffe's character was actually really pathetic. I won't so much as say that it was his acting ability (though it could well have been), it is just that he simply did not seem to be able to play the part.In the end there is nothing really all that great about this film, and as far as I'm concerned, there are much better films out there that will simply leave this one for dead (which isn't all that hard).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have just seen Now You See Me 2 yesterday, and I was pretty let down, no, confused by the plot.And that's where we are gonna start.As a heist/magic movie, Now You See Me 2 obviously has many twists and turns in the story, just like its predecessor. But this sequel has too many twists and turns that they made the fans struggle to understand what the heck was going on. I mean, creating the Daniel Radcliffe's character was good, but making Thaddeus Bradley a good guy? That's a crazy idea! And why would he and Lionel Shrike( Dylan's father) pretend to hate each other? Thaddeus said that it had been a trick, but for what? Why Thaddeus wouldn't be a cop and why Shrike wouldn't be a thieve? They would have fooled a lot of banks and had lots of money, wouldn't they? I would rather see Lionel Shrike came back to life and said he was head of the Eye rather than Thaddeus become a good guy. One more crazy thing is, when the Horsemen found out that the chip they had stolen were fake, then how on earth could it become a real one in the end of the movie? I remembered that Walter( Oh, I remember his name now) had checked that chip and he said it was real.The plot was way too over complicated for any moviegoer to understand.Finally, I just want to say that Now You See Me 2 had truly fooled moviegoers by the magic tricks( Holy *beep*, they were stunning). If you are looking for a good movie this weekend, then skip this one( And Warcraft as well). You might be disappointed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now You See Me 2 - Review: Cash Grab</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first movie, I could say that I kinda loved it.When the first movie was released, I passed on the theater experience. At one point, I was never going to watch the first movie, but that all changed when a friend of mine had recommended it to me.So one day, I actually sat down and watched Now You See Me after hearing a lot of mixed reviews about it. I had a lot of fun with the first movie, I thought it was creative, it was beautifully shot, the music was great, all the actors were charismatic, and the movie moved at a fast paced.Now You See Me 2 is just more of the same, but this movies execution is much slower. Also, the circumstances in this movie are quite unbelievable. The first movie had some ridiculous, almost ludicrous, and quite unbelievable feats involved, but the second movie takes it to a whole other level.The opening in Now You See Me 2 is a bit slow, it takes a while to get things going; However, once everybody's in place, the movie does start to pick up steam. The first job that the Horsemen execute in the movie is entertaining and fun, but then after that, the movie slows down again, and by the mid point I fell asleep. I woke up after the Horsemen had executed their second job, so I missed it, but the story wasn't hard to follow. I did fall asleep during quite a few sequences because the movie was so boring, slow, and predictable, however, even though I missed some things, I was never lost or confused when I woke up.The fight sequences in this movie are bad, they're poorly shot, and I could barely tell what was happening. The establishing shots were good, the music also added some form of excitement to them.The actors were still pretty likable, even Daniel Radcliffe was good, but I thought he was completely underutilized, and he barely did anything.The "magic tricks" in this movie are completely illogical, the first movie had this problem as well, but the sequel turns every magician into a superhero, it tries to make logical sense, but I feel that the screenwriters just wanted to show the audience something cool, and so they just said, "To hell with logic!"Overall, Now You See Me 2 is not as fun as the first movie in my opinion. This movie has one or two fun moments, but as a whole it's a complete snooze fest. This movie is 100% predictable (even if you fall asleep), it's boring, it's slow, and it's just a lazy cash grab. I dare say that I love the first movie, but the sequel sucks.Final Grade: F</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was absolutely atrocious. I really liked the first one so I went to see this as soon as possible hoping for more but it seems like they doubled down on all the things people hated about the first movie. The magic tricks were much more CG heavy, the story-line was absurd and confusing, and worst of all the tone of the film was completely different. I love Lizzy Caplan but everything about her in this movie I hated. Everything about her character enforced the idea that we were no longer in a realistic movie and everything became slapstick and silly. The first movie had a "real world" feel. As soon as Woody Harrelson's 'Brother' appeared I pretty much checked out. I cant overstate how much I hated this.</fullReview>

I held in there till the end, just to see how it ended, wasting more precious moments I can never get back. Why? Muddied story line, reliance on "action" to carry the film, with ridiculously long, unnecessary sequences. How long really can you watch grown adults play hide the parcel (card / super chip)before it becomes nothing more than a time filler. Wait to contemplate watching once it comes to TV / Free to Air / Cable, before you waste you hard earned dollars on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i would like to start this with the usual compliment of something in film but,, this has nothing worth mentioning. the characters are generic and corny.. it turns into a dumb story about the dad that died in the safe. Morgan and Mark have a bonding scene that is cringe-worthy, bad, corny,, almost gives you a "give a break" moment... the one that makes you get up and go ask for your money back do yourself a favor and avoid the aggravation, just skip this one.Also the new girl they use is too "Disney" and Woody H plays twins,, badly acted and inconsistent to the plot and both just come across just annoying. Poor Radcliffe tries to add his boyish charm but ends up going down with this ship,,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2, directed by Jon Chu (that rhymes!) is a sequel to an enjoyable Now You See Me made in 2013. This film however was not as enjoyable. What made Now You See Me so enjoyable was the allure of mystery. Like magic we did not know how everything was done and the truth was revealed only after everybody was fooled. In NYSM 2 each tricks are revealed so fast that it doesn't feel like magic. It's like a magician telling you the secret as he is performing it. That's not fun at all. The first film also had the two side that the audience followed, the cops and the magicians. With that the audience could essentially choose a protagonist and follow their mystery, but in this movie everything has been laid out for you and the mystery that was in the first film disappears in the second one.What took me out of the film the most were the small details. For example one character (Jack) teaches the new girl (Lula) a back palm. As a magician myself this is frustrating to see as Lula is shown doing multiple amazing and imaginative magic throughout the movie and yet does not know how to do one of the most fundamental sleights in magic. There are other minute details that makes this movie feel so much like a movie than a real life. Everybody except the cops and the antagonists love the horsemen. There is a really sappy scene in the end where everybody is gathered and they are saying very clichéd dialogues. As well the characters felt bland.Speaking of characters, most of them were very one dimensional. All of the conflicts and the character relationships felt like it could have been developed more and since they were not fully developed I did not care as much. There were some enjoyable moments in the movie, and some tricks were fun to watch. The first magic and the card heist being my favourite but even with that it felt very empty when I left the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NYSM2 is a literal and fatal misdirection with little in the way of fresh excitement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has seen Christopher Nolan's cerebral masterwork in The Prestige will recall that a magic trick consists of three acts. Typically, this involves the 'setup' where the nature of the trick is explained, the 'performance' where the magician applies misdirection to fool the audience, and finally the 'effect' of the illusion on said audience. At no point will a magician reveal the secret behind the effect. So despite its critical consensus of style over substance, 2013's Now You See Me turned out to be a popular hit precisely due to the performance and misdirection applied. It was cheesy fun and at times nail bitingly good but we wanted to be fooled and we were.Picking up roughly a year after the events of the first film, Now You See me 2 seeks to bring back the pizazz of its predecessor with more twists, turns, noise and nonsense. That's not necessarily a bad thing and while it's fairly traditional to harvest the merit of an original, NYSM2 as a sequel suffers in continuity owing to a poorly conceived setup. A result of which has the returning A-list cast embroiled in a save-the-world technology heist, ala international espionage styled thriller. With the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan (replacing Isla Fisher), the Horsemen are now required to pull off a high security job reserved for the likes of Ethan Hunt. And as absurd as that sounds, the idea of a hi-tech heist using street magic is quickly overrun by expository plot points in the form of flashbacks. No surprise then that however baffling a trick might seem, Morgan Freeman's celestial voice talent is always ready to narrate the secret. It doesn't help either that most of the other actors struggle with characters that lack any semblance to the previous film; Jesse Eisenberg included. Also lacking, albeit severely, is the on-stage showmanship of the Horsemen that made them famous in the first place. Instead, new director Jon M. Chu's outlandish approach is in laying the foundation for a trilogy ? much like the Oceans 11, 12, 13 franchise but with smoke, shadow, mirrors and identical twins. In part, this plays out by pitting head Horsemen Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) against Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley, a magic debunker with ulterior motives. While this incubates a backstory of tragedy and vengeance, it also detracts from the central theme of magic and those show stopping illusions that we actually came to see. To its merit, the inclusion of Daniel Radcliffe adds a whimsy twist to this sequel. Radcliffe is no stranger to magic but we get to see him play a creepy Bond-like villain in a bizarre father-son relationship with main villain Tressler (Michael Caine). Other developments include Woody Harrelson in a double role with equally bizarre if not intended comic interjections. And poof! Everything else goes out the window, rabbit and hat in tow. With legendary illusionist David Copperfield serving as production consultant, NYSM2 should have turned out better than the first film. But on its own there is little in the way of fresh excitement, let alone not more than two main illusions. And undermining the entire concept of films about magic, at no point are we fooled into believing what we see either. Ultimately it all comes down to the arduous task of direction, or in this case, a literal and fatal misdirection but without the intended effect. Fans of the first film might find themselves in a giddy bag of tricks. For the rest, it's like watching a street magician perform with Parkinson's disease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse Than The First - Terrible Everything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first one was a little better, but still had the terrible acting, despite the magic of Mark Ruffalo and Woody Harrelson, they were unable to rescue anything. Now they decide to add one of the worst actors ever in the history of acting, Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel needs to understand he was just the right face for Harry Potter and that is it, he wasn't there for his acting abilities. In this movie and anything he's tried after Harry Potter, it proves this fact. To put him as a nerdy geek is one thing, kinda plays to his terrible acting, however to play him as a global criminal mastermind, that's just idiotic, for this I blame the writers and directors, shame on you idiots. Jesse Eisenberg acting roles has always bemused me, he wasn't the only one who destroy Superman vs Batman, there was a whole load of crap in that movie. But his one dimension "acting" as he believes it to be destroys the mood of any movie. I understand he writes, produces and directs, perhaps stick to that?? Lizzy Caplan's addition to the quirky loudmouth lady sidekick is just odd, can't tell if it is her acting or just terrible symmetry for the role. But no....just no. It saddens me to see Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine agreeing to play in these dog gone godawful movies, I can a only assume they need a paycheck. Be warned, you will lose over 2hrs of your life watching this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very simply this movie is riding on the shoulders and expectation following the first film and on an all star cast.We are introduced to a new character early on with no real explanation as to the absence of Isla Fisher's character, I think the most plausible explanation is that Isla Fisher must be the only person who actually read the script before filming started!If you ignore my advice and still watch this, then prepare to have your disbelief suspended, battered into screaming submission and then vomited onto the floor.BTW Daniel Radcliffe must have been penciled in for his role just as a joke at the planning stage, but tragically made it into the actual film. Radcliffe is Harry Potter and shouldn't be let close to anything that relates to magic, you just spend the whole film thinking "OMG Harry has turned pretty nasty, hmm he does look better with contact lenses though, I wonder when is he going to pull his wand out and cast a pointless spell?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me put this straight, this season 2 totally sucks compared to the season 1. The few magic scenes are disappointing. The first magic-show scene is still attractive, but then nothing about magic happens till the final show. In season 1, magic scenes run through the whole movie, and all those magics work perfectly and reasonably. In season 2, it's more like a action movie with many street fights. The new characters are plain unnecessary. Let's say, the appearance of Lula aims at the gender balance. Right, it's important. None of us wants to see a movie without a beautiful face. So, what's the point of the two Chinese characters, that grandma and grandson? I believe the plot goes fluently even though the director cuts out all their scenes. Those trivial characters just distract the audiences' attention from the Horse Men and make the plot dragging and embarrassing. Combined with the lack of magic and additional characters, the plot becomes so distractive that some of the logic mistakes become so confusing. Like, the Horse Men have nothing in Macau, no money, no magic tools, no identity. They are under the supervision and can't leave the city. However, after they save their leader, they are free to go. They suddenly travel to London and have enough time and everything to prepare their final show. By then, they are still required by the FBI and chased by the villains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first film. I'm always hesitant about watching sequels, but I figured if they at least follow a similar plot line, it should be somewhat enjoyable. Wow, was I wrong. This sequel is talky, boring with an occasional CGI trick thrown in. Add that to a plot that just meanders along and you have NYSM2.The film made me angry - I had much time to have my anger build since the plot was so bland and uninteresting. It's like throw many stars at a film, use CGI and there we have it. The joke is on us for spending money on this turkey! It's now all about making as much money as possible, the art aspect of film making has taken a beating. Green light whatever has many stars in it and will turn a profit. Hope that many people will see it before the fact that it is garbage gets out and people stay away. Giving people two hours of enjoyable cinematic fun has disappeared from the equation.. This film is a mess! Re-watch the first film instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love the first "Now You See Me," like, a lot. It's just a really light, breezy, nonstop fun movie, and it knows it. And the trailer for this movie looked like it would be more of the same, which I was completely fine with. Unfortunately, the trailer is infinitely better than the actual film.Honestly, this movie was embarrassing to watch. From the childishly annoying character that Lizzy Caplan plays, to the horrendously unfunny identical twin that Woody Harrelson plays, I was cringing in my seat and praying for deliverance. Now, one could argue that Lizzy Caplan's character was intentionally annoying, and that Woody Harrelson's twin character was intentionally unfunny, and while I would agree with that, it still didn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience, especially when these two characters had a significant amount of screen time.I can't deny that "Now You See Me 2" did have some very entertaining sequences, with one particular scene involving an elaborate card trick being the definite highlight of the film. However, these few scenes couldn't save this forgettable mess of a film. I mean honestly, I'm having a hard time writing this review because I can't even remember what I disliked about this movie. It's just a completely forgettable film in every way that will leave your mind as soon as the credits start.Huh, come to think of it, maybe this film did do something right after all: it disappears completely, just like a real magician would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 can be equated with the last slurps of a snow cone, where there is no flavor left, but you finish it anyhow. Now You See Me was one of those refreshing works that always left you wanting for more. It has to be said that the sequel to the 2013 amazing movie was far from impressive. If the makers had the idea that dazzling the viewers with a lot of hyperbolic cinematography was the way to go, they were sadly mistaken. The many small and episodic routines that were to culminate in to some sort of a grand Finale which were supposed to wow the viewers fell short of achieving that. All things considered, the worst part of the movie has to be Lizzy Caplan's way below average acting and presence in the movie. The movie could have been a little better without her lackluster performance and over the top hollow effort to outshine Isla Fischer (which made her look even more miserable), and hopefully she is given the sack if the makers of the franchise ever plan to redeem themselves with another movie after the second not so indulging effort.</fullReview>

Now You See Me 2 isn't as entertaining as it's predecessor,it didn't brings new to table but brought us the predictable formula and tricks that wants you to throw you brain on the cinema floor or drink a lot of alcohol to get drunk in order to fully enjoy the film if you are a type of person who question everything or skeptic and always nitpicks or too smart to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, in my opinion this is better than the first. Obviously this film cannot live without the first one. But it expands in the story so much more than expected.Now You See Me 2, has surpassed my expectations in the fact that it finishes the story to the fullest. The first one left us on a kind of cliffhanger, and now it tells us the rest of the story. But apart from the great actors Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco and Morgen Freeman coming back for another magic trick we also get another surprise guest. And that's Daniel Radcliffe. I am amazed over the fact that i saw him as a whole nother character and not like "oh hey look, its harry potter and hes gonna teach them some magic".Jokes aside, this is an amazing movie and its absolutely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that having watched the first one some time back, I really did not remember lots of things. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first one a lot! Really! But not being able to remember what's up with the FBI guy and that the other magician was supposed to be dead, was a pleasure kill in the beginning of the movie. Other than that, it was nicely made. The tricks were really cool, once more, although a bit far-fetched at times (but that's why you watch movies like that in the first place). Brilliant cast, and nicely acted by all performers involved! I think it was the second time after the batman movie that Caine and Freeman were in the same movie, which is a guarantee on its own! I enjoyed watching it, even if it seemed to drag out a bit longer than it should. Really looking forward to seeing a third movie. I think that this one was not as good as the first one, but it's nice when there's room for improvement! It seems like it was an intermediate step just to get to the third one. I guess that we'll have to wait and see. Nonetheless, I really liked the funny parts in some phases of the movie. Really worth your time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I noticed a college of mine had a bigger boat than I, so I decided to make a new movie. I called Marvel and asked if they had any more superheroes. They said they had one that transformed into an ant, but I thought that sounded a bit weak and decided to start from scratch. Having only seen the interiors of Hollywood mansions for the past 20 years I thought it was time to reconnect to humanity and I took my jet to Las Vegas and watched a Magic show for 10 minutes. Bingo! I had an idea. I called the studio and told them and they asked if there was going to be real Star Wars super magic, but I said no, regular card stuff. They told me I needed more CGI to appeal to the common man, I said sure, - how about an animated card flying around for 20 mins? That will also compensate for the lack of a real story. We brainstormed for 15 more minutes and came up with many brilliant ideas and here you are, my latest masterpiece. Now I can finally afford that bigger boat. And thank you, common man, for your 7 point review and all your money. You give me hope of a better tomorrow. now on to the 3-qual to explore those depths and fill in the gaps left out of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 -- A review of sorts...There are some films which are truly great yet flawed. Some which are truly entertaining yet not great. Some which are truly awful but have charm. And some which you wish you could get your entrance fee struck from the box office takings to send a message.NYSM2 is anchored firmly in the last category.I like paying to be entertained by lots of things -- particularly film. I love films, all sorts of films. And whilst I don't know enough about how hard and complicated it is to make one, what I do know is that the expectations before seeing any film should be basic: It should be competent in certain areas such as direction, writing, acting. And it should also be entertaining, or thoughtful, or both! Now, we all know these criteria are not always met...but you can usually take something away from most films good or bad. However...Firstly, I could mention the incredibly incoherent plot that literally makes so little sense that you're left wondering if this is so heavily edited that they've butchered a decent story. However, this film is so, so overly long and drawn out that there's no way it was over-edited! A tighter edit would have literally cut this film in half and you wouldn't have noticed anything missing. Everything here is hung, drawn and quartered out until it's very, very dead.Secondly, a good, bad or indifferent story can be forgiven if the script is clever, funny, thoughtful, suspenseful, etc. A good script can literally save the most esoteric plot...This is one of the worst cliché ridden scripts that I think I've ever sat through. Every. Single. Line is laden with either cheese or lead. Stinker isn't harsh enough. The main problem is that it relies too much on the 'magical' theme of the movie. The jokes miss their targets by a country mile, and any dialogue with exposition is so stiff and phoned in that you literally tune out, even during 'important' scenes. It honestly feels like the script took 2 hours to write, and the film's 2 hours long -- do the math. (From the writer who brought you the Super Mario Bros. film!)Thirdly, no matter how grim first and second are, a really good cast of actors can still pull the iron out the fire --- Oh! Not one actor cast here is either suitable for the role and/or, to add insult to the viewer, gives a performance that is uncomfortably and completely phoned in long distance. It really did feel that they all just turned up for the cheque. I'll give you examples: Watch Zombieland to find Jesse and Woody's missing chemistry. Watch Spotlight to see Ruffalo actually growing into a part that fits him. Watch anything else that Mr. Freeman has been in where he also moves his lips to hear him speak lines he actually understands how to convey. Watch Batman where Mr. Caine shows some interest in his character. However, Mr. Radcliffe is more miscast here than any other 'grown-up' film he's probably ever been in...And I have never seen one of those films where he has actually been suitably cast. Sorry, Dan.I could literally go on for hours about all of the above. The direction feels so non-existent to the point where I turned to my mate and stated the following, "did they just skip rehearsals and record the first take in every scene?" Because that's exactly how this film felt: Take, Cut, Print!Such a really poor film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My father and I loved the first movie, we were completely blown away by the special effects, the ideas for the magic acts, and the plot was gripping. Naturally, we thought the sequel would live up to it's name. Boy were we ever so wrong. 20 minutes in, and I felt that this was not going to be anything interesting. No one is in character. Lula is dull and annoying, we have no idea what happened to Henley apart from the fact that she left and Atlas is bitter about it, Jack well he's just nice to look at in this movie, and two Woody Harrelson's is, well, too damn much. This movie had so much potential, but it seeped through the plot holes. Not only did it lack magic acts like it had in the first one, but at some point I asked myself "What is this about again?" SO MUCH POTENTIAL JUST WENT OUT THE WINDOW ALRIGHT? Acting on point, but you can't do anything if the writers don't deliver. Such disappointment, and I really don't understand how this movie is rated almost 7 stars. Also near the end of the movie, well they just re-used what they had in the first one, and it just made everyone groan. Cheesy, predictable, disappointing, and I hope to never watch this again.</fullReview>

I don't know whether foreigners think that China is still a place which is stuck in the past century or something. Who would wear silk dresses and watch a b/w television nowadays? Besides I don't think shops in the style of that magic shop would exist and there is no such place called "Taipa Market". In addition I can't understand why the film makers made Macau a place filled with gangsters and "barbarians"... Macau is a friendly city where tourists are given good service.I think most of the movie is acceptable but like the first movie, the ending ruins the whole thing. Even though the effects are quite awesome, the plot of the movie bored me(too many useless scenes). I think what the audience want to see is how great the four horsemen are and the unique way they steal with magic, but not seeing them fail their acts. What I see in movie 2 is four kids throwing cards around while their guardian was watching, therefore I think Movie 1 is way better than the second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining flick that lacks the flair of the first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Now You See Me was a very enjoyable and entertaining flick that boasted a good cast and visually impressive stunts. The second, called Now You See Me 2, on the other hand was good but lacked the 'wow' factor of the first. Still boasting the stellar cast of the first movie with the added Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan, who replaces Isla Fisher as the 'girl' horseman in the group, the second act as it is so-called, tries hard to make an intelligent story. This attempt backfires as the plot becomes bloated and too complex to understand towards the end of the movie, and the tricks become unconvincing.The Four Horseman, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Lulla (Lizzy Caplan), are hiding and the FBI are searching for them. They have been waiting for over a year to return to the stage and the leader of the Horseman, Dylan Rhodes, played by Mark Ruffalo, orchestrates there comeback. But as there jubilant return seemed to be going smoothly, the stage is hijacked by Walter Mabry, played by the magical Daniel Radcliffe. The magicians are then sent to Macau, where Walter awaits them. His goal is find and steal a computer chip with the ability to decrypt all of the data in the world using the Four Horsemans thieving skills. Rhodes is arrested as the FBI find out about his connection with the Horseman, but he escapes and gets a call from Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), the magician he blames for the death of father, who says he is able to help Dylan. But the deal can only be done if Dylan can get him out of prison. This plot seems easy enough to understand, but as the movie continues to develop, it becomes a whole lot more complicated than you would've thought. The movies continuing story becomes implausible, in particular the part about the computer chip. There are many things I enjoyed with the movie but there also seems to be a little problem after that. As a whole, the visuals are really good, but there are times were it goes a bit too far (back to implausible). The cast and acting was good, but the characters are very much the same as in the first movie. There is nothing new about them, with the exception of Mark Ruffalo's character. We are given a better and more thoughtful backstory about his past, and more emotional understanding. Out of the horseman, Woody Harrison's character is the only one whose past is even talked about when his brother comes into the frame, which didn't really do much to the movie. I personally didn't like it that much. I enjoyed Isla Fishers replacement in Lizzy Caplan. She was a fun and provides some positive energy to the group, which contain some boring members. She has a personality which some of the characters lacked, but her role only took a bad-turn when she and Dave Franco's character, Jack Wilder, entered a horribly-developed relationship, which had nonsensical impact on the already bloated story. As long as the team had chemistry, which they did, I was fine with some of the minor problems.The tricks were impressive but I didn't find the 'wow' factor like I did in the first movie. Also, as Thaddeus was a magic debunker, I would've liked, even for a brief minute or two, for him to explain how some of the tricks worked, which would've helped the audience, but also expand his role in the movie, especially as he is such a great actor. Continuing on with the tricks, I wish that they didn't all have to have some sort-of CGI work on them. One of the things I liked about the first movie were some of the tricks didn't require CG work at all because they were entirely performed by the magician. Though I know that the people performing the tricks are not magicians, they could've at least applied some free-hand stuff for the actors to perform.Overall, the movie, despite its bloated story and extensive CGI work, was entertaining and fun to watch. It has some resemblance to the first movie, which I didn't entirely enjoy, and hope that if they do make a third (I hear they are) that they make a more believable and different story, continuing on with some of the great visual effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice film with great magical performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the other movies in the theaters this week, this is a good choice to spend your two hours.. I think the age warning of above 13 for this movie is actually right. My advice is that if you're above 40, it may not entertain you because this film doesn't include much logic among some events that follow one another. Another thing is that this is also a movie about a struggle of saving the world from the bad guys. There many movies like that but this movie saves itself from being boring with the humor &amp; sarcasm of the characters. Magics which we cannot come across in real life help a lot to take the movie to a higher position in the audience's point of view.Best parts of the film: 1. The voyage of the horsemen after they jump through the tunnel. 2. When four of the horsemen are together in a room where they are being searched for a possible theft.3. The magical performances of the horsemen in a city center at a special day of the year.4. The audience may not guess how the film will end, will the horsemen succeed or not?5. There may be a 3rd film of this series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel! Don't assume based on the negative reviews - see it for yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand all the hate for this movie. It accomplished the same ends as the first one, and even exceeded it in some ways. Just like the first, it started with a simple plot, added in some humor and dazzling magic tricks, and then brought in a twist at the end. Very fun movie, with complex characters. Sure, it's not a FANTASTIC movie. But I don't think it was meant to be an award- winner or anything. It celebrates the mystery and magic of illusion, and reminds viewers that even today, audiences can still be fooled, if the magician has just enough intuition (and money) to pull it off.I would've given 10 stars, but the romance was poorly executed, and some of the plot elements bothered me. Loved it though. Don't believe the negative reviews. Watch it for yourself and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word! Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is an utterly disappointment, huge mess, broken story line, it is like a demonstration of how not to make a file. Don't waste your money or time. Now You See Me 1 was a surprised movie, it gave a great story line, good balanced character set but when it comes to Now You See Me 2 it is a totally mess, can't understand how they mess with this one. Also the story line of some characters are dull and boring. Also the director tried to mix some amusement to the film by adding Unnecessary stories, but finally the whole movie is a joke. Also I am very much worried about Daniel Radcliffe's decisions to select such movies. He has a great acting ability but he is now wasting that talent. Hope there will not be any further sequels based on this concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Down With A Case Of 'The Sequel'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated the first film in this series a 10/10 because I was completely enchanted by it. I had never watched a movie like it before in my life.As with any sequel, that illusion was gone (no that pun was not intentional and no I'm not deleting it). While I still enjoyed the movie as a whole, it lacked the spark that the first one brought to the screen. As with my review of the last one, I will list the things I liked and things I didn't.The good parts: - The sequence where they passed the card around. I thought it was imaginative, really. Others have passed it off as being unrealistic with a lot that could easily have gone wrong, but that's the whole point of the movie. They're highly skilled illusionists and magicians. Jack is one hell of a card trickster. I spent the time trying to work out how the stick got in the card in the first place!-The performances. As with the first film, I was impressed yet again with the performances. Mark Ruffalo brought it once again, with more depth to his character this time around. Morgan Freeman never fails to steal the screen. Dave Franco did a great job with his still limited material to work with. Jesse Eisenberg had arguably a smaller role than the first one, but his work is good as always. Lizzy Caplan continues to prove herself as more than just "Janis Ian" with every role she takes and even though she was there as Isla Fisher's stand in (and the comedic relief) she really did well in my opinion.-The twists. I saw more of them coming this time around, but that doesn't diminish their effect. When the characters are fooled, so are the audience (most of the time).The things I didn't like about it: -I miss Isla Fisher. Yes, I know she was pregnant (and will be back for the third instalment) but I still missed her. Henley was a large part of my love for the first film and it was weird to see the other three without her. As I said, Lizzy Caplan was a good character, but Henley was missed. Hey, at least the movie addressed her absence instead of just replacing her for no apparent reason.-*sigh* this one pains me to say. Daniel Radcliffe. Look, I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd and Daniel Radcliffe has a special place in my heart, but he can't act. Yeah, I'll be that one guy who says it. He can't act. It felt as though he was trying too hard to emulate David Tennant's portrayal of Kilgrave in Marvel's Jessica Jones at some points. I didn't really believe his performance and he doesn't really make a good villain. I guess that might be because he'll always be Harry Potter to me.-Dave Franco remained fully clothed yet again. I stated this flippantly in my last review, but I'm still bitter about it. The same can be said for Mark Ruffalo because damn he looked great in this movie.So, overall, not as good as the first one, but nobody expected it to be. Sequels are curses upon themselves and, as iconic as the first film will always be to me, this was a solid effort at a follow up. Of course I'll watch the third film (I'm guessing it's the finale) and I assume I'll rate it lower than a 6.Well, maybe not considering Isla Fisher is back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing movie. Within the first few minutes of the movie begins to lose its appeal. I think Henly played a good witty part in the first movie. dropping her was not a good move. this was made even worse by introducing Lula did not do anything to help the movie. I kept wondering "so what is she doing here?" Jesse Eisenburg seemed to be going in and out of being Lex Luthor. seemed to be a character confusion between Lex Luthor and Daniel Atlas.The first movie was not super great but had enough mystery and good wittiness about it which was entertaining. Now you see me 2 sadly lost me in the opening minutes because of it's lack of depth. poor character buildups, weak plot, predictability and simply a let down from the first movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ocean's Hungover Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously. Who's asking for these sequels or reboots. Only one in maybe 15-20 make money, so it can't be the studios or the audience. Egos, perhaps?It's been almost three years to the day since I saw the original and the only memory I took from it was that I really liked it. I hardly recall scenes, or what made me really like it, just that I did. I cannot say the same for the Ocean's Twelve/Hangover Part II crossover dud.But, to be fair, there were scenes I did like and the third act reminded me a little more of what I liked about the first one. Unfortunately, we still had the first two aimless acts to get through to arrive at our happy place. Not to mention, that first two-thirds or so felt like you MUST have JUST seen the original to follow all these events. More than half the time, they were doing the infamous "Remember when we did this/you said that" mentions that irritated my amnesia all the more.So, this doesn't stand alone sequel involves on-the-run magicians desperate to make a new splash, get used by a maze of villains and need to prove their worth to get out of it. Hardly an original idea for a sequel, let alone any film and at over two hours, it gets tedious.That all said, the gang does have charisma. I definitely like the cast and the ending *almost* makes this follow-up a recommendation. But, as mentioned, it's best to watch both together so not to get lost like I did for the most part.***Final thoughts: I guess part III's in development, already. Ah-hem, like the Ocean's and Hangover movies I compared this to. This is not due to the American box office, of course, since it made just about half of what the first one did here in the U.S. It was, however, a smash hit overseas. Same goes for the Ice Age movies. While that one is an obvious franchise (for kiddies,) this one never really felt like one.</fullReview>

I quite enjoyed the first film and was looking forward to seeing this, and although it wasn't too bad, and was at times OK, really I found it to be quite lacklustre and even a bit boring. Not sure about the director choice with Jon M Chu, who directed Justin Bebier's believe, which I obviously have never watched but not sure how he landed this gig. Eisenberg, Ruffalo and Harrelson all were OK but weren't really given a story or script worth their talents. There was no wow factor here that we got in the first film under director Louis Leterrier. If you are interested in a bit of fun then check it out, but don't expect to use any part of your brain while watching. Now You See Me #nowyouseeme2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well after a ton of waiting, the excitement builds as we had anticipated the release of Now You See Me 2 (2016). This was a film that we had a real interest in given that the first film "Now You See Me" was so awesome; we thought how could anything go wrong?.Well to be very honest "Now You See Me 2 (2016)" was the typical "all hype and NADA"! There were so many holes on the story that we lost track in the middle of which story was taking place. The cast of course done what they do, they played their part though I believe the script writers were writing completely different rushed stories and forgot to run each story by each other before rushing it together to push out an over hyped epic fail of a sequel. So disappointing to see this film land just like every money hungry film.If you can get past the flaws in the story and simply watch all of the eye candy they provided in the film then you won't even miss it, though if you follow the story you'll walk out in the middle of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, but many factors in the film were unnecessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not emphasize more that many elements in this film were not needed or completely unnecessary. The first film was fun and entertaining, but you can't say the same for this sequel.To start on a positive note, this isn't a bad movie as some reviews have made it out to be. It is quite decent and it's somewhat entertaining. I felt there were several scenes in this movie that was very fun to watch, and at the same time, captivating. The new Horsemen is a great character, and I really liked this person! The acting was good, as expected from the cast just like the first movie.My main issue with Now You See Me 2 was that it contained extra "fluff" that wasn't needed. There is a certain character they introduced in this film that did nothing for the movie. If you were to completely remove this person, the movie wouldn't even change. Additionally, this character was just plain annoying and his role took up time and space in this film. Several times in the film they would explain or show you how the tricks were made, and often times, you do not need to hear or see it to know how they did it. Aside from SOME great tricks and illusions, the majority of the magic show this movie presented were insignificant and easily forgotten.Overall, okay movie - great cast, except for the one unnecessary character. The movie is decent to watch and had scenes and moments where it shined, but there were far more things that could have been removed, and in place, they could have added better and more entertaining tricks and illusions as the first movie did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 was a hot mess, plain and simple. There's a lot of hand-wavey, look-how-cool-we-are tricks that actually have very little basis in reality. At least in the first film, most of the tricks and effects were fairly believable.Unfortunately, this second movie throws any pretense at believability out the window and just goes for spectacle. And that might not be a bad thing-- if you really grew to care what the spectacle was all about. You don't. The premise to this film is flimsy at best. And the climactic scene toward the end of the movie falls very flat.I did like the resolution for a couple of the characters at the very end of the movie, though. That was satisfying.Would I watch this again? Definitely not. Is it worth seeing? Probably. Just don't bother comparing it against the first movie. It doesn't measure up.</fullReview>

Just take it for what it is: a fun, entertaining movie about magicians and tricks. Don't expect everything to make sense, because of course, most of it is actually silly but still fun nonetheless. Mark Ruffalo is always a delight to watch and the rest of the cast make a great team as well. Don't expect a super smart plot, just a typical fast paced film that will keep you on your toes. I will say the original goal of the team is mostly forgotten throughout the two hours, but I don't think that matters much. All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie and I think it's a solid 7/10.</fullReview>

I endured but it was a total waste of time.The first movie was much more believable despite it having its own flaws.

		<fullReview>The cast, the trick effects and the acting are great, but in my humble opinion they are overshadowed by the plot. The biggest magic trick of this movie must have been getting approval for the script. For my taste, even being a huge fan of the "mind-f*ck" genre, this plot takes too many turns. In a good mind-f*ck movie, you should be amazed by reveals. In this movie, there are so many small reveals that I cannot even remotely recall how many there were. The last trick was the only reveal that I really appreciated. Overall, I would describe the story as unnecessarily busy. The first film in the franchise was not flawless either, but I felt emotionally more invested in the characters because the overarching story was always clear and only took a handful of twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review for Now You See Me 2: The Second Act (spoiler free)** (2/5)Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Lizzy Caplan, Dave Franco, Daniel Radcliffe, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman.Plot: World famous magic act/thieves The Four Horsemen ? now with a new member, and under the auspices of uber-magician, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) ? find themselves up against a formidable enemy, who seems to know their every move?Normally with magic acts they tend to have an end and sometimes they come back for a second act and it's going to be a lot bigger, not in the case of Now You See Me 2 ? which manages to be more stupid than it's flashy and witty predecessor which is the best film in the world compared to this. This movie is definitely not bigger or better than the first act. At the end of the first movie, a charming, and surprise sleeper hit big reveal when Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent Dylan Rhodes who spent the entire movie chasing the flashy thieves/magicians but never quite caught them because they were always ahead of him. So he decided to reveal his biggest secret that he is a magician himself, even that movie had a really convoluted plot but it was actually fun to watch.This film still explores the same characters as the first one along with some new ones; Jesse Eisenberg's Atlas seems to be in an endless squabble with the other characters. Well there is no Henley (Isla Fisher) anymore she is then replaced with fast talking and witty Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and finally joined with Dylan Rhodes who seems to be blaming his father's watery demise on Morgan Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley and that conversation seems to be decades old at this point. As far as this movie keeps brooding on at it's messed up points there are some fun bits well if you can call them fun, Walter Maubry's (Radcliffe) entrance is really cool and you can tell that he is going to be a pretty insane villain (that moment soon dies off) but after he stays on the screen for a long time then his character turns into just another stupid and pointless addition, in a stupid and pointless movie. The more this movie goes on with its "second act" business and by the time it gets there it really suggests that they should have stuck with the first act because it was better. The first movie directed by Louis Letterier was fun and flashy. This one, directed by John M.Chu is tepid, even managing to make a lengthy detour in the colourful city of Macau dull. Louis Letterier is nobody's idea of master of magic but next to Chu, he's Penn &amp; Teller or even Harry Houdini. The movie is so strangled by an incredibly convoluted plot, including a spectacularly silly retcon, that the easy repartee of the Horsemen from the original is never recaptured. One can only dream of a much better and hopefully much dynamic film than it really is. Even the Card throwing Jack (Dave Franco) tries to pull them out of endearing situations and tries to pull off another charm that didn't even work in the first movie, let alone in this one. There are moments when the energy surges, such as a sequence where the Horsemen have to work together to conceal a playing card-shaped MacGuffin from the world's worst security guards. By and large though this movie suffers the same fate as another sequelitis, and a sense that nobody's heart is really in it. Take, for example Woody Harrelson's dual role. In what seems like a desperate attempt to give him something interesting to do, he also appears as Merritt's evil twin brother with a crazy and endearing plan, but as he babbles on unwittingly you want to wish that he and his fake mustache should come to an untimely demise. No such fate happens. As this appears to be bigger than the first and believe it or not the final act is actually the best part of the film but unfortunately until that time you have to go through nerve shattering squabbling and once it's finally got, to the final act the whole lead up is worthless. It then turns into whodunit murder case but they already know who did it and if they said that they knew then this movie would have been a lot shorter, unfortunately it wasn't it was just a worthless popcorn movie but with those they are guilty pleasures this was just stupid.Verdict: It's an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and yes, magic of the original. You'll like it, not a lot or no at all. 4/10 appalling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I stepped in to watch Now You See Me 2, the scenes of the first movie was riveting in my mind.But this film proved to be a HUGE disappointment. It was as if it had caved under the weight of its predecessor. The plot continuously loses grip. One is left questioning "what? I don't get it". Trust me the tricks seem more realistic than the plot. Too many so called twists in the tale. Well its not needed. The movie doesn't remain true to its genre. And characterization. Whoa! Talent seems wasted. Jesse Eisenberg deserved more screen space. Instead Daniel Radcliffe - great actor he may be- cant save a sinking plot. And Woody Harrelson in two roles. Not good. Lizzy Chaplan tries to impress us with her humor.Well it just didn't click. Morgan Freeman excellent as ever. But again not enough screen space. Reserving the best for the last, Mark Ruffalo. He seemed well and truly into the character. He sells his role to us. But the plot collapses. None of the greats in the movie could save it and thats a shame. All i could think when I stepped out was "why oh why take a sequel. Couldn't we just float in the magic of the first part".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freshness is gone, but?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years ago, "Now you see me" hit the summer fun flick market like a new zesty cooler with a fresh taste. Before that, there had been movies similar to it, in this way or that, but never one quite with the ingredients blended and packaged in that way. A sequel invariably suffers in the department of originality. NYSM is no exception. "This is a movie more about journey than destination", I wrote about the original. This still holds true, the style and merriment are still there. Yes, the sequel is not as good as the first one. But it is nevertheless a pleasant ride to the majority of fun-seeking moviegoers.The basic three-city-three-act structure is retained, this time New York, Macau and London. The gang of four retains the three men Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco (James's brother), but replaces Isla Fisher with Lizzy Caplan who works very hard throughout to please the audience, and is generally successful. Mark Ruffalo's character comes to the forefront, not only as member and leader of the gang, but also has a story built around him that carried the bulk of the movie's emotion content. Morgan Freeman also returns, enigma and all. Michael Caine has two more joining him in his villainy endeavors. One is Daniel Radcliffe who needs no introduction. The other is a bit awkward to introduce. Whether for double fee or not, Harrelson plays his character's evil twin brother. But he looks much more like the twin of Jim Carrey, uncannily so. As one critic points out there is loaded acting power here with a few Oscar wins and a whole lot of nominations. But don't expect much. The script is not adequate to carry any Oscar caliber performances. Still, these people are fun to watch.The prize in material form here is a "stick", in IT terminology, a card (also IT terminology) that holds immense data manipulation power. Been there; done that. The psychological prize, one of them at least, is revenge. The other is unmasking villains in front of a huge, cheering life audience. The climatic, concluding set piece in London does just that, in grand style, with three of the four horsemen (Eisenberg, Franco, Caplan) doing their dazzling acts in three different locations, and these are just diversions while a lot more is happening in the background. What more can you ask? You will tend to forgive the rather lame, unconvincing plot.</fullReview>

This is where the spoilers begins: it makes no sense at all that Morgan Freeman is a good guy at the end of the movie. Movies nowadays fell into a trend of trilogy but by having Morgan Freeman to be a good guy at the end. Like who on Earth are willing to go to jail for a year just because I felt the truth will hurt Mark!!?? The twist really felt forced, like Freeman is a good guy because he's Freeman. I felt they missed out on an epic storyline if they were to film part three. Second, I thought the chip was a fake!? I thought the ending would be Woody hypnotize his twin brother and then trade places with him to hypnotize Michael and Daniel because his twin did a weird clap on the airplane when telling the henchmen to throw them out of the plane. The chip turning out to be real was really weird.</fullReview>

It's a shame when a rather intriguing original (with most main stars returning) goes so far off track with it's sequel. Sure the "slight of hand" antics are still present, but having so much explanation associated with most tricks is downright time consuming and boring. While Lizzy Caplan ("Master of Sex" - TV) steps in as the fourth Horsemen, her contributions are left to be the bubbling fourth wheel performing amateur magic diversions, "never stop smiling" Dave Franco's (original NYSM) trickery (stand behind the cards and toss playing cards) is boring at best, and Woody Harrelson's "two-part" performance is beyond positive explanation. Daniel Radcliffe steps in as the spoiled rich kid felon, yet somehow his character just doesn't matter, and could it be that I'm just tried of watching/hearing Jesse Eisenberg's always the same delivery? Okay, okay. NYSM 2 is just a movie, so let me step back and say "you won't see me" watching anymore of these (NYSM 3 has been announced).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesse Eisenberg can heave a sigh of relief, that his bad, bad, embarrassingly bad performance, as Lex Luthor, in this summer's first outing 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', has a companion piece in the baddie rendered by Daniel Radcliffe in this flick. Seldom has a villain been less menacing, less effective, and generally had nothing to do. Eisenberg continues his paycheck-perspective irritating/old shtick, and it grates here.Green Lantern's Jay CHou is wasted.Lizzy Caplan grates throughout, almost as badly as Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson 2.0. 1.0 doesn't have much to do, either.Dave Franco has charm, but is under-utilized.One of the best parts about its predecessor, was the final reveal, though it did not ultimately stand on its legs, in hindsight. Now, that reveal is undone. Initially, I thought the decision was bold, but taken in combination with the backstory that focuses on one of the mainstays in this flick, it doesn't make sense, again, and the momentum I thought it bought, is never spent throughout. The climax underwhelms, to say the least. In spite of all the above flaws, and the overall clichéed, underwhelming tone of the flick, there is 1 sequence due to which I can recommend this flick, which happens in a vault of sorts, and requires some amazing dexterity in choreography, and a combination of finesse and CGI to pull it off (it does). Save that 1 sequence (and part of 1 more, with Mark Ruffalo doing a lot of work, and maybe 1 more, that divided audiences - the Macau journey), imho, everything else in this pointless sequel is redundant. Jon Chu, of the 'Step Up' and 'GI Joe' franchises, could stop inflicting his talent on us. Not looking fwd to NYSM3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now You See Me 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film was lame and boring, I said I didn't understand why they would bother making a sequel, but they did, I wanted to see it because of the good cast, and see if it would be worse than the predecessor, directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, G.I. Joe: Retaliation). Basically a year has passed since The Four Horsemen: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco, James's brother) outwitted the FBI and won the public's adulation with their magic spectacles, they are now in hiding. Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher, unavailable due to her pregnancy) has since left, she got tired waiting for her next orders from FBI agent and their leader and handler Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) or from secret society The Eye, and illusionist Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) has replaced her. Rhodes assigns them a new mission, they infiltrate the launch party for the new software of corrupt businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb), they plan to expose the software that secretly steals data on its users for Case's benefit, but Atlas, McKinney and May are interrupted by a mysterious individual who reveals that Wilder, thought to be dead, is alive, and that Rhodes is their mole. Attempting escape, the Horsemen are captured by mercenaries, led by Merritt's vain, greedy, self- centred twin brother Chase (Harrelson), who has the same training as him, and he takes them to his employer, technology prodigy Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe). Mabry wants the Horsemen to use their skills to steal the data-mining device developed by Case from a secret facility beneath a casino, the chip allows the user to decrypt any electronic device around the world, threatening to kill them they agree to carry out this seemingly impossible heist. The Four Horsemen want to clear their names and reveal the mastermind to the whole, Mabry is not the only one in the scheme, Rhodes' rival Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) is plotting his way out of his prison cell and getting involved, the team manage to carry out the robbery. After some more ducking and diving, and the reveal that Mabry is acting on behalf of his father Arthur Tressler (Sir Michael Caine), the Four Horsemen travel to London, England, where preparations are being made for the New Year celebrations, the team are there to cause diversions of street magic and ultimately plan to expose both Mabry and Tressler for their actions. It looks like their plan has failed when they are taken aboard a private jet, which one by one they are thrown out of, however, the Four Horsemen have tricked Mabry and Tressler with a trick, their plane did not take off, they are in the middle of the River Thames and everything is exposed to the public, just before the strike of midnight and the fireworks mark the New Year. In the end Mabry, Tressler and Case are arrested by the FBI, Rhodes gives the data-mining device to FBI Deputy Director and Agent Natalie Austin (AVP: Alien vs. Predator's Sanaa Lathan), who allows him to escape, Bradley compliments Rhodes and the Horsemen for what they have achieved, he reveals he is high- up in the Eye, the final scene sees them all going down a spiral staircase, this turns out to look like the eye. Also starring Jay Chou as Li, David Warshofsky as Agent Cowan, You Only Live Twice's Tsai Chin as Bu Bu, Game of Thrones' Richard Laing as Lionel Shrike and The Inbetweeners' Henry Lloyd-Hughes as Allen Scott-Frank. All the actors remain pretty well suited for their parts, new addition Radcliffe (suitable casting, considering his former magician character fame) gets some good moments as the villain, and there are still good special effects, camera tricks and editing, especially the Mission: Impossible style heist scene, the story this time is a bit more rounded and less boring, perhaps predictable in parts, however it is much more complicated with too much going on, hopefully the announced third film will be the last, this is a sort of alright crime thriller. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Oh No It's Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Four Horseman are sorta all back (bar one) and with even more elaborate tricks up their sleeve than ever in Now You See Me 2. The original director Louis Leterrier has vanished and instead a new director is pulled out of a hat. This sequel comes from the director of Step up 2 and 3D, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Jem and the Holograms. Now You See Me 2 fails to capture any of the magic the first film may or may not have had and chooses style over substance.The Original cast is back, except for Isla Fisher whose away due to pregnancy and whose character's absence is poorly explained in this film. Instead we have Lizzy Caplan in the female role and she does a decent job in this film along with the other big newbie to the series, Daniel Radcliffe. In my opinion both Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan give the best performances in this film. The rest of the cast are fine except for Woody Harrelson as Chase Mckinney which was just bad and I just wanted it to stop.What this film is all about is the cool and elaborate cons and tricks that are pulled off. As a spectacle it worked great but if you switch your brain on and think about it logically then its not so fun. Although the complication will make audiences "ooh" and "aah" it leaves the thinking man wondering "Is that the best plan they could come up like was anything they did necessary??"Speaking of complicated, the film as a whole gets lost in its own complexity. There are many questions left at the end of the film both by the films protagonist (as stated in their dialogue) and the audience. It's OK to leave some questions open to make the ending ambiguous, but this film steers close to the ambiguity seen in the TV show Lost. Some of my questions are: What is the Eye? How was Dylan able to take Thaddeus out of prison if his face was on the news? What was Thaddeus' beef with Dylan because prison life for Thaddeus looked pretty cosy? When did Thaddeus suddenly turn good and tell Dylan about his father at the end? The list goes on.Overall, Now You See Me 2 is a question mark of a film. The new members to the cast are good but the film just thinks complicated means better. If there is one thing that 2016 has taught film makers, its to probably leave films alone that include a group named the Four Horseman (Xmen Apoclpse reference)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is sucks.All i want to do during the movie was getting out from the cinema and prefer to not wasting my 2-hours for this movie.I am adoring the first sequel (Now You See Me), and expecting a better (or even the same) quality as the first, but i found it should be better not making the sequel. You will find the story was really look being forced from the first series (as if they forced to make this second series, maybe because of the first one shocking popularity).Cinematography are bad, it sounds like i've been watching a cheesy movies, really really far from the great first one by Larry Fong and Mitchell Amundsen.Jay Chou, who finally are being included in the Hollywood movie poster, only made a 2-3 minutes' appearance (so, why make him show in the poster as like he will become an important role?)And plus, Daniel Radcliffe's acting made this film even worse.I suggest you who love the first sequel, pretty sure to not spend your money and your precious 2-hours just for this (below) standard movie. Until now, i still regret for what i watched yesterday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now You See Me 2 is a Fun Heist Movie That Doesn't Quite Live Up To It's Promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Now You See Me was a genuine pleasant surprise. I remember it came out and not much was expected from it. It was going up against a couple of other movies coming out that weekend. But it did pretty well and the movie was fun overall. It was a decent heist movie and the characters that they created were cool and you wanted to see more of them. I would have gave the first one an 8/10. I don't know if anyone really needed a sequel to NYSM, it worked as a standalone but with the money it made, of course there would be a sequel. I was happy to go see it and I had a good time but in terms of building off the first one, this one falls flat in similar places and doesn't fulfill the promise that the ending of the original set up.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin with an introduction from the villain from NYSM 1 Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). He tells us how The Horsemen J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher who does not appear in this movie) took the world by storm. Their magic astounded the world and they became Robin Hood like figures, taking down corrupt businessmen including Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) and rewarding their followers. With the help of the mysterious organization The Eye (supposedly an organization of master magicians who use their talents to help the collective good) they were able to evade the FBI including agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and make a successful getaway. Since their disappearance in New York, they have been in hiding and the world hungers for their return. Unfortunately, they got away and left someone else holding the bag which was Thaddeus who is still in jail having been setup by the Horsemen in the finale of NYSM.We then flash to Daniel running through the sewers of New York. He comes to a special chamber where he talks to a voice who claims to represent The Eye. Atlas and crew have been in hiding much longer than they expected to be and are tired of biding their time by practising. They have also gotten tired of the passive tactics of their leader *spoiler for NYSM* Dylan and it is alluded to that Daniel thinks he can do better. The voice tells Atlas to be patient, that he will get his chance and that there is an upcoming opportunity for them to return.The first Now You See Me was a heist movie that tried to do something different rather than a team of car thieves or a team of con men, it was a team of magicians and it was cool to see a different perspective on it. They also brought some interesting and fun to watch magic tricks. This one also brings that element. Sure, not everything that they can do can actually be done but I was willing to forgive that as long as they moved at a quick clip and kept it light, which they did. We do that with other big budget heist movies or superhero movies so if you can ignore the physics, there's good times to be had.Not only are the tricks that they perform pretty sweet but the chemistry between the crew is strong. While I'm going to criticize the writing later, the dialogue is pretty good and the sense of "family" that you get with the Fast and Furious franchise (which they might be trying to borrow from) is present.They've got quite a cast here too and they all perform well. Jesse Eisenberg is well suited to his role and he excels as the leader in these movies. Dave Franco is actually given room in this franchise to perform by himself and he also does well. Woody Harrelson is his normal excellent self (I have issues with his dual role but it's not the fault of his acting). Lizzy Caplan is a good fit to fill in for Isla Fisher, she's got good comedic timing and her character is given more personality (I liked Fisher in the original but she's not given much to do outside of working with the group). Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all come back and are all solid, there's a reason that they are some of the best. I liked Daniel Radcliffe in his role too, it's very self aware casting but he doesn't overdo it as the villain. He does just enough and I'm happy he's getting more and more franchise roles.Getting to what I didn't like, one of the reasons that Now You See Me worked is that it was pretty unpredictable and fresh up until the end. I'm sad to say that NYSM 2 fails there. Certain things are introduced and it's really obvious how it's going to play into the story later. They write certain twists that are obvious from miles away. How they make one of the original cast play a dual role was really lame. It was really too bad, this movie was close to being something great but more time needed to be spent really smoothing out the rougher parts of the script. It just felt a little rushed so if there is a NYSM 3, hopefully there's a tighter product.To wrap it up, while there's too many twists and turns and the end is convoluted, unlike NYSM which fizzles towards the end, at least NYSM 2 provides a satisfying payoff. But I wanted to like this movie more than I did. There were moments when it absolutely lives up to the first but how the plot flows cuts it out at the ankles. I would still recommend it to fans of the original as it's far from bad. It's just not the complete package and for me it was a slight disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So it turns out, the things critics complained about in 2013's Now You See Me would've been better off untouched. While not producing a perfect movie in the first installment, the opposite ends up happening here.On the other hand, much like the first one, Now You See Me 2 has the mind-bending entertainment taken care of. It holds the same charm that was present in its predecessor-- perhaps even more. However, there are just a few things that are problematic.For one, the audience constantly feels like they're missing something--like they're always behind in what's going on. And not because of natural occurrences in the narrative, but because the filmmakers simply want us to be. Which is odd, seeing that this time we're actually in on most of the tricks. In Now You See Me, we're given the story through the FBI agent's point of view--always on the other side of the magic. In the sequel, we're mostly given the point of view of the four magicians, so we're deeply involved behind the scenes. The former situation was a major complaint of the first film, but now that I'm seeing the alternative, I think I would rather things be back to normal. And even though it's worth it in the end, the whole time prior you just sit there, frustrated, not wanting to be in on the trick, trying to mentally disassemble all the rigmarole in the meantime.Two years following the events of the first film, the Four Horsemen (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Lizzy Caplan) must remain in hiding for fear of the FBI. But they're growing impatient waiting for further instructions. Caplan replaces Isla Fisher as the female in the group. She's very unfunny--even when she so desperately tries to be--making us wish Fisher was back. The clan ends up in China where they are forced into working for a rich businessman (Daniel Radcliffe) who faked his own death and is supposed to be dead to the rest of the world. Radcliffe's brilliantly evil persona is far from the paladin, Harry Potter, as this may be his most mainstream role since.Morgan Freeman also returns with his character still in prison, because, for some reason, he can't seem to prove his innocence yet. Freeman is a key cog because he's what connects Ruffalo's character to his father's death as a child. Also differing from the first film, the first two acts are the weakest part. Waiting for things to get better towards the end, we sit through a magic trick-less setup that's more confusing than interesting. We do, however, get "treated" to an unnecessary card-flinging scene that just ends up being silly and five minutes too long.Does a good ending make up for a meandering 90 minutes? I guess it might if those 90 minutes are pertinent to the climax. And in this case, they are. But things may be a little too intricate to be cherished in the long run (something untrue for the first film). Maybe it deserves another watch. Maybe then will things be more clear. Because even after it's all explained to us, things wind up being overly complicated, but I guess you just have to trust that it all makes sense. If you're okay living like that.Twizard Rating: 73</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see the first movie, so I was lost for much of the movie since it does NOT stand on its own. The creators of this movie were trying so hard to make the "Four Horsemen" come across as super cool the plot fell completely apart. There were so many eye-rolling, suspensions of disbelief I kept asking myself, "Who buys this nonsense." Apparently with an average score of nearly "7" there were quite a few viewers duped by this movie's level of stupidity. I was bored throughout, confused, incredulous, and baffled at what the movie expected viewers to take for granted. Thousands of fans turn out of nowhere to view the final magic acts of these four, spotlights magically appear out of nowhere to highlight their acts, no seems to be needed to make all of these amazing things take place--they just "happen." While younger, less educated viewers may have been swept away in this idiocy, I simply kept looking at my watch (and occasionally tapping it) to hurry along this cinematic mess. I wish they could have made ME disappear during the first five minutes so I could have been doing something entertaining. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ocean's Eleven, except without the charm, or the wit, or anything really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start by saying that the first Now You See Me left me disappointed, but I was able to see how some people might enjoy it as brainless entertainment. I am a big con and heist movie fan, and NYSM and its sequel are obviously inspired by the likes of the Ocean's trilogy, Inside man and The Prestige. The first grabbed my interest with various tricks and twists which left questions that I was expecting to be answered in the movie's final act. The first movie contained nothing of the sort, but what was left was a decent amount of visual effects and good acting to make a fun experience, even if it did leave a bitter after taste.So it feels ironic that Now You See Me 2 fails because it tried to explain itself.Without spoiling the movie, I will sum up the story like this: The squad from the first movie (with a subbed in girl member played by Lizzy Caplan) is outsmarted by a "shadow organization" that is out to get them. Two men that stand out from that organization are the snobby millionaire played by Daniel Radcliffe and Woody Harrelson's character's twin brother played by Woody himself. Radcliffe does a good job playing his part, and Harrelson does what I suppose is the best he could do with his added role, seeing as it is probably one the worst written characters this year. I say "one of the worst" because it definitely isn't as bad as the new girl member of the team. "Lula" is supposed to be an illusionist worthy of the world's most secret magician society, yet she acts like an edgy 16 year old, desperately crushing on Dave Franco's character. This, together with the movie's plot, make the first two acts play out like a cartoon, with no logic or decent motivation behind any of the characters.The magic, I should note, looks great, the visual effects and direction are not ground breaking, but are certainly well done. Yet, as in the previous movie, it is literal MAGIC. Most of the big illusions in this movie are left unexplained, and those that aren't, should have been. Why? Well, perhaps because the writers of this movie seem to think that walking up to someone on the street and snapping your fingers at them is a legitimate way to hypnotize people, or that flashing a person with a UV lit text that says SLEEP will knock them out indefinitely. When an explanation serves its purpose only within the twisted reality of it's movie, it is safe to say that it isn't really a smart explanation, and that this really is not a smart movie, even if it acts otherwise.My friends and I left the theater laughing, dazed by the silliness of this movie. Would not recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one lacks the magic and fun !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie had a relentless pace and fun magic tricks, some of which, actually worked on the audience! It had charm and a pseudo smartness which fell away when inspected too closely, but that movie disguised it PRETTY well with misdirection and actually followed its own advice, the closer you look, the more you will miss out on. But unfortunately, this sequel is rather by the numbers and has none of the cleverness and charm which the audience were expecting. Just like the previous movie, the four horse men are just patsies in someone else's plan and the whole movie is spent trying to figure out who and why. From the stale opening to the lame first act, this movie drags along. Halfway through, there were more yawns than cheers from the audience. The ending twist / surprise (or the Prestige as Michael Caine himself said in the Nolan movie) Is weak, inconsistent with the previous movie and lacks any kind of punch.Lizzy Caplan replaces the beautiful Isla Fisher and the movie is all the more awkward for it. The twin role by Woody Harrelson is at times funny, but ultimately it has no pay off and seems like a useless subplot. Michael Caine reprises his role from the sequel and he seems to be tired and not enjoying himself at all. Daniel Radcliff is severely miscast in his role and he comes across as Harry Potter acting like he was megalomaniac. This role need a serious creep factor which Elijah wood brought in for sin City, unfortunately Radcliff fails miserably. This movie is obviously partly produced by china as it involves a lot of its action taking place in Macau and the inclusion of the Chinese actors is a bit jarring. But this seems to be the new trend in Hollywood, co-financed by China. Karate kid, Transformers 4, Iron man 3 all went this route and this film really suffers for it? The plot of such a movie should be so fast paced that the audience has no chance to think and they will just enjoy trick after trick. But this movie miserable fails in that too. It's boring, its clichéd and not enjoyable! I wish this was an amazing sequel, but it sadly falls way below the mark.Rating: 5/10. No really good reason to see this. Instead see the original again, it was much better! Note to Marketing Team: Next time your film has a great twist about the villain, DON'T reveal it on your marketing POSTER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like with the first film, very entertaining. But unlike the first film, this is poor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film this really is poor. On practically every level it falls down? Now You See Me 2 picks up directly where the first film left off and the film follows a similar pattern ? The 4 (or 5?) horsemen, performing larger-than-life magic with the aim of providing for those less fortunate or exposing those who do wrong. However, unlike the first, their motivations behind each of these stunts are a little less clear and certainly less meaningful. In fact inconsistent or unlikely character motivations and actions are a problem throughout the film (with supporting characters as well as the leads).Then there's the fact that this plot is so unrealistic and beyond the realms of possibility that it makes the first script look practically normal. The script in itself is a problem? it's messy, incongruent and forced ? "well we need to have a shootout/car chase, otherwise it won't be cool enough".Then there's the fact that Isla Fisher's character has left the gang and although briefly explained at the beginning of the film, is never mentioned again. Yet her replacement (played by Lizzy Caplan) is not only treated as if she's been there since the beginning, but also held responsible for all the actions she wasn't around for in the first film. I get the feeling it might have been easier for her just to play Isla Fisher's character (Katie Holmes-Maggie Gyllenhaal in Batman style) rather than trying to shoehorn in a different character. And talking of characters ? Daniel Radcliffe's character is atrocious. I don't want to give anything away but he is such a stereotypical, spoilt, British man it's untrue. Moreover his acting in this was reminiscent of all his appalling, wooden performances from the early Harry Potter films? And just I was starting to believe that maybe he could act!And then there are issues around plot holes, speech which is purely for the viewers' benefit, seemingly irrelevant sub-plots and a ridiculously backwards ending which doesn't appear to make much sense.So how the hell, given all these problems, does it give it get a 6 I hear you cry? Well, as with the first, it is still thoroughly entertaining. It's light-hearted fun, which isn't really tackling any of the world's serious topics and as a spectacle is still great. Sure I found myself thinking of several occasions 'my god this is garbage', but it didn't annoy me. It's the kind of film where you can laugh off the issues and appreciate the fun parts.In summary, if you liked the first one, I certainly wouldn't discourage you from seeing NYSM2. I'd just go in with limited expectations and an acceptance that many aspects of it aren't going to be very good. If you have those two things you'll probably enjoy it thoroughly, despite all its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now You Don't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say I loved Now You See Me. It wasn't a "guilty pleasure" or a "cheesy movie." That's something pretentious people say to excuse themselves for enjoying a film we all know ain't gonna win any Oscars. But NYSM was a good movie.Remember how immediately Jesse Eisenberg looked you right in the eye, dared you to "look closer," then performed a simple, real-life illustration that if it worked (and it worked on me) was enough to earn your suspicious surprise and childish delight for the next hour and a half? That twinkle, that sparkle of harmless deception designed to bring joy?what Melanie Laurent's character championed for the entire first film? that's what's missing from NYSM 2.I had hoped NYSM was a stand-alone film. I didn't want a second one to come along and upset the motivations of the first, but that's exactly what happened. Regardless, in this review I'll avoid my frustrations with the plot and focus on the other elements I felt detracted from the movie's potential. First off, the magic.The big question of NYSM remains unanswered. NYSM 2 still hasn't decided for itself, whether or not it believes in magic. This makes it impossible for the viewer to choose if what they're seeing is supposed to be a cunning illusion or something mystical, otherworldly or paranormal. The quick-changes, inexplicable transformations and thin- air disappearances don't even attempt to poke at realism. I liked NYSM because it wasn't always blatantly obvious which "tricks" were possible to recreate live (regardless of how complicated or expensive) and which were clearly intended to work only on a film level. Early in NYSM 2, I began thinking, "that's not possible" but without any of the thrill or allure of a person who knows their senses are being made to work against them.People whine about how much "suspension of belief" NYSM asks of them as if all movies don't require at least the slightest measure of the same thing. This franchise didn't invent magicians, hypnotists or illusionists. But, at some point it stopped caring about whether or not it stayed true to the possibilities and limitations of the art form (without supernatural intervention). This should have been impossible to do with David frickin' Copperfield advising, but apparently not. I didn't believe my eyes. Not for a second.As far as visuals go, my only problem was that, at times, it felt like the action existed to support the special effects and not the other way around. There's a scene where the magicians must keep discreetly passing an item between themselves. It looked awesome, but went on for entirely too long. Shall I over-explain it in cumbersome, wordy detail? Don't worry, I won't.The heaviest expositions in NYSM existed to move the story forward or to deliver the full impact of a sequence of events. It didn't feel intrusive. Somehow, both the dialogue and the exposition (of not only tricks but of motives, intentions, plot) became distracting and exhaustive. Maybe it worked in NYSM because we were learning trade secrets as part of an investigation. This time around it felt like, "Did you get it? Did you get it? Did you get it?" Yes. I got it.Rounding out my frustrations were some poor character choices.In NYSM, Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) was such a strong female lead. Assistant- turned-Magician, she more than held her own in the all-male Horsemen line up. When I saw that she wasn't returning I was disappointed, but for only as long as it took me to read the name Lizzy Caplan. I adore Lizzy Caplan. Mean Girls, Cloverfield. She sealed her ownership of my heart in Party Down. I assumed Caplan was coming on to pick up Henley's reins and ride. Not so. Lulu, the newest addition to the team, is a fine magician but she's fidgety, rambles aimlessly and is immediately too preoccupied with Jack Wilder for her own good. I didn't hate Lulu. I was just bummed that she was so flat. The movie had, like 3 female characters. It just felt like a missed opportunity. Also, I wouldn't hold high hopes for Lulu's crush on Jack. Remember Alma Drey, the Interpol agent who won Rhodes' heart by the end of NYSM? I almost didn't. I mean, gimme a throwaway line, "She's in South America." I don't know, something.There were actually a fair amount of character development points that irked me. Things even the brilliance of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Mark Ruffalo couldn't barrel over. I won't even touch the Shrike / Bradley story arch. But NYSM 2 finally takes things too far by casting Woody Harrelson as his own identical twin brother, Chase McKinney ... HOW did things GO SO WRONG for this film!!?? Do I love Woody Harrelson? You're GD right I do! Did I ever want to see him act alongside himself as his own bizarre, quasi-effeminate twin brother? No. No, I did not. It's bad enough that this film couldn't get away from familial power struggles if it locked itself in a safe and sank to the bottom of the Thames. But this twin business, unforgivable.So, there it is, another 5 of 10-star review from a die-hard fan of the first installment. Hollow magic, drawn out special effects sequences, cringe-worthy dialogue and exposition, almost none of the dazzling stage time the Horsemen established in round one and finally, poor character choices ending with the McKinney twins.I wanted so badly to love NYSM 2, but as I feared some really poignant things got wrecked and left behind in the path it cleared for a third movie. Oh, well.I assume they'll just call it NYSM 3.But if the original was truly "Now You See Me," sadly, the sequel is "Now You Don't."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just like the first movie...it takes you into the mind of magic tricks and just how easy, hard and confusing and well timed it can be. It's interesting to see just how they do it, because we keep forgetting it's all fake and not real. This movie is magic mixed with a robbery heist all combined into one.All the actors return, excluding Isla Fisher. This time we have a lady by the name of Lula (Played by Lizzy Caplan) who, to an extent replaces Isla Fisher. She's actually really funny and charming, to say the least. All the characters are exactly as the same as they were in the first one. We have a new villain by the name of Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe.) He wants the Horsemen to capture a certain device so he can have access to everyone's details. 1 issue: Daniel Radcliffe does not make a good villain...he was okay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NYSM 2 is more interested in theatrics than logic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, suspension of disbelief can suffice to maximize one's viewing pleasure in illusionist films, which tend to capitalize on showmanship to camouflage the many plot holes of the story. However, the second act of the 2013 surprise hit, Now You See Me, requires a brain entirely shut off for one to endure the film 'till the end and still enjoy it. While the magical heists in Now You See Me 2 do reach new heights, they are spoiled with twists and turns that fail to make any lick of sense.Picking up a year after last year's heist, the film finds the remaining members of The Four Horsemen?illusionist J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), hypnotist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and street magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco)?laying low and awaiting further instructions from The Eye, the secret society of magicians they've been recruited into. F.B.I. mole/ringleader Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) regroups them along with a new "horsewoman", fake- violence specialist Lula May (Lizzy Caplan), to expose a corrupt businessman planning to launch a device that is claimed to be the "key to every computer system on the planet." Meanwhile, tech mogul Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) wants the device for himself and bends the will of our rogue tricksters to pull off their toughest stunt yet in exchange for their freedom. Clueless as to his team's whereabouts, Dylan is left with no choice but to ask for the help of Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a scheming magic debunker who he framed in the first film and who also happens to be plotting his revenge against the horsemen in ways they couldn't expect.Director Jon Chu maintains the sleek look and fast pace of the first film, showcasing, this time, more of the heists than the magic. Here, the magicians seem to have graduated from Robin Hoods showering cash to their audiences but to corporate whistleblowers using their illusions for a greater purpose. The plot itself involves more infiltration and theft that can be found in a Mission Impossible film, making the lack of real-life magical spectacle more glaring. Chu and screenwriter Ed Solomon, however, hurts the film's credibility and betrays the profession by using "magic" that mostly passes here as "cheating-using-Hollywood-special-effects-and-wildly- implausible-writing-not-even-David-Blaine-can-accomplish." That being said, there are two kinds of magic tricks here: tricks they don't try to explain and tricks they agonizingly try to explain and you wish they haven't.The problem with Now You See Mee 2 is the same one that dogged its predecessor: It is more interested in theatrics than logic. Alas, not even a sleight-of-hand can obscure the trouble that brews in its already convoluted plot which for certain will be shoved with more swords in the future installment. "Look closely because the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see." Well, if you step back a bit, you're not actually being fooled but you're being scammed. Tah-dah!!!Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/now-you-see-me-2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miss the "magic" of the first, but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the first NOW YOU SEE ME film. I thought that film's premise "magicians robbing a bank" was original and the execution of the unique script by Ed Solomon and Boaz Yakin by director Louis Leterrier was strong. Add to that the casting - Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco as "The Four Horseman", Melanie Laurent, Common and (especially) Mark Ruffalo as the cops who were chasing them and sprinkle in good ol' Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman into a plot that kept you guessing to the end and you had a fun ride.My only question was, could the sequel capture the...wait for it...MAGIC (yes I went there) of the original?And my answer is...sort of.Kind of like seeing a magic show for the 2nd time, the spark of originality and wonderment was mostly missing this time around, consequently NOW YOU SEE ME 2 turned into a fairly standard crime/action caper - but with magic instead of guns, cars or fights. All that said, I was still entertained by this film, but that enjoyment was filled with an undercurrent of disappointment as I wanted to by "wowed" like I was with the first film.The script - written by Ed Solomon, one of the writers of the original, struck me as a "job script", that is, a script written for money from the studio vs. a "passion script" where the author has an idea they are passionate about and that passion is shown on the screen. Add to that the fact that Jon M.Chu - director of GI JOE: RETALIATION (not exactly CITIZEN KANE) - helmed this film and you have a movie that feels professional, competent and workman-like.What saves this movie is the performances. Three of the horsemen are back (Isla Fisher had to bow out due to a pregnancy) and the bi- play and the interaction between Eisenberg, Harrelson and Franco fits like an old glove. They get to interact with Ruffalo more in this film and that's a plus. Freeman and Caine return and are as dependable as ever and newcomers Daniel Radcliffe, Tsai Chin and (especially) Jay Chou were fun. Only Lizzy Caplan's Lula didn't really work for me - I thought she was trying to hard to fill in for Fisher.Interestingly enough, I could shake the feeling, as I was watching this film, that I was watching the 2nd chapter in a trilogy, even though this one did NOT end in a cliffhanger. Sure enough, upon further review, NOW YOU SEE ME 3 is currently filming.All in all, I enjoyed this film, I just wish I could have been surprised more, like I was in the first film.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want a fast paced, exciting and funny movie packed with incredible visuals, WATCH THIS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was saddened to see that Now You See Me 2 is rated poorly both on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. I saw it in cinemas yesterday and it was one of the best movies I have seen in a while, and the two people I went with agreed. I also thought that visually, humour-wise and acting-wise, this movie was better than its predecessor. The visuals are, as usual, incredible. The effects are fantastic and I love the way they show all of the tricks. It's exciting, intense and a bit over dramatic, but hey, that's what you get from the Now You See Me franchise, and I love it. Not only this, but it has a fantastic soundtrack and what can only be described as 'cool' sound effects. They are well placed and frankly, awesome! People are accusing this movie of being overly-CGI, having a bloated plot and being worse than the original, which in my opinion is ridiculous! Obviously it's going to be loaded with CGI - it's a movie about magicians and illusionists! It's far cheaper to use CGI than to actually do the tricks. Not only this, but I failed to find a problem with the CGI. It was done well, not too excessively and definitely used to the movie's advantage. The plot was most certainly not bloated, it had a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining plot arc and the characters were each well developed ( well, as developed as they could have been in this rather fast moving movie). I liked it better than the original. I loved the addition of Lizzy Caplan replacing Isla Fischer (which was done smoothly), and the new objective of the Four Horsemen (which again I won't go into, but was exciting, hilarious and at times even emotional). The acting was great, there weren't any phenomenal performances however, again, this is simply not the type of movie that you go to if you want to watch some great classic or moving story, you go to it to have a good time and to have fun. One standout performance for me was Mark Ruffalo's, but I won't say why because it will breach guidelines and become a spoiler, most likely. Dave Franco's performance as always was charming, Jesse Eisenberg's was funny, Daniel Radcliffe was also great, and of course Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were fantastic. My one reservation was that it was rather predictable. I won't say any specific plot points just in case of spoilers, but I did figure out the basic plot arc before the halfway mark. Then again, this is Now You See Me, and something I loved about these movies was how they can take a basic plot and turn it into something spectacular. If you liked the previous Now You See Me then I'm sure you'll love this. If I were to describe it I'd describe it as Inception, but with less of a tragic backstory and more of a funny, exciting and dramatic plot line and characters. I loved it and cannot wait for Now You See Me 3!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a sequel that we didn't need. It's OK to spend time with the big cast. Some of the card flipping stunts look good on screen. The airplane stunt was fun.The movie feels too long. The cast is so well known it is hard to see them as their characters in the movie. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is Michael Caine. Mark Ruffalo got angry enough to turn into The Hulk but he didn't.In the first movie of this title we were in the gambling capital of Nevada. This time we are supposed to be in Macaw, the gambling capital of Asia. The movie plays well on the big screen and will play very well on home platforms. If you liked the first one you'll be OK with this one. Hopefully the Horsemen have outstayed their welcome and use their magic to disappear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a worthy follow up to the first movie (coming from someone that as a rule doesn't believe in follow-on movies). It's fun, it's got its twists and hidden surprises, &amp; ends up being a well put-together, bit of entertainment. I went to see it with my my teenage daughter and we both really enjoyed it! It's a great, light, holiday movie, that leaves you with a smile on your face and "oh, gee, I didn't see that coming". It is a good mix of slight of hand that admittedly are fun to watch, good action and some rolling humour. Do yourself a favour - if you saw the first one and enjoyed it then go see the follow-on. Don't be put off by the nay-Sayers. Listen to the Inspector!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 wins the title for most unnecessary sequel, maybe of all time. The first film was a surprise with decent twists and performances. It was a success, apparently to the point where the studio thought the audience needed more. We didn't and this film doesn't really offer anything new and it expects us to really be invested in these characters and their story. Yet neither of these things are really compelling enough for a second go-around. As a result, this sequel just manages to be serviceable.The Horsemen are in hiding and the FBI are on the hunt for them. It's been over a year and now the stage is set for their triumphant return. Just when they reappear in the limelight, the trick seems to be on them. Their entire stage was hijacked and they find themselves at the mercy of Walter, a mad genius who needs their skills to steal a microchip. In this battle of wits, which magician has the upper hand?I begged my wife to see The Conjuring 2, but she was terrified of the original and absolutely did not want to see the sequel in theatres. Double that for the fantasy adventure film Warcraft, so we were stuck seeing the magic heist flick Now You See Me 2...why this wasn't called Now You Don't, me and millions of others apparently will never know. Most of the cast has returned with the exception of Isla Fisher and Mélanie Laurent, with the former disappearance explained away with a few bits of dialogue. In her place we have Lizzy Caplan, who seems a lot more at ease with the cast and the material. One of the welcomed additions to this sequel. While the original was somewhat refreshing, this one treads the same waters. I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns the original offered us, here everything is telegraphed and predicted a few scenes beforehand. Thus the magic is gone, to a degree. The spectacle is still there is some sequences, yet the revelation is timid. I had to stop thinking about logic a lot of times in order to enjoy the spectacle. One sequence involving the team throwing a card between each other to keep it hidden from people inspecting them, was really well done. But why do they need to throw it to each other? Why not just have one of them keep it and continuously hide it? I don't know. Double goes for a plot hole that I simply do not understand involving a fake chip and the real one. NYSM2 doesn't bother to explain much that makes sense and instead tries to explain what we already know. As I said before, Caplan is the one good addition the film does. Most of the cast seems to sleepwalk through their roles, especially Eisenberg. The second new addition is Daniel Radcliffe, who despite playing a "magician" does his best to shed that Harry Potter persona. Between his role in Horns, here and the upcoming Swiss Army Man, I hope he manages to do it. NYSM2 is again, a pointless sequel that manages to entertain enough to warrant a view if you're a fan of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throws Out All Logic and Realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the pull of academy award winning actors and a promise of 'wow' factor, the first Now You See Me film managed to be the definition of a great cable watch. But with the silliness in tone and in the added suspension of disbelief, the sequel is about as frustratingly stupid as it is visually impressive.It's hard to deny the acting talent that is aboard this franchise. There are 17 Academy Award nominations between this cast, but for the most part, the Now You See Me films seem to be paycheck films for those respected actors. That's not to say they don't have tons of fun, Woody Harrelson is easily the best thing in the film (although they try to do way too much with his 'twin'). But even if I'm being honest, I don't go see these movies for the incredible acting, I go to see some awesome magic.Unsurprisingly, the film decides to jump ship on any logic at all when it comes to the magic from The Four Horseman. Along with Harrelson is returning cast members Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, and Dave Franco; with newest horseman being Lizzy Caplan. Remember in the first film when all of these guys did magic tricks that you somewhat believed could be true if you really tried? Yeah, that's all thrown out the window. Granted there are attempts to explain the outrageous supernatural-level acts, but even the explanations don't add up.Sure, this film does have its impressive moments, however. Any easily pleased action fan will have a good time watching the various ridiculous acts of the horseman. Even I really enjoyed one particular card-trick scene between the 4 main horseman. But I think I would have liked a bigger effort being put to a Prestige type story and not a mindless action film with more twists than it can handle. Or perhaps the series should just take the Fast &amp; Furious route and stay ridiculous. If the third one does go the route of the ladder, I would hope it doesn't try to outsmart itself, because this film sure does.+Card trick scene+Visuals and Horseman acts can be fun-Throws out all logic-More twists and turns than it can handle5.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Man, it feels so good watching a movie with great cast of actors and also a great director. David Copperfield made illusions... sorry, make illusions. He is also the co-producer of this film. The only illusion in "Now you see me 2" is that it is a movie. Such a fresh breath to sink into a solid production, speaking of soundtrack, sound effects, acting and so on. The frame they have made around the entire production is nice; everything is associated and related to the observation of the eye and illusions, very good! The fast paced little details happening all around is truly magic (... and there is that pun again...). Almost so over the top that it becomes a little forced... almost. It is delightful to see. Woody Harrelson is a perfect fit for his character; a man of hypnotics that is socially extremely clever.David Copperfield made the statue of liberty disappear and walked through the great wall of China. You take "The Magic of David Copperfield". Then you add a little of the "Mission : Impossible" movie franchise and a little of the Ocean 13, 12 and 11. Swirl it around, and out comes "Now you see me 2". So, if you like "magic" and sophisticated types of movies as mentioned above, turn this on. Otherwise, maybe turn this on anyway, as there can be some entertainment and laughs for everyone.About 59:00. That is the time where I loud and clear heard myself saying; "You gotta be kidding me!?" One of the most innovative and clever scenes I have seen. Full blown team-work, magic, prestidigitation and dexterity! Can this things be done i reality? Maybe, and it should have been taken years of practise. So perfectly matched together it almost creates the question if this is surreal or can be done in reality. I was completely surprised and impressed when that came in hand (pun intended through the movie; Yeah, that is correct. I just made up a new type of pun... or is that only an illusion!?)! (Did I just raise your curiosity?) The surrounding big band kind of a jazzy tune make that scene scream "Mission : Impossible". The line of the movie: Michael Caine : Hell would seem as a day at the spa when we're through with these Horsemen, wouldn't you say? Daniel Radcliffe : You had me at hell.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Better than an average American production. The soundtrack does the trick (pun!?) and creates some really fine moments in here. It's almost like Harry Potter should have waved his magical broom around. There is a great sense of sophisticated class that goes through the entire production. Highly appreciated! - The actors : Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo... and John M. Chu as the director. A class act! Greatly done! - Entertainment : Very entertaining. Watching Mr. Harrelson doing two parts is hilarious, and he nails both characters. Besides that, high in motion to deliver illusions and tricks everywhere. So high in fooling the mind that even John Cena would finally proclaim "Now you see me". Also, knowing that my favourite magician David Copperfield co-produced this one, makes it even bigger and better. - Age : 117,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious to watch, comes with the musical score from a TV sitcom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no idea how this movie can show a rating above 6 on here, it is beyond me. At first you're presented with a confusing introduction, followed by an even more confusing continuation and further confusing plot twists that make absolutely no sense to anyone.That and the fact that they spend more time showing how magic tricks are done than showing them in action or concentrating on character development or romance. In fact at the end something happens between two of the horsemen and everyone in the room watching the movie looked at one another in confusion... What just happened? Why? To top it all off, the musical score sounds like it's straight out of TV shows like Castle or Nash Bridges with a playful, repetitive, "free stock music" sounding instrumental piece that starts out as annoying and by mid movie, winds up being all out irritating.Their only saving grace that gets them 4/10 is the fact that they used a cast of pretty decent actors but one is left to wonder: How the hell did they talk Morgan Freeman into actually playing in a movie this bad? Maybe he hadn't read the script or maybe they threw a bag of money at him. In either case this is the perfect example of a movie sequel quickly scratched together to achieve only one thing: Profit.Cheaply made, cheaply scripted, cheap special effects, cheap everything but the entry price. Not a movie I'll watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stage magic and movies are very much alike. The more convincing, the better. Unfortunately the action in this film, magic tricks, sleight of hand, hypnotizing people, is simply unbelievable - in a bad way. This is not an alternate universe with different rules of physics. This is not a group of super heroes using their powers, this is not a tale of magic becoming reality, this is simply unrealistic garbage.As for the actors, most notably we have Mark Zuckerberg (played by Lex Luthor) trying to take away the leadership of the "Horsemen" from "Jack" (played by someone without any screen presence whatsoever). Then we have a new person in the crew, an obnoxious girl, replacing someone from the prequel who I can't remember, because they were just as forgettable as the whole drivel that makes up both stories. We have Woody, Morgan Freeman, Caine, and Harry (Potter). In other words no one likable, unless you like them. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) also shows his unlikable side.I tried to keep this on to help me sleep, but during the action scenes they cranked up the volume (as is customary in movies for some reason) so I ended up switching it off.The extra star I gave is for production value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extended Episode of Scorpion!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie felt like an extended episode of Scorpion. The same contrived humour and feel good unnecessaries. Alex Kurtzman &amp; Roberto Orci have bombarded us with this absolutely unoriginal piece of garbage. Mark Ruffalo &amp; Jesse Eisenberg have really dropped their standards here. This totally seems like a forced studio movie which they were contractually obliged to do.There is maybe 20 minutes of this movie that should have made it to the final cut and even this is mainly special effects. But with a run time of 2 hours this was a pain to watch. The story really went no where and left you thinking -- seriously? Have no idea how it is at such a high rating on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many negative reviews. If you want a fun watch and don't care about realism, this is fun. Don't listen to the the trolls. When I read the IMDb reviews I saw lots of negative comments. They are from trolls. Look at their hating history. I'm not going to bother to try and sell you on this movie. Watch it for fun and screw the haters. I'm babbling to fill the minimum sentences. I watch for fun and don't need realism. Sometimes I give a negative review because something is too far fetched but, this isn't that. Give it a try if you have the time. This might not be as good as the original but, it's not worse in my opinion. Take a chance and I think you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first one was excellent--this one is cheesy, but it still holds your attention. As an example, when they're taking the "chip" out of the computer room and tossing it around on the back of a playing card like it's a frisbee from one to the other, you'll notice that everybody gets searched like a dozen times. Yeah, it's fancy camera work, but it makes no sense. After the guards search the first person, pass the damned thing to him/her and be done with it. The scene went on for 15 minutes and then ended with Woody Harrelson almost miss catching the card in his hat of all things. I don't know how they got these actors to sign on for the second installment, honestly. And is it just me or does Jesse Eisenberg play a great prick because he's really a prick and it's not acting? Really--I'm getting tired of seeing him play pricks in every movie he's in. If that's just him, then it's not acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tricks in the first one were much better in my opinion and I honestly felt like there were more in the first one as well. In the second one, why did Woody Harrelson have to play a twin? The whole evil twin thing was not needed. Surely there could have been another actor playing a different relative. I didn't like seeing Woody talking with (basically) himself.One thing that really bothered me and made me not like it as much was the fact that James Franco's character was in 2 places at once. Let me explain. So, near the end of the movie, when The Four Horsemen were "setting up" their finale, Jack Wilder was performing the Queen trick (his first location). Then it goes to the evil twin finding and walking with Merritt McKinney. Merritt then calls Dylan Rhodes to warn him and the others that Walter and his father are on to where their next location will be. You don't find out until they start describing how the trick was done that Jack Wilder was also at this brotherly encounter (location 2). Jack was the one who hypnotized the evil twin and told him to throw them out of the plane. After Merritt calls Dylan, then Jack, Lula, and Atlas abandon their tricks. So how was Jack able to perform a trick in one location and then hypnotize someone in another location? I know they were magicians, but even magicians can't really be in two locations at once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now You See Me 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like the film Now You See Me, because it took the "nothing is what it seems" idea to the point of total incoherence. And I'm not only talking about the "magic" tricks employed by the quartet of magicians/thieves to pull their bombastic crimes, but also each one of their ridiculous plans, which required huge coincidences, improbable situations and the universal stupidity of all the people trying to stop them. But the worst thing of all was the fact that, in a film theoretically inspired by the authentic art of illusionism, all the magic acts were special effects. Oh, and I can't forget to mention the hateful attitude of the characters, who were so impossibly "cool" and casual in such an affected and artificial way that it was impossible for me to take them seriously. I have spent quite a space talking about the first film... because nothing is what it seems in this review! In fact, this review is about the sequel, Now You See Me 2! The big trick in this case is the fact that both movies are identical, not in their plots, but in abuse of improbabilities and narrative poverty. The mission is different; new allies and challenges are revealed, and some old enemies are back. But the methods are the same: basically anything is allowed to happen because: Magic! Oh, and I also experienced the same indifference when the "surprising" revelations I had guessed since the beginning were revealed. Have I mentioned that nothing is what it seems? Something I wasn't expecting was the substitution of Isla Fisher as the female member of the Horsemen, but I liked the replacement to be Lizzy Caplan, an excellent actress who is quite underrated; pity that the screenplay doesn't bring her anything substantial to do. Anyway, I know that Now You See Me has various fans, and Now You See Me 2 counts with the same elements, atmosphere and style which brought success to the original film, so apologize me for my bitterness, and enjoy this sequel to your taste. Personally, I keep thinking that "band of magicians using tricks to break the law" is a good idea; however, Now You See Me and Now You See Me 2 have extirpated all the "magic" of such concept, and made it become a parade of distractions with a lot of movement, wordiness and some fashionable themes (the hotshots of Wall Street are "out"; the hotshots of Silicon Valley are "in") which aren't enough to bring any substance to experiences without any shape or depth. Pick one card, any card... and then play solitaire for two hours. It will surely be more amusing than watching Now You See Me 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2Lumberjacks and magicians have a lot in common on account both like to saw women in half.Fortunately, no red and black plaid shirts are worn in this action-thriller.The underground conjurers that comprise The Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson) are employed by the FBI (Mark Ruffalo) to prevent a software wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) from stealing a decryption device.The quartet is evened out by new edition Lula (Lizzy Caplan), who helps uncover a connection to a former colleague (Michael Caine) working behind the scenes.The obvious follow-up to Now You See Me, this sequential sequel benefits greatly from the addition of Caplan's character. However, the same cannot be said of Harrelson's twin brother: Chase, or the onslaught of digital slight-of-hand and overly complicated cons.Besides, everyone already knows the real dream team of magic is: Copperfield, Angel, Henning, and the tiger that ate Siegfried &amp; Roy.

		<fullReview>"The more you look, the less you see" This quote in the the movie "Now You See Me", aptly describes it's sequel "Now You See Me-2". Now You See Me-2 is a silly, goofy and fun sequel to a silly, goofy and fun thriller which resolves around the world of magic and illusions. It's that kind of movie where every time your mind is trying to find the secret within the quick-moving story line. The casts, director and screenwriters have tried something weird and funky. One special thing about this movie is that Woody Harrelson gets to play his original character, Merritt McKinney, who is a renowned magician and hypnotist and uses his tricks and powers to pull off some brilliant crimes. Things make sense until the halfway point of the movie before all the trilling but illogical sequence of scene starts unfolding. Anyone watching this movie without having seen the first movie of the series(Now You See Me) would probably be lost more than once. The universe created in this movie is more than comically cartoonish and surreal. Coming to the plot, the person making things difficult for the Horsemen in the movie this time is Walter Mabry(Daniel Radcliffe), a wealthy businessman who once partnered with the target of horsemen in the previous movie. Due to this, the money that horsemen stole sort of belonged to him, and now he is seeking reparations. Mabry's role is of a man with double, triple... dose of devilish ego. Also, one amongst the new cast who are a part of this movie is Lizzy Caplan, who replaces original star Isla Fisher. If you do have have a good memory, then anything which you might remember from the movie after some weeks of watching it is it's benchmark-Gimmick, a cleverly staged "sleight of hand" trick that involves stealing a microchip hidden in a playing card. But still, this movie offers as much entertainment as it is expected to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the previous film was full of intrigue, mystery, and revelations, this film is a pale comparison to it's prequel. With considerably less action and more talk, the first half of the film manages to bore the audience. As well, this film gives off the feeling of trying too hard to be like the first one that it just falls short.The acting is fine enough for the Horsemen, as they all reprise their roles. I did like Isla Fisher and her character, but unfortunately she got replaced by Lizzy Caplan, who isn't so bad either. I had a problem with Radcliffe's character. He was too weird, and his background was not very comprehensive. I also found out how short he actually is in this film. In addition, the film introduces Merritt's twin brother, Chase, played by Woody Harrelson. That was another no-no. Though the editing was done well enough between the two characters, the hair on 'Chase' was very obviously a wig which was unnerving. Needless to say, I found that the new characters were not a great addition.As for the narrative, it kind of continues the story from the first film, but not in as much detail. As well, there are more elements involved in this film that detracts attention away from the main plot. This is what made it messy; with too many things going on the audience doesn't know which to focus on. And with no focus, the narrative just becomes jumbled up. The effects are cool as usual. I especially liked the scene where they're tossing a card to each other. Visuals and coordination are nicely done there, and managed to engage the audience. The ending felt a little too deja vu from the first one. As mentioned, it tries too hard to be like its predecessor that it just destroys itself. I'm not saying the film is not enjoyable, but while it isn't totally horrible, there is too much dialogue and not enough action. I'd liked to have seen more tricks, and less new characters who hardly had any foundation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More or less capering around the surface of its prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, that leaves its wounds open ? the way things were in the previous installment. But it manages to work around it with its stunning theatrics, an elusive plot and a pinch of some rad magic to keep us riveted to our seats.NEW INCLUSIONS IN NOW YOU SEE ME 2 Daniel Radcliffe as Walter Mabry is absolutely thrilling, although he doesn't get much to gnaw at. He still manages to make his character interesting. Makes a swell entry! Lizzy Caplan is an awesome find as Lula, a pleasant inclusion to the already stellar cast. Her jocular remarks will make you fall in love with her instantly. Also, she doesn't make you miss Isla Fisher.The director's shaky camera techniques don't really work here, as he decimates action. If it were not for the plot and some cool magic tricks, it would have failed, nay, fell flat on its face in the muck of its own doing.SPOILERS YOU MIGHT SEE COMING: Now You See Me 2 has side-plots, some fine to live with but some really vapid and in need of better framing. Two of the worst ones were the twin tale and the original girdle that bound the movie taut. Even though Woody Harrelson creates a charming façade as his twin, the side story doesn't pack in a big punch. The Morgan Freeman story does, but it simply vexes you forcing you to chase the 'tale'. It is as if Jon M. Chu serves you a revelation hotchpotch, and boom! they keep falling one after the other on you. It seems rather deliberate and pushed to match the lines of the first installment.At times the dialogues of Now You See Me 2 run into the cheesy territory and you feel like laughing at serious moments, like when they team up (which by the way they have always acted as), and they go, "Who's in?" and then others follow, "I am in", "Me too".The side story of Dylan Rhodes, which Mark Ruffalo goes in full-blown acting mode along with Thaddeus Bradley, is a good one but the vendetta never takes place. The final revelation of Now You See Me 2 feels kind of empty even though it was colossal. Maybe it was in dire need of a proper depiction with a revelation theme or something. The way the movie begins, ends the same way opening you to the puns hidden in words which was well thought of. The voice of Morgan does justice to it as well. The Eye still stays as the rudimentary backdrop of the tale, and looks like we have something to look forward to in the long run.MAGIC TRICKS The card trick to steal the stick is stark badass but unfortunately there is too much of it, and it makes you start thinking out loud. There is comparatively lesser magic and more of hypnotism in Now You See Me 2 which kind of defeats the purpose of magic. The best magical majestic bit is the one Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) performs with rain as he tries to play God. Absolutely stunning to watch!

		<shortDescription>Can be given a pass.... poorly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half an hour of the movie confirmed it's going to tank big time. NYSM2 basically rides on the same formula that the first part registered its success on, completely ignoring that with a sequel, the audience expects something new. Story (4/10): The story is on a similar plot as the first one - four Horseman trying to expose a corrupt businessman and use their magic as the weapon. One of the Horseman, Henley (Isla Fisher), is replaced with Lula (Lizzy Caplan). While the story has new characters (some of them completely unnecessary like McKinney's twin brother), new location, and a slightly different setup, it doesn't come up with anything which we didn't see in the first part. It is kind of a drag after some time. The new and unnecessary characters are evidently conceptualized poorly. The only interesting part of the entire story was perhaps the sub-plot of Rhodes-Bradley animosity where the writer spent some good time to develop an interesting twist to it.Acting (6/10): The movie doesn't boast of much amazing acting. In spite of big names like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Mark Ruffalo, the other lead protagonists are way off. Daniel Radcliffe does a decent enough job of a tech prodigy but there was only as much screen time he had. Direction (4/10): It is the direction that sank the movie. When you have a very predictable story, all you need is brilliant execution. A dragged illogical sequence of chip stealing from the facility was a kind of final nail in the coffin. Except for some thrilling magic tricks, the movie was executed poorly. The things which worked for the first part were the very things that tanked this one. Overall (5/10): Overall, the movie can be given a pass. You won't be missing anything if you haven't watched this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five Word Review: Convoluted, Messy Sequelitis; Frequently Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately not titled 'Now You Don't', this sequel to the frothy, enjoyable 2013 sleeper hit adds to its all-star ensemble cast (Lizzy Caplan replaces Isla Fisher and Daniel Radcliffe is introduced as a villain), expands the setting, and ups the stakes, like most sequels. And, like most sequels, it's not as good as the first one. With The Horsemen being threatened by the threat of Daniel Radcliffe (odd to see him in a film about magic eh?) there are more hi-jinks, impossible feats of magic, convoluted twists, and witty repartees between the talented cast. The cast is undoubtedly the strongest thing about this film - the standout scenes are the ones in which The Horsemen are in their element, doing quick flashy magic and impressing everyone. Unfortunately there aren't as many of these scenes as there should be, with the filmmakers seemingly intent on switching from one underdeveloped subplot to another. Mark Ruffalo, as the Head Horseman, spends much of his tins with Morgan Freeman, with the two struggling to sell unconvincing drama. In a bizarre and distracting turn of events, Woody Harrelson takes on a dual role, introducing his character's twin brother as a campy villainous antagonist with almost nothing to add to the story which already has enough characters - it's always good to see more Harrelson but the twin aspect was unnecessary. There's a father-son relationship between Radcliffe and Michael Caine - who is great for his ten minutes of screen time - an FBI investigation team with a young officer who looks up to Ruffalo, a helpful pair of Chinese magicians with some vague link to The Horsemen....it is at times almost as overstuffed as Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's a classic case of sequelitis, and one which dooms the film almost from the get-go. Which is not to say there's not fun to be had: the delectable sleekness of some scenes is sure to bring a smile to the face and with this cast it's impossible not to be entertained. Standouts are Radcliffe's demented bearded tech whizz who is just fantastic to watch. He is an actor who has really thrown off the shackles of the Harry Potter legacy and is now just a great actor to have in anything, now showing his skill as a villain. Lizzy Caplan is bubbly and fun in her role, whilst Jesse Eisenberg, Harrelson, and Dave Franco are all solid as a team - if the widely purported third instalment of this franchise is to go ahead, then a good suggestion would be to bring down the stakes and focus more on the team dynamic. Ultimately, the film is flashy and at times fun, but drags more than its predecessor, is overstuffed, and is simply less enjoyable. One of the main criticisms of the first film was the empty flash, but the sequel has just expanded on that. A decent enough watch, but not something that will be remembered or re-watched. 53/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magicians get bedazzled and conned by the magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2013 a film came out called 'Now You See Me'. this was an exciting and funny film about magic. Four street magicians came together as 'The Four Horsemen' and used their magic to rob a bank. Mark Ruffalo played the role of an FBI Agent hunting them down. Michael Caine played a wealthy man robbed by the magicians, and Morgan Freeman, played a magic-debunker, blamed for the death of a magician, who ended up framed and imprisoned by the magicians. A final reveal showed that the FBI Agent was also really a magician, and the final scene was a sweetly romantic one set on a Paris bridge.As this reviewer has only recently returned from Paris, after walking across the said bridge several times, the arrival of the sequel to this magic film was highly anticipated. Sadly, it must be reported that this sequel makes the romantic scene now totally redundant. We cling to the romantic hope that there was at least a brief encounter, but sadly, in this film there is not even that.Jesse Eisenberg must have really enjoyed acting in the original fun film because he went on to star with Kristen Stewart in 'American Ultra' (2015), a silly Bourne-like spy-spoof comedy. Jesse Eisenberg as a magician, is joined once again by fellow magicians Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson.This film is set a year after the events of the first film. The Four Horsemen are in hiding, and Mark Ruffalo is still in the FBI pretending to track them down. In reality they are preparing for their next coup. There are some nice early scenes that introduce Lizzy Caplan to the story, as well as a flashback scene of the magician Lionel Shrike dying in front of his son. Richard Laing and William Henderson played their small parts well. It should be said that although the UK rating of the film is 12A, the subject of this film is magic in all of it's forms, thus bloody illusions are performed, and death is always a possibility.Some of the early scenes are frankly boring, and there is little tension as the coup unfolds. The original movie was cleverly filmed so that action scenes were clearly seen, and were also funny and exciting at the same time. There was not a need for too much of a suspension of belief. Sadly, the sequel, directed this time by Jon M. Chu, lacks that same fine touch most of the time. The action takes are so fast that we cannot see what is happening, and they are neither exciting or funny either. Of course, what this film is about, is a major twist, in which the magicians are undone in their coup, and are themselves played by a Mr Big. Director Chu does however reveal the Mr Big in a very impressive scene with an accompanying classic rock track.There is some impressive acting, especially by Woody Harrelson. Mark Ruffalo once again shows a fine touch, fans should check out the 2013 musical drama 'Begin Again'. In a smaller role, Sanaa Lathan makes a very convincing FBI Agent, and Jay Chou and Tsai Chin entertain us in their small roles too.The film opens with our magicians about to perform their coup, but as Mr Big ensnares them, it looks like they will need some magic of their own to escape his clutches.The Prestige, (there is a 2006 film of that name starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman), is the final reveal, where the magic trick is revealed in all of it's glory. Those who enjoyed 'Now You See Me' (2013), will enjoy this sequel, which, whilst it certainly does not surpass the original, does contain it's own magical flourishes as rabbits are pulled out of the hat. 8/10.</fullReview>

Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) remain after the Eye releases member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) is eager to join the Horsemen. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) gives them the job of taking down tech businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb). The group gets exposed, and kidnapped by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merritt's twin Chase McKinney to Macau, China. Walter is Owen's former partner and has faked his death to go off grid. He blackmails the Horsemen to steal a chip that can decrypt anything from Owen. That's before the return of Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine).I like Isla Fisher but substituting for Lizzy Caplan is a great move. She is loads of fun and the main reason I like this more than the original. I like this movie up to Radcliffe's reveal of their kidnapping. I don't think the Harrelson twin adds anything great. It's a functional caper movie until the twists pile up. Like the original, the movie deteriorates in the second half and I stop caring. It's a mixed review but I love some great Lizzy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all must come clean and say that I've not seen the original Now you see me movie. It was only the 2 in the title that gave away this was a sequel to me and didn't know anything at all about the movie beforehand.It turns out that it's a movie about a group of magicians called the Horsemen who perform spectacular magic acts to expose rich people exploiting people. Think that pretty much covers the plot. The film is at it's best when there are scenes of the magicians trying to outdo each other. The first scene which introduces the new horseman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) is an example of this. Overall it's a pretty incoherent script though which may be partly explained by the fact that I hadn't seen the first film. Maybe a second viewing would make things a little clearer although on balance I can't be bothered. If you like magic and enjoyed the original film then sure you'll enjoy this. If not you'll probably be somewhat puzzled like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the first, this is an enjoyable film without much substance; it has a weak plot and even weaker villain, but there are some good scenes and better characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Now You See Me 2' is the sequel to the 2013 film about a group of magicians who rob banks during their live stage shows. I didn't think the first film was all that good, as it had several large issues, but it wasn't terrible either. This film is set two years after the events of the original, and this time involves the 'Horsemen' being brought out of hiding to pull off a new heist. I definitely enjoyed this movie more than it's predecessor, but that by no means implies it's great: it still has it's fair share of problems and is largely uninspired. I did think it was a pretty solid, if a little shallow, action thriller.The plot of the film is one of it's weakest aspects. It feels very long, even though each individual scene moves along at a brisk pace, and ultimately doesn't amount to much. This time, the story has been scaled down somewhat and streamlined to be a more focused one - which spends a lot more time with the 'Horsemen.' An issue I had with the first was that the perspective shifted from the magicians to the FBI, making it hard to root for and fully understand the motivations of the 'Horsemen.' Thankfully, this was fixed by side-lining the FBI and paying more attention to the main characters; they don't spend as much time on stage and we follow them all the way through the picture. It makes their motivations and character arcs noticeable, allowing us to relate to them and their situation much easier. The flick also didn't feel like it was trying to be too clever for it's own good, like the first did. There are a few twists and turns but they are all predictable and don't feel like the crux of the narrative. They are largely uninspired, don't amount to much and probably could have been omitted but at least the film-makers seem to know this - they don't think that they've pulled one over on us, which was a vibe I got from the first film. The final reveal is also superfluous, and doesn't really make sense - it ripples across both movies, and tries to retcon some motivations. It is unneeded, a twist for a twist's sake, and had no impact. The faux-intelligence isn't as apparent as in the first one though, and thus doesn't feel as pretentious.The other problem with the plot is that there really isn't all that much magic. The movie doesn't feel like one about magicians, instead making them appear like pseudo-spies, and the whole film feels more similar to a traditional heist picture. One of the best scenes is an extended sequence in which the 'Horsemen' must hide an important playing card on themselves whilst being searched; they employ all sorts of distraction, misdirection and sleight of hand. This sequence is enjoyable and well put together, with the individual character personalities feeding into the action. There is some suspense here, and the scene mixes both action and slapstick together quite well. Most of the magic in the film felt a lot more tangible than in the first, even though there are some impossible vanishes and a sequence involving Jessie Eisenberg manipulating the rain that's ludicrous. There are some sleight of hand sequences which are mostly possible, using several recognisable techniques and real misdirection tactics, though the reliance on CGI is a little much at times - including some digital card doubles. I found the magic to be more realistic this time around, but the tricks performed aren't all that spectacular and the final 'trick' is very weak, with almost no actual 'magic' on display. I found the direction to be better this time as well, as there wasn't any nauseating camera motion and a few longer takes. It didn't cut nearly as much, and the edits weren't as jarring. There were a few continuity errors, though, and places where characters snapped to different positions between shots. There was also a fight scene that was very hard to read visually, due to the heavy amounts of shaky-cam and quick cutting. The action was confusing at times, and the fight as a whole was pretty underwhelming.The characters this time around are given more to do, and more motivation to do it for. The only real arc belongs to Mark Ruffalo's character though, as he changes throughout the course of the film. He also gives the best performance and is the most interesting screen presence. Jessie Eisenberg has the beginnings of an arc, though it's all but forgotten at the mid-point, and a couple of reveals serve to give new light to some character motivations. There are two major new additions to the cast, that of Lizzy Caplan's fourth 'horseman' - as Isla Fisher was pregnant at the time of filming - and Daniel Radcliffe's villain. Caplan was given more screen-time than Fisher was, and actually has some impact on the plot. She also has a more rounded and unique personality, though she is mainly relegated to being the comic relief, and does a good job making her character believable. I didn't find her funny though, instead she came off as awkward in a talking-too-much kind of way; the character wasn't too annoying, but was given too much dialogue at times. Radcliffe provides a very weak villain, however, coming across as neither threatening nor powerful. His performance is good enough, but it's the material he's given that's lacking; his character is very one dimensional, not given all that much screen-time and hasn't got all that much impact on the plot.Overall, I found this film to be more enjoyable than the first. It has a weak villain, bland plot and poor magic but is ultimately entertaining with a couple of good scenes and better fleshed out characters. Perhaps it would fall apart on a second viewing, but until then I liked this film: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 continues the narrative of the first film well, however does not add much to the lore of the series or match the quality of its predecessor.The best ingredient of the film is the cast. The actors and actresses involved work really well together to create charming chemistry and characters. Unfortunately, there are so many actors involved that some are ultimately wasted/short changed. Michael Caine and Jay Chou are among the first few billed for the film, yet they have little development and do not add much to the story.One aspect of the film I cannot criticize is the action. It is well paced and choreographed, boding together "magic" and realistic brawls. Furthermore, the magic/stunts in the film are exceptional and entertaining to watch, despite how ridiculous they really are.The main problem with the film is the actual story and how everything comes together. The story darts around from arc to arc whilst clumsily trying to continue the events of the first film and carry a new story all-together. This results in a disappointing third act as well as out-of-place scenes peppered throughout the movie. Now You See Me 2 is missing the magic of the first film to make it a really good film, however utilizes the majority of the cast and set pieces well to aid a struggling story.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly enjoyable caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only recently saw Now You See Me, on DVD, in preparation for this release - and then read some reviews which made me wonder if I should have made the effort. I'm pleased to say that I need not have worried, and I enjoyed this film just as much as the first - and possibly more; some of the illusions were worth the entrance in themselves. I liked seeing more of the characters and some depth develop to them, and unlikely as it might be, I'd certainly be up for watching a third outing. I say this as someone who doesn't necessarily enjoy magic on TV, and the difference here was probably the engaging cast. Dave Franco was a very pleasant surprise - endearing but not too cocky - and Mark Ruffalo manages to take centre stage and be self-effacing all at the same time. Big thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a mix of twists and turns, you more than often miss the obvious in these films, which is often its biggest advantage; you never really know what to expect because the obvious is usually so much more than that. And on top of that, its not knowing that one character will escape a reinforced steel safe submerged in water, but its wanting to know 'how' that keeps you so engaged in the film. Yes, the phrase 'style over substance' occasionally comes to mind, but this is an example of a film where that is not too much of a problem if you can accept it early on. You cannot waste your time running round in circles, thinking about the ins and outs of this film, as you will end up feeling redundant to the film, I just urge you to go into this film expecting nothing but fun and games - the trick here is all in your expectations.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/tKd9Ao</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What seemed like another forced sequel, Now You See Me 2 is about the return of the 'Four Horsemen' and for them to pull off a heist before something worse happens to them. The plot is very similar to its predecessor but in my opinion there is no need to change something for the sake of change, it works and it works well. The majority of the cast return (minus Isla Fisher but is replaced by Lizzy Caplan who was a great addition) and whilst most of them are doing their job fine, some are more captivating (I'm looking at you Ruffalo and Radcliffe). The majority of twists and turns are predictable but that does not deter from what is an enjoyable flick. The magic is great and some of the scenes are so outlandishly ridiculous that you just go along with it (especially one scene involving a card and a search team...seriously genius). It does take a while for the film to get going but once in full motion, this 129 minute ride will fly by. Overall, a decent sequel that may have lost the mystery that its predecessor played with but the magic is still there for what I would consider an enjoyable flick.- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - about as inventive as its title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that made the first movie work is that its plot was clever enough to keep you on your toes, not too clever to lose you, but entertaining enough to make it feel fun - like a dazzling mystery film. This time, however, the tone is all over the place. So there are still a couple of ridiculous plot twists, but it seems the focus is more on action set pieces (hence the director of Step Up, LXD and Bieber movies being brought on board).Most of the cast returns - Eisenberg, Harrelson, Franco, Ruffalo, Caine and Freeman - with a few extras. The female horseman this time is played by Lizzy Caplan, whose over-the-top enthusiasm was frankly annoying compared to Fisher's coolness in the first one. The supreme gimmick of having the world's most famous magician (Radcliffe) in the movie wore off after the first trailer, and although he's not bad, he doesn't really add much presence to his scenes. But in all honesty, the film does celebrate the relationships between all the characters, good or bad (although Chase was a character that never properly settled with me...) which is actually the driving force of the film.Where the movie struggles though is entertainment. Despite the banter, there isn't much humour in the script. And the magic tricks themselves, although sometimes explained, are just baffling (how did they set that up without any prior notice?). The movie only explains which tricks it wants to and sweeps past the ones that make absolutely no sense. Some of the set pieces are very well delivered (like the first time they go back on stage), but others are just awful (the stick-stealing scene), and for some reason they've filled the frames with unnecessary CGI this time, even on simple things like throwing clothes into boxes, or flicking cards, which looks incredibly fake and needless.Now You See Me 2 is about as inventive as its title. It's light and fun, doesn't take itself too seriously, but like the first it does think it's cleverer than it actually is. Very flashy and shiny, but needs to focus on some smaller details like all the unanswerable questions we're left with.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After recently watching the first now you see me I was pretty excited about this film but unfortunately like many sequels this film suffers and is not as good as the original. The premise of the film sees the four horsemen return, when they are forced to steal a piece of tech for an eccentric megalomaniac. Jesse eisenberg, woody harrelson and Dave Franco are the returning horsemen and they all do a good job in this film they have great chemistry together and there characters blend well together. Mark ruffalo like the first film is the best part of this film because he is easily the most interesting character in this film and has the most depth to him. Daniel Radcliffe is a good addition to the film as the villain with a fun performance he just isn't in the film that much. Michael caine and Morgan freeman are back in this film and they give decent performances for there screen time. Aisla fisher couldn't return for this film so she is replaced by Lizzy Caplan and unfortunately I just found her character really annoying and I just feel she didn't offer enough to the group. Also woody harrelson plays his twin brother in this film and my goodness this character was insanely over the top and really cringeworthy to watch. The story has very little depth to it and it feels like the basic plot is just used to show magic tricks and very little depth to it. Mark ruffalo has a bit of an interesting story but it feels very disconnected from the horsemen and it feels like a bit of a repeat from the first film. The first film has some decent humour and drama but like the first film it lacks anything that memorable which hurts the characters. The style has a bigger scale then the first film which means the magic is more over the top cgi events which do look pretty cool. But even more then the first film you have to disband your disbelief because most of the tricks seem impossible even with the explanations. Overall this is a poor sequel that isn't really worth a watch even if you liked the first film.</fullReview>

The director want to make audience keep guessing what happen next, but the intrigues seems easily predictable.Thanks, at least the story about magic seems cool right now. No other to contest because its a monopoly. But i cant stand with a bad character development and cheap writing. This kind of movie is a character driven typical, you need to amend the four horsemen better as the duration goes on to make this movie work. This movie too busy to close one mystery with another one until the director forget how cumbersome this movie is. Shorten the context of the story and sharpen the character depth will erupt the movie in my opinion.Its not like a magic story nor the cast that plunge the rating. Its just dull in its story and ambition, also lacks vanity to its character depth were the issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon M. Chu takes the helm from Louis Leterrier (Transporter 1 &amp; 2, The Incredible Hulk) and actually does a fine job of keeping the same style and magic of the first, better known for dance movies and music films like Step Up 2, LXD and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. There's a sleight change of casting but the core is still very much there with the addition of Lizzy Caplan as cheeky, confident and a little crazy Lula, which is a good one with a very quick brush off for Isla Fisher and absolute no mention of Mélanie Laurent this time round. She was my favourite character from the first Cloverfield, so I'm glad to see her again. Jesse Eisenberg and Dave Franco slip straight into their routine but we get a double helping of Woody Harrelson who pretty much, ridicules himself throughout the movie. Harry Potter goes rogue and does some bad wizardry proving Daniel Radcliffe actually makes a decent bad guy. It's Michael Caine who seems to be the weak link for this film, I wasn't sure if he wanted to be there. Freeman, like Ruffalo is here, there and everywhere. They all shuffle well together with the same funny, clever banter but some parts of the story and script are flawed. Brian Tyler reprises his score which was so suiting for both films, being the type of music you would hear at a magic show. It's recognisable, majestic and illuminating. Nothing really is what it seems, and you might spend most of the film guessing what's going to happen next. Everything all becomes very elaborate, so much so you actually forget what the whole point of the film is, who's who and where's it going and though mostly unpredictable and entertainingly so, the end might be anticlimactic for some. There's a lot of needless dramatic action, and yes, it's all about the showmanship but it needs to be good showmanship at that and some of the action feels cheap and maybe too much, even for the horsemen. It's slick in places and nicely put together but it then starts to lose the magic and mystery towards the end even with some clever, massive reveals it just doesn't hit home. Reminded me of Sneakers at one stage. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it like the first one, so fans should like it but I can see some people picking it to pieces. Now I've Seen It 2. Tada.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the first but an adequate sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the majority opinion I really enjoy 2013's Now You See Me; sure some of it doesn't make sense but for some reason I find it very entertaining. This year's sequel sees us eighteen months since the events of the first film and the Four Horsemen are tasked with performing a heist for Daniel Radcliffe.First off, you have to acknowledge the all-star cast here; I really enjoyed them in the first one so it was great to see the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Morgan Freeman and more back on board. They all do an excellent job of course and get straight back into these characters who's lives I was fully invested in. After the twist at the end of the original I was wondering how Ruffalo's character would change but I really enjoyed the majority of his arc in this and it builds on what we knew of his back-story already which was cool. We did have some new characters introduced to us and they were just OK; Isla Fisher did not return as the female Horseman so they bring in Lizzy Caplan as this new magician and despite a bit of a rushed introduction she was surprisingly tolerable; her character may be a little irritating to some as she is used as the comic relief a lot which was unnecessary and I do think Fisher's character was more interesting but as far as replacements go, she wasn't bad. Daniel Radcliffe also joins this cast as our antagonistic billionaire who wants something only the Horseman can get; so yeah it's a plot-point we've seen a lot of times in film but hey, it is a heist movie so I'll let it slide. He was absolutely fine in his character, not quite as threatening as sometimes I think he was meant to be but once you get used to this what this type of movie is, he's more than adequate.Just touching on the plot; it's a basic heist movie with the Now You See Me glitter all over it so plenty of illusions and visually interesting effects. I enjoyed it quite a lot, plenty of action, plenty of tricks, the locations were interesting as well, quite international which I enjoyed. There were a few twists here and there but some you could see coming and others I wasn't particularly keen on. I know they tried to top the big reveal of the last movie but it didn't really work here; it seemed to struggle explaining what it was they were surprising us with. But as a whole the main story worked for me.Something, or rather someone, I did not enjoy much was a particular character they introduced as a relative to one of the horseman; his purpose was a little unnecessary and what they made him into just brought the quality of this movie down. He was more suited for some sort of comedy which unfortunately this film tried to much of. The first film had funny moments and Harrelson was our comic relief but now they've introduced two more "funny" characters and it cheapened it at times.My last critique is that unless you enjoy the first film and have watched it recently I don't think you'll enjoy Now You See Me 2 as much. It requires you to remember a lot which was OK for me as I have seen the original a few times but for a casual viewer you are left asking a few questions. So in the end, if you didn't like the first one, you won't like this. For me it wasn't quite as neat and shiny as the Now You See Me but entertaining enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 continues with the story of, The Four Horsemen. One year after outsmarting the FBI, The Four Horsemen reemerge for an unforgettable comeback performance. Apart from J. Daniel Atlas(Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney(Woody Harrelson) &amp; Jack Wilder(Dave Franco), the Horsemen get a new addition to their team named, Lula(Lizzy Caplan). However, during their comeback magic show, things don't go according to plan. Now, The Four Horsemen are forced to work for a tech genius. The Horsemen will have to do what they do best &amp; pull off their most difficult heist yet, using their signature illusions. Now You See Me 2 is a superb film. It is as good as Now You See Me(2013). Director Jon M. Chu has successfully retained the magic of the original movie. The magic tricks performed in this film, are mind-bending &amp; look fantastic. They surpass the illusions in the first movie. There are quite a few twists &amp; turns in the film, to keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next. This is in keeping with the suspense element of the first film. The action element, is a welcome addition to the sequel. The magic trick involving the stick, is the highlight of the movie. Jesse Eisenberg is great as J. Daniel Atlas. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Dylan Rhodes. Woody Harrelson is awesome as Merritt McKinney. Dave Franco is impressive as Jack Wilder. Daniel Radcliffe is amazing as Walter Mabry. Lizzy Caplan is hilarious as Lula. Jay Chou is good as Li. Michael Caine is fantastic as Arthur Tressler. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Thaddeus Bradley. Sanaa Lathan, David Warshofsky &amp; Tsai Chin are effective as Deputy Director Natalie Austin, Agent Cowan &amp; Bu Bu, respectively. Now You See Me 2 is a must watch, for fans of Now You See Me(2013).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first "Now You See Me" was a personal guilty pleasure, it was fun, fast-paced and clever, with the help of a talented cast, good characters, and a complex story. The sequel didn't have the same clever elements of the first, and there was a subplot about a twin of one of the characters that added nothing to the film - if they had left that out in favor of a different conflict they might have had room for something else - perhaps an ending more like the first, with a lot more flash and spectacle. Oh, and Woody Harrelson in a wig, playing a fey version of himself - not a good idea. If they are in fact doing a third, they'd be wise to look at the first again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now You See Me 2 improves with some new tricks, but creates new problems for it's show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one thing to produce fantasy where wizards can produce magical energy to fight or resurrect the dead with a spell, but something else when your portraying stage magicians. One major rule when making a movie about these illusionists is that no computer-generated imagery can be used what so ever. Part of the reason that translating the stories of magicians to cinema is that the awe of the tricks are from witnessing them live. Adding a camera adds a sense of cynicism that a simple white rabbit out of a top hat could have been done using editing rather then hand trickery. Ironically, much of whatever's added in film to make things more magical suddenly takes away the wonder.The Prestige from Christopher Nolan seems to be the best movie out there about magicians. But when most people think about cinematic illusionists, they think about the 2013 film, Now You See Me. The movie had some interesting ideas, but I found the four horsemen too perfect for their own good. They didn't connect with me, but it did with audiences and was a hit (you have to give the movie credit for being original AND a hit). Now You See Me 2 continues the escapades of the four (in this case five) horsemen.Set a year after the events of the first movie, the horsemen, hypnotist Merritt (played by Woody Harrelson) street magician Atlas (played by Jessie Eisenberg), card handler Jack (played by Dave Franco), and newcomer May (played by Lizzy Caplan) have been in hiding, waiting for their next move from the Eye, the magician society they were recruited into before. With their leader FBI agent Dylan (played by Mark Ruffalo), they are assigned to expose a corrupt businessman whose software can steal data from users. They hijack the launch party, but are interrupted by a unseen individual who reveals that Dylan is in on the four horsemen. The magicians escape, but are unexpectedly taken and brought to Macau. They are brought in front of tech prodigy Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) who used to work with the same business that the horsemen tried to expose. They are given orders to steal the software chip from a secret facility under a casino. The heist goes well, but Mabry turns the tables on them and steels the chip back for his own benefit. Upon finding out that Mabry is the son of Arthur (played by Michael Caine), they travel to London to plan their next act to finally put an end to these villains.I'll say that I liked Now You See Me 2 as much as the last film?which was okay. It's not the same thoughts though as while they fixed some problems I had before, but accidentally create new ones. While the four horsemen are still too perfect as heroes, Mark Ruffalo gets some more background and becomes a surprising interesting character to follow. This film continues the heist theme, which seems like a good plan, but a lot of the story gets complicated.A lot of that has to do with the fact the idea of steeling a computer chip has been done hundreds of times before in film, so why should I care about this one? The villains' plans are just as predictable as it's just take over the world. Finally, some of the magic tricks are cool and visually neat (not as much CGI this time), but it requires a major suspension of disbelief. I doubt David Copperfield and Sigfried &amp; Roy could have come up with some of these tricks in just one day. I'll give this five joker card out of ten. If you liked the last movie, you'll probably like this too. It's too much "movie" for me to get into. What I mean by that is I wish I could be seeing these tricks live rather then watch it in a movie. Though there are some tricks, the overall treat just isn't to my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Four Horsemen resurface and are forcibly recruited by a tech genius to pull off their most impossible heist yet. This film is the sequel to Now You See Me, we have the Four Horsemen back except one of them: Isla Fisher, who's been replaced by Lizzy Caplan. The pleasure of NYSM2 is that the Horsemen perform magic with human powers. They are superheroes of the mind. Three years ago NYSM was a grand illusion thriller, drawing on elements from Nolan's The Prestige and Soderbergh's Ocean series. Mark Ruffalo is the core character of this film, his sincerity makes it work. In my opinion he carries the entire film. He has a heartfelt story in the film and his character has been given the most logical reasons to be there and exist. All of the other characters seem to be contractually obliged to be there. Whereas Ruffalo has motivation. As far as characters go, the rest don't really have much going on. Bigger isn't always better, in the case of sequel, especially in a movie about magicians and out-tricking people. Less is better. The key is accuracy. Though, the director keeps things moving at a smooth pace. The first movie had me questioned some of the things that happened, but for the most part you go gracefully along and have fun! In some ways this sequel is quite the same but it lacks of substance. There's tons of flashy big sequences but none of them really had up to anything. Furthermore, there were an absurd amount of continuity errors in this film. usually I don't look for that sort of things, and filmmakers don't expect their audience to. However, when you examines film and you really look for errors like that, it starts to become noticeable. Finally, this movie is edited with impressive rapid-fire precision. We keep thinking: when is the climax going to arrive? Overall, in NYSM2 there is always more than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now here is a film which had a good idea and would be an entertaining treat for audiences. This of course is 2013's Now You See Me. This concept was used to all it could be in the first film, and what has now followed is just sequelism.Now You See Me 2 is the sequel to a Now You See Me following the acts of the Four Horsemen; a group of magicians following a secret order to bring justice to society and take down corrupt figures. This time the Horsemen are challenged by opposing forces and enemies attempting to destroy them.With only two actors missing from the first film, all major characters return to do almost the exact same thing as they did last time. Along with two new main characters: Lizzy Caplan, and Daniel Radcliffe (who actually are quite good characters) Now You See Me 2 launches this franchise to a new expanded universe full of much more nonsense and more very unbelievable magic tricks than in the first film.So the definition of 'enjoyable rubbish' means a fun time at the cinema but the film is not necessarily good, but you can still just enjoy what it is, even if it is absolutely rubbish.I personally really enjoy the first film, as its really fun and not annoying. However the film does try to act like a clever film but it isn't, as like in the first film, it tries to justify its wit and cleverness with berserk twists and turns which try to be sophisticated but just aren't.I will also say that the film is very close to being defined as a science fiction film, as there are so many unbelievable tricks, sequences, and extremely advanced technology you have to call it fantasy.However, the film does have its pros. One key thing is character development which is excelled much more in this film with more depth and darkness. Not all characters are developed very well, but still reveals more about these Horsemen. Like the first one it is visually entertaining to watch, along with some pretty cool (very unbelievable) sequences.Overall the film is enjoyable but just tries to act clever but isn't, is quite complicated for the film that it is, very crowded in narrative, and just pure nonsense. I've heard there are plans for a third which is very unwise, but not an upcoming apocalypse (I hope). But just enjoyable rubbish/. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soo Magic! I'm writing this on a fire tablet. Bare with me, not liking it. This movie ain't great but is cool. What's the difference between great and cool? Its how much you smile. Its fun , its enduring (meaning a 3rd is inevitable.) But the p!ot lacks attention. The relationship between me and anyone from this movie is not true.What happen since the last time we encountered these guys? In the first movie, the relationship between hulk and his father, was great, here I don't know why he is still in the FBI. Take the flash but essence is gone. Pretty is dope, though.Pretty don't always pay out. P.S. Franco pulled some great card tricks,I read he really practiced. Woody did not manipulate the thoughts of anyone in this film, but in his defense he has been trying to do this for years!</fullReview>

Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all reprise their roles from the previous film, new cast members are Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Radcliffe.I found the film to be fun and taking the characters in new directions. Adding new characters, new story and locations the film offers something for everyone.Check out the review for Now You See Me 2 https://filmorder.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/now-you-see-me-now-2/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Many Twists, Not Enough Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as the story goes, there is actually a lot of potential in Now You See Me 2. It's not long before Rhodes has to give up his role in the FBI and focus entirely on being a Horseman, there's a handful of new players in addition to Lulu, and almost everyone from the first movie returns (although the Interpol agent isn't even mentioned). There's plenty of twists at play in this movie. Too many in my opinion. Rather than build-up mystery and intrigue, it just throws twist after twist at you. Some of them are great, some of them are awful (great being the identity of the new villain's father, awful being the figurehead of The Eye; the mysterious organisation of magicians).Similarly some of the new characters are great, while others are awful. I was sad to hear that Isla Fisher wasn't returning as Henley. There's a reasonably plausible explanation as to why she's not around, but I'd rather have still had her around, even if it was in a reduced capacity or cameo. That said, Lizzy Caplan's Lulu is a worthy replacement. She adds a lot of much needed energy and quirkiness to the group that, without her, would have seemed incredibly dull and uninteresting. I'd probably go so far as to say she's the best character of the whole movie. With all the antagonists of the first movie out the way, Now You See Me 2 needed a new one, and Daniel Radcliffe's Walter Mabry is brilliant. Just like Caplan, he brings a surprising amount of energy to the movie, and his borderline sociopathic villain makes for a brilliant foil.Then there's Chase McKinney, Merritt's twin brother, also played by Woody Harrelson, who is a dreadful and pointless addition. He's Harrelson at his most goofy and annoying, and that awful wig certainly doesn't help. Not only that, but he serves no purpose in the movie, no purpose that couldn't have been served by someone else at least. The best comparison I can think of to a similar character is Alfrid in The Battle of Five Armies, who's only purpose was to bring cringeworthy and completely humourless comedy to an otherwise fairly serious movie, cheapening the whole experience.The returning cast are all back to what they do best, and honestly I'm surprised that even if they did all phone it in for the paycheck, it's not immediately obvious. Mark Ruffalo probably gets the most opportunity to add depth to his character of Dylan Rhodes, particularly after his status quo completely shifts early on. Morgan Freeman chews up the scenery as usual as a personal antagonist to Rhodes, and they share some great scenes together. Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, and Woody Harrelson all do great as the rest of the horsemen, but they sorely lacked any character development at all, resulting in each of their characters becoming little more than empty shells trundled around at behest of the plot.The real draw for me, and I'm sure many others too, was the magic tricks. These imaginative and fluid tricks made the first movie so enjoyable, even when they flirted with the plainly unbelievable, giving it that edge of pure fantasy that I really dug. Now You See Me 2 is a bit of a disappointment in that regard, as there isn't really a whole lot of magic. Their first show back is thwarted before they really get to do much (although I admit the build-up was entertaining). Beyond little easter eggs and teases here and there, that's it until the third act. Okay, we get an entertaining exchange of cards in a high security lab between them, but it goes on entirely too long (seriously, how many times can you search one body over and over), and is ultimately pointless, because they seem to just keep passing the card to the person next being searched, when really the first guy should've kept hold of it after cleverly keeping it out of sight. When we do get a promise of some magic, they almost always get interrupted. What was great last time was seeing these tricks play out to their end and the Horsemen getting away with it. This time they never get to finish anything as Mabry's men or the police always seem to barge in, and any getaways they have are similarly thwarted with ease. When they all coalesced onto motorcycles I sat up in my seat ready for a nailbiting car chase through the streets of London, but they don't even get out of the car park. The imaginative and well-prepared Horsemen seem to get outsmarted constantly this time, and that was just frustrating.I enjoyed Now You See Me 2 for the most part, and I am eager to see the third instalment if it gets made, but I can't deny that this second movie was a bit of a mess. It had far too many twists and turns, returning characters became dull and indistinguishable (somehow), and the fun of grand magic was completely absent. The action benefited a lot from John M Chu and his history of highly choreographed movies, but he was near useless at handling anything else the script threw at him I give Now You See Me 2 a slightly disappointing 6/10.P.S. I still can't believe they didn't call it "Now You See Me Too" or "Now You Don't". Even the original title of "Now You See Me: The Second Act" would have been a bit more imaginative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Four Horsemen come back into the light to take on their biggest challenge yet. But are they able to succeed the brilliantly over-complicated Now You See Me or would their second act disappoint, Join Film an TV Nerd to find out.2013's Now You See Me was entertaining nonsense, and the sequel is pretty much the same deal.So the short version of this review is that if you liked the first film then this one will probably work just as well for you. On the other hand it's unlikely to convert and newcomers - but maybe that's not a problem given the box office return the first time around.There's a lot of razzle and dazzle in the film, courtesy of new director Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, GI Joe 2), which makes perfect sense for a story about magicians who steal things during spectacular stunts.The set pieces are enjoyable enough, with some over the top card skills a particular highlight. Some vehicular action is a little dull but otherwise this is a handsome production which amps up the silliness to keep things moving at a brisk pace.Script wise it's not bad, but pretty much this is oceans eleven with added magic tricks. Whilst trying to have continuity in the form of agent Rhodes childhood and even an odd appearance by an "Evil Twin" Brother, this continues the story on 18 months after the events of the first film whilst adding a bit of a back story at the same time.In terms of new additions, Lizzy Caplan definitely makes an impression but her motor mouthing mostly annoyed me. She like a yapping puppy who doesn't know when to stop, seeking all the attention even though she doesn't really add that much besides some diversity to the group. Then there's Daniel Radcliffe who is mostly entertaining as villain but looks oddly ill throughout the film.Jesse Eisenberg , Mark Ruffalo , Woody Harrelson , Dave Franco , Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all return to reprise their respected roles and do a decent job of it.Of course there are various twists through out, but this time around your not really left with that sense of wonder of how did they pull it all off. Saying that this is still a fun film that continues the tale of the modern day robin hoods as they become part of the fabled "eye".The action takes place mainly away from the sates where the horsemen are all wanted by the FBI, as we visit the far east and the landmarks of London. The sets are over-elaborate and well polished as well they should be for this style of film, its just a shame that fight scenes fall victim the shaky cam is shaky curse making it even harder to see the tricks taking place.But overall few fun tricks, some famous faces and a fittingly over the top finale make Now You See Me 2 a very familiar two hours at the cinema. It's a little long and a bit basic but entertaining enough while it lasts So out of a possible five stars Now you see me 2 earns: &#x272a;&#x272a;&#x272a; It seems very realistic to What did you think of this film?

		<shortDescription>As good as the first one... Maybe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie despite the disadvantages it had. The star of the film was still Jesse Eisenberg (who was still brilliant as Atlas) but we got to see more of the other two Horsemen (both Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson were great to watch). The new girl Horseman, Lula, was good. Sometimes she was on the verge of being annoying, but on the whole, she was likable and definitely had a solid character whereas Henley (Isla Fisher from the first film) didn't leave much of an impression on me. Even so, I don't think the Horsemen had the same kind of camaraderie as in the first film. Daniel Radcliffe was interesting to watch. His scenes were always fun, he has a particular knack for doing the simplest things and making them funny. Sometimes though, I got the feeling he wasn't even acting, that he had wandered onto the set and was just being himself. The film seemed to have a fairly simple plot but it tended to wander off. It was definitely sometimes tricky to understand what exactly was happening. I think there's two things that contributed to that - 1) the pace; sometimes several things were revealed to the audience too quickly for them to process fully, and 2) the dialogue. Again, this had to do with the pace, it was just too quick sometimes. My last point, the magic. It was great. It was so exciting and exhilarating to watch them do impossible things (even if they're not real). Not all of their tricks are explained in the film but I think I prefer it that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Major Casting Flaw Kept This From Being As Good As The First One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If they couldn't get Isla Fisher, who placed Henley Reeves, in the first one, why on earth could they not find someone like her? The bold, brassy, in your face gal, Lula played by Lizzy Caplan, her replacement, not only did nothing for the film but she kept the whole feeling of the 'team' from forming. They never came together as a group with her in there. The addition of Daniel Radcliffe was a brilliant stroke. He was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. Another wonderful character added was Bu Bu played by Tsai Chin, as the little oriental shop owner. And please, could they not find a razor to fit Mark Ruffalo's face? I love him, but he looked so tired and scruffy ? mainly because of that face full of whiskers, that I was put off. In other words, this film had all the makings of another great picture like the first Now You See Me, but because of a few flaws, mostly Lizzy Caplan, it just never got there. What a shame. Was so looking forward to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'NOW YOU SEE ME 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2013 surprise 'caper flick' hit; about a group of four illusionists, that rob from the rich and give to the poor, during elaborately staged magic shows. This installment has the magic team being forced to pull off their most challenging heist yet, for a greedy tech genius. Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine all reprise their roles (from the original movie); while Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Radcliffe and Sanaa Lathan join the cast (Isla Fisher is noticeably absent, due to her recent pregnancy). Jon M. Chu directed the flick (he's previously helmed films like 'G.I. JOE: RETALIATION', two Justin Bieber documentaries, and two 'STEP UP' sequels), and it was written by Ed Solomon (who also co-wrote the original movie) and Peter Chiarelli. The film is definitely a lot of fun, and consistently entertaining throughout (just like the original).The remaining three members of the famous illusionist team, known as the Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Harrelson and Franco), have been hiding out for a year. The FBI is still on their trail, and FBI mole, Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), is still protecting them. Then Rhodes helps them setup another elaborate magic show heist, that goes horribly wrong. The team wakes up in China, and finds themselves being blackmailed into another caper; by a tech genius named Walter Mabry (Radcliffe). A witty magician named Lula May (Caplan) joins the crew, on this new mission. I'd say if you're a fan of the original flick, you'll probably like this sequel just as much (or close to it). It's filled with all the same cool magic tricks, detailed (and impressively involving) heists, and witty banter. The cast is all great again (I'm a huge fan of Eisenberg's) and Caplan is an awesome addition to the cast (she's definitely an improvement over Fisher). I can't really see any major faults in it; and at over two hours, it impressively flies by!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hated the first, enjoyed this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As per the summary, I watched the first movie at home, and it was a CHORE to watch. I started doing a play by play on Facebook, just hoping for it to end. But it kept going. And going. The movie was too slick for my taste.The second movie might be Jon Chou's best as a director. That I've seen. Ahem. And I've seen way too many of his movies, not really liking any of them.But this movie surprised me. My daughter dragged me to it. I only saw it because she wanted to see it. And huh... I was entertained. When it comes to magic, I let myself go with it. Magic is slight of hand, and this movie actually showed how a lot of the tricks worked. And if it didn't, I figured there was a trick to it, and I went with it.There was good humour in this flick, with the best part being a hide-the-card trick.This movie is getting both sides of hate and love, and I was surprised that I really liked it. Makes me rethink all of those movies on Netflix with low ratings...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Expectation are as high as it will ever be. The Louis Leterrier redemption movie was exhilarating three years ago. The pressure is on. Can the directory of the Justin Bieber documentaries follow up to the expectations the Four Horsemen set in the first picture? As I sat there watching the late comers take their seats, I thought to myself, I will never understand folks coming in to a movie of this nature late!Undeniably the strongest narrative voices of our time, the opening Freeman monologue locks you in, everything else is now background noise. The returning cast with the exception of Isla Fisher and the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan makes the new four horsemen. NOW YOU SEE ME 2 picks up a year following the exit of the horsemen. They resurface in a performance to clear their names by exposing the tech goliath Octa. Octa seems to be the least of the problems as the FBI closes in.Jessie Eisenbergs' eccentricity, Dave Francos' prattle, Woody Harrelsons' comic- relief, Mark Ruffalos poise and Lizzy Caplans charm are all on point. Director Jon M. Chu recognizes that the screenplay is weak (just as in "1"), the characters have no depth and the audience yearning for gimmicks. He delivers. Just like any Bond movie, MI movie, or Fast &amp; Furious movie, its about being flashier than its predecessors. In that category I think "2" isn't all that bad.Danielle Radcliffe to me always will be Harry Potter (his fame came at a price). He certainly has the range as an actor but the 24-year-old to millions will always be the wizard. Radcliffes' character of Walter Mabry is surprisingly the most versatile. Given more screen time I would chose Radcliffe over Eisenbergs as the most interesting performance. Freeman and Caine need to not even speak, their presence on its own add value.Did we really need "2"? Well its too late for that question now since "3" is already rumored. Arguably a parody of the first script? To an extent yes, I prefer to consider it a continuation. Exhilarating? Entertaining? Engaging? Yes. Yes. Yes. Do you need to have watched the first movie? Yes. One of the most thrilling pictures this summer? Absolutely. A must watch? Why not.TITLE: NOW YOU SEE ME 2 DIRECTED BY: JON M.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good.. Not as good as the first though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you see me 2 is not as good as the first one, which is typical for a sequel. But now you see me 2 is not one of those terrible sequels. For one thing I really enjoyed the acting, I thought that the acting was very well done by every cast member, and Lizzy Caplan is a good addition to the horsemen, her positive energy and witty humor works well with the film. Mark Ruffalo was alright in this one, and in my opinion he wasn't as good here as in the first one. OK, I enjoyed Woody Harrelson and his character, but his evil twin brother was just a big mistake and I really think the character would've been better off by being played by a different actor, I also thought the twin brother was just really annoying and purposefully weird and I thought his character was just crap. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine have really strong presences in this movie and they really give great performances. Daniel Radcliffe is alright, not quite as good as I thought he would be, but still not terrible or bad. And last but not least, there is Dave Franco, the sexy smoldering Dave Franco...... He is great here, he is one of my favorite things about this film. The action is good, not as great or often as in the original movie, but what's here is still sufficient. I think now you see me 2 wraps up nicely too, Morgan freeman ends it in one of his great famous monologues, and I thought the ending was good. 7/10 for Now you see me 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2, a sequel to a movie I never thought would get one. Well, here it is and though I loved the first one, and the second did fall short a bit, but is still fun and those who enjoyed the Ist, well definitely at least enjoy the IInd act, if not from a critical viewpoint. Let me give a special mention for Lizzy Caplan, the girl horseman, (woo-hoooo!! anyone, No??! it's okay..lol) who was brilliant, just brilliant in my opinion and without her in this movie, I do feel this one would have sucked and hard at that too.Now let's discuss the problems, which were a lot. The acts!! Oh my god! The acts were really weak throughout. The first act never even began before they were interrupted. The individual acts in the end were either revealed in detail with explanation in the beginning of the movie or the trailers, and the final act was a little too easy for me, I feel. Now, the positives. The story was good, no matter what people say I liked it. Lizzy Caplan again stole the show and Jessie was good as well along with Mark Ruffalo. The stealing act was good BUT they didn't have an exit plan? Like seriously?? Major plot hole.Overall, I liked the pace, liked the cast, liked the story, and loved the fun, goofy elements and Harry Potter.. lol. But the magic acts should have been better considering it was a 'magic' movie. Final Score- 7/10 (Watch it and you'll enjoy it, but don't try to make sense of some of the elements.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alma Dray, the French Interpol agent was simply nowhere to be found. And why would they replace one horseman just because she isn't able to act? Is there no better reason? The first movie was much better in my honest opinion.Also, as compared to the first movie, this movie had so little "magic" in it. It really lacked the wow/surprise factor. I enjoyed the first movie a lot more because it was very entertaining, whereas this movie has a lot of conversation and action than magic. I believe the theme changed into more of an action film than a magic-show film.And Jay Chou... Why is he even inside? For marketing purposes to appeal to the Chinese crowd? Beats me. 5/10.

You can't take any of it seriously or try to wonder too much about why the chip was fake one minute and then real the next? Hmmm. I'd really like to point out that Isla Fisher is a good actress, but she brought nothing to the first movie. She was eye candy. She is better suited for a different type of movie. Lizzy Caplan nailed it and was terrific! Also many previous reviewers didn't mention a new character, Chase, Woody Harrelson's twin brother, who is hysterical and reminds me of mixture of Owen Wilson and somebody I can't quite peg. Anywho, it was great if you loved the first, easy to follow if you understood the first and followed the firsts plot which was nice. Loved the ending!

		<fullReview>It's a about what you'd expect if you have seen the first one, although not nearly has good. A film like this you have to suspend your disbelief, cause it's about a team of magician crusaders. I really liked the first one, this was alright, I don't think it deserves the bashing it's getting from critics.The rest of the cast do return, except for Isla Fisher, who was replaced by Lizzy Caplan but a different character. Our favorite modern day Robin Hoods known has The Four Horseman find themselves exposed and on the run, and at the mercy of a billionaire(Daniel Radcliffe) Who wants them to a job or it's over. Will they find clever way to get out of it.It's does have some clever moments, you just don't see it coming. Although a little bit of the fun parts where just not here, only in some of it. Lizzy Caplan I did like, was not sure I would at first, but she really grew on me. Woody Harrelson seems to be having the most fun here, playing his characters twin brother. Jesse Eisenberg filmed this after Batman V Superman, I can tell looking at his short hair. Don't expect nothing more or less going into this, if so you'll be entertained by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic &amp; Comedy Trying to Mask That It's Just Another Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like any sequel, it's not as good, but it gives us another crack at the world we liked enough for there to be a sequel in the first place. Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg), Jack (Dave Franco), and Merritt (Woody Harrelson) are still in hiding from their ultimate trick. Henley (Isla Fisher) has left, stated to have been fed up with their year and counting of hiding. Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) has brought in a new female, Lula (Lizzy Caplan) so the Four Horsemen can resurface and pull off another ultimate magic show. However, a new player on the board usurps them and Dylan's cover with the FBI is blown. This disaster of a comeback was orchestrated by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merritt's "evil twin" Chase. Mabry wants the Horsemen to steal a computer chip thingamajig, but as we all know, that is only the surface of the plot. Not going to lie, I actually like Caplan's Lula better than Fisher's Henley. There I said it. If a third film is made--as the ending suggests--I hope she stays with the rest of the cast. That being said, "evil twin", really? But I digress...Aside from Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Hunger Games: Catching Fire I'm not entirely sure how often a sequel equals or surpasses it's predecessor. Usually it doesn't, simply because it can't. Therefore, I'd ignore the criticism that is solely based on this being number two and focus more on the criticism about the film itself.For the fact that I was having a bad day and needed a simplistic film with a good laugh, this was just the fix. However, I was surprised at how simplistic it was. The first film was well "WOW" is really the only word to describe it. We delved back into the world of magicians and trickery, and that mixed with the Leverage element of righting wrongs, made it a very entertaining film. Yet it was more thriller with the FBI agent trying to catch the "criminals". The magic was secondary. The sequel places the magic first and foremost, which became too much. Too many tricks that we can't keep up with and can't believe. Part of the magic of magic is believability, but when the tricks are happening at lightening-speed and so frequently the audience has no choice but to sit back and just nod. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun to watch. But there are four magicians all playing tricks, mixed with the other plot twists, and really the film is just magic tricks in sequential order that without the film would fall apart. What was even worse is that I figured out the ending right away. Not the very very end, but the ending with the "antagonists". It was like a Las Vegas welcome sign that was impossible to miss. I'm still trying to decide if that was intentional. If you see the film you'll see that they once again have three tricks leading to the finale, and with each trick the magician stresses how it's important for the audience to pay attention. So I did, which is why I figured it out so quickly. But like I said, perhaps that was intentional...though if it wasn't then the film loose significant points in my book. I will say that once again we had plenty of comedy between the four horsemen. That was entertaining in and of itself.Overall I would say the film is good. Good enough that I don't regret seeing it, good enough that I would likely see a third if it is made, but still just another sequel all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The return of the horseman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One year after the horseman did their greatest magic trick by stealing tech magnate Arthur tressler hundreds of millions, they are back on their latest assignment. The four horseman are assigned by Walter mabry who is played by Daniel Radcliffe as the villain which is a change of pace from the usual heroes he plays is a scene stealer to get a device that deals with the issue of privacy. Lizzy Caplin is another great addition to the cast as new member Lula who replaces former member Henley reeves played by ishla fisher in the first due to pregnancy. What I loved about the film was the fascination with how the magic was pulled off into addition to exploring more of Dylan played by mark ruffalo backstory. Morgan freeman is also back as Thaddeus Bradley who is explored in further detail and has a surprising connection to Dylan's father Lionel shrike who was a magician.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice until the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the first movie, I have been waiting for this one impatiently. As the movie started, it amazed me with all the magic tricks and the incidents going on. It was absolutely perfect to watch, until the end. After all the effort the horsemen showed through the film the ending was like: OK, let's make the horsemen do all these stuff and after it's done they will feel like ONE and think they have accomplished something. For me the ending became a disgrace and it was a disappointment. To sum up the plot turned into a thing like: There is this community called "the eye" and they create a problem and then they find new people to replace themselves which should first solve the problem they created without knowing that the eye created it. And through the process they also help for the problem to be unsolved. The question is why did you act like the villain in the first place! It is a movie worth watching yet it didn't really fulfill my expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sequel I've Seen In A Long Time!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was iffy walking into the theater about the second movie. I fell in love with the first one and I knew nothing could top it. I'm going to be honest, it starts out slow but give it at max 10-15 minutes in and I was hooked! It's been a very long time since I've seen a really good movie sequel! I loved Isla Fisher in the first movie but the new girl Lizzy is hilarious! She adds humor where Isla to me really didn't it was more sass than anything. I was also worried about Daniel Radcliff being in this movie but I was proved wrong he did really good for his part in the movie. I was impressed overall with the second movie. A lot of plot twists! I wish there was a bit more magic but the finale and a couple of tricks made up for that ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some disappointments but at least......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now you see me is one of my favourite films of that year and I am very curious in finding out whether it still is any good in this second installment. Firstly Before going into this film I was very disappointed that Isla Fisher is no longer coming back but I was interested in seeing how they would handle that. I was pleasantly surprised with Lizzy Caplan's Lula who may strike annoying at times but seems to handle it just right so it isn't too over the top at times.There were several odd things in this film including Woody Harrelson playing two roles. It was unnecessary and just made it all seem very strange. The film seems to lose some of the fun elements that the original had and is replaced with fast talking and a very sloppy plot. I found it quite predictable at times which makes their efforts of making big reveals seem amazing and unbelievable pretty stupid. However the final act I feel was great and I feel was really what they should have stuck with instead of this dull series of talking, outsmarting and little tricks. The large scale and the tricks I feel is what made me like the first film so much and should have been a larger part of this film. I would expect at least 2 or 3 large scale performances from the horseman.Another more personal problem of the film would center around a minor character played by Jay Chou. Since I am a Taiwanese I payed close attention to Jay Chou's involvement with the production of Now you see me 2. I was disappointed that he was after all apparently just a sales gimmick to sell more tickets to the Asian market. It was ridiculous that His character got around 5 minutes of screen time and around 10 lines and he was still front and center of some of the posters of Now you see me 2 that I've seen. He was more of a cameo really, this sort of false advertising made me leave the theater quite disappointed after all. I understand that the language barrier would likely result in him not be able to deliver well in terms of acting and dialogue but in that case studios shouldn't throw him on every poster selling him as some sort of major character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice entertaining movie albeit lacking that 'Wow' factor that made the first one memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had very high hopes for this movie after watching the first one because that movie was something new and different. It had an intriguing concept which was wonderfully portrayed on screen. The acting in that movie was solid which is a given when you have talent like Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in the same movie. They all returned for this installment with only Isla Fisher being replaced by Lizzy Caplan. Then there was Daniel Radcliffe, arguably the most famous wizard in the world playing the villain of the movie. Though the irony of this was not lost on me, I felt that however much he tried, Daniel Radcliffe wasn't convincing as a villain. Lizzy Caplan was not good at all with her character being very unconvincing. To me it felt that her whole purpose in the movie was to provide that unnecessary romance subplot with Jack Wilder. This movie still brought those stunning visual effects of the first movie with my personal favorite being the scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the rain during the film's climax. The scene in the middle where the Horsemen had to steal a chip from a heavily guarded location was entertaining to see albeit illogical. I mean whim were the filmmakers trying to convince by showing that not a single guard saw the card being tossed around the room? This lack of logic spoiled what was a great scene visually. The scenes in the Chinese Magic Shop were really enjoyable. Jay Chou's character was especially good with his comedic timing. The main problem of this movie was that it got lost in setting up a convoluted plot. This made the initial half of the movie very dull and boring. Where the first movie kicked off with 4 individual scenes involving magic tricks and then the big bank heist, this one had its first real magic scene during the introduction of Lizzy Caplan's character, which was a really weak scene. This movie had very little actual tricks with actual explanations and it instead relied more on unexplained illusions. The twist that Daniel Radcliffe's character was in fact Arthur Tressler's son was a decent one even though it was a bit clichéd. What made the movie good was its climax. The climax showed us what we wanted to see from the start. Actual tricks with believable explanations which were enhanced by special effects which were a visual treat. It was a gripping climax and it used it's backdrop of the City of London quite effectively. The finale in the middle of the Thames was extremely good and was in my opinion much better than the finale in New York in the first movie. The end reveal that Thaddeus Bradley was in fact partners with Lionel Shrike and was a high ranking member of the eye did not go down well with me. It was a big plot hole for the first movie as why didn't he tell Dylan about this when he was first jailed? It made no sense. But we still got a brilliant scene between Morgan Freeman and Mark Ruffalo due to it so I can ignore that mistake. All in all, this movie is more of a typical summer entertainer rather than the thought provoking one its predecessor was. It got caught in a tad too much storytelling and illogical tricks rather than the ones with an explanation but it still delivered enough to justify there being a third installment in this franchise. This movie should be seen as more of an unrealistic entertainer with a less than average plot but with enough of the visual treat to justify spending two hours in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Excitement and Unrealistic Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Now You See Me 2" is the sequel for the 2013 movie "Now You See Me", and features Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Mark Ruffalo, and as a replacement for Isla Fisher, Lizzy Caplan. Like its predecessor, the movie follows the same behaviour pattern by showing the same amount of crazy, unexplainable magic tricks, so that we, the moviegoers, can feel impressed and amazed. Even though the movie tries to explain some of its many insane magic tricks, some tricks are still left unexplained which leaves me as viewer with an increased skepticism of the lack of realness showed in the movie. I know the movie is supposed to be fun, exciting and nothing more, but it would still have been nice to see some kind of explanation to some of the bigger tricks, that did not involve cards. For the acting part: Lizzy Caplan did a good job as the replacer for Isla Fisher, being both credible and funny. I loved that her humour felt real and not forced, and when I say "forced" I mean in a way where scriptwriters make her say one too many funny one-liners, but instead she would say what came to her mind and it worked great. Mark Ruffalo was great and had by far the most emotional story in the movie, which made him more interesting to follow than any of the other Four Horsemen. Daniel Radcliff as the main antagonist also worked great, and I really believed his portrayal of a crazy, sociopathic billionaire. The one performance in the movie that annoyed me was by someone who played a twin-brother to one of the horsemen, and this characters behaviour just got on my nerves throughout the movie. In the end, the movie is a good time with popcorn and soda, and instead of asking yourself, "how the f**k did they pull that trick of?" you should just try by going with the flow of the movie and it will give you 2 hours of fun and excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastical Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 is a great movie. By definition, it is however nothing new. It uses the same formula for success as its predecessor, of an all-star cast, twist heavy plot, and (CGI-assisted) breathtaking magic stunts.All of these things are well developed, just as in the original. The characters especially are given much more intentional treatment, and their development is much more effectively intertwined into the story. One bad thing about this film, (Its reason for my giving it an 8, and not a perfect 10) is that it suffers from what is popularly known as "sequel-itis". It capitalizes upon what made the first film great, but unfortunately gets a bit caught up in the spectacle of showing people something they have never seen before.In the end though, what determines the merit of a movie, is the level of enjoyment it offers. Now You See Me Two, offers plenty of enjoyment, not to mention great action, organic humor, and thoughtful plot twists; all of which make for an all around thrilling movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So it turns out, the things critics complained about in 2013's Now You See Me would've been better off untouched. While not producing a perfect movie in the first installment, the opposite ends up happening here.On the other hand, much like the first one, Now You See Me 2 has the mind-bending entertainment taken care of. It holds the same charm that was present in its predecessor-- perhaps even more. However, there are just a few things that are problematic.For one, the audience constantly feels like they're missing something--like they're always behind in what's going on. And not because of natural occurrences in the narrative, but because the filmmakers simply want us to be. Which is odd, seeing that this time we're actually in on most of the tricks. In Now You See Me, we're given the story through the FBI agent's point of view--always on the other side of the magic. In the sequel, we're mostly given the point of view of the four magicians, so we're deeply involved behind the scenes. The former situation was a major complaint of the first film, but now that I'm seeing the alternative, I think I would rather things be back to normal. And even though it's worth it in the end, the whole time prior you just sit there, frustrated, not wanting to be in on the trick, trying to mentally disassemble all the rigmarole in the meantime.Two years following the events of the first film, the Four Horsemen (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Lizzy Caplan) must remain in hiding for fear of the FBI. But they're growing impatient waiting for further instructions. Caplan replaces Isla Fisher as the female in the group. She's very unfunny--even when she so desperately tries to be--making us wish Fisher was back. The clan ends up in China where they are forced into working for a rich businessman (Daniel Radcliffe) who faked his own death and is supposed to be dead to the rest of the world. Radcliffe's brilliantly evil persona is far from the paladin, Harry Potter, as this may be his most mainstream role since.Morgan Freeman also returns with his character still in prison, because, for some reason, he can't seem to prove his innocence yet. Freeman is a key cog because he's what connects Ruffalo's character to his father's death as a child. Also differing from the first film, the first two acts are the weakest part. Waiting for things to get better towards the end, we sit through a magic trick-less setup that's more confusing than interesting. We do, however, get "treated" to an unnecessary card-flinging scene that just ends up being silly and five minutes too long.Does a good ending make up for a meandering 90 minutes? I guess it might if those 90 minutes are pertinent to the climax. And in this case, they are. But things may be a little too intricate to be cherished in the long run (something untrue for the first film). Maybe it deserves another watch. Maybe then will things be more clear. Because even after it's all explained to us, things wind up being overly complicated, but I guess you just have to trust that it all makes sense. If you're okay living like that.Twizard Rating: 73</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Now You See Me few years ago was quite enjoyable movie and I was hoping that this would be too. I was wrong. Even it is quite entertaining, it won't surprise me enough. There are too less magic and too much trying. Movie is too long and there are not simply enough magic in it. If you do magic tricks in front of live audience, this might be enough, but not in a movie. You simply expect something bigger. Now You See Me 2 i quite entertaining, but on the other hand it is quite empty. David Copperfield as an producer you would expect more. I have seen his magic show in live at Las Vegas and that was way better than this movie. It is not a bad movie, but somehow you just expect more. Best thin in this movie are great actors, but not even they can't save the hole movie. Unfortunately.</fullReview>

I do not usually write reviews but writing a negative review for this movie actually makes me feel better after what the movie did to me. I watched the first movie only hours before this one and that was much better/smarter/funnier than this one. The jokes in this movie are ridiculous and the plot does not make any sense. So many things that you look at do not make any sense for a normal human being to digest. There are many scenes that it looks like they were trying too hard to be entertaining or funny. On top of the the acting is TERRIBLE. The script is TERRIBLE. There are many point when actors even look directly at the camera, loss of continuity in scenes. It was as if the director was too lazy to record extra takes for badly shot scenes. I was bored for the first 3/4 of the movie. The ending is slightly more energetic but can do nothing to save this movie from being an utter disaster.</fullReview>

The entire team of actors and actresses in the movie brought a certain kind of presence to the screen with each scene. The film continued with their trend of unexpected twists that few may expect and I continued to love just as much as the first film. As I sat there at the end of the film. I was attempting to figure out which one I liked more and to be honest, I can not really pick one. I do have a minor issue where in the middle of the film, I had a brief moment of being bored which I did not experience in the first film but as soon as the magic tricks and acts begun again, I was instantly back into the groove of being entertained. 'Now You See Me 2' is a frequent wave entertainment. Perfectly meshed together with film and stage magic.

Written probably by a 5 year old it started stupid and by the time it got to the FBI running around London with guns ordering the British police about it had fallen over the precipice of utter b#llocks never to be seen again as anything worthwhile.Rich men hire absolute idiots to look after their security allowing a bunch of so called magicians to magic and hypnotise their way across the globe. The US prison system allows someone to walk in and walk out with a criminal using an FBI ID stolen from another agent. Then Harry Potter turns up and makes the Horsemen steal a chip from a secure facility manned by complete buffoons.Harry seemed under the impression being rich means he can just order a plane into the air anytime he likes without any notice from flight controllers. And firing guns in the street would not attract any attention. And Harry must have never been on a plane before or else he would have noticed it had not taken off even with some shaking and a bit of fake rain.But of course everything was an illusion and all ended well with the FBI arresting the bad guys with their guns in a country they would not be allowed in with those guns let alone take a leading role in any arrest.Meanwhile London bayed like a bunch of cackling chimps at the brilliance of the Horsemen and their improbable plot. The less said about the Morgan Freeman Bruce banner bonding at the end the better.Are Americans really that stupid? Sadly #3 has been announced and who knows what japes these magic folk will get up to.A good example at why films with numbers after them should be burned before release.</fullReview>

Not to mention the twists &amp; cleverness about the film which made the first one also great! The acting &amp; plotting was pretty good too! Their were some parts which got me a bit lost but weren't really confusing as the film itself was like a magic trick as a whole designed to make you think the opposite while working out how they done the tricks too!I'd say it's slightly more fun &amp; creative than the first but couldn't pan the first as it was also great &amp; well put together as well! This film see the return of Morgan Freeman which was good as I was wondering what the film was going to entail with him in it as he was arrested at the end of the first film. This sequel carry's on the story but with several revelations &amp; twists that we thought otherwise in the predecessor. It was clever how it all worked out &amp; how the film pulled off some tricks I never saw coming!The end finale was probably the biggest part I loved about this film! It was just truly epicness just like what I felt with the first Now You See Me! I won't spoil it as it got me first time round!This is a really underrated film with great twists &amp; turns you'll never see coming &amp; the great ending to the film in which you'll be blown away by!I overall enjoyed this sequel &amp; thought it was worth the wait!

Sadly, it fell very short of what it should've carried on.There were some wonderful fighting scenes throughout the movie, in fact more action than the predecessor. There was also more humor to the movie, thanks to the introduction of Lizzy Caplan and the terrific acting by Woody Harrison.Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Dave Franco did a job which was as good as the first part, and definitely was enjoyable. The acting was so good that the audience, and especially me, did not miss Isla Fisher one bit.The horrible disappoint was the awful display of Daniel Radcliffe and Michael Caine. The roles they played definitely did not suit them AT ALL. Throughout the movie there was one scene which amazed me and the audience, otherwise the movie was just awful display of it predecessor.

		<fullReview>It's contain bigger and near-impossible magic than the first movie. The casts are well-known, and the film's visual effects &amp; humor was amazing and fresh. I surprised by the director, Mr. Jon M. Chu, in his mind and work to make this great film. The story was told in unique ways and I amazed by the tricks they're used to, the characters are complete each other, and I was speechless by the last trick, what I think is completely different, amazing!. I though this is the best film I saw in the last 6 months, and I hope there will be a sequel, or a prequel about The Four Horsemen's backgrounds. Sorry for bad English, and thanks Now You See Me 2, for entertaining me:D, Bye!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing Now You See Me (2013) several times a couple years back while on an international flight. I certainly enjoyed it, but didn't think it to be one of my favorite movies of all time.NYSM2, however, is even more well done and absolutely enrapturing. I saw it twice, and I have to say, the second time was even better than the first. Although visual effects (added in post) are certainly used in the film, the many feats of "magic" are most definitely real. It was wonderful seeing a film with such attention to detail and sleight of hand. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've seen this year-simply for the writing and plots in the movie. Obviously we have had more visually appealing movies and superhero movies, but this ones unique. Its a fantastic spin and continuation from the first part and couldn't have been better. Great acting by the horsemen but not sure why the girl was substituted--actually the girl lost out and not the movie. All characters were fantastic and so was the setting starting with Macau. I don't think anyone could have predicted the outstanding twist at the end -- I for one, thought they would show Lionel Shrike alive and well which could have been an alternately intriguing end. I've heard critics claim there could have been more emphasis on magic than plots and I don't disagree with them had the directors thought of lengthening the film, but am satisfied completely. If it were up to me, I would've had every human being see this film once and decide for themselves.</fullReview>

It had all the good characters in, Lex Luthor, the Hulk, Haymitch Abernathy, Alfred, God and even Harry Potter.The movie had a good plot and it was a really fun movie to watch, the acting was good. I mean this is totally Jesse Eisenberg movie, rather than the other one he completely Butchered. *Cough* BVS.The effects were good and it did a good job at keeping me entertained. The Villain of this movie however was not so good. The acting was alright, but it did nothing to make me feel like he's a legitimate threat. Also the plot twist were a bit predictable, you kinda knew that the 4 Horsemen would be ahead of the villain for the most part.All in all though, it was a pretty good movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of the first Now You See Ms (2013) with its great surprise ending. The combination of magic tricks mixed with crime always intrigued me,can't you'll get it all here with this sequel. I went to see this today with my sister and it was great. The plot was just as smart and suspenseful, the acting was great, and the graphics - especially the scene with the rain - were mesmerizing. The Four Horsemen deliver a whole new level of magic tricks, deception, and fun. Lots of crime and action in this sequel. It's just as great as its original and fills in a lot of missing info. Definitely go see it! I give it 10 stars for its cleverness, suspense, great action scenes, and overall an epic ride with The Four Horsemen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot holes are so large that the entirety of the Thames could be poured into them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After successfully executing their heist of millions from corrupt businessman Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the "Four Horsemen" magicians go into hiding to evade capture. But laying low for a year doesn't sit well with headstrong Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), who ignores leader Dylan Rhodes' (Mark Ruffalo) assertions to remain patient. Instead, he secretly contacts the Eye, the mythical organization that cryptically controls the band of thieves.Shortly thereafter, Rhodes gathers the Horsemen together for their next assignment and to introduce them to new recruit Lula May (Lizzy Kaplan). When their plot to expose unethical communications company Octa goes awry, resulting in the Horsemen's identities being revealed to the world, they become ensnared in a trap devised by ruthless tech genius Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe). Forced to steal a computer chip from Mabry's longtime rival, Atlas, May, Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) must outwit both hunter and prey, all while staying one step ahead of the FBI agent (Sanaa Lathan) hot on their trail and the scheming magic-debunker, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), hellbent on revenge.Revisiting the perilous underworld of magicians sounds like an antonymous event - and it most certainly is. Still teetering on the ludicrous brink of a 007 adventure filled with the sarcastic jokers of "Ocean's Eleven," this crew of heisters more closely resembles special forces soldiers or secretive government agents than amateur stage magicians, even if they call themselves "Elite Magic Society" members. With a plot of "Mission: Impossible"-styled infiltration and theft, there's really no room for magicians at all. And, once again, it seems that all aspiring illusionists want to be like Robin Hood. What ever happened to doing magic tricks for the sake of entertainment? A vengeful, villainous discreditor takes the place of a James Bond supervillain, while the FBI - and any other form of law enforcement - is so meaningless that it's easy to forget their purpose every quarter-hour when they briefly rear their heads. At the same time, there isn't enough written into the story to require one-to-two Horsemen, let alone the four-to-five that actually frequent the picture, or the bevy of whiny evildoers who attempt to manipulate the protagonists like puppets. And this doesn't even take into account the actual culprit behind the figurehead villain, or the ringleader prestidigitator behind all the human pawns ushered about on a global chessboard - or Woody Harrelson's dual role as a twin, which has to be one of the most unnecessary gimmicks ever employed.Once again, the biggest problem with this film is the depiction of magic. Every trick is not simple sleight-of-hand or misdirection, but rather outrageously over-complicated feats of absurdity - so extreme that only computer-generated imagery can be used to represent them. Since movie-making itself is something of a deception, this dependence on utterly unbelievable cheats of matter and energy - which could have been possible through editing techniques alone - only dulls the sense of wonderment. None of the illusions performed are even remotely engaging, especially considering that after each one is demonstrated, a flashback has to rudely interrupt the action to explain how it was orchestrated. Certainly, none of it is inspirational. Like "The Game" (1997), a constant dubiousness presides over every endeavor, introducing perpetual doubt as to the truthfulness of the storytelling. By the end, viewers will wish it was all just a big dream sequence.If it weren't bad enough that all of the phantasms were designed specifically to make the audience feel stupid, the characters appear to be scripted to be deliberately annoying, as if to provoke further agitation. Everyone is overly confident - or they sit in the background, silently being smarter than everyone else. Repartee and flirtation hope to distract the audience from the unoriginality of the various missions, each involving time, training, and resources that couldn't possibly be available.And, most distressing of all, are the plot holes (or elements of laziness), which are so large and numerous that the entirety of the Thames could be poured into them. Language barriers and deadly weapons never present problems; the Horsemen are acknowledged and welcomed in every country as if universal celebrities, despite the fact that they're wanted criminals who have been in hiding for a year (even in specialized product launch events they're applauded as if superheroes crashing a party); geographical inconsistencies and the passing of time are completely ignored; the planning and coordination of various ruses are conducted mostly off-screen, as if in an alternate universe where nothing can interfere with them; hypnotization is conjured up continuously with total effectiveness, as if Jedi Masters were commanding the weak-minded; and characters survive daring ordeals that would normally require diving equipment or Olympic training or animal wranglers or, at the very least, plenty of implanted assistants ready to feign shock or surprise (at one point, a random street-crowd onlooker has a pigeon fly out of his pants). For a movie all about precise plotting and skillful swindles, it sure is sloppy.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

All of the tricks really got me and long after the movie my boyfriend and I still were talking about what we thought about every trick in the movie. Honestly, go watch it for yourself. I don't understand where the bad ratings are coming from. It is surprising, it is exciting, and it is enthralling. it is everything I could have wished for in a second movie for Now You See Me and I am very excited to see what the third one holds.

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the first film you can't not enjoy this one, the direction is excellent; the acting is superb; the graphics are outstanding; the plot line is ingenious and tight and via science, logic and a hefty amount of money all the tricks performed are very much possible, if put together correctly. Also I think it was a great decision to replace Isla Fisher with Lizzy Caplan as I think she brings more to the role and that extra piece of comedy to the film that seemed to be missing in the previous film. Therefore, I think if you did not enjoy the first now you see me, you shouldn't even bother watching this as it'll be a waste of your time. However, if like me you enjoyed the first film then definitely go and see this movie because you will very highly likely enjoy this movie as much if not, like me, even more. I genuinely believe this is better than the first and is one of the best films I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Now You See Me 2", starring Jesse Eisenberg-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, Zombieland; Mark Ruffalo-The Hulk in the Avengers movies, Windtalkers; Woody Harrelson-The Hunger Games movies, Zombieland; Dave Franco-The Neighbors movies, Warm Bodies; Lizzy Caplin- Masters of Sex_tv, 127 Hours and Daniel Radcliffe-Trainwreck, The Woman in Black.This is a sequel to the 2013 surprise hit. Seems like whenever a movie makes money nowadays, they will make a sequel-it's easier than coming up with original ideas, plus people like the familiar. Anyway, the Four Horsemen return with one substitution, Lizzy for Isla Fisher-I think I heard that Isla was pregnant and could not make it. Plot wise; Jesse, Mark, Woody and Dave have been in hiding, since the last movie, and are drawn out by a wealthy, want-a-be magician, Daniel. Daniel wants them to pull off a heist and threatens them if they refuse. There are the elaborate tricks, misdirection and smoke &amp; mirrors magical spectacles that made the first movie popular and there is even an evil twin of one of the characters thrown in the mix-he plays both parts. FYI: I also heard that they are already talking about a third sequel. If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one, too. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 9 minutes. I liked the first one and I would probably buy this one on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let me start by mentioning I thought the first one was good, different,less predictable especially liked how some of the tricks were explained but "The Second Act" well make it too much.I mean this isn't supposed to be a movie on fantasy. It's supposed to be real life magicians. I think the movie was too busy trying to show fancy tricks. An example is the part where they were searched they could all have hidden the card rather than throwing it around. It had some good moments too but overall predictable and average. Not bad, okay. I like magic very much, The Prestige is still one of my favourite movies so I didn't mind the mediocrities in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . where in the world are Ron and Hermione?! As retired Boy Wizard Daniel Radcliffe roams the planet from Macau to London in search of a credible plot for NOW YOU SEE ME 2, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are nowhere in sight. Instead, Harry Potter faces off against such "B-movie" Gary Busey or Eric Roberts Wannabes as Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Mark Ruffalo. Jesse Eisenberg continues his slide down toward their level as he apparently lacks the SOCIAL NETWORKING skills necessary to latch onto projects that can at least keep movie audiences alert for two hours (even if the film lacks prestige--I had to nudge my seat mate awake a couple of times during SEE ME 2 when her snoring became a distraction from what little was happening on-screen). Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are as happy to provide window dressing for a BATMAN offering as a penguin march, but their presence alone in limited roles is not always worth the price of admission. Join me in pledging NOW WE WON'T SEE YOU AGAIN unless they at least toss Ron and Hermione into the mix for the trilogy's climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flash, Bang Boom: This Movie is Stunts, Comedy, and Tricks. Not so Much On Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robbie K back again, and this time with the third review of the week. This installment focuses on yet another sequel to grace the silver screen and one I never expected, or wanted, to come. My review is on Now You See Me 2, as you can guess from my posting, an attempt to follow up on the successful thriller from 2013. But can this film follow a truly great act? Or is this merely another money making scheme whose name overshadows the quality. Let's get to the review to find out. If you remember the first movie, it was a crime/thriller with an underlying mystery that came to a well-concluded end. Natural, come up with an even more intriguing mystery and throw in a little vengeance on top of that. Now You See Me 2 takes place merely a year after the last installment and focuses on uncovering the mystery of the Eye, the organization that recruited our "heroes" in the first installment, who may have set them up for failure. The plot is certainly intriguing, and the team manages to throw those famous curve balls we saw in the first film. While the mystery isn't quite as good as the first one, and the thrills are a bit stale, it makes for an intriguing story nonetheless. My mind was constantly trying to decipher how deep the rabbit hole went and just who was in cahoots when it came to dismantling the team. In addition, they added some of the character development that the last installment lacked, some of which was good and some of which was cornier than a corn maze at a harvest festival. Outside of the mystery, the vengeance part is so-so in terms of quality. Multiple people have a vendetta against our crew and they go through extraordinary lengths to get it done. However, one of the new characters Walter (Daniel Radcliffe) was not the villain to do so and was more annoying than menacing. Regardless the plot against them wasn't as suspenseful and a mediocre attempt to try and keep you on your seats as if there were harm to your characters. I applaud them at the good attempt, and appreciate the somewhat emotional twist at the end (which made some of the events in the first movie irrelevant), the vengeance plot was merely a scaffolding for impressive stunts. But it's the stunts and magic that really draw the eye in this film. Like the last installment, number 2 has plenty of convoluted plans that show some serious imagination and cleverness. Fans will be pulled into the confusion of how the gang ended up where they were, only to be wowed by the thorough explanation of how the trick was pulled off. When you pull in the fantastic use of CGI, the stunts only get more impressive as our magicians disappear in ways you only dream about. But again the realistic factor sometimes gets drowned out when a convenient opening appears for our group to take (e.g. a box magically collapsing, a trap door in the middle of a crowded street, or a mirror suddenly appearing). These moments are again cool, but a bit eye rolling when they wrap it up with one sentence, which boils down to "we wanted something cool, but we could only do it sloppily." Overall though, these stunts prove imagination is not dead, and that originality can come in the simplest forms. In terms of the casting this is another major strength of the movie. Eisenberg reprises his role as Atlas who still has the chip on his shoulder and ego issues. The snarky comments are fun and funny, but for once I felt it was a bit diluted compared to some of his other roles. Woody Harrelson as the hypnotist was a grand addition and provided some of the funniest moments on the screen with his banter and dialogue. The jokes get a bit tired, but all in all his role in this film has greatly improved. Dave Franco took a bigger role in this one, bringing humor, looks, and a charming story that I really enjoyed. And Mark Ruffalo, well a little sappier and less humor, but it works on a different level than his original character. As for newcomer Lula (Lizzy Caplan) at first she was annoying and too over acted (an attempt at using the shallow comedy for laughs), but then she grew on me and started becoming a much more integral cog into the mix. As for Radcliffe, the actor is still solid in his abilities, but the direction of his character was more whiny brat than anything else and somewhat of a waste of his talents (think Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 movie). Despite the flaws though, the cast really supports one another and makes for an entertaining team. Overall Now You See Me 2 is a fun, entertaining sequel that I enjoyed. The stunts are exciting, the plans convoluted, and the acting is top notch on most grounds. While the story isn't quite as thrilling, and there are components that didn't work for me, it still outshines most of the stuff that hits the theaters these days. I recommend a theater visit for this one as well, but you'll probably get the most out of your money if you rent in about three months. Regardless, enjoy the show and may it be as entertaining to you as it was for me. My scores: Action/Comedy/Thriller: 8 Movie Overall: 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as magical as the first but it was a fun movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first movie was a surprise how good it was, but was it good enough to produce a squeal? How many movies actual are?Now You See Me 2 takes the magic from the original and milks it for all it's got. The biggest draw to this film is still the amazing cast. I think what made the first film work so well is that they got a group of people who seem to be having fun with one another and had some really good chemistry, so the chemistry returns as it's basically the exact same chemistry with a few new addictions.One of the biggest new attractions was Daniel Radcliffe, but to be honest I did not think he was all that worth spending your money on. He really did not bring anything cool to the mix, unlike Lizzy Caplin who replaced Isla Fisher and was able to fit right into the cast while equally being it's break out star. If you like the first movie because it was about magic, Now You See Me 2 was more about magicians trying to be like superheroes, but considering much of the cast appeared in some pretty big superhero movies, it's not surprising. It's a pretty straight forward sequel that is pretty fun to watch, but will vanish from your memory as soon as it's done.</fullReview>

I just predicted it when I found that his body never be founded. The odd one was the scene where little Dylan watched the show of his father's trick was the different scene with the oldest one from NYSM 1 where the child was just got a watch from his old gray-haired father in a room.

		<shortDescription>A very good sequel full of twists and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magic movies are fun. They are responsible for some of my favourite movies of all time. 'The Prestige', 'The Illusionist' and the original 'Now You See Me' all come instantly to mind, and now I can add 'Now You See Me 2' to that list, because it is a very impressive sequel. The series has a very similar feel to the 'Ocean's Eleven' trilogy, and we all know how the second installment of that series turned - not well. They made the mistake of making things too complicated for the average movie-goer to understand and just sit back and enjoy. 'Now You See Me 2' does a great job of keeping things intricate and twisted, while always keeping the audience in on the joke (and trick). There's the return of all the main stars (minus Isla Fisher who couldn't return due to her pregnancy) and the inclusion of some new ones who fit in seamlessly. In fact, I thought Lizzy Caplan was even more suited to the role of a magician than Fisher was, she did an excellent job as the newest Horseman. Daniel Radcliffe (yes the same one who found fame in another certain magic themed series) also joins the cast. His acting always comes across quite clunky to me, and I felt his performance worked more due to his star-power than actual acting chops.All the fun from the original is there. Everything you think you know, you should reconsider. There are twists and turns around every corner and the 129 minute run time flies by. Is there enough here for a third installment? I see no reason why not. The world of magic leads to infinite possibilities, and this cast is strong enough to carry a story and keep things fresh and fun. Personally I hope they do return again based on this fine effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really great movie but it definitely lacked the flair that the first one had. The magic tricks were great but it kind of sucked how they explained the magic tricks. Woody Harrelson is one of my favourite actors but for some odd reason he played two characters in this film. Jesse Eisenberg also plays a great character and performs some good tricks. Dave Franco's character is just awesome and I must admit that I have been practicing throwing cards at different targets. Daniel Radcliffe plays the villain in this movie which was unexpected but he seriously needs to lose the beard. My God Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are good actors and I was actually pretty surprised when Morgan Freeman turned out to be the good guy at the end. Lizzy Caplan was a good replacement for Isla FIsher and managed to pull off some very humorous scenes. All in all this was a great movie but lacked the tricks that were in the first movie.</fullReview>

(Kinda reminds me of Avengers vs Age of Ultron, everyone still loved the 2nd one anyway) Even though the 2nd movie have changed its style (instead of doing magic performances for revenge), I think it's going towards a better direction, like the fast&amp;furious sequel. Lots of magic tricks, lots of mind blowing scenes, actions, and funny AF. Jay Chou was a great addition to be added into the film crew. I'm glad that I was able to get invited to watch a pre-screening of this movie. I certainly hope that there's a NYSM 3 that's coming in a few years. Magicians really deserve some serious credit, with the amount of work they are putting into every magic trick they do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic tricks were damn cool but the story was sloppy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was pretty fun and worth watching, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were amazing, but the plot really needed to be polished, the motivations were just abrupt. The narrative structure of this one was pretty similar to the last one but only sloppier. If I could I would give this film a 7.5, but since there was no such option and it really couldn't hit 8... Anyway it was still a cool film. Jesse Eisenberg was cool as hell. I'm totally willing to watch the film again just for him, and of course Woody Harrelson. Other supporting roles were also good and the magic tricks they showed were just brilliant and tremendously interesting. Although the ending was fallacious, I liked and enjoyed the film in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable Magic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sequel to the 2013 surprise hit Now You See Me. This movie brings back Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and replaces Isla Fisher with Lizzy Caplan which in this movie makes sense and works well for what they are given.This movie takes place about a year and a half after the first movie ended, the horsemen have been in hiding since then. Because of that they have become bored and want to get back into the limelight and showoff their magical abilities. However in doing so they are caught by Daniel Radcliffe's Walter and forced to commit some more magical heist but instead for the wrong reasons.When this movie started I was worried that it would be a rehash of the first film, the horsemen use their magic to bring down a big corporation but as the movie continues the story takes a turn for the better and introduces the new characters and ideas.When it comes to the performances Mark Ruffalo is great in whatever movie he is in, Dave Franco did the best with what he was given, Daniel Radcliffe showed some range playing a villain and Woody Harrleson is one of the funniest actors currently working.The only negatives for this film is that it is a slight downfall from the first movie because the first was such a unique experience and seeing it a second time will never be as impressive. Jesse Eisenberg plays his same kind of character, egotistical maniac. Most of the moments that didn't revolve around the magic and illusion where a little slow and Woody Harrleson for some reason plays two characters in this movie, which at time felt very strange and a little unneeded.Overall this is an enjoyable magic heist movie with some funny moments, good acting, a great cast and one of the best heist moments involving a playing card. Overall I recommend this, especially if you enjoyed the first one or enjoy fun movies.To see this review in video form check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucKbeDVB6mo</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Ridiculous that it's fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now You See Me 2 is a direct sequel from Now You See Me in 2013 which is a decent hit but not that much of a popular the only reason this sequel get made is probably because studio got a lot of profits in the first film but whatever let's critique about the film itself.Now You See Me 2 overall is a step-down from the first one especially in it's story and direction part, not only that the story, characters and conflict so mediocre and not told very well but they try to hide it with these magic stuff thing.I have to admitted Now You See Me 2 is a lot of fun but not because it's good but because how ridiculous and over the top it is, all of these magician stuff is so ridiculous and not in the smart way, it basically try to surprise you with these lame plot twisted and turn which is not working at all since you can pretty much guess what's going to happen from a mile away ,even all of those magic trick reveal it's just so bad that you can't help but laughing .Now You See Me 2 is not a bad movie but magic that can be predicted from a mile away is not magic at all even if the magician trying so hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Video Review for Now You See Me 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a huge fan of the first Now you see me and I'm still not that big of a fan of this one. Now you see me, both movies, they've always annoyed off, because they manage to do all this magic in the movie, which by the way none of it makes sense, and they miss this perfect opportunity in filming. To do actual magic tricks that could be done in real life. It would be so interesting to see that in a movie but instead we get a cgi fest of outrageous, ridiculous, stupid "magic" they do, and no tension is involved because they basically have super powers. I am not the best at typing. So if you'd rather just see my video review which I go into way more deeper detail with why I don't like this movie then the link is down below. My Channel is called virtual Tyler and I constantly do game and movie reviews.
