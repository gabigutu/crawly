		<shortDescription>What a movie should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is a starkly simple story well told. It is the journey of a man who seeks to re-make himself. Johnson becomes disillusioned, like Thoreau and even Ulysses S. Grant, by the Mexican War and deserts to become a mountain man. There he finds the Rockies starkly beautiful and completely without mercy for him or anyone else. Will Geer plays the older trapper who teaches the 'Pilgrim,' a very solid performance by Redford, how to survive. The film's treatments of Whites and Native Americans is profoundly even handed, and Milious's fingerprints are noteworthy in the robust and calculated course of the narrative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Father and Son Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies and evokes so much emotion from my childhood. My father and I have watched this movie at least 10 times together and it never gets boring. It reminds me of my days when we used to go on hikes in the woods and we would sing the theme song with me in my little coonskin (it's fake for all you animal lovers) cap. I just cannot get enough of this movie. It grows on my every time I watch it. It is one of if not the best Robert Redford movie ever. He does a fantastic job in this movie. The scenery is beautiful and makes me wish I was there in that unspoiled area. The dialogue, though there is very little compared to other movies, is brilliant. The old adage quality not quantity fits this movie to a tee. There are numerous one liners that have been incorporated into my everday vocabulary. "You cook good rabbit pilgrim." "....the Rocky Mountains are the marrow of the world..." "Watch your top notch." "Watch Yur'n." I could go on and on. Each character is colorful in it's own distinct way, making even the most insignificant ones unforgettable. The theme music is both haunting and beautiful and I've been looking to buy or download the soundtrack so if anyone knows where I could send me an e-mail. Not only does this movie have great characters,acting, dialogue, music, and scenery, but it also is filled with action and has several interjections of humor. I feel as though this is one of the greatest movies of all time and the special moments you share with your family watching it, just make this movie even better. (A 9/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Redford's two or three best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film which is glibly categorized as a `western' but goes somewhat deeper than that. The Pollack/Redford combination works well, and the photography of those magnificent mountains of Utah is spectacular. With all that beautiful scenery in Montana, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, I am surprised that the US government never does very much for saving it and cleaning up all that contamination ??.. Thirty years on and after several viewings, I find this story grows on you, like the aging of fine wine in oak casks, such that another recent viewing gave me as much ? if not more ? pleasure. Precisely because it is not the standard `western' formula. One gets a little tired of John Wayne getting saddle-sore, killing indians and wooing women; at times watching `Jeremiah Johnson' I cannot help comparing a little with `Dances with Wolves' (qv), not because of any story similarity but more from certain situations being played out. Robert Redford has given us numerous films in which his characterization is pretty good in general, but in this film I rather fancy he was inspired, even to the point of throwing off that silly category so beloved of those suffering Hollywooditis. Most notable in `The Sting' (qv), `All the President's Men', `Out of Africa', and `A River Runs Through it', without forgetting his excellent directing of `Ordinary People', one of the best true-life dramas I have seen. `Jeremiah Johnson' is now one of the classics of the genre and even of cinema as a whole: always worth another viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broken humans learning to be whole again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney Pollack's return to the western four years after THE SCALPHUNTERS was to be a completely different experience. Following the trials and tribulations of a deserter of the Mexican War who disappears in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to become a mountain man, JEREMIAH JOHNSON eschews the conventions of the western as a genre in such a way as was only made possible for American cinema in the tumultuous era of early 70's with such visceral movies of frontier survival as MAN IN THE WILDERNESS and A MAN CALLED HORSE paving the way. As Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) wanders the mountains like a fugitive stricken by disaster, a solitary figure against awe-inspiring backdrops of massive rock formations, steep ravines and expansive mesas, you can tangibly feel the film, like the hero, transcending the specific time and place and breaching out vision to become an all-encompassing spiritual journey where the individual characters - fur trappers, bear hunters or Indians - are merely the unwitting parners in a dance of death.Some viewers may be put off by the lack of straight-forward plot, the episodic, repetitive nature of the movie or the long stretches of silence, but it's from those exact things the movie takes its power. JJ comes unto its own in those small moments of quietude, in Johnson's silent encounters with indians, in the barren, unforgiving wastes of the craggy mountains that reflect so well the psychology of characters wandering in their shadow, in the subtle, heartwarming interactions Johnson has with the Indian woman he's taken for a wife and the mute boy he's taken for a son. There's hardly a word uttered between this peculiar family the entire movie but the ways they learn to overcome the barriers that separate them is a touching sight to behold.There is some dated montage, a corny soundtrack; how much of this will affect your enjoyment will boil down to your affinity with how cinema was in the 70's. Still, what is left is this beautiful parable of broken humans learning to be whole again. Equal parts visceral, savage and heartwarming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In shooting his character as a solitary figure against a field of white, Pollack turned Johnson into something bordering on a spiritual experience?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in the snow-covered vastness of the Utah Rocky Mountains, Robert Redford plays well a deserter from the Mexican War who wages a bitter struggle against the elements and Indians in order to lead a life of solitude? He heads into the mountains, only to find that there is the wind that never seems to stop? Sometimes he swears he is going insane while the storms that he has never seen screech booming with their thunder? Around him, snow squalls that kill everything that is unprepared? Jeremiah's first winter proves almost fatal because of his inexperience in coping with the harsh Rockies? Fortunately, he meets a real mountain man seasoned to the ways of the wild? Bear Claw takes Johnson in and shares his knowledge with him? Travelling the untamed wilderness, Jeremiah finds out that it is a land fit only for the savages, and he has seen what they are like? But he has seen worse when he happens upon an Indian massacre of a settler's family or upon a bald man buried to his neck in sand by Blackfeet Indians? And much worse after violating the Crow sacred burial ground while helping cavalry men find some lost settlers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liver Eatin' Johnson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always considered this one of my favorite "rainy Saturdayafternoon" movies. The scenery is wonderful, Redford does one of hisbest performances, the characters are colorful, and it is a wonderfulstory of the pioneer spirit. Then, a few years ago, a good friend told me he had the book about thereal "Liver Eatin' Johnson", about whom this movie was made. He lentme the book to read - and I highly recommend it for anyone interestedin a first- and second-hand story of the old west. The real story of Johnson is greatly removed from the movie, thoughthere are many parts in common as well. Most notably absent is thefact that Johnson would remove and partially eat the liver (raw) of theCrow braves he would kill. This was done by Johnson to scare the Crow,who believed their soul would wander the earth forever if the body wasnot buried intact. Johnson was also known to have eaten meat from theleg of a Blackfoot indian, whose tribe had captured him to sell to theCrow. This incident, however, appears to have been more for survival,as Johnson had to travel for several days through snow on foot afterescaping the Blackfoot. Johnson was a well traveled man, friend to more than the moviesuggests, and finally died of old age in Los Angeles in 1899. Hisactual age is subject to dispute, but he was at least 75 yeard old. During his long life, he met up with many recognizable characters fromthe old west. I leave the names for you to discover in your reading -it is well worth the time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" You've done well to Keep your hair, when so many's after it "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films which personify the era of the Mountain Man. This is perhaps one of the best. The reason why it is at the top of the list, is due in part to director Sydney Pollack's selection of natural wonders, majestic scenery and simplistic storyline. The movie tells the story of Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) a veteran of the Mexican American war who decides to journey into the High Alpine Rockies to become a Mountain Man. Based very loosely on the novel by Vardis Fisher, the hero seeks the life of a trapper which offers Solace, wild adventure, aboriginal encounters and a chance for legendary exploits. During the first years of his experience, Johnson is befriended and threatened by both Native Americans and crazed mountain veterans who teach him and endanger him as well. Among the best is 'Bear Claw, Chris Lapp' (Will Geer), 'Paints His Shirt Red' (Joaquin Martinez) and Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch). (Delle Bolton) plays Swan and Josh Albee) is Caleb who become part of an instant family. The film is quite picturesque in its beautiful seasonal settings and entertaining to anyone seeking a chapter in the bygone era of a vanished breed. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To connect with nature and find your place in the world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is unlike most films of its kind, which is a subgenre of the adventure film that follows a lone mountain man disillusioned by society who escapes to the frontier in order to become one with nature and reinvigorate himself. Strange how women never do this. Anyways, Robert Redford is surprisingly effective as the quiet, tough and determined title character who remains focused on his ultimate goal of remaining aloof and alone from all connections to anyone.Unfortunately, he is bamboozled into a most peculiar family situation involving a mute son of a crazy pioneer woman and the daughter of a French-speaking Native American chief. In the end, what director Sydney Pollack is all about is showcasing how nature can indeed salve some of our pain and make us feel more comfortable with our situations. Nevertheless, true relationships with people cannot be substituted. Beautiful photography, strong performances and a most intriguing storyline all help create a very interesting film that is worth multiple views and considerable think time.</fullReview>

When he trespasses holy land is continuously pursued by Indians and vice versa, because he seeks vengeance , going on a relentless chase. Meanwhile the Indians attack his farm. Crow Indians set out to track down the mountain man on savage raids until an inconclusive final .Solid western with interesting events , violent fights , emotions , thrills and spectacular outdoors . From the initiation until the final are proceeded continuous battles against nature and a survival fighting versus wintry wilderness , enemy trappers and savage Indians, among others . The story is a crossover of various films, the battle against nature of ¨Man of a wilderness land¨ and Indians as ¨ Man called horse ¨ and the obstinacy and stubbornness of relentless enemies who fight with no rest such as ¨The duelists¨. The magnificent cast is starred by an excellent Robert Redford , a simple man who has no taste for cities and becomes a tough and two fisted mountain man obsessed a bloody revenge . Supporting cast is featured by various actors in brief performances as Jack Colvin , Matt Clark , Charles Tyner and special mention to Will Geer as feisty old trapper . Splendid cinematography in Panavision and glimmer Technicolor by Duke Callagham as is reflected on spectacular outdoors filmed in sighting, rousing natural parks from Rocky Mountains. Lively and evocative musical score by usual secondary actor John Rubinstein and beautiful songs by also actor Tim McIntire . The motion picture is stunningly directed by the recently deceased Sidney Pollack (Yazuka, Three days of the condor, Way we were, Out of Africa). Rating : Better than average . This outstanding film will appeal to Robert Redford fans and landscape lovers .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is made in the mold of what movies should be. In an era of blockbusters and CGI graphics it's nice to see a movie that gets back to basics. Jeremiah is an ex army man who moves to the Rockies to start over. He starts out as a novice in the ways of the woods. With the help of Will Geer (Grandpa Walton) Jeremiah forges himself a place in the wild. The ending is kind of sad but I won't go into any details. This movie doesn't go into great detail about his subsequent rampage on the local Indian population. But if I wanted a documentary then I would watch the history channel. Anyway Jeremiah Johnson is a great movie to watch on a cold night when the wind is blowing and it's good to be inside. For a good adventure Jeremiah Johnson is one to watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film with deep insight into human interactions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally discovered Jeremiah Johnson while on IMDb (go figure) while browsing the westerns. I have seen many westerns in my time, and a good few were generic or shallow, but Jeremiah Johnson looked like a unique film to me, so I rented it. I was not disappointed. Jeremiah Johnson is more than a western, it quite accurately and deeply depicts the mentality and desire to escape from society and the problems in our lives, while also portraying human interaction in a way I found touching. With each new person he meets, we see a new character interaction, with Bear Claw we see salvation and gratitude in Johnson, and the "family" he later has reveals companionship and deep affection even when it begins in odd and tense situations. Overall, we see reflected onto us how much meaning our interactions with others have, even though that meaning becomes lost in the jumble of our daily lives. Johnson also embodies the desire for humans escape their situation for something more peaceful. In Johnson we see ourselves, we see our desire to find something better, sometimes for solitude. In summary, the interactions between people and what it reveals about human nature is what makes Jeremiah Johnson a truly beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Nobility Of Crapping In The Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:As with all movies, return this to its indigenous zeitgeist and it will make much more sense to you. It is 1972, in America, millions of badly smelling, Counter culture hippies are walking away from society. Their existential withdrawal must be understood as an allegorical reflection seen in this movie. This putative nobility of walking away from society, crapping in the woods, running from a bear and living like a Neanderthal, now seems quite quaint, ergo, the low IMDb rating. To those of you thinking of watching it, I must warn you how incredibly boring the movie is. Frankly, as other great reviewers have pointed out, it is boring like you cannot imagine. Redford is laconic almost the entire movie before we get to the 'what a man I am show'. Other than his brief visits with Bear Claw, whose idea of hospitality is to lead a bear in to kill you, yes, remind me not to visit him; Redford wordlessly treks across landscapes. If you adore Norman Rockwell paintings, you might enjoy his dialog-free adventures, for me, I found them excruciatingly bad. The ordinary events of your everyday life have been distilled here, in the first half of this cure for sleeplessness, into occurrences clueless, overrated Pollack (3 Days Of The Boredom) thought were very fascinating to viewers. Shaving, bathing, chopping wood, building his log cabin: the thrills, the tension, better check your blood pressure, it is so enthralling. I haven't had this kind of fun since I trimmed my toenails, Bob, thanks so much! You may think, after his wife and son are killed, that the movie is going to pick up. No, see, suspense requires unknown outcomes in order to work. Now, show of hands, who thinks Bob is going to be killed by the one on one attacks of the Native Americans? I see many of you did not get the ending, yes, it can seem inscrutable; here is Garth's translation. How! Chief I have killed many of your men, now I can finally feel like a man. See, besides the painful contrivance of only one on one attacks, the ending is some kind of half ass gear validation for Bob. Evidently, there were strong feelings of effeminacy, deep under the surface, that necessitated killing a whole meeting hall full of natives to commensurately assuage them. The stupidity of showing the number of braves he had killed gives the movie its unshakably racist tone, that always is to be discovered beneath the surface of their patronizingly, progressive, condescending advocacy. Use the philosophers' old reliable inversion rule, imagine a movie with a Native American who killed thirty white men one on one, please? People would have laughed it out of the theater. Look at him, does he look like Stephen Segal to you? For those lucky few of you who haven't seen this turd-ball, the last half of the movie consists of an endless line of Native American braves fighting Bob to the death one on one. We are shown their many graves testifying to his incredible virility and potency: Good Heavens,"I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, I sleep all night and I work all day. I cut down trees, avenge my squaw and kill a hundred men," please, OK, we are going to freaking puke! Get some therapy! You don't have to be a Freudian to notice somebody is feeling a trifle unsure of their 'manliness.' As a narrative, I cannot overstress to you how coma inducing one brave at a time ad infinitum is; this is the last half of Pollock's movie. Then, right before the end comes the height of dramatic tension, he meets Bear Claw again. They eat a rabbit and discuss the weather. The movie ends with the aforementioned 'great gear validation moment' where he receives, from a real warrior, the validation that his damaged psyche requires for peace of mind. Truly, one of the most boring, narcissistic, neurotic, disturbing pieces of frozen poop ever made by the hand of man. Please, Bob, stop already with the 'what a man I am' show. BORING.

		<shortDescription>A thinking person's western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often, the images you see in American western films are all pretty much the same--cowboys, Indians, evil bosses trying to steal land from the little guy, gunfights in the streets and heroes who are practically invincible. Unfortunately, most of this is wrong--historically speaking. Most folks out west did NOT wear cowboy hats, the Indians were generally pretty peaceful and a gunfight....well, when they did occur, it usually was one guy shooting another in the back--never at 'high noon' in the main street. Because of all these inaccuracies, I love "Jeremiah Johnson"--a film that de-romanticizes the west and shows what life was really like in the early days of western expansion.The things I also love about this film are its slow pace, underplayed acting (aside from a memorable scene with Will Geer and a bear) and sense of beauty in the great outdoors. The bottom line is that this is a film for the thinking person--someone who is willing to see something other than shootouts and the like. Gorgeous, well directed and, at times, profoundly moving. See this film--it's one of Robert Redford's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film Which Speaks Volumes Without Much Dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A veteran (Robert Redford) of the Mexican War (1848) rejects society, where "It should have been different"; to become a mountain man. Unfortunately the economy of the mountain man era has ended in the late 1830's leaving the main character to wander the wilderness until he happens to meet a veteran mountain man (Will Geer), who teaches him the ways of the mountain man. The film explores the need that human beings have for human contact, in spite of whatever sense of isolation and alienation that society may expose them to. The film is also one of the first to portray Native Americans in a complex manner; revealing them to be something more than a white caricature. The film uses a powerful dialog, that while limited; is packed with deeper meanings that would be lost to many who watched the film. The limited dialog is carried by stunning scenery, which further serves to make a statement about loneliness and isolation. Add to this the bitter cold in which the main character is at constant battle with and the viewer will want to throw another log on the fire. The main character conducts a war of retribution against the Crow after they kill his Flathead wife and an orphan boy. In the end the outcome is left to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is directed by Sydney Pollack and is inspired by two books, Raymond Thorp and Robert Bunker's Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson and Vardis Fisher's Mountain Man. Script was written by John Millius and Edward Anhalt and cinematography is by Duke Callaghan. It stars Robert Redford, Will Geer, Stefan Gierasch, Delle Bolton and Josh Albee.Hardened after the war with Mexico, and fed up with everyday life, American Jeremiah Johnson (Redford) leaves civilisation behind to live life as a mountain man. He intends to be self-sufficient as a trapper, but he finds that mother nature can be tough, and out here in the mountain wilderness he is not alone. There are others here, and Jeremiah must face many challenges if he is to truly survive.Filmed entirely on location in the vast wilderness beauty of Utah, Jeremiah Johnson is light on plot but all the better for it. Film basically constitutes Redford's mountain man learning to survive up in them thar mountains, and, earning the right to do so. A number of issues will arise to test his metal, giving him a number of hardships and adventures to define his transformation from average Joe to a fully fledged mythical man of the Earth. Redford is wonderfully at ease in the title role, and very quickly he gets the audience on side to share in his journey. But ultimately it's the landscapes that you take away from this movie. Not only gorgeous, but also the critical character that frames Johnson during his isolation and battle for survival. 8/10</fullReview>

We also use some of the lines as sort of a private joke when we are with others. They never get it. When I want her to be quiet I will say as best I can the words Jeremiah uses to Swan when the solders are coming to the cabin.The music is haunting and the scenery is breathtaking. This movie is almost in a category to itself and I wonder if one like it could be made today. Although some of Redfords mannerisms in Horse Whisperer remind me of Jeremiah. The few things that I don't like is the obligatory bigoted minister and the reference to where they will go in the end.(Hell) Overall though simply one if not the best movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has ever spent time and gone hiking in a wilderness area, this is about as unpretentious movie as you can get. This beautifully photographed film shows how beautiful and rough life in the wilderness is. Some might consider this movie rather brutal and racist. The Native Americans were portrayed very roughly and the white man was seen as having to fight them for survival. However, I think that if you are getting too politically correct, you might miss a lot else to this movie. It was about how rough life truly is living in the mountains. Life for centuries before the Europeans came was rough and brutal. This movie actually is nice in-between of the overtly politically correct "Dances With Wolves" and the horribly sadistic and racist "Mountain Men" (a knockoff made later in the 70s with Charleston Heston). No one is portrayed too sensitively, because life was so rough in the mountains. Yet, there were great moments. For a time, Jeremiah Johnson finds himself happily married to a Native American woman and enjoying life. Then, tragedy of course strikes. The survivors of the mountains are stoic men, men of wisdom, and men who have learned a lot in life. This is the west that is forgotten. With all the beauty and romance of the Old West, it was also a very brutal and humbling life to all who experienced itself hardship, while seeking it's beauty and it's promises of freedom for the individual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic Utah locations and great cinematography enhance this off-beat, free-spirited and very seventies look into the rugged life of self-made mountain man Jeremiah Johnson and his experiences when he leaves civilization behind to become a trapper, sometime before or during the Mexican American War.In the title role, Robert Redford is good. However, the film is stolen from him by feisty bear hunter Will Geer and the eccentric, bald-headed Stefan Gierasch, as senior mountain men showing Johnson the ways of the wilderness.Interesting is it's depiction of Indians, in that it neither shows them as "red" savages or weak victims. At various times, they're portrayed as friendly, stern, and frightening.There's a lot of great detail in the muscular script co-written by John Milius and featuring many of his usual macho/romantic themes. One scene in particular (and one of my favorites) is reminiscent of his later work in Conan The Barbarian! Much like Conan, Jeremiah is on the verge of not making it in the wilderness when he receives a life-saving gift from a dead man. With Conan, it's his sword. Here, It's the gun Jeremiah Johnson uses to hunt his food and defend himself.The final act is fairly dark and a bit depressing, with little doubt that Johnson has changed a lot during the course of the movie. The film winds down excitedly but ends on an anti-climactic note.As a kid, this was one of the first films (and the first western film) I ever saw on videocassette and it was unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frontier Saga Drowsy But Authentic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jeremiah Johnson" may only run two hours, yet the video version I have actually stops midway through for a musical entr'acte. It sort of feels right. In patience if not true time, this is one of the longest movies I ever sat through.Robert Redford is Jeremiah, a Mexican War veteran who has clearly had enough of civilization and wants to strike out for land where no white man has been. In the course of his travels, he meets a colorful grizzly-bear hunter (Will Geer), a scalp trader (Stefan Gierasch), a Flathead woman (Delle Bolton) and a boy (Josh Albee). None really are around very long, as Jeremiah's loneliness and individualism is pretty much the theme of the picture.A film that feels very much of its time, with a folksy singer playing a guitar while a camera pans over miles of snow-covered mountains, "Jeremiah Johnson" has a rugged authenticity that commands respect, without ever spilling over into Granola-hippie platitudes. With John Milius co-writing the screenplay, there's no chance the film will stoop at the conventional political pieties of its day (or ours). Indians massacre whites, whites shoot animals for fur, a sign over the door of a trading post says "White men only," and no one questions why.But the problem with the film is that it is a trial to watch through its slow but meritable first half, then loses its bearings to become a different, quicker, but dumber movie, a revenge story with the once-peaceable Jeremiah becoming "Crow-killer." I understood the transformation, but it feels somehow wrong, with a series of sudden battles between JJ and individual Crow warriors ("Lucky they were Crow. Apache would have sent 50 at once," the scalp trader tells him) and a final scene so abrupt it appears the producers ran out of money.It's a one-man film, and Redford shows he can be interesting company. I'm not totally sold on his frontier authenticity, I know in real life the man is a big fan of the Great Outdoors, but he looks like Barry Gibb in buckskin with his big old beard. Still, he inhabits the small scenes well, like the one where he lights a fire or tries to teach his new Indian bride to say "Yes" or tries to take his legacy from the cold, dead hands of Hatchet Jack.At times a good film, at times a dull one, "Jeremiah Johnson" showcases the spirit of western migration. Actually, one of the things Westerners would say was the toughest thing to face was not the hard winters or Indian attacks, but the boredom. Maybe "Jeremiah" is too authentic that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been reported to be Redford's personal favorite of his films. Treat yourself and watch it. I'm a sucker for a film that has Indians like this (Black Robe, Little Big Man, Last of the Mohicans).Will Geer is great and so are the rest of the cast. Redford says little but conveys much.I read that Pauline Kael says that the final shot is Jeremiah "giving the finger" to the crow. I thought it was defiant but also a show of respect and not an insult. ...and some folks say...he's up there still</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable conflict between nature and man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thought: Robert Redford the mountain man? The hillbilly music did nothing to disperse this twisted image of good ol' Bob wrestling naked with a bear... Surprisingly enough, the movie was a rather enjoyable experience for someone who enjoys his westerns hardboiled with flying bullets (i.e. Wild Bunch). The action was fun, dialogue well written (for the most part) and it had no ending. Robert Redford did a smashing job of doing the stunts and fights throughout the movie. The supporting cast was, well, very supportive. I recommend this film to all Western junkies. Also, it should be noted that the DVD of this film is superb in transfer and with additional materials.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The finest westerns, it seems to me, are the least conventional ones- movies like BAD COMPANY, with Jeff Bridges, for instance, which takes the stylized romance of the Fred Remington-esque westerns of the early 20th century and gives it a good, swift kick in the seat of the pants. As did McCABE &amp; MRS. MILLER (whose look and feel may well have inspired the teleseries DEADWOOD, to some degree); and CHARLEY ONE-EYE (which co-starred Richard Roundtree and Roy Thinnes); and THE BALLAD OF GREGORIO CORTEZ (with Edward James Olmos); and THE GREAT NORTHFIELD, MINNESOTA RAID (with Robert Duvall); and WILL PENNY (starring Charlton Heston), etc. Redford is credible as Johnson and his interactions with the locals are often riveting. "Friend or foe...?" Will Geer (who played Grandpa Walton on THE WALTONS) seemed born to play a Mountain Man, and his is one of the more memorable parts: he takes things in stride, with a barely-concealed sense of humor, but understands all too well the hardships of life in the mountains and has a wistful air about him when last he lays eyes on JEREMIAH JOHNSON. Giersach is likewise a character never to be forgotten- but it's the solitary struggle of Johnson- who "was bettin' on forgettin'"- as rendered by Redford who is most memorable of all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still more hidden subliminal patterns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first i was not sure if the subliminal imagery was intentional or not, but there are just too many of these surprises to pass off as coincidence. See my earlier comments.Here's more - In the scene again where the Crazy Woman is singing "Gather at the River" over the graves of her children, the angel pattern is visible on the rock face behind her and between her and Johnson as the camera zooms out in the last image of this scene. As the zoom extends, a wooden cross from another grave becomes visible in the lower left - these are not the first children she has buried. But to the right of this cross there is a shadow of a tree - and the pattern of this shadow again strongly resembles the image of a skull. At the end of the zoom the Crazy Woman is positioned in the forehead of this shadow skull - she is literally in the "Shadow of Death".A few minutes later, just after Johnson's "I make damn good biscuits", the Crazy Woman is heard wailing and grieving. In the scene that shows her next, the shadowy rock to the left has at least 3 different suggestions of faces - the closest to her clearly resembles a Viking (or the devil?) with horns.Upon returning from observing the Crow war party, Johnson tells crying Caleb to "Stop that, boy". Look at the pattern of tree branches between their faces - there is a strong suggestion of Johnson's own face there.Just before Johnson races home from the Crow burial ground, the shot with the cliff in the background shows a face in the rock pattern of the cliff.For other subtle imagery, the Blue Backpack keeps turning up. It is first seen at the feet of the middle bridesmaid at the wedding ceremony - maybe it was a gift or dowery to Swan. Johnson sits on it after he returns from his hunt with a scrawny rabbit for dinner and throws it into the pot - implied: "I caught it, you cook it...". Swan must have then have taught him how to cook rabbit properly as shown in the last scene with Bearclaw - "You cook good rabbit, Pilgrim..." - in spite of her inability to cook good biscuits. Again in the scene where they pause from their labours of cabin building (and eat bad-tasting biscuits after her practising of religious ceremonies) the blue on the backpack is visible in the bottom right of the scene. These repeated images of the blue backpack decor lay the foundation for the blue on the graves in the Crow burial ground later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On first seeing this fantastic film in a theatre, and then watching the VHS video countless times (i know, this movie is addictive), i finally realized what it was in the Crow burial ground that caused Johnson to rush home to find his family massacred.This is very subtle, is it just me that cannot immediately see these details that mean so much to the story? Or is this so well buried in the images that many others could not see it either?None of the reviews on IMDB mention just what it was he saw, so maybe i'm not the only one who has to watch the movie 30 times to finally get it.Hint: The prophetic scene where Johnson, Caleb, and his new bride Swan leave the Flathead village.

		<fullReview>I never include much of a plot synopses in my reviews, only that which is necessary to underscore whatever calls for a bit of back story, as that information can be found elsewhere. Instead, I concentrate on the all around artistic merit of a film and the quality of its production. In Jeremiah Johnson, I'll make a bit of an exception since it's essentially a true story, and there is so much going on that one would do well to watch it at least twice to catch all the nuances at play. Based on an amalgamation of real life people including a character named "Liver Eatin' Johnson", who ate the livers of his adversaries in keeping with THEIR customs, I will say that essentially the movie tells the story of a white man who drops from society to escape it's politics and finds himself at war with native peoples of the lands wherein he ends up. His family killed by these native peoples for having broken a sacred custom, the real Johnson, confused, scared, mad and alone goes on a vengeful spree. So worthy of an adversary was he and so fierce was his revenge, eventually it was the wily and land-savvy indigenous peoples who sought him out for a truce. This was more or less the way of it. Now on to the technicalities of the film. Pollack has always been my favorite director. His understated direction and touching scores are the stuff of legend. Perfectly lit and beautifully shot, everyone pulls their weight. Perhaps Redford's best work, you can also expect to see Will Geer at the top of his game, and Stephan Gierasch &amp; newcomer Delle Bolton (now a novelty shop owner in the southwest) take turns stealing their scenes as well. To say this is merely a great film does it a disservice.&nbsp; It's more than just great - it's quintessential. Its a must-see. The tension the viewer feels as Johnson stops cold on his mount, listening to the silence, sensing something is amiss after breaking a native custom and having quietly led a rescue party through a burial ground rivals anything in the movies today - albeit more is left to the imagination. But after all, don't we yearn for more movies wherein we are forced to contemplate plot as opposed to essentially having it all but captioned for us? See this and thank me. Along with All the President's Men and Three Days of the Condor I'd put this atop that short Redford list. Yup. It's THAT good. The evidence: within 10 minutes you forget its a nearly 50 year old film. Now you'll excuse me, I'm going to start it from the beginning and watch it again.....Enjoy!! -Jim Boerner,&nbsp; jb0579@yahoo.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crow Indians for violating their burial grounds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writers and producers of REVENANT must have looked carefully at this movie to find some of their ideas. The setting were similar, the time frame was roughly the same, both heroes underwent like trials and tribulations. I cite he bear attack in Revenant and the wolves attack in this one. Indian vengeance, beautiful scenery and very cold weather were present in both. Differences there were. Jeremiah Johnson was not as long, was better lighted, and had a positive ending. Furthermore, this movie was properly researched, unlike the REVENANT. The tribes depicted here, the Blackfeet, the Flathead, and the Crow all lived near the Rockies and were enemies of each other and of the white man if the situation warranted. The Pawnee in REVENANT were in the wrong place and had good settler relations. I thought the manner in which the Indians pursued Redford was suspenseful and exciting. This was a very good film and Redford had a strong performance. The supporting actors, his Indian wife, mute son, and fellow mountain man added a humane element. The ending seemed to indicate that a truce was in the offing and that Jeremiah Johnson would be free of free of his pursuers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Archetype of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The struggle of one man to make a new life for himself in an unfamiliar and uncompromising landscape. His infatuation with the high places and the hard life he finds there is presented as a series of episodes which would likely have devolved into formulaic tedium, despite Pollack's sure eye, but for the masterful writing of John Milius. Johnson progresses through initiation, testing, and mastery.Though Johnson is accused at one point of having "gone native," this film does not stoop to the played-out whiteguiltmessiah trope of a renegade holding back the depredations of mechanization. This is not Fern Gully/Avatar or Dances With Wolves/Last Samurai. True, Johnson is disaffected and turns his back on the servitude of life down in the flats to seek an imagined Independence as a beaver trapper. That this is a vanishing livelihood past its heyday entirely suits his purpose. This is a latter day knight questing for an elusive grail. Those who have cried "historical anachronism!" have missed this point. Johnson's quest is an affirmation that such a life could still be lived, as an act of will. Oddly, because the films are otherwise so different, the closest analog to his spiritual plight that comes to mind is Jerry McGuire. But this film is no romantic comedy.This is a man's film. While it portrays relationships, they are not its essence. The main characters are all orphans of one sort or another, adrift in an uncaring if not purposefully hostile environment, taking occasional rest in the security of temporary alliances. The themes are manly abstractions like integrity, duty, territory. Femininity is portrayed as alien and inscrutable, both attractive and repellent. Violence is graphic and frequent, a necessity of life, sometimes an indulgence of vanity, and a consequence of carelessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-appreciated classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few people took notice when the movie, Jeremiah Johnson, hit the theaters in 1972. It was considered a movie for hikers, backpackers, and people that enjoyed the wilderness. I paid to see the wilderness scenes and instead, I fell in love with a great storyline. Looking back, it may have reflected some sentiment against the Vietnam War; leaving the army and the senseless killing, and striking out for solitude and peace of nature. Who knows?I never considered this great flick a "western". I find it strange it was called a "western' because it has none of the flimsy, reckless elements of the genre. But the Johnson film breaks new ground; a chilling almost haunting depiction of a pioneer's life. The movie doesn't seem to care if you are entertained or not. Jeremiah Johnson appears as a a documentary and doesn't take sides. The Crows had their rules and Jeremiah had his journey to run. The movie's slow pace and story development is a joy to watch in contrast to more recent films that pack action into every scene. Like many great films, it's a movie that either makes you think or you can simply watch, picking up small details each time viewed. I'm surprised how the movie continues to wear well on audiences more than 35 years later. Redford and supporting cast of little known actors was outstanding. Will Geer played a crucial role in the film to support Redford. The worrisome entanglement of Jeremiah's life from simple desire to hunt and fish to becoming a killer grows with every turn. Jeremiah had this super-human spiritual sense of "feeling" something without seeing. How long can a man survive when he is constantly hunted down? How many fights can he win? I didn't care for the ending. I wish it could have been more defined. But the ending simply adds to the mystery of the story; a great movie. I'm reminded that the film has no swearing, and no excessive gore. Yet overall, this gem of a movie will surprise you in simplicity and in depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mountain man by the name of Jeremiah Johnson abandons his life as a townsman and takes up a new residence trapping, hunting, and fighting for his very survival in the bitter and hostile wilderness of the Rocky Mountains in the days of the frontiersmen. Not only must he deal with the environment, hunger, and Indians, but with a new family that he's been entrusted to take care of against his desire.From the moment I saw "Jeremiah Johnson", I came to highly appreciate the film. It's not an extremely complex story, but it doesn't have to be on account of the fact that its beautifully made. Robert Redford is flawless as the title character. The dialogue is perfect for the movie and it changes moods many times. Characters can be serious and comical and there are many instances of comic relief in the film, especially from characters like Del Gue and Bear Claw Chris Lapp. And then there's the wonderfully tranquil scenery shots of the breathtaking Rocky Mountains to bring back serenity to the film before moving on to the next big scene.I loved "Jeremiah Johnson" so much that after the first time I saw it, me and some friends decided to make our own movie. But I cannot expect ours' to be as wonderful and inspiring as this. It's a film I've watched numerous times and one I'll watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fair piece about a man's struggle in the environment of the early Western frontier. Although the usual Hollywood liberal bias bleeds through even in this one. The choice of Paul Benedict as the Rev. Lindquist, and lines given him, were to effect an oafish unsympathetic character with a prejudice against "Indians". Really he was portrayed as the only black-heart in the movie, convincing Jeremiah to go on a rescue mission leaving his homestead behind, exposed to possible attack. The Reverend was shown to be disdainful of the sanctity of Indian burial grounds, while his mission saving the hapless Christians was portrayed as more or less a fool's errand. Basically the stupid Christians got themselves into this predicament, and the conniving Reverend belittled and cajoled Jeremiah into rescuing them. What if the Reverend had been portrayed by a handsome, valiant, prayerful character truly concerned for the welfare of the stranded Christians? Undoubtedly, that would have taken away the audience's sympathy for the bloody vengeance Jeremiah took out on the "Indians" that attacked his squaw, and the boy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film provides a great look at the life of the mountain man in the Rockies during the 1860's. For any of you who have occasionally longed for the simpler life, this film helps to show how complicated that life can be. Filmed with the backdrop of picturesque landscapes and big blue skies, this is a film that is best viewed on the big screen and could easily be enjoyed with the sound off.The story is simple and simply told but with touching moments of human compassion that reach for a place of peace inside all of us and succeeds more often than it fails at sharing the essence of this lifestyle with the viewer. Even amidst the violent scenes you get a sense of harmony - a straightforward kill or be killed code that clarifies all the films encounters.If you liked Dances with Wolves, this is an earlier version of that same genre - the thinking man's Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redford wanders the west in search of a site for the Sundance Film Festival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and several times on television since but it really should be seen on the big screen to the enjoy the cinematography of Duke Callaghan. This is the second of seven films that Robert Redford would star in for director Sidney Lumet which would include This Property Condemed, The Way We Were, Three Days of the Condor, The Electric Horseman, Out of Africa and Havana. John Milius adapted his screenplay principally from the novel Mountain Man by Vardis Fisher and segments of the book Crow Killer by Robert Bunker and Raymond Thorp. Jerimiah Johnson is the fictionalized account of an real life mountain man John Johnston whose life itself was more legend than fact. Johnston was born John Garrison who served in the Navy during the Mexican American War and deserted after striking an officer. He changed his name to John Johnston and worked in the west cutting wood for the riverboats. His wife was an Apsaroke, river Crow who was killed by a raiding war party of mountain Crow warriors. Johnston swore vengeance by dedicating his life to killing Crow warriors and in a symbol of completing the cycle of revenge he would allegedly eat part of their liver thus earning him the name Liver Eating Johnson (the t was dropped as mountain men passed his name around.) He somehow enlisted in the Union Army and late in his life became a deputy sheriff in Colorado and a the first town Marshall of Red Lodge, Montana where he served several terms before dying in Los Angeles at the age of 76. So is a brief outline of the real character but this film only uses part of the story (thankfully, Redford doesn't go around eating human livers) in a mythic western tale of man among the elements turning his back on society. In the cast is Will Geer in support but the rest of the cast are mostly unknown or lesser known character actors including Josh Albee, Delle Bolton, Stefan Gierasett, Allyn Ann McLerie, Charles Tyner and Joaquin Martinez. A good music score accompanies the beautiful scenic imagery in this interesting film that really has no ending. Even with a beard Redford might be too good looking to be an effective mountain man. Parts of this movie were filmed near Park City, Utah where Redford had bought the Timphaven Ski Resort and renamed it Sundance Resort. Soon after he would found his Sundance Film Festival there. I would give this an 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining yet artistic film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Jeremiah Johnson" to be both entertaining and artistic. It is beautifully shot and, due to it's age, has a distinctly antique feel to it that only adds to its rustic feel. Perhaps the most compelling thing about the picture is that it seems to incorporate both a contempoary sensibility and some connections to the more traditional style westerns.When I say "contemporary sensibility" I am talking about the fact that the Indians are neither good or bad, nor are the white men...you see good and evil reflected in both groups. Furthermore, the dialogue is sparse yet realistic. Some of the music and dialogue may sound a bit cheesy, but I chalk that up to the fact that the film is already over thirty years old! The acting is good, despite a few lines that sound stilted.On the other hand, it comes down to the white man vs. the Indians, like so many Spaghetti Westerns. Despite this fact, the film never boils down to a final fight scene or Hollywood ending, but rather ends sublimely with a theme emerging that is more about inner peace than any fight.Overall, however, the film is both haunting and beautiful. It is paced evenly, for the most part, and we care about Johnson although most of what we know about him we can only assume. The film also depicts a great deal of realism in the details regarding survival, hunting and the Old West.I don't know why it took me so long to finally see this. In fact, it's now officially one of my top ten favorite films of all time! 5 Stars</fullReview>

Jeremiah Johnson has been my undisputed favorite since I first saw it on video in 1992 (regrettably, I'm too young (born in 70) to have seen in in the theaters) The characters are iconic without being cliché. The character interactions and dialog are really quite poetic in a simple and unpretentious way. The story and it's hero are of epic proportions while being completely modest and understated. And, of course, it's beautifully shot on location in Utah and Montana.I could go on. It's a fantastic film. If you enjoy entertaining, beautiful cinema with a simple, natural story, you'll probably love it as well. If you liked either 'White Chicks' or '2 fast 2 Furious', then you'll probably hate it.

		<fullReview>I Was born in Idaho just east of West Yellowstone National Park, and grew up in Washington State. As a result I spent many years in the outdoors of Canada, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming and Washington. But when I went camping about two miles up the road from Robert Redford's Utah home (not knowing that he lived there at the time) in my early twenties I immediately moved to Utah. The opening scenes and much of the film is on the north side of Mount Timpanogos. So like Robert Redford the land of Utah brought me here and has kept me here for almost 30 years. Most of the land in the movie is still as pristine now as it was then. The first time I watched this movie was in 2007 and I have to say that the mountain scenes make my heart ache with love for this land. I now live in southern Utah and spend many weekends up in the desert mountains shown in this film near Zion National Park. As an avid fly fisher I have spent many years in the most remote streams and landscapes of this beautiful State. This movie really captures the Spirit of Utah. Thank you Robert Redford and Sidndy Pollack for capturing the very real essence of this land. If you loved this movie then please come visit us and enjoy our State.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More subtle details hidden in the pictures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since my last posting 25Mar04 i have watched very closely for other hidden details. It seems that Mr. Pollack has very skillfully blended subliminal imagery into the photography to enhance our enjoyment without conscious perception of these adornments. Maybe that's why this movie is so appealing. Have a look yourselves and see if you agree, and maybe find more that I have so far missed.When the Crazy Woman is singing "Gather at the River" over the graves of her dead children, look at the rock outcropping just behind her. The pattern on that rock face very much resembles an angel with outstretched wings.When Johnson enters the Crow burial ground on his return from guiding Lt Mulvey, to the background sounds of 'birdcalls' (the same as heard just before Bearclaw and Johnson are accosted by the Crow Indians) there is a pan shot of the forest. Near the screen center and about the height from bottom to mid screen the pattern of tree branches, bush, and rocks resembles a grinning skull. Very plain to see when you are looking for it.Both when Johnson on his return first enters the burial ground and then when he realizes the implications of what he sees, the close-ups of his face very briefly (for only a few frames) each time show a very rich blue reflected in his eyes (use the single frame feature of your VHS or disc player to see this clearly). It is the blue beadwork and blue tassels freshly added to the graves that he sees - the same ones worn by Swan on her stirrups and on her backpack when leaving the Flathead village. When he reaches his cabin, a split second shot shows that her blue-decorated backpack has been dumped on the ground.There may be many more of these subtle details hidden in this movie. If you spot any please post them here. My old VHS player just does not show the detail a disc player can.</fullReview>

It is brutal in parts, but nothing too gruesome. I would have preferred to watch this film on a Sunday afternoon with my family. It's slow, uneventful and lacking in many areas. I found the soundtrack off-putting, especially the self-titled intro music. Robert Redford plays his character brilliantly, as do all the actors, (and horses,) it just seemed a little dated and, although I'm not much of a fan of remakes, I believe this particular film could really benefit from a revamp.It is a good film, but not for me, sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is disillusioned with life after experiencing the horrors of the Mexican War. Now his one simple desire is to live the life of a "mountain man". He will fend for himself, and live off the land. Along the way he will encounter such characters as the helpful old hermit Bear Claw (Will Geer), the grieving "crazy" woman (Allyn Ann McLerie), and the flamboyant Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch). He will incur the wrath of the Crow tribe, becoming a marked man, and meet many of their number in hand to hand combat. He will also experience friendship, love, and loss, while once again finding his place in the world.Redford is aces in this well crafted story inspired by a real life trapper named John Johnston, and drawn from sources such as the novel "Mountain Man" by Vardis Fisher and the tale "Crow Killer" by Raymond W. Thorp &amp; Robert Bunker. Given that one of the two credited screenwriters is John Milius (the other being Edward Anhalt), this proves to be a stirring, robust, and interesting entertainment. It's extremely well directed by Sydney Pollack, and it's set against the backdrop of some truly breathtaking wilderness. Themes of man vs. man and man vs. nature are front and centre. Some viewers may take exception to the way in which a number of the Indian characters are portrayed, but balancing that is the appealing performance of Delle Bolton (who gets an "introducing" credit) as the Indian lass Swan, whom Jeremiah is roped into taking as a wife.Our hero definitely blossoms as he forms something resembling a family unit, with a "son" whom he christens Caleb (Josh Albee), and his new bride. His story is somewhat episodic in nature, but compelling and heartfelt.The music is credited to actors Tim McIntire and John Rubinstein, and it is simply beautiful, serving as the perfect accompaniment to lovely widescreen images captured by cinematographer Duke Callaghan.Redford is extremely well supported by a cast that also includes character actors Joaquin Martinez, Paul Benedict, Charles Tyner, Jack Colvin, and Matt Clark. Both Geer and Gierasch steal the show in their respective scenes.Redford has made many fine films, but this one remains somewhat undervalued.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This turned out to be nothing like I expected, and I don't mean that in a good or bad way in that respect. I liked the idea that the character of Jeremiah Johnson represented. He was a man who wanted to be different and leave the world of "normal" people and step out into the unknown. Living a simple life and surviving off the land, which is something that I admire and would like to emulate. But does this make a good story? In this case I did not think that it did. About half way through, near the intermission, the plot just seemed to disappear and the movie dragged on with nearly another hour of nothingness. Before this it was slightly interesting and engaging but the latter half just lost all entertainment value. The film-making was fine except for a few poorly written lines and that awful ballad singer who would randomly crop up and narrate with a stupid juvenile little tune. It was descent in the beginning but ultimately the dry involving storyline brought the film down to its knees. A mediocre watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read an account of Robert Redford stating that one of his takes at the end of the movie where he gnashed his teeth at Paints-His-Shirt-Red was inadvertent and was the one that wound up in the film. When I saw it, I felt he was containing his rage and showing a measure of respect for his Crow Indian foe long after his Flathead wife Swan (Delle Bolton) and companion Caleb (Josh Albee) were slain by the Indian or one of his tribe. It was a way for the viewer to comprehend that Jeremiah Johnson understood that the Crow revenge for going through their sacred burial ground was to their way of thinking justified. At least that's what I got out of it.After watching the movie, one gets the impression that getting back to nature might not be the best idea going. At least not 1800's style. Hunting, trapping and freezing to death to make a living is not the panacea one might envision in a wistful reverie about living off the land. Of course the Indian threat is much less today, but surviving brutal winters outdoors is never fun. It's been below zero every morning where I live for the past week.What's never made clear in the story is why Jeremiah Johnson gave up on civilization in the first place. One could come up with a few ideas but they'd be only guesses. A brief mention is made of the Mexican War but Johnson didn't have a problem with violence when you come right down to it. I would like to have better understood his motivation.The picture is gorgeously filmed and the scenery is outstanding. As a man without a plan, Johnson winds up wherever life takes him meeting colorful characters along the way. There's a sort of romanticism to it in it's own way, but always slammed with a harsh measure of reality every time other human beings are involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric, though not without flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sid Pollack's direction and Tim McIntire's atmospheric music are fine in this 'mountain man' movie and all the roles are cast rather well except for one -- the title character. Robert Redford has all the acting talent of a hollow log.The essence of the mountain man in this film (Johnson) is a spoiled putz. His opinions of the folks 'down below' are filled with contempt... "It ought to have been different", he says, and "I've been to a town" (and he doesn't ever want to go back to one). So this lame-o runs away from life to hide up in the hills so he can do important stuff like sleeping all day and using a piece of string to fish for whatever's in the river.Ultimately, this is a story which goes absolutely nowhere and that is evidenced by director Pollack's indecision on how to end the film as he continues pitching after the last inning had already been played.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1830's era of free trapping were some of the very toughest of times, and this early period western is one of my favorite Sidney Pollack films. It centers historically on the free trapping of beaver in the American west. The movie is a cult classic among those familiar with the lives and legends of the free trappers. The movie is loosely based on the book, "Mountain Man" by Vardis Fisher. The character invented by Fisher is a combination of mountaineers based on the incredible legends of men like, Liver eating Johnston and John Colter. Pollack had also directed "The Scalphunters" in 1968 which was a film about trapping in the west. This earlier film may have helped lay a foundation of experience for "Jeremiah Johnson".This film chronicles the journey of Jeremiah Johnson as he begins a life in the mountains in his pursuit of free trapping. The choice of Robert Redford for Johnson seems pretty natural for a movie in this time frame. Pollack would have needed someone like Redford as a box office draw, and also, to insure this 1830's mountain film seemed more attractive and compelling to a younger audience. Although Redford did a good job, I'll always wonder what Steve McQueen would have done with this role. The film was shot in various national parks in Utah and contains many winter scenes and sounds that really add to the story.As with any journey type of story, we see that Johnson encounters things and people that help him along his trail in the mountains. Initially, it appears he is on his way to becoming a first season causality before he acquires the help of mountain man veteran Bearclaw Crislap played by Will Geer. In following acquaintances however, he isn't as lucky.The film offers up an explanation of why the mountain men ventured into such a harsh existence. Few things could have been more dangerous as trapping beaver in the Rocky mountains. So many things were there to kill you. The elements, animals and angry Indians were equally up to the task. However, these rules were as clear as the mountain air, and the mountain men seemed to appreciate that. So, the mountains were a symbol of purity - they were closer to God - the air was cleaner. There is constant images of white snow covered scenery that helps the movie convey this message. The characters of Bearclaw and Del Que are quite often delivering lines and messages that express their passion for mountain life and the great pride and respect for this existence. We see the mountains begin to develop as a character themselves. "The mountain got it's way", says BearClaw. Indeed, the mountains seems to communicate with BearClaw. And later the winds sing a sirens song to warn Jeremiah when trouble has found it's way into his life. This mysticism also has something to do with the character of Jeremiah. He never says too much about his reasons for leaving the towns below for mountain life. Unlike Del Que and Bearclaw he doesn't say much about his passion for the mountains.After Johnson has successfully run the gamut of dangers in mountain life, he again encounters some the first few people he met when he entered the mountains. He meets them again in reverse order, and we begin to realize Jeremiah's journey has taken him full circle and the story is nearing completion. We see in the end that Jeremiah has completed his journey, from apprentice to the status of Mountain Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Generic Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man gives up civilization in the 1840s and heads for the Rocky Mountains with the intention of living the life of a lone hunter and trapper.What an unpromising premise. It can so easily get boring, seeing one guy trying to cope with the vicissitudes of a majestic but harsh and unforgiving environment, and occasional brief encounters with other humans, half of them determined to kill him. (All but two of the other half are indifferent.) I couldn't do it.A story like this can so easily go wrong, as it did in "Castaway", for instance. But with the help of the extraordinarily popular and handsome Robert Redford, the movie makers manage to pull it off. There's hardly a dull moment.Nothing comes off quite as expected. At first, Redford knows nothing about survival in the wilderness. Finally he is taken in for a short spell by an old grizzly hunter, Will Geer, from whom he learns the rudiments of getting along from one day to the next.The movie of course depends on Redford. Despite his personal attraction to the mountains of Utah, it seems like a poor choice because he's a minimalist actor, releasing whole gigabytes of information with a roll of his eyes. And the director, Sidney Pollack, a master of urban Angst, expects us to become involved with this guy? But Redford's cool actually makes the film more interesting in that, through his very reticence, he introduces an element of simultaneous contrast with the events going on around him. He proves to be a good physical actor, but he's almost a hole in the story, being to the movie as a whole, what the pupil is to an attractive eyeball.Redford is no hero here, mostly just an ordinary neurotic who's trying to forget the (Mexican-American) war. Most of the time his handsome features are hidden by a full beard. There are only two expectable genre conventions. One is that he keeps killing Crow Indians as they attack him one by one and, though often wounded, he's always the victor. The second is that he mistakenly enters into a marriage with a Flathead (or Salish) woman and is forced by circumstance to adopt a mute white boy. There is the simulacrum of a family then. After they get to know one another a bit, they play field hockey together. (Ho hum, says the savvy viewer.) But they're lost to him because he chooses to aid some stranded white folks, so he's left on his own again. The ending is ambiguous. It's not clear how Redford turns out. If he survives the continuous Crow attacks, he might well end up as savage and bitter as the animals he kills. A different, and equally realistic description of the life of a trapper, can be found in A. B. Guthrie's "The Big Sky" -- the novel, not the movie. There's a surprising amount of humor. Well -- ANY humor in the story of a man traipsing by himself through the wilderness is liable to be surprising. But, really, running across a guy buried to his neck in the soil? Claiming he is still sitting on his buried horse? Pollack, thank God, doesn't really go in for the easy shots. Aside from hiding Redford's features, the director manages to avoid having him strip off his shirt to take a swim. (Imagine Sylvester Stallone in the part.) Redford and his non-English-speaking wife have a friendly but sharp exchange, like the Flintstones. After lengthy periods of isolation, when a friend shows up in the distance, they don't greet each other warmly. They don't greet each other at all. Neither do they say good-bye. When they decide to split up, one says, "I think I'll go to Canada." The other says, "Keep your hair," and rides off shouting gibberish to himself. The Indians are treated fairly. After Redford has just slaughtered four or five of the Crow who have murdered his family, he corners the last one, who begins singing his death song. Redford crouches over him with his knife, eyes darting around, then shuffles off without killing him. There are some fights but they're realistic -- mano a mano, and short. Nobody dangles from a cliff, let alone from a skyscraper. We don't see two bodies struggling under the water. None of the violence is in fashionable slow motion. Pollack exercises a good deal of restraint.There seems also to be a good deal of social comment -- on human nature, on the Vietnam war -- but there's not enough space to get into it. And I'm not sure I could interpret it all that accurately.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Portrayal of American Spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily my favorite movie of all. It is as superb a portrayal of the American Spirit as you will find in any movie.Some movies make out being American to be more glamorous, some more boastful, some more rejoiceful, some more overtly patriotic. Some show the more recent decent into violence, drugs, sex or valueless, soulless nihilism.This movie simply shows the true spirit. Men who desire freedom and the solace it brings the soul. Peace thru relative solitude. It also shows that Americans are willing to help others, even at expense to themselves (a.k.a. common decency). And it shows the resilience that marks Americans.The script is perfect, treading lightly and smartly, never intruding or overbearing, deftly crafted. Redford is outstanding, his love of the land, his skill and his care for the movie clear. Will Geer and Stefan Gerasch are superbly cast and lend the perfect companions to Redford's Johnson. The cinematography is excellent and the land provides the perfect overarching character, nurturing and uplifting both the characters and audience in unison.</fullReview>

I missed the first half hour and went back to watch it again to fill in the blanks. When we caught up to where I had come in the first time, none of us wanted to turn off the movie but wanted to watch all over again. A movie that I want to watch twice is a movie worth seeing at least once. I particularly liked the way the story wrapped around itself. The play between the different cultures was fascinating. It had humor and hardship, beauty and savagery, and people both prevailing and failing against nature and each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another subliminal image detail just prior to a death scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On 9April04 i posted some observations of subliminal effects hidden in various scenes in this movie. Here is another one -When Johnson first hears the faint voice of the Crazy Woman, there is a pan shot of the rocky terrain as he tries to locate her direction. At the end of this pan look at the rock formation in the lower left just above the small green bush. The hollows and shadows in the rock suggest the upper half of a skull, the lower half is hidden by the bush. Then in the next scene the Crazy Woman is tending her dead children while viewed over the top of a fallen tree trunk.This may simply be a coincidence, but it appears that at least twice in this movie the suggestion of a skull appears just before a scene of violent death. There may be more of these as yet undiscovered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Redford's heart was clearly in this one. An actor who's often seemed ill-at-ease with his golden boy image, this role gives him the opportunity to play against type in the tale of a man who immerses himself in the wild in order to transform himself. His transition from greenhorn to mountain man is measured and convincing, aided by lively support from Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch, among others. Redford and his good friend and favorite collaborator, director Sydney Pollack, filmed in pristine, seldom-seen wilderness locations; this is definitely a movie to be enjoyed in a theater or letterboxed on DVD. Superb cinematography, sound and a flavorful score (by actors Tim McIntire and John Rubinstein) enhance the overall effect. The final scene is understated but a perfect capstone to what has come before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw 'The Revenant' with Leo DiCaprio and could not help but compare it to Jeremiah Johnson with Robert Redford.The comparison is not favourable. 'The Revenant' is not a patch on Jeremiah Johnson.Both are visually stunning. (Bear in mind that Jeremiah Johnson, circa 1972, is visually stunning without the benefit of CGI)Both have gritty realism.Both have very good acting.But only Jeremiah Johnson has a really really good story. Jeremiah Johnson, ex-soldier, tired of war goes up into the mountains to be a 'mountain man'. He has an exciting and dangerous life, learning how to survive, helped by an old mountain man. He finds survivors of Indian massacre and is force to adopt a mute boy. He then gets an Indian squaw as a present. He finally settles down with his new family. But comes back to find them killed by Indians. He tracks and kills all but one of the culprits. Thereafter the tribe, in a test of manhood, send warriors one at a time to try and kill him. It's a cracking film. A Sunday matinée classic. (The Revenant is not even close)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I avoided viewing this well-known film for many years as I thought that it was merely another "solitary man" flick...Needless to say I was all too wrong...Suze Orman would like Jeremiah Johnson. He carved out a lifestyle of "Standing in your truth". To dismiss Jeremiah as merely anti-social is an injustice. He wanted to embrace his vision of happiness; this realization was inextricably tied to the wilderness and the beauty he longed to carve out of it....Will Geer is a revelation in his role as Johnson's impromptu wilderness teacher and guide. He is a complex, unflinching man who himself is a study in swimming against the tide...There are moments of sheer beauty in this story. You'll need them to steady yourself later in the story...Most of us in our lifetime have at one time or another, been compelled to embrace an agenda that is really not our own. We may have been deliberately misled, or of our own negligence, ill informed as to the 360 degrees of such a cause...The outcome finds us mere onlookers as a latent evil takes center stage, and thrusts the well-intended into a dark tunnel. In Jeremiah's case, he is so devastated that survival and retribution become one and the same. We too embrace his outrage. Although we want him to remember the canvas of his former dreams, we know that his palette is now colorless, his brush stroke now too broad to paint the intricacies of what he used to imagine for himself...Robert Redford is brilliant in a must see film.</fullReview>

Disenchanted with how the United States is turning out, he moves to the Rocky Mountains, expecting to live in peace, but everything takes an unfortunate turn.Usually, mountain man stories seem silly, but director Sydney Pollack does it right here. Similarly, Robert Redford would straighten out a previously clichéd idea when he directed "The Milagro Beanfield War" sixteen years later.

Clearly the highlight of Redford's career and he is very credible as he eagerly learns the survival lessons of a mountainman from Will Geer, who obviously had fun with this part. Redford's metamorphosis as he moves from the hunter to the hunted is just amazing and the scene with Geer at the end of the film is one of the most poignant in movie history.

		<fullReview>Although his heart was in the right place, let's face it, Robert Redford is totally miscast as this bitter, rugged mountain man. Placed on the beautifully shot landscapes he just seems out of place with his beautifully layered hair.This quiet Western Adventure is probably better because of its sparse use of dialog because what is used is quite Hollywood corn and mostly rings phony, like most of the characters in this overrated Movie.Clichés abound as the folksy ballad intrudes unnecessarily at times, as if we needed to be reminded that we are watching a Movie. That is undeniable. It is not as bad as Dances With Wolves (1990) and can be viewed for some enjoyment, but for a Film striving for realism it oh so fails as it tries to portray isolation and individualism.It is disjointed and edited rather clumsily and there is unintentional humor and the intentional humor falls flat. Even the dirty faces and scraggly beards look like make-up. This is an experience that many find warm and memorable. It's reputation is solid and if you don't mind all that has been said here, you may enjoy it. But it is much more of gallant failed attempt than great insight into the elusive Mountain Man Mythology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delle Bolton's Swan song?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that I had seen this film long ago, but when I watched it last night, none of looked at all familiar. First, the scenery (and photography of it) was totally gorgeous. But I guess it's hard to go wrong with Zion National Park. And Robert Redford was a bit too much of a pretty boy back then to be totally convincing as Johnson. The incident early in the film with Redford trying to start a fire under a tree in the bitter cold, and just when it gets going it is snuffed out by snow falling from the tree, is right out of a Jack London story I read some decades ago. (I cannot recall the title.) I was very impressed with Delle Bolton who played the Indian maiden, Swan. But according to IMDb, this was the only film she ever appeared in. It was refreshing to see a film that did not try too hard to ennoble the Indians, and showed their savagery. Nowadays you would get something like "Dances With Wolves" where the camera is always somewhere else when the Indians begin to scalp and otherwise mutilate the dead. Overall, I enjoyed this film far more than I expected to. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his scything critique of the film, one of our more learned members known as "Cine6fr" (http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?511647) rightly pointed out that the film had "something to do with Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis". But alas, the stereotypical nature of the characters kept him from appreciating the film. Hopefully the poor fellow learned a bit more about the frontier and film theory as time went on and realized the beauty of this film. Sydney Pollack's framing and editing is fantastic. The story communicates both the ethos of the "mountain man", and the American concept of the frontier in its totality. While the characters show some degree of humanity, ultimately the film chronicles the migration of "civilization" across the frontier and all the things it destroyed along the way. From wild life, to entire ways of life, Jeremiah's odyssey captures the twilight of a brief period in U.S. history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with a quiet that makes you wish you were there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie just has a special place in my soul. It has a quiet and a simplicity all its own. Robert Redford and Sydney Pollack team up for a movie that tells a story about a man who decides to journey into the mountains to become a "mountain man." He has no other choice than to learn the hard way. His struggles and where it takes him are the thread of the movie that shows you what it must have been like to contend with nature in such solitude and vastness. The movie is beautifully filmed and looks like a postcard for Utah. Supporting cast is excellent, though most of the movie is just Redford in one of his best roles ever. This movie has a spirit of its own- if that sound a little over the top- you just have to watch it to understand. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largely Meaningless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great strength of this movie is its setting. It's beautifully filmed and features spectacular scenery that does manage to give the viewer a sense of being in the wilderness with Jeremiah. Unfortunately, spectacular scenery aside, the great weakness of this movie is its story. It really doesn't seem to have any particular point to it and it really doesn't lead up to anything. There are a few good scenes in it. When Bear Claw (Will Geer) gets the grizzly to chase him into the cabin for Jeremiah to skin him I smiled; the fight against the wolves was pretty good; and there really was a sense of sympathy when Jeremiah discovered his "family" massacred. But there really didn't seem to be much glue holding this together as a comprehensible story.Jeremiah (Robert Redford) is a mysterious figure. As the movie opens he simply appears, getting off a boat in the western wilderness and striking off to be a mountain man. There's no real explanation of the character - where he came from, what he was getting away from, why he chose the mountains. There's a couple of hints that he had been a soldier (he's wearing army pants as the movie opens, and he makes reference to the war against Mexico in another scene) so perhaps he's a deserter? Or just disillusioned by war? In the era in which the movie was made, perhaps that would make him something of a sympathetic character (in the early 70's lots of people were "dropping out" of society, disillusioned by war.) But that's speculation on my part; Jeremiah's background was never really explored, and so never really explained.The setting alone gives this a certain attraction - as does the fact that Jeremiah is escaping from the world (who hasn't wanted to do that at one point or another?) But as far as story or plot goes, this struck me as largely meaningless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly beautiful film, well worth viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is NOT a great narrative, instead it is a beautiful foray into the mind of the frontier. Rather than simply tell a story about men who live precarious existences on the far-flung frontiers of human habitation, it tries to show us what those men were like. This is not a perfect film, it has flaws... but it is a beautiful film and one that should be seen.Perhaps Robert Redford was not the perfect choice to play Jeremiah, perhaps his soft good-looks do not complement what we would like to see in this semi-mythic character, perhaps he undermines just a tad of our credibility... but irregardless, he comes to embody Johnson. I find his gradual transformation from inexperienced explorer into savage force of nature to be entirely beleivable, if perhaps a bit strained.Ultimately, the real problem lies in the film's narrative structure... it tends to meander too much and to never resolve itself in a meaningful manner. The story turns violent, but we don't really get a sense of why this violence is significant, or germaine to the plot. There are too many false endings, and the movie seems to end abruptly and without real closure.However, even with all of these problems in mind, Jeremiah Johnson is an experience. It may not be a film that you want to rent with a bunch of friends, but rather a film to watch by yourself, when you are in sort of a contemplative mood. This is a film to relax to, to allow to happen rather than to actively engage it. There are a lot of things to think about and to reflect on, and the film is truly beautiful to watch. This may not be a film that you will watch often, but it is a film that you will value having watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dropping out of society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disillusioned by the horrors of war, a US soldier attempts to live alone in the mountains in this unusual western starring Robert Redford. The film is based on the true story of an 1840s fur trapper, however, the basic narrative has more in common with the 'dropping out of society' movies of circa 1970 with Redford rejecting the rules of the society that has raised him, only to have to contend with other (Amerindian) rules. Perhaps most pointedly though, Redford finds himself eventually saddled with all the accoutrements of society that he has tried to avoid, inadvertently making friends, given a surrogate son (after the boy's family is killed) and an Amerindian bride for a wife. One of the film's best aspects is how Redford gradually progresses from being resentful of the son and wife to actually caring deeply enough about them to take action at a pivotal point. Intelligent as all this might sound, 'Jeremiah Johnson' is certainly not a film for all tastes. It is very deliberately, almost lethargically paced and Redford's journeys are accompanied by a series of superfluous sentimental songs. The film also never really probes into Redford's past and all the reasons that culminated in his drop out of society. It is, however, his journey (rather than his motivation) that drives the film. He might look and sound the same by the end of the film, but he is indelibly changed. No matter how one dissects it, it is hard to deny that the film has a potent message to offer about the difficulty of actually avoiding society and the company of others altogether. The scenery is great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western balderdash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New Jersey-born John Garrison, a.k.a., John Johns(t)on (c.1824?1900) joined the Union Army in St. Louis, Missouri in 1864 and served with Company H, 2nd Colorado Cavalry. Honorably discharged in 1865, Johnson migrated further west and became a notoriously tough and ruthless trapper, Indian fighter, and lawman. In the 1880s he served as Deputy Sheriff in Coulson, Montana and later became Town Marshall in Red Lodge, Montana. He died of old age at a veteran's home in Los Angeles. Such are the rather prosaic facts of the real John Johnson. Then there is the myth. An associate of Wild Bill Hickock named Joseph (John) "White Eye" Anderson (1853?1946) seems to be the main source for the fantastic legends that accrued around Johnson in the second half of the 20th century. In 1941 Anderson regaled western writer Raymond W. Thorp with tall tales of "Crow Killer" or "Liver Eating Johnson," so named because Johnson allegedly slew between 300 and 400 (!) Crow warriors and ate their livers, raw, to avenge the murder of his pregnant wife in 1847 by a Crow hunting party?20 years before John Johnson moved West. Seventeen years after meeting Anderson, Raymond Thorp joined Robert Manson Bunker in writing 'Crow Killer: The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson' (Indiana UP, 1958), a highly speculative "biography" that turned Anderson's wild fabrications into uncorroborated "fact." Noted western author Vardis Fisher further burnished the Johnson legend with his novel, 'Mountain Man' (Morrow, 1965). Building myth upon myths, screenwriter John Milius ('The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean') used Crow Killer and Mountain Man as his sources for Jeremiah Johnson, a movie that more realistically chooses to portray Johnson (Robert Redford) as a ascetic, romantic loner, not the vengeful, brutal monster recounted by White Eye Anderson. (Rather than waging a vendetta on the Crow, Redford's Johnson is constantly attacked by them.) Further enhancing Jeremiah Johnson's nobility and the film's lyricism are breathtaking vistas of the rugged Utah Rockies shot by Duke Callaghan (promoted to DP after serving as one of Sydney Pollack's cameramen on his previous film, 'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'). If that were not enough, a lush musical score by John Rubenstein and Tim McIntire completes the picture. Yet, when the movie premiered at the 26th Cannes Film Festival on May 4, 1972, Robert Redford somewhat disingenuously told 'New York Times' interviewer Cynthia Grenier: "I wanted this film to be an antidote to the general feeling in the States today that getting away from civilization is such a terrific thing and is so romantic. I wanted to show the kids what it is really like going it on your own in the wilderness..." 'Jeremiah Johnson' might well have been the gritty western that Redford imagined it to be if producer Joe Wizan had gone with Clint Eastwood as Johnson and Sam Peckinpah as director, as was originally planned. The estimable (and once-blacklisted) Will Geer (best known as Grandpa on "The Waltons") plays Johnson's wilderness survival mentor, Bear Claw Chris Lapp. VHS (1997)and DVD (1997).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mexican war veteran Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is tired of the world and seeks to be a mountain man trapper. He struggles to survive until he runs into the frozen body of Hatchet Jack clutching his .50 caliber gun. It proves to be a much needed gun. Then he meets another mountain man Bear Claw (Will Geer) who takes him under his wing. He encounters Crow chief Paints-His-Shirt-Red and eventually befriends him. He runs across homesteader (Allyn Ann McLerie) and her mute son just after a Blackfeet raid. She pushes him to adopt her son whom Johnson calls Caleb. The duo go off and run across Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch) who the Blackfeet had buried up to his neck. Gue and Jeremiah find a Blackfeet camp ending up killing the Blackfeet. Jeremiah is disgusted with Gue taking scalps. The group meets Flathead indians who are in awe of Jeremiah. They assume he killed their enemy Blackfeet to avenge the crazy white woman of big medicine when they see the scalps. When he gives them the scalps and the Blackfoot ponies, the chief needs to give an even greater gift, his daughter Swan. Gue leaves them and Jeremiah is saddled with a son and wife neither of which he wanted. They eventually become a family with a cabin. Then the US Cavalry convinces Jeremiah to search for a wagon train. They go through a sacred Crow burial ground despite Jeremiah's objection. The Crow slaughters Caleb and Swan which sets off a long running quest for revenge.Coming at a time of disenchantment, the public was ready to run away and rediscover America. At first glance, Robert Redford seems too refined for a mountain man role. However even Jeremiah didn't start out as a mountain man. Redford can slowly transition into a more rugged character. Sadly in the end, he fails to get to the truly insane mountain man character. He just doesn't have that in him.The movie moves a little too slowly at times. Director Sydney Pollack could have tighten up the pacing a bit. There's a more melodic feel coming from this movie. It's not really the same as a Clint Eastwood and Sam Peckinpah western. I would expect that version would be more brutal. That may be a good idea for a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mountain Man Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is the third of a troika of films about the mountain man experience, Clark Gable's Across The Wide Missouri and Charlton Heston's The Mountain Men being the other two. One of these days there will be a good biographical film of Kit Carson, the greatest of the lot.Robert Redford in the title role gets in on the last years of the mountain man experience. These guys trapped for the fur pelts living months and sometimes running into years before they came down to sell their goods. They lived alone among the Indians, hostile or not, and being that repeating rifles had not yet been invented the Indians had numerical and firepower advantage over them. They had to be one hardy breed of men as Redford and the others show.Initially Redford lucks out winning the respect of the Indians when he avenges a crazy woman's massacre of her family. The Indians hold the insane in respect even though Redford kills several Indians doing it. They even give him an Indian bride in Delle Bolton.His luck runs out when he reluctantly guides a party of soldiers through an Indian burial ground. After that they don't let up in trying to kill him and his loved ones. Being the noted conservationist that he is I'm sure Robert Redford loved shooting in the national parks which are preserved as they were in the time of Kit Carson, Jim Bridger and the rest. Some beautiful cinematography is another hallmark of Jeremiah Johnson.One of Robert Redford's best and most interesting characters he's brought to the big screen, this Jeremiah Johnson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Redford plays Jeremiah Johnson in director Sydney Pollock's interesting, beautifully filmed story of how Johnson, soured by human civilization, flees into the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where he barely survives that first winter, but he is aided by an experienced old trapper(played by Will Geer) who teaches him what he knows, and is gradually impressed by how quickly he learns, eventually becoming an experienced mountain man himself. Later, he will find himself at odds with the local native American tribe, who have attacked his home after he transgressed on their ancient tribal burial ground.Fine acting by all, with an engrossing story that may well have influenced the(kinder and gentler) film "The Life And Times Of Grizzly Adams" and subsequent TV series with Dan Haggerty. Johnson is not always an endearing person like Adams was, since his stubborn personality may well have alienated him from his fellow man(I sympathize!) Still, this fine film is quite worthwhile, and has a haunting ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film I had never seen until recently and I sure was glad to have viewed this film on TV. The photography is outstanding in the West with the Rocky Mountains and the real wide open spaces for miles and miles. Robert Redford, (Jeremiah Johnson) was in the Civil War and decided he was going to get away from and become an adventurer (Hermit) in the high country and in parts of this unknown territory known mostly by various Indian tribes. As you view this film you see that Jeremiah was rather green at trying to survive and being able to accomplish simple things like catching fish and wild game. Jeremiah does meet up with some friendly characters who give him some hints about really being able to survive in this rough and tough country. Jeremiah soon gathers quite a few people to help him settle down in the mountains with a nice log cabin and a boy, Josh Albie,(Caleb) who never speaks a word along with Delle Balton, (Swan) a very young Indian woman who speaks very little English and was taught to be religious from a Catholic Missionery. This is a great family film and is a great masterpiece from 1972.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a remarkable movie, though it has some good scenes, breath-taking views and beautiful shots. The dialogs are often clichéd, and the storyline is just mildly good. It's about a mountain man played by Robert Redford, and his struggle to survive. After that, you see his life with an Indian woman and a little boy; those scenes are very cute. It's mostly quite boring and not absorbing enough, though. One of the main problems of this is that Robert Redford isn't capable of holding a picture. His character is never realistic, and it's never iconic. He still has some moments in which the emotions of Jeremiah come out, and those are touching. The supporting actors are better. Delle Bolton, who plays Swan, shows a nice deal of emotion with her body language, and Josh Albee as Caleb is really expressive, and his character is the one I cared the most about. Will Geer is pretty funny, but his character isn't very well-written.Allyn Ann McLerie plays crazy very well, in her few scenes.The visuals were the best thing on the movie. The locations are some of the best I've ever seen, and I think you can say they are the main element of the story. Without the mountains, the peace and beauty this movie has would disappear. Sidney Pollack's direction is great. His close shots are always lovely, and his wide shots are perfect. Then, there's some great music too. All those songs about Jeremiah sound beautiful and have good lyrics. As I mentioned, I didn't enjoy the dialogs much, but some of them are truly poetic and seem to echo on the mountains. The ending is well done, too. This is not an unmissable movie, but it's very beautiful 7/10</fullReview>

From the opening credits to the end of the movie, Sydney Pollack put together a movie that is one of Robert Redford's best. Though Redford's character doesn't have much dialog, indeed the photography of the American West is stunning. Redford's character's solitude and antagonizing confrontations with local Indian tribes are well enough, but the real power of the movie comes from the middle third where he builds his own family and learns of love and loss. I especially enjoyed that relationship with the forsaken boy and Indian Wife given the extreme environment. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When asked to name his favourite film of those he's starred in Redford says this one, without hesitation. Quote, 'A great American tale', is his summary in a nut shell. He plays a man disillusioned (&amp; probably shell-shocked) from fighting in a war he does not care about, nor wants to, who embarks on the solitary life of mountain man. A life where every day is not only a battle with Nature to survive but also against hostile Indians. A beautifully made film, it is as much a journey of self discovery as it is about the brave, solitary life of the mountain men themselves. The character's joy in at long last finding company again in the form of an Indian wife &amp; a young white boy traumatised from losing his parents to Indians, was so well done. Then, when he loses them we too can feel the grief, feel the isolation &amp; loneliness creeping back in, such was the intensity of those scenes! The music &amp; cinematography is superb, the scenery lending it's magic to a great film. Redford too became enchanted &amp; built his Sundance home there in Utah.

It's a well driven character movie. It's not western, it's not documentary, it's not pure drama. It's a little bit of everything, but mostly a study about human communication and feelings. Jeremiah was a man who wanted his privacy, liked to be free. He yearned for freedom and in his loneliness he found a family to love. And when he did it didn't last. So, Jeremiah became an animal with just his instict for survival left in him. Robert Redford gives his greatest performance to date in this masterpiece. He always uses his eyes as a mirror to the soul of his characters and in this beautiful movie you seem to forget that Jeremiah Johnson is just a movie character. You feel his anger, hear his yearning for love. Redford should have won an Oscar on this one, but who cares after all?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have noticed something peculiar. Reviews of people not from North America seem rate the movie poorly. Perhaps one needs to be steeped in the mythos of the frontier and an appreciation of where we Americans (especially the people of the US) were after Vietnam. Yes the film uses archetypes and yes there are what you could call "bad Indians". But this is film is more than the sum of its parts. It is about a man escaping the bellicosity of the US for the peace of the wilderness (see Thoreau) and to find his place in the world. This is a typically American idea. This theme is seen throughout the first half.But then, his American heritage, his inability to throughly appreciate the native culture, and his response to family's death eventually put Johnson in conflict with the Indians who lived there before him. Yes he kills but the film treats these amorally. The Crow even respect him for he abilities, but his wariness of fighting at the end is palpable (read in American involvement in Vietnam). This film offers more three-dimensional characters and realistic set-pieces than Dances with Wolves (Whites are bad) or traditional westerns (Indians are bad without reason). I think this film is still apropos today; especially today.But aside from that, it is a beautifully acted and shoot movie. The imagery of the mountains cannot be beat. Please, please check this out even as a pop-corn flick and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can anyone tell me what became of Delle Bolton, who played the part of Swan, Johnson's squaw, after the film was made. There are no other cinematic credits to her name. Although her part in the movie was small, it was an important element of the story, and her capabilities as an actress convincing. It is especially odd that she seems to have disappeared without trace as she was billed in the credits as "introducing Delle Bolton". The recognised movie and actor/actress web sites carry no biographical information about her and she does not gain more than a mention in articles and reviews of Jeremiah Johnson. Perhaps someone knows what became of her after this one movie appearance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why an Intermission?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rewatched this film on Turner Classic Movies and was surprised that there was an intermission in a movie that only ran 116 minutes, less than 2 hours.I don't remember if there was one during the original theatrical release.I think the break came at around 80 minutes in, leaving only about 36 minutes afterwards.Is there a reason for this break? Was it to stir up audience who were calmed and settled by the generally liesurely pace of story telling?Was it intended at one time for the film to be even longer, so the intermission was created for that eventuality?It was not badly placed, but I've never seen a break like this in any film this short.I still like the film, and so did my 12 year old son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the "new-age" American westerns to spring up in the late 60s/early 70s (BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER, PAT GARRET AND BILLY THE KID, this is easily my favorite.Marking the second (and perhaps best) collaboration between director Sydney Pollack and star Robert Redford, JEREMIAH JOHNSON is probably the closest we'll ever get to a cinematic representation of an Emerson poem.Loosely based on the life of the "Crow Killer", JEREMIAH JOHNSON is the story of a young greenhorn (from parts unspecified) who eschews civilization to carve out an existence as a "mountain man". Adopting the basic necessities of survival is complicated by working to co-exist peacefully with the ubiquitous Native Americans (who didn't take too kindly to frontier-pushing "whitey" at that time.) Along the way, he meets up with a wily bear hunter (formerly-blacklisted Will Geer) and forms a makeshift family with a squaw and a young boy whose whole family excluding his mother was murdered. Just as he's learned the tricks of the trade and acclimated himself to his environment, Johnson's tranquil existence is irrevocably shattered when he finds himself the object of a blood vendetta waged by Crow Indians.Shot entirely in the parks and wilds of Utah, JEREMIAH JOHNSON is first and foremost a "return to nature" picture, made at the height of the Hippie era and to capitalize on renewed interest in nature conservation. It is an epic panorama of trees and mountains, accentuating all of its rugged, majestic beauty. However, its lyrical meditations are punctuated by scenes of carnage and brutality. For all of its splendor, the wilderness was a foreboding and capricious place. Hostile weather, savage wildlife, and vengeful Indian tribes all contributed to make life an especially arduous and perilous process for settlers in the early days of westward expansion. The film doesn't sugarcoat it, making numerous references to scalping, staging a rather graphic attack by a marauding wolf pack, and demonstrating the ease with which one can freeze to death.I love reading about the intrepid mountain men who risked life and limb for solace and solitude in the great outdoors. They were hunters and fur trappers who sometimes hailed from military backgrounds, often as members of scouting expeditions or cargo transports. There have been numerous accounts written about John Johnston's identity and his adventures. Some are quite sensational, embracing the tall tales and myths that formed the bedrock of his reputation. Literature has portrayed him as a "white warrior" who participated in Indian battles and fended off an ornery cougar with the arm of a dead man, to a quiet type who reveled in the rustic country he adopted as his home. No facet of his life is more enduring (or compelling) than his long-running feud with Crow Indians. After murdering several in a frenzied bout of revenge, Johnson became the recipient of inveterate Crow attacks, who would dispatch young braves to prove their honor by claiming his hairpiece. It's widely purported that he ritualistically consumed the livers of his victims. While the film includes all this (minus the liver ingestion), it doesn't get sidetracked by it. JEREMIAH JOHNSON isn't a revenge parable, or cautionary tale. It's the story of a guy who hurdled a lot of obstacles because the emancipated life of a mountain mas was "worth it".Pretty boy Redford, sporting his best he-beard, was a tough sell for some people as a guy hacking it out in the woods. Personally speaking, Redford doesn't tax my credulity. He looks appropriately out of his element when the film starts, and hardened by his experiences by the end. A more macho and imposing actor may have worked, but Redford isn't a knock against the film. A lover of nature noted for his liberalism, Redford owns a lot of land near the locations this was shot and is said to embody the same free spirit engendered in his tough forbears. JEREMIAH JOHNSON is soup for the soul. Despite the hazards, you just may walk away from it enticed by the idea of bidding farewell to your material possessions and embarking on an exciting life in the wilderness. At the least, you'll gain a greater appreciation for this alternative lifestyle. That's the aim of the picture, and it succeeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Turned Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having taken a real interest in American Studies, I came across the writings of Vardis Fisher, upon whose book this is based. This is a movie as quiet as the open spaces that surround the title character. Not unlike a Greek tragedy, Johnson is drawn to his purpose and seems resolved to it. There is never any other reason for him to be a mountain man than he sees it that way. What follows is a slice of Western life that tears at the soul and takes everything the man can give. Along the way, we meet adversaries of every kind, each a way to true knowledge, which is what this movie is really about. Will Geer's character, Bear Claw, takes the man and begins to mold him, but his baptism is certainly of fire. He knows the bragging tenderfoot has never encountered a beat, and he knows that he will have to perform or die. There is a complex relationship with the Indians of the time. This book pulls the stereotypes out from under them and we begin to know their unique tendencies. With each passing encounter, which includes the tragic loss of the thing he loves the most, he comes to an uncertain peace. Purification through suffering is as old as the Iliad.</fullReview>

Beautiful scenery and cinematography. Simple, but straightforward and powerful script. Excellent cast (especially Wil Geer), and a great story in general. They don't make films like this any more. If they did, we'd have a greater appreciation for true old west and mountain adventure. Rent it. Watch it. Learn something about a life that most North Americans know nothing about. Even if you're simply a nature-lover, this film will be worth your time. This film is one of my top five favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Glorious cinematography of the Utah wilderness almost - but not quite - redeems this somewhat aimless tale of a man who shuns civilisation in favour of the wild, but finds himself initially incapable of survival, and then the subject of a bloody vendetta with local Indians. A different role for Redford, pitching his Ivy-League looks against the rigours of nature and blade of a tomahawk, but despite the engaging premise and delightful location work, there's little else to celebrate.His battles with the local Indian population just seem to be so spontaneous and unmotivated at times, that it's difficult to believe. Earning reprieves from short-sighted Indians who either miss with monotonous regularity, or fail to inflict a fatal wound, Jeremiah occasionally comes into contact with other frontier-men (Geer, Tyner, Gierasch, McLerie) for profound discourses on social attachment that would make Plato blush before resuming bloody hand-to-hand combat with the land's traditional owners. All this punctuated by ill-fitting country odes to Jeremiah.As we witness his bloody encounters and retributions spanning time and territory, his reputation for conquering the wild earns him legend status among new settlers, and his identity becomes one of folklore. The idea is appealing and there are aspects of this movie that work really well, but it's lacking the synergy required to be a great movie. A nice postcard and somewhat self indulgent of Redford's well known affection for Utah, despite all the promise, it's not enough to watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jeremia Johnson took his horse up to the mountain.... Jeremia Johnson took his horse up to the mountain"...That is the theme song of this movie, and the entire plot, so I should have included a "Spoiler Alert"... except there's really nothing there to spoil.This is a movie about a man who is an apparent former soldier, who decides to leave society and live in solitude for the rest of his life in the mountains. It is not explained who he is, why he came to this decision, or anything else about him. We learn absolutely nothing about him in two hours of silence in this film. We do learn that Indians don't like him. Maybe it's the beard. Maybe it's because an Indian woman decides she wants to sleep with and live with the first white man she's ever seen, despite the fact he can't communicate with her, hasn't had a bath in a year and has a long scratchy beard.Of course, civilization won't leave him alone. Random people wander into his life, call him "pilgrim", and wander out again for years at a time. He adopts an orphan boy he calls "boy". Of course, just when he has something of a family again, the Indians decide to show up and wipe them out. This cliché of killin' the missus and the young'un sets up Redford's vendetta against the Indians. They show up, one at a time, week after week, to prove their manhood by killing him. Of course, this earns them a one way ticket to the Happy Hunting Ground, as Redford dispatches brave after brave, despite their size, speed or fighting skills. Redford is completely non-credible as a "mountain man". He looks and acts like he just got out of makeup, despite the gnarly beard. He never for one moment looks happy with the solitude he sought. He lives alone, avoiding people, waiting for the next Indian to try to kill him. The movie to me felt like a long, slow exercise in masochism by Redford's character. I felt like I was engaging in the same masochism by sitting through it. Finally, his ol' buddy wanders back by after three years and Redford asks him if he knows what month it is; March, April? The old man replies "March...maybe. April, I don't think so. Well, take care, Pilgrim". He then leaves. That is their entire conversation. There is time for one more fight with a random Indian at the end which Redford butchers, of course, then the credits roll. That is the movie.It is as if Sydney Pollack deliberately wanted to make a movie as devoid of dialogue, structure, plot, purpose or meaning as he could, and as if doing that would impart meaning on this film. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to. He only succeeds in the former. I have to wonder if even Robert Redford understood what the point to the film was, if any. You feel a lot of time passing in the movie, and you feel a lot of your own life has as well watching it.At the end of the credits, we hear the same lone singer we heard at the beginning: "Jeremiah Johnson, took his horse up to the mount-ain, Jeremia Johnson, took his horse up to the mount-ain". (I always felt sorry for that poor horse)."And some folks say... he's up there still". ....Yes? And? The man wanted to be left alone. You should've respected his wishes, and not filmed him to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dull as dish water. No wait. Duller. I was so utterly bored that I started studying the patterns on my ceiling - which doesn't have any patterns. Damn!! I dunno... maybe one needs to be comatose to enjoy this thing. Unfortunately I'm a guy who yearns for a little excitement every now and then. The truth of the matter is that I really wanted to like this film. The theme of man going into nature I found appealing - I really loved INTO THE WILD (one of my favorite films from 2007) - but here I was just bored witless. Sure the on-location shooting in Utah was nice - loved the snow, the mountains, the valleys, the desert, etc. Redford was okay although I always saw him as more of a movie star than an actor in every role he played. I actually thought that Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch gave the more memorable performances here. But all this is a moot point because the whole affair is so dreadfully dull and pointless. Man meets some good Indians, man meets some bad Indians, man marries a good Indian, man wanders around the solitary landscape, man builds a house, bad Indians destroy said house, man wanders some more, etc. And all done with minimum dialogue. For large swathes of this film you feel like you're watching a silent movie. And none of what I saw I could engage in. I just flat out didn't care. I remember in the past thinking DANCES WITH WOLVES was boring but compared to this WOLVES is an outright adrenaline rush! Sydney Pollock really divides me - at times he can create very good stuff like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and THE YAKUZA and at other times he gives me coma-inducing stuff like this and OUT OF Africa. Still... the absence of Meryl Streep means that this one gets an extra point. Otherwise it may have been a 1/10. And that, of course, is PHANTOM MENACE territory. Thou shalt not enter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Dances With Wolves" of the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, sort of.Like "Dances With Wolves," "Jeremiah Johnson" (1972) is about a white man choosing to live in the wilderness and his inevitable interactions with natives. Like "Dances," it features realistic natives and was a hit at the box office. Unlike "Dances," the story takes place in the mountains, rather than the prairie, and it's less compelling.THE PLOT: Jeremiah Johnson decides to leave civilization behind to become a mountain man in the Rockies. At first he's a bit na?ve to the ways of the high country but he learns and eventually acquires a kid and a native wife. Although he befriends some natives, he develops hostilities with the Crow. Johnson proves himself in combat and develops an almost legendary status while braves keep coming after him to win a name for themselves.The film was based on the true story of Liver-Eating Johnson who notoriously ate the liver of the braves he killed because the Crow believed the liver was vital for the afterlife. He was also known as Crow Killer and killed braves for 25 years, attaining legendary status, but finally made peace with the tribe.Some people complain about Robert Redford in the title role, suggesting that he was too much of a handsome movie star, but who says all mountain men were brawny and ugly? It is true, however, that the real Johnson was 6'2" and 260 lbs, while Redford is 5'9" and fairly lean. Even though Charleton Heston would've been better in the role, Redford does fine.Although the stomping grounds of the real Johnson was Montana and N. Wyoming, the film was shot in Utah, which sometimes has too much of a Southwest flair to be a good substitute. Regardless, the locations are spectacular. Some even point out that the movie is worth owning just for the location photography.The film was directed by Sydney Pollack and adopted by John Milius from the book "Mountain Men" and the story "Crow Killer." It runs 116 minutes.FINAL WORD: It's interesting to watch this film and observe Native Americans being portrayed realistically and respectfully almost two decades before the heralded "Dances With Wolves." "Jeremiah Johnson" may not be great like "Dances" but it's quite good, as long as you're in the mood for an atypical Western that's kind of low key and doesn't spell everything out. If you're looking for cowboys, saloon gunfights and cavalry, forget it.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Redford's many Native films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this one to be interesting in that it was one of Mr. Redford's many Native-themed films &amp; documentaries. However Redford's love for Natives first appeared back in the late 60's when the resurgence of Native pride came in the form of the formation of AIM. I don't know HOW exactly he became interested from that alone but he did and surely enough, he wanted to make his presence felt for Native rights. For him, the best way to do that was to portray them in a positive light rather than the usual negative stereotypical ways that so many other white people have done. Mr. Redford has also produced interesting documentaries on Natives that have won different awards (I don't know which ones exactly offhand). But thanks to him, he has helped make a big difference on how mainstream Americans should see Native folks, and NOT how they're portrayed in those BS ones where Hollywood ruined it for them.Anyways ... this is why 'Jeremiah Johnson' is a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another favourite film of my dad's and as ever, the old man's rarely wrong. One thing I always liked about Robert Redford was that he didn't sell out his integrity for a cheap blockbuster big-payday, unlike say Newman and McQueen in "The Towering Inferno". That said this movie belongs along with the likes of the former's "Buffalo Bill and The Indians" and the latter's "Tom Horn" as an example of film-making for film-making's sake and is all the better for its artistic integrity.Here, pretty-boy Redford is deglamourised to the extent that for most of the film he's heavily be-whiskered and if he seems less like a grizzled mountain-man than one might have wished (the originally cast Clint Eastwood raising intriguing possibilities), nevertheless in a difficult eponymous role, requiring lots of physical exertion and correspondingly little verbal expression, Redford convinces you of his character's veracity from the off and holds the viewer's attention all the way through.Along the way of course, he encounters a few eccentric characters, which adds to the richness of the narrative and is teamed up for a long time, until their bloody demise at the hands of the avenging Black Crow Indians, an almost mute pair of companions, one a Flat-head Indian squaw to whom he's affianced in near enough a shotgun-wedding and the morose young son of another victim of the Black Crow whom he takes in.The film thus, especially in the first half, moves along in near silence, at its own pace and invites the viewer to get to know this individual character, get under his skin as it were and moreover take in the fantastic snow-covered mountain scenery he inhabits. I had absolutely no problem with this, finding much to admire in director Pollack's beautifully shot cinematography as well as the quality of the acting. An actor's hardest task, it seems to me, is to convey emotion without words and this Redford does superbly throughout especially in the heart-breaking scene when he comes upon his slain adopted family.Despite his orneriness, Johnson does build up a series of interesting relationships with a variety of differing personalities he meets along the way, the last of these being the hard-won respect of his nemesis, the Black Crow leader he encounters throughout the movie. The film also subtly proffers a pacifist message which I would imagine was not quite on-side with the prevalent US Government of the day.Okay, I could have done without the mediocre folk-balladry which regularly interspersed the action and would counsel patience to potential viewers as the movie finds its feet, but can state that those that do will be rewarded with a brave, uncommercial work offering an insight into a long-vanished arcane world peopled with real characters in a time and place far removed from the comfort-zone of this particular city-dweller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is the epic saga of a man who doesn't want to be part of a civilizing world and heads to the mountains to be a...well, mountain man. What he's searching for is never all that clear, not even to himself. "A mountain man is a lonely man" says the song and that does seem to apply to all the characters here.As Jeremiah learns the tricks to survive up in the mountains he encounters quite a few people and ends up gaining a family. But life in the wilderness is harsh and in more ways than Jeremiah may have thought.An exceptionally beautiful film to look at and with a captivating story, Jeremiah Johnson is a great film in most respects. Shot entirely in Utah, the scenery looks so great you almost wanna pack up your bags and head to the mountains before the credits end.It's also well written I think. Jeremiah goes through a lot and ends up with plenty of wisdom and experience but whether that's a good thing or not is up to viewers. Redford is excellent, doesn't talk all that much but conveys a lot through gestures and looks. Really good actor. Everybody else does good also, I particularly liked his wife and "adopted" boy.Plenty of action as well, as Jeremiah has quite a few brawls with some Indians. Overall Jeremiah Johnson is overflowing with good things to say about it but somehow lacks the touch of greatness. It's irritating when you can't quite put your finger on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essential Mountain Man Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mountain man (Robert Redford) who wishes to live the life of a hermit becomes the unwilling object of a long vendetta.I love Robert Redford. I have a tendency to lump him with Paul Newman, but the fact is that I love Redford more than Newman. If there was a Redford's Own salad dressing, I would smother myself in it and roll around in lettuce and tomatoes.The music in this film for some reason reminds me of "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers", which may not be a bad thing, since that is a good movie and they seem to be set in similar times.For some reason, this movie strikes me a subtle comedy. It really should not, probably, because of the massacres and death, and struggle to survive. But the situations are just so silly. It is like a light-hearted version of "Centennial"...</fullReview>

The noble spiritual indian is kind of passe' now, PC sillyness attributing all sorts of wonderful things to people who ate each other, killed and raped each other daily and tortured people to death is besides the point...very lush photography and a great man against odds film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redford STINKS, as usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie about a mountain man wouldn't be so bad if the viewer didn't have to stare at Bob Redford's expressionless mug plastered on the screen almost 100% of the time.Johnson goes up into the hills because he just doesn't like people and towns and life and other horrible things like that. It's much better for him if he doesn't have to get a job, wash everyday, or do something useful with his life. It's in the mountains where Johnson can be constructive, like when he sleeps all day, when he commits arson in the woods, and when he screams at the Rockies because he's tired of having to murder an Indian every half hour.Tediously directed by Sid Pollack, but just about every role was well-cast, except for Redford and Delle Bolten (Johnson's squaw, 'Swan').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film loosely based on semi-legendary character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeremiah Johnson is a movie based on a malevolent and raucous character named Liver Eatin' Johnston who dropped out of society to hide out in the wilderness for a life of solitude. Unfortunately his supposed journey became more hectic and severe than he had planned. I read some reviews about the 2 books based on this character, "Crow Killer" and "Mountain Man". Many of the testimonies from his life are from third or fourth party members whose logic in reality and chronology are undoubtedly implausible. Many tall tales have been mentioned about Liver Eatin' Johnston leaving many historians incredulous. The few people who encountered him over his life speak of an extremely pernicious and rugged individual. The character portrayed by Robert Redford is a much toned down and soft version of this character. But putting aside tall tales and factual exaggerations, Jeremiah Johnson narrates the frontier saga of the lead character. The real character was only in his early twenties during the saga of which this film is supposed to take place. So Redford being about 35 is and looks a bit old for the role. But I will cast aside minor inaccuracies. This is a rather slow moving and deliberately paced film which is somewhat boring if you don't know what to look for. I'm hesitant to say this was a narcissistic engagement for Redford in that he milks this heroic and tough guy role for all it's worth. The problem is that Redford is not very believable. He's too sedate and sober in expression to reveal any angst or genuine rage. This character is supposed to be a mentally unbalanced maniac. But I know that the direction was intended to use Redford's star status and image (in his heyday) to capitalize on his popularity and slowly draw the audience into this man's world. Johnson nearly dies in the snow until he is saved and befriended by a cantankerous hillbilly (Will Geer) who teaches him the ways of the mountains. Oh, now this movie tries to get deep and postulate as if there is some wisdom that the flat landers are ignorant of. Mountains and nature can be harsh and one has to learn to adapt or else perish. And thus we are told the tale of Jeremiah Johnson and his life in the wilderness. I choose not to retell this worn out story, but I need to comment on the characters and actors and how this translates into creating people into stars:Redford is blonde and fair-skinned. He rose to popularity at a time when the Tall, Dark and Handsome look was overused. Redford arose to popularity in the early 70's and this movie is designed particularly for that purpose. Having his Aryan looks matched with a Native Blackfoot woman with broad cheekbones, full lips and chiseled features only gives him opportunity for bragging rights. Since the exotic appeal of an indigenous woman was new and somewhat taboo in that era, Redford capitalizes on this opportunity. It works yes. I was intrigued and even suspended to see any gratuitous sex. It is implied and not overtly revealed. Jeremiah is the leader of his new adopted family which he acquired reluctantly. This is another Hollywood attempt to make Redford look desirable by spurning dark, exotic woman and an orphan child. The boy, Caleb, is barely shown, but only with Redford to display Redford's integrity and humanitarian qualities. But his squaw, Swan, played by Delle Bolton has it made. She gets hitched to pretty boy Johnson. He carries her across water, plains and snow. He cooks, hunts, and builds a cabin with his own hands. This is how Redford's ego is fed; it wants to show him in a strong and capable image without exposing his personal flaws. Pollack also shows this by making her look dumb, submissive and sexy. I personally never thought Redford was all that to look at. He's blonde and has a nice smile, but that's about it. I never cared for his features and I think this movie is a pure example of how Hollywood tried to deify and mythologize his persona to unreasonable proportions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was just a simple tale of a "mountain man" and his life over a period of time surviving in the Rocky Mountains. The time period is the first half of the 19th century. Robert Redford plays "Jeremiah Johnson."The film shows Johnson's battles with the Crow Indians, his family life after he is "stuck" with an Indian bride and a young boy and some of the tragedies that befall all of them, as well as a few other people.Will Geer, a wonderful Native American actor, gets good billing in here but is only in the last 20 minutes! He also has no dialog. This is mainly a one-man show with Redford, and that's okay. He's usually interesting and he's always in beautiful movies, photography-wise.The scenery - filmed in Utah - is great stuff and looks awesome on widescreen DVD. It really needs to be seen in that format to be fully appreciated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thet warn't the real liver-eater.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say at the outset, I like this film despite its shortcomings. It's worth seeing &amp; Robert Redford played the title role as well as it could be played under the falsifications Hollywood imposed on it.The real Johnson's name was not Jeremiah, but I guess plain "John Johnson" lacks the euphony for box-office success. In any case, Johnson was better known to his contemporaries &amp; to posterity by either of his nicknames, Crow Killer or Liver-Eatin' Johnson ? &amp; for good reason. His bloody feud with the Crow tribe, condensed into the final half hour of the film, lasted decades &amp; was perhaps the defining factor of his legendary life. When this film was released in 1972, I don't guess audiences were ready for a hero who cut out the livers of his slain enemies &amp; ate them raw. Picture Redford with a half-eaten handful of dripping human liver, as the blood streams down his chin into his beard. Yet this grisly fact was a very real part of who Johnson was &amp; to flat-out ignore so elemental an aspect of his life is a Hollywood cop-out that deceptively sanitizes Johnson's savage life &amp; times.Maybe nowadays, in an era when cannibalistic serial-killer Hannibal Lector can elicit our sneaking admiration as he fries pieces of a bad cop's brain &amp; feeds them to him, the story of Liver-Eatin' Johnson could be told more honestly. He had a lot more adventures than we're ever shown &amp; in his long life he came in contact with a fascinating rogues' gallery of characters besides Del Gue &amp; Bear-claw Chris Lapp (splendidly played by Will Geer), who weren't given enough screen time to more fully develop their characters. Hatchet Jack Ireland, alive &amp; well when Johnson knew him, turns up conveniently dead in the film as a mere device to furnish Johnson his introduction to the hazards of wilderness existence. Not even mentioned were such famous mountain men as Portuguese Phillips, White-Eye Anderson, Mariano Modeno, Bigfoot Davis, Anton Sepulveda, Apache Joe Millardo, Grizzly Bill Miller, Mad Mose &amp; Wind River Jake, any of whose exploits might inspire a movie of their own.Perhaps the only way to do genuine cinematic justice to Liver-Eatin' Johnson &amp; his contemporaries would be to re-make the film as a mini-series ? la Lonesome Dove. And in these days, when damn near every film worth its salt ? not to mention quite a few that aren't ? is being re-made, I hope some worthy producer/director ? How 'bout you, Bob Redford? ? will take the hint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a rueful paean to the legend of the Wild West mountain man. It celebrates his stoic glory but doesn't flinch from a harsh life that very few were fit for.Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) is a man fresh out of the army who wants only to leave the world behind for the mountain wilderness of Colorado. He starts out as a real greenhorn, barely able to keep himself alive. Then he meets a grizzled old hunter of grizzly bears named Bear Claw (Will Geer), who takes Jeremiah in and teaches him how to survive. Leaving Bear Claw behind to make his own way, Jeremiah comes upon a family of settlers murdered by Indians. Only a mother driven mad by grief and a young boy survived. Jeremiah takes the boy into his care and then meets another mountain man named Del Gue (Stefan Gierasch), who pushes them into taking revenge on the Indians who slew the settlers. He also ends up getting Jeremiah married to a beautiful Indian girl named Swan (Delle Bolton). Jeremiah, Swan and the boy he names Caleb become a family, until Jeremiah is called upon to help settlers trapped in the mountains. That act of mercy has terrible consequences, leading to a cycle of revenge and death that make a legend of Jeremiah Johnson.The first thing you should know about this movie is that there's not much of a plot, in the sense of events connecting to other events and leading to a big climax. This story is more "Guy goes into mountains. Stuff happens". So, if you're looking for a fast-moving and clear narrative, you won't find it here.Aside from that, Jeremiah Johnson is a very enjoyable film. It's very much a "scenery Western" where the awesome beauty of the Rocky Mountains is as important to the story as any character. It makes a great setting for a screenplay that tries to say as much with silence as it does with dialog. Will Geer and Stefan Gierasch play colorful characters without making them into caricatures. Delle Bolton and Josh Albee don't let the fact that they never speak of word of English prevent them from expressing real emotion. Robert Redford has to carry the movie as a very unflashy and stoic man, but he manages to find the subtleties in someone who wants to make his own life away from the rest of the world.This movie also deserves praise for it's careful and balanced portrayal of the conflict between white settlers and Indian tribes. It doesn't shy away from the dangers Indians posed, but it frames their violent attacks in the context of a people whose land is being invaded by alien outsiders. The story feels no need to condemn or justify either side of the white/Indian conflict.Jeremiah Johnson is also film that everyone who's ever flirted with Libertarianism should probably see. It demonstrates the allure of the lone man freed from the burdens and responsibilities of society. It's also very clear on how "you vs. the world" can be a punishingly brutal life.This is a good movie that's held up quite well over time. You might need to have a little patience with it, but it will be worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make them like this anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How has this one slipped under my radar so far?Jeremiah Johnson is based on the real-life story of the guy. In these cases, people often demand total factual accuracy and will reject fictional aspects. I don't like this approach. For me, a movie is about imagining, dreaming, and inspiring. It doesn't need to be a true story. If I can connect with it, then I will regard it as REAL, in which case I can allow it to have an effect on me.This movie certainly had an effect on me. It is magnificent, I think I will watch it regularly in the future - until I decide to live in the mountains myself :). It shows life in the wild is a very viable alternative and something humans are well suited to. Shame that nowadays we need to get all kinds of permits to even hunt for food. Instead you are expected to stuff yourself with factory farmed junk, living in an excessive 'shelter' made from industrial products, paying through the nose for a mortgage, tap water and gas.I will not talk about the movie's plot, if you like to dream about freedom, life in the wilderness, organic and indigenous living, then this film is a must watch. The scenery is awesome, the pacing is perfect, the soundtrack is fantastic.I've read comments about how Robert Redford, who is an avid Native American supporter, was willing to take on a role like this, killing lots of natives. These comments are totally deluded and are missing the point. There's nothing anti-native American about this movie, or about Jeremiah himself. He doesn't go out to kill natives, he simply kills people who hurt him or want to hurt him. Living in the wilderness, he is pretty much a native himself, but living by his own rules, rather than the rules of those tribes. In fact the very satisfying final scene completely dispels this ignorant notion.I have 2 issues with Jeremiah's way of living.One is the use of guns. Obviously, guns are made by the foolish empire one desires to leave behind. In my opinion they are totally needless for hunting, and can only serve as a destructive warring weapon, causing unnecessary injuries or deaths. It takes special skills to set traps and make bows and arrows, or other primitive weapons, but industry made guns do not belong in the wild. It's a great shame that post-European natives as well as white survivalists have regarded them a necessity.My other issue is his loneliness. I don't think it's necessary for survivalists or wilderness-men to go it alone. Of course he eventually had a woman and a boy, but neither were his own choice really. In my opinion the big extended family should and could be the base of life for people that decide to go this route. I understand though that very few eligible women are interested in this lifestyle.Obviously, these are not criticisms of the movie, but rather of the protagonist's life choices. In no way does it affect my rating of the film. 11 out of 10 if possible :).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to start and stop without cause or resolution. What the hell is the point of this thing? The soundtrack has terrible lyrics in it that remind me of some "Wilderness Family" movie for kids. It felt like some bad made-for-TV movie. Redford is such a stiff too. He has no soul, no happiness, no sorrow. He just sits there with his hair and looks at us... oh yeah... and kills a truck-load of "savage" black-foot indians. His short-lived family doesn't work. They quickly try to show scenes of affection before they get killed, but who cares?Years later, another movie with another "square-jawed stiff" came out called "7 years in Tibet". I hate the fact that I've wasted hours of my life watching both of these bore-fests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Editing , Not Enough Decent Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a massive fright when I saw this because I misheard some of the early dialogue when someone says to the title character - " You just came to molest my hunt " which had me thinking the title of the movie should have been BILL CLINTON and not JEREMIAH JOHNSON , but I do assure you I did realise within seconds what the actual line was This is a movie that's let down by a lack of dialogue since much of the narrative involves a lone character who has no one to bounce lines off , that's why a lot of books like Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND are somewhat unfilmable because many pages are devoted to a character living alone with thought process informing the reader as to what they're thinking It's also a very poorly edited movie where we see wild wolves attack Johnson which is both confusing and laughable . A jump cut leads to a wolf biting Johnson's hand then another jump cut to the wolf biting his leg . It's also obvious that the " attack " is done by filming a real wolf jumping then cutting to someone throwing a cuddly stuffed wolf at Redford ! There's also a very confusing scene involving Johnson fighting an Indian where he falls in a river , cut to a mountain range then a log cabin where Johnson kills and Indian in a fight . Is it the same fight ? the same Indian ? You tell me The real Jeremiah Johnson was a rabid Indian hater involved in a blood feud with Indians but this movie seems produced to appeal to a PG audience hence the story has been toned down which might have ruined the potential somewhat if the haphazard editing and production values hadn't done so</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Jeremiah Johnson' is the story of a fronteirsman who lives in the mountains and befalls some hard times with the Native Americans. Although the cinematography/photography is good and some excellent music, the film's plot was too slow for my liking. It's a very analytical story of the life of this man who lives in the mountains and his way of life, and it is a powerful film in that sense, but I failed to be captivated or really interested by this film. I also thought that it was too long to sit through, and the story and the character just did not interest me enough. Unless you have a big interest in this era of history or have heard about the film and think you may like it, then you might, but it is slow. I would compare it to films like 'Dances With Wolves', but it is not for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew we were doomed from the moment I heard the toe-curling ballad at the opening of the film about JJ and his decision to become a mountain man. Yawn. It was almost as bad as the refrain from a mercifully little-known Robert Mitchum western/comedy called The Good Guys and The Bad Guys which ran, "Marshal Flagg, Marshall Flagg, beneath his shirt, his shoulders sag".This film clearly has the sentimental appeal to some kind of mythological long-lost past that so many Americans seem to hearken back to. Look at this comment from another reviewer. "It reminds me of my days when we used to go on hikes in the woods and we would sing the theme song with me in my little coonskin (it's fake for all you animal lovers) cap". Oh dear...The film is crammed with the most agonizing Hollywood clichés you'll ever come across. The savage dumb injuns - oh, apart from the one who speaks French - the compliant injun squaw who manages to learn the word "yes" thanks to our hero and gets her face all roughed up by her paramour's manly beard, bless her - this of course is the perfect excuse for him to shave it off so the ladies can go all weak at the knees when they see Redford's lumpy old face in the flesh at last - the grumpy old timer whose only purpose in life is to hunt grizzlies and who excruciatingly refers to Redford as "pilgrim", the bald geezer who manages a nonchalant sense of derring do even though he's been buried up to his neck in sand by the injuns, the orphan shocked into muteness and the woman driven to distraction by the horrors they've witnessed, the hilarious wolf fight complete with cuddly toys, it just goes on and on.Yes, of course the scenery is fantastic but this is hardly a saving grace. You can thank nature for that not Pollack simply pointing a camera at and panning across it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today in my AP United States History class, I assumed that I would be enlightened with a feature film about United States history. When I walked in, I did not expect to see a flick like Jeremiah Johnson. Let me say this, it blew my mind how much of a stereotypical view of the world this movie is. Apparently, Indians are the stupidest people in the world; Robert Redford has an orgasm after he teaches someone how to say "yes"; and everyone has a heavy drawl. Now I realize that it had something to do with Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis, but I sure hope my character wasn't shaped by this retard. To date, I have seen half of the movie. I don't really want to watch the second half, but I will be forced to. Couple of things I did like: 1)zoom-up of Redford which makes him look stupider. 2)"I make damn good biscuits boy" (In case you didn't know, I was being sarcastic) Something I really did like: my vote 1/10</fullReview>
