		<shortDescription>"The Stanford Prison Experiment" is a dramatic true story and a startling look at human nature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Would you rather be a prison guard or a prisoner?" That question was put to young college men who answered a newspaper ad in "The Stanford Prison Experiment" (R, 2:02). The movie is based on a real-life psychology department study conducted at California's Stanford University in August 1971. After being screened using a questionnaire and an interview, 24 students were chosen as paid participants in the 14-day experiment (each making $15 per day). In spite of the above question being asked of all applicants, participants were assigned as either guards or prisoners by coin flips. Faculty offices in the basement of the university's psychology building were transformed into a mock prison wing. Dr. Philip Zimbardo, the psychology professor who led a team of graduate students and advisors in conducting the experiment, wanted to test the theory that conflicts between guards and inmates are caused by the men's individual personality traits. A documentary about the experiment was released in 1992 and a German film loosely based on the experiment came out in 2001, followed by an American remake in 2010, but this is the first feature film which attempts to dramatize the actual events that took place. As we see Zimbardo (Billy Crudup) going through his selection process, we meet his team (James Wolk, Keir Gilchrist and Gaius Charles) and the student participants (including "prisoners" Ezra Miller, Tye Sheridan and Thomas Mann, along with Michael Angarano as a "guard" who based his authoritative persona on a sadistic captain in the movie "Cool Hand Luke"). The guards are briefed and given generic uniforms. The prisoners are "arrested" by actual local police officers and sent to the "prison" to "await trial". The guards process the prisoners, give them uniforms (crude smocks and stocking caps) and taught to only identify themselves by their prisoner number and to address all guards as "Mr. Correctional Officer". The guards initially perform their duties tentatively while there's a lot of eye-rolling by the prisoners. Then something happens.Both the guards and the prisoners quickly adapt to their roles to a surprising degree and even internalize them. The guards become increasingly menacing and sadistic. The prisoners' actions vary, but all are in character as some comply while others resist the guards' authority and talk of escape and some are even pushed to their psychological limits. Zimbardo and his team watch and listen to all the goings-on via closed-circuit camera and hidden microphones. Even when the guards violate the rules they've been given and the experiment seems close to getting out of hand, Zimbardo repeatedly forbids his team from intervening. A former San Quentin inmate (Nelson Ellis) joins the team as an adviser and gets involved more than he's comfortable with. An actual priest (Albert Malafronte) speaks with each of the prisoners and the team even holds a mock parole board. When Zimbardo's girlfriend (Olivia Thirlby) stops by and observes parts of the experiment, she criticizes Zimbardo's methods and expresses concern for the well-being of the prisoners. The professor insists that his experiment could bring out positive change in prisons everywhere and wants to continue, convinced that he can keep things under control. "The Stanford Prison Experiment" is a compelling dramatization that really sneaks up on you. Just when you're tempted to write off what you're seeing as a ridiculous exercise, you start to see what the professor sees ? the remarkable transformation in the student participants from role-players to young men living and, in the case of the guards, actually relishing their roles. We also see what Zimbardo can't see ? that he and his team are becoming part of the experiment themselves. The cast includes few, if any recognizable actors, but there is no weak link in this chain of performances and Crudup is particularly outstanding. Tim Talbot's script and the film's look realistically evoke the spirit of the early 70s, while the score and the cinematography are both creative and effective at drawing us into the film's narrative. Little-known director Kyle Patrick Alvarez does a great job of pulling these elements together.Dr. Zimbardo's experiment made him an in-demand expert on the psychology of authority and on inmate-prison guard relations. He testified before Congress after major prison riots at San Quentin and Attica shortly after his experiment took place. After he noticed striking similarities between the results of his experiment and the abuse of prisoners at the hands of American soldiers in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison in 2004, Zimbardo wrote a book discussing that connection. He has also lectured on his findings to audiences all over the world. None of this should be surprising to anyone who sees "The Stanford Prison Experiment". It's a dramatic depiction of a landmark psychology experiment and a startling window into human nature. It also happens to be a fascinating and entertaining film. "A-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ugly side of the human condition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been fascinated by the original Stanford prison experiment. It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that's been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can't quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn't make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today's technology and young talent. There's a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.While it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy's. At first it's disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it's having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There's always a reminder that it isn't real, but it doesn't stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.There is a tendency in the film's inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they're focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner's rebellions and reluctances. He's missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we're left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.On the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn't remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he's finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo's girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn't hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.The Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It's graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I've been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it's a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary look at Power and the Human Psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film blew me away. I first saw it at the IFC Center in New York with an average expectation. The sound editing is the first thing you notice. It's crisp, clean, and wields its own power that is advantageous to the narrative. The narrative centers around the experiment that takes place at the Stanford University in the 70's. It follows the students who participate and how their lives immediately change for the worst. Now the film feels and looks like the era with great costumes and set work. Everything from the computers to the coffee mugs immerses you ever so deeper into the emotional toil that intensifies with each scene. A smart move I would like to mention from the casting directors is the fact they used actors from children's films and popular TV shows then start beating them up and messing with their characters' minds. For any millennial, they would instantly recognize the actors which gives the millennial a sense of familiarity with the characters, and at that sense feel more towards the behavior and mistreatment of those children actor's character. Overall, I was pleased with the film as it's theme and historical significance played in my mind throughout the whole day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but watch Das Experiment instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is based on a true story, blah blah blah. It's a good one as well! Not the amazing ingenious movie and certainly not the thriller that "Das Experiment" was... If you can find it at your local video store, go and get it and watch this instead! Don't get me wrong, the movie is a nice attempt, really interesting and raising all kinds of moral questions and dilemmas. The actors were true and professional all the way and overall, this is more than a movie for a pleasant afternoon... The science behind the experiment was kind of crappy, but I guess back then, psychologists were a bit on the rough side and not too cautious with experimental parameters, etc. Anyways, if you want the thrill and the tense, "Das Experiment" is what you should be looking for. This movie was unparalleled. Better yet, watch this one first and then "Das Experiment"...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes compelling, sometimes tedious, but ultimately as flawed as it's protag's ill-conceived crackpot theses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a number of films with this same basic premise... it's not new. People have been riffing on what I like to call the Milgram plot now for years. Throw a bunch of people together, divide them in half and give one half absolute authority and no rules, the other half no rights. It can produce a very tense, uncomfortable, interesting movie.Unfortunately, Kyle Patrick Alvarez's film of Phil Zimbardo's reckless, misguided, and absolutely unscientific experiment on a handful of young men in the Summer of '71 in a Stanford campus building just doesn't deliver enough to merit its 122 minute slog.It isn't that the performances aren't good (well, except for Crudup, who's a disaster, coming across as a guy too dim to even be employed at a hot car lot). It's the waffling tone of the film and the indecisive script by Tim Talbott that ultimately condemn it to ineffectiveness. Billy Crudup's hamminess and Talbott and Alvarez's misguided intentions certainly don't help.For a good three-quarters of the film, we're treated to a gleeful, gloating, willfully-ignorant portrayal of Zimbardo by Crudup, and a fierce build-up of unrepentant sadism from the mock guards under his control, only to suddenly find the mad doctor's heart soften by the film's last reel --- neither convincing or explicable --- and an end-crawl blurb that makes Zimbardo out to be some kind of misunderstood academic saint. The film is ill-conceived and its aims incoherent, if not completely missing. Even though we are at times an overly litigious society, if this thinly disguised exercise in megalomania had gone on today, Zimbardo would be burned to the ground (and rightly so), buried till he choked in civil suits on mental and physical abuse charges, or at the very least reckless endangerment. Stanford would throw him under the bus faster than it could crush him (again, rightly so).So what does this really leave us as viewers? Just a lot of sadism and degradation at the hands of a "scientist" who doesn't even seem to know the meaning of the term "independent control group" when quizzed by a colleague... a man so warped that he brings along his ex-con "subject" or buddy (never was clear) to interject the man's uneducated, obviously over-emotional opinions into the fray to muddy things further.What's next, a glorification of Joseph Mengele's good intentions?Despite the good, sometimes terrifying performance from most of the game young cast, The Stanford Prison Experiment is as meaningless and facile as the case on which it's based.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly intriguing, very well-acted, retains the real-life effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quick thoughts before I go: Very impressive. I was afraid a film based on this would be either too pandering and surface-level or sway too much on the "informational" side. The film did a greeeeat job of really driving home its essential point while still offering an intriguing film experience. It did a great job of developing its characters. And although there are unsurprising over-dramatizations in the story, it always kept in line with the real-life tone of the whole thing. Perhaps the film makes Zimbardo a little too cruel, but Crudup did a fine job of making him feel like a human being. It could've easily failed, but it didn't. Ezra Miller was fine until he needed to go really big. He's the only one who provides some false notes in an otherwise brilliant ensemble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chillingly bad science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a dramatization of a real psychological experiment that took place at the Stanford University in 1971. The motivation was to study the dynamics of individuals who were arbitrarily placed into roles as prisoners and guards at a simulated prison. Since none of the study participants were actual criminals or correction officers, the idea was to glean insight into the psychology of the power imbalance that arises from the situation, as opposed to the people involved.Things famously degraded quickly and the experiment was terminated after only six days. Multiple guards displayed sadistic traits and performed acts of psychological and even (to a smaller degree) physical torture, all overseen, permitted, and arguably encouraged by "superintendent" Philip Zimbardo, the study's creator.The conditions the participants were exposed to were reprehensible, but even worse is that ultimately this was simply bad science, making the whole endeavor a cruel waste of time. The experiment lacked much of the basic rigor required, as highlighted in the film by a verbatim repetition of an actual conversation Mr. Zimbardo had with a colleague who questioned some of the basic scientific methodologies being utilized in the study.Zimbardo himself committed what I would consider borderline criminal acts such as initially denying "prisoner" participants the option to leave when requested (to instill in them the belief that their situation was, in fact, real), which came frighteningly close to converting the "study" into a criminal act of kidnapping in my opinion.Zimbardo explains this as him getting "to close" to the experiment, but personally I'm not particularly sympathetic to that argument. When you watch the actual clips from the study and read the notes, I'm more inclined to think that Mr. Zambardo himself had a sadistic streak that he failed to control for a time. Honestly, I think the man should have faced criminal charges for his role in this fiasco.In the end, some good did come out of this experiment in that it created a push for establishing standards and controls for psychological experiments in the future.Despite knowing the actual outcome, I still felt anxious about the fates of the young men involved, a testament to the power of the acting and directing here. To me, this movie is a chilling and visceral reminder of how easy it is to create conditions that foster cruelty and dehumanization. A rewarding, if somewhat depressing, film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good dramatized telling about arguably the most controversial psychological experiment ever done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about arguably the most controversial psychological experiments ever done, which generated a lot of attention in the media in that time. It is a dramatized version of the experiment that has a thought provoking aspect to it. This horrifying drama/thriller is a heart breaker and is told with a slow pace which gives you enough time to absorb the events that happen in the movie.The movie starts with three professors who interview a few student to participate on their 2 week experiment. The professors rented a few rooms and a hallway at Stanford University to simulate a prison. The selected group of student are chosen based on their mental history and their ability to endure mental setbacks. Half of the students were chosen to be guards and half were chosen to be prisoners. The professors behind the experiment have had a camera installed in the hallway so they can monitor everything that is happening. At the beginning everything seems under control. But it doesn't take long before everything begins to escalate.The movies goes straight to the point fast. The students are getting paid so they are doing what they are told to do. The guards must present authority and the prisoners must be obedient. However, the students playing the guards want more and are creating their own bully characters during the experiment. The guards are careless and are humiliating the prisoners most of the time, which make this movie hard to watch. The first and second act are done with great subtlety. The mental torturing of the prisoners serves a purpose and isn't just for shock value. The professors who are watching the proceedings are all having different opinions about the proceedings that are happening and are starting discussions about morality, motivation, behavior and boundaries. The transition from different perspectives on this experiment is done really well by director Kyle Patrick Alvarez. Tim Talbott does a great job with his writing. The thought provoking aspect in his writing is one of the strongest points in this film. The second act of the film builds up really slow to compensate for the small first act. It is unsettling to watch the guards in their mistreating behavior, while the professors don't interfere. There is no motivation for the guards to act the way they are behaving, except for the fact that they can. A big reason why the film is hard to watch is because of the solid acting of the whole cast. The young actors portray their characters in such a convincing way, that it feels real. This movie has a lot of heating emotional moments where the actors can show their full potential. This film will be a great addition to their resume. Ezra Miller and Tye Sheridan get special mentions because both get a lot of screen time, and they show that they can carry a movie. They show why they are one of the Hollywood's biggest talents. Even though the first and second act are solid in every aspect of filmmaking, the movie loses its touch in the last act. I won't go in to what specifically happens, but the subtlety of the storytelling disappears and the slow pace kills the momentum of the climax. The last act relies too much on shock value and the suspense is diminished because of the repetitive scene transitions in the last moments of the film. Overall, this is a solid movie that creates discussion between groups with different standpoints of this subject. The acting is phenomenal by the talented cast and there is a clear direction. The slow pace is a tool well used in the first two acts and adds to the suspense the director wants to communicate. Even though the film falls apart in the last act, I would recommend this movie to watch. But only to the ones with a strong stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engrossing Venture Into The Effect Of Power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building.Rarely do we see such an ensemble of up and comers really given the chance to act. The Stanford Prison Experiment is in my opinion an exercise in profound acting ability. It simply does not work without the performances of its cast, it truly is a testament to their talent that it plays out in an engrossing manner, compared to what could have been a ridiculous one. Director Kyle Patrick Alvarez works wonders in his constricted set that manages to captivate and fascinate the viewer. The films aesthetic manages to encapsulate its secluded and underlying darkness in an almost haunting fashion.Billy Crudup puts in a fantastic performance as a man who is willing to push his experiment to the end of the line whitout regarding the emotional well-being of his personal genie pigs. Ezra Miller and Tye Sheridan play two of the stand out prisoners taking part in the experiment, with Miller giving an emotionally outlandish performance and Sheridan retaining his subtle brilliance (shown in previous films like Mud). Thomas Mann, Johnny Simmons and Nicholas Braunsll all contribute essential performances with each of their character being fully realized. The stand out however, is Michael Angarano who is absolutely phenomenal in his role of "Christopher Archer" an almost Fletcher (Whiplash) type character who is both repulsive and mesmerizing at the same time. I look forward to seeing his, along with all of the other actors work in the future.Where this film stumbles is pacing, some scenes are drawn out too long and others cut to short with a better flow could have let this films message of the effect of power on the powerful and the powerless conclude in a more ominous way. Also the way in which certain lead characters reach there breaking points is not fully explored to the extent it could be, when these characters leave the experiment it only results in lowering fixation on the film.Overall, I did find this film to be a real standout in showcasing the performances of its actors, its story could have been executed with a better flow but it is nevertheless gripping throughout. Its themes are extremely relevant today and the abuse of power is evident in our society. It is also able to explore this theme from the other side giving us an examination into the effect power has on the person who receives it. This is an achievement for all involved and it is the type film that could go so wrong but instead, with the help of a talented director, screenwriter and spellbinding actors, it goes so right. I am going to give the Stanford Prison Experiment an 8.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Future Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark my words, "The Stanford Prison Experiment" will become a cult classic. This film gets so many things right, that it is truly shocking for it to receive such neglect, under any excuse than it simply flying under the radar of moviegoers.From the get-go, "The Stanford Prison Experiment" hooks you in and never lets go. After a brief selection process, two groups are formed for the experiment: the inmates and the guards. For no reason other than a coin flip, each member is delegated to a group, which is a surprisingly large motif of this film. The first inmate the viewer meets is Daniel Culp, thereafter referred to as 8612 (played by Ezra Miller) who plays arguably the largest part of an inmate. As the film goes on, the importance of identities is quickly forgotten. Deindividuation(separation from one's identity) is the theme of the film, and purpose of the experiment; however, time dilation is another important motif.Another of the film's breakout attributes was the direction and set design. The film takes place in the early 1970's, so the set design truly reflects that, with "retro" technology such as SONY LCD televisions and antiquated elevators that have long since broken down. This set design is aided by the direction of Kyle Patrick Alvarez, who has cleverly broken the movie into "Acts" as though it is a Shakespearean play, brutally being topped off by the ominous, white text on the background denoting the days. The first day in the movie takes up around 25-30 minutes of screen time, but it is finally signaled to end with the text, "Day 2" appearing on screen. This inclusion is particularly important in helping the viewer empathize with the inmates to how long their stay truly is, which at this point is simply unknown.Saving the best for last, "The Stanford Prison Experiment" has incredible acting for such a C-list cast. As mentioned, Ezra Miller (of "Perks of Being a Wallflower") is cast as "the" main inmate, while the villains of the story, Dr. Philip Zimbardo (played by Billy Crudup) and Jesse Fletcher (played by Nelsan Ellis) are largely dismissible. The best performances in the film did not, in fact, come from the "main villains" or from any inmates, but rather, the guards, whom one can sympathize with. The guards go largely unnamed, however, their actors, Michael Angarano and Nicholas Braun easily stole the show by being despicable, yet justified. The film follows the journey of how these men became the monsters they act to be, and this fact leaves the viewer with a sense of anxiety that will leave them biting their nails for comfort. To boot, Michael Angarano delivers some of the most crisp and powerful uses of "the F word" I have ever heard.To top it all off, "The Stanford Prison Experiment" is based on a true story. All of it, is in one form or another, based in fact, straight from the journal of the real-life Dr. Philip Zimbardo.The final scene of the film is the one that leaves the most impact, though. The final scene is a debriefing of the patients. Ezra Miller and Michael Angarano, two sworn enemies, are now talking to each other as civil human beings, and remark at how simple it was to see themselves in the other role. Overall, a masterpiece with minimal flaws.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely gripping and one of the all time most difficult movies to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps one of the best movies I have seen in 2015 and yet I would think twice before watching it again. The Stanford Prison experiment is a taut and intriguing drama hat manages to thrill you for most of its run time as well as making you terribly uneasy as you ponder as to why people behave as they do in the movie. Inspire by the real life prison experiment conducted at Stanford University in 1971 using college students where some would be assigned as guards and some prisoners and were stationed in a mock prison for 14 days within the Stanford University premises itself. It proved to be one of the most disastrous and widely criticized psychology experiments ever conducted by mankind and was shut down in just 6 days.The movie doesn't spend too much time on buildup as you start feeling the claustrophobia and sense of loss of freedom quite early on. The script has been top notch as well as the direction. The best part about the script that I loved was that it remained truthful to the actual events and the documentary style cinematography added so much realism to the experience. The other impressive aspect of this movie is the acting. The casting doesn't involve any big superstar names, rather most of them are well known in the indie and television scenes. Phillip Zambardo's character development was pulled off by Billy Crudup with absolute finesse while Ezra Miller and Thomas Mann left a lasting impression with the devolution of their respective characters. The rest of the cast, especially the ones who played the prisoners were great as well, as they were constantly able to maintain the sense of helplessness and psychological deterioration throughout. The main star of the film, however, is Michael Angarano. His character is what everybody would love to hate. I used to remember Angarano as this charming kid in Almost Famous and Lords of Dogtown and I was quite shocked to witness the whole sadistic and borderline sociopath side of him. The only shortcoming I felt was the overall pacing. The movie slowed down at some points; especially during the first half (I am not going to spoil anything) and it could've done a better editing job. Some of the cast, especially on the guard side could've used a bit more screen time since the camera was almost entirely focused on Michael Angarano. However, this doesn't diminish the quality of movie in any way. It's a great albeit cringe worthy study of human psyche and the movie will leave a long trail of questions for you to think about. Overall, The Stanford Prison Experiment is undoubtedly a great cinematic achievement both in terms of visual style, storyline, acting and direction. This is not exactly a family movie or something you want to watch with your girlfriend and definitely not a feel-good experience, but if you are a fan of psychological thrillers, then this film will give you a run for your money. My IMDb rating is 8.1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too narrow in the focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's subject is indeed intriguing, similar to what the other movie Experimenter talks about, that people can deliberately abuse power even if it's just a fake power. On the other hand the prisoners also tend to let things happen to them because they see the authority, again even if they know that the authority is a fake one. But I think the movie becomes boring after a while. Yes it's well acted, I give you that, but the movie didn't present any variations beside the visiting day. There's just literally repetitions of the same practice of the psychological torture, albeit with new participants as replacements. With the movie didn't introducing the background of the experiment, it makes the two hour duration feels so long and boring. But the acting is something good. It's good that these young talents are acting out the real reactions of psychological torture to incite fear on the audience's eyes. Ezra Miller's acting of faking the freak out makes the suspense grew. Thomas Mann's character displaying resolve is also something nice to see.</fullReview>

The cast is terrific, it's directed and edited artfully and intelligently, and it never falls into what would have been easy exploitation or exaggeration of a true event. Indeed, whole sections of the screenplay were taken from the actual transcripts. Yet somehow this reenactment of psychologist Dr. Philip Zimbardo's famous 1971 experiment - where students played prisoners and guards, and quickly the roles started taking over until things got out of hand - is less chilling and powerful than what I expected.Having seen an educational documentary that included excerpts from the tapes of the actual experiment, I found the film just couldn't match the power of the real thing, in spite of tons of talent and good intentions. I was always aware these were actors and I was watching a movie.That said, there is a lot that's worthwhile here. The always wonderful Billy Crudup finds all the darkness in the ego-driven Zimbardo, but never lets us forget he's also a human being who believed he was doing something important, even if he has momentarily lost the forest for the trees in a big way. All the supporting players bring complexity to roles that could have felt very sketchy. And certainly a film about an experiment that showed just how easy it is for a sense of power over others to distort the personality of almost anyone is timely and important.I just hope that now someone can get a hold of and re-release ether the very little seen documentary of the same name, or create a new one with the actual footage. That would be an even more powerful addition to the study of the dark sides of all of our natures.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a fun watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanford University Professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo (Billy Crudup) conducts a two week experiment and volunteers get paid $15/day. He randomly chooses nine guards and nine prisoners. He's trying to strip away the prisoners' individuality as he allows the guards free rein.This is grinding tough watch. Essentially, the audience is put in prison with the volunteers. The flaws in the experiment is obvious right from the start. The most compelling character is Zimbardo but his drive to maintain the experiment isn't examined deep enough. The relentless oppression in the prison is suffocating. The true experiment is really about Zimbardo. It's not that surprising that people under pressure and isolation start doing ugly things. Without guidance, Archer is playing the guard like a movie villain. That in itself is fake. The biggest unanswered question is what drives Zimbardo. His refusal to end the experiment especially with girlfriend Christina Maslach is the most compelling part of the movie. The acting from everybody is great. This is not a fun watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took twelve years for them to get it here, but thank goodness they did. The Stanford Prison Experiment is the unbelievable true story of the university prison simulation - students were hired to play prisoners or guards in a 14-day study of human behaviour.The results were incredible, both of the study and the movie - basically the guards pretty quickly begin to abuse their supposed power. The story never really goes further than that, but the beauty of the movie is being able to get under the skin of the characters. The motives of the guards, at first, are lighthearted - they're having fun in what could be a boring situation, but your sympathy always lies with the victims. As the movie progresses, the intensity escalates and emotions begin to pour out, not in a forced way, but in a way that feels very heart-felt and genuine.A lot of that is down to the (mostly unknown) cast. Tye Sheridan and Ezra Miller, as the two main prisoners, are outstanding. The study's leader, Dr Zimbardo (Billy Crudup), could be seen as the overarching villain of the movie if it wasn't so grounded - his decisions are understandable (after all, he is studying them), but morally arguable. The chief guard, Michael Angarano, does walk close to being unrealistically aggressive, but still manages to stay convincing.With such a low budget, this movie could easily have fallen apart and become clichéd and fake. Alvarez did a great job of keeping the movie grounded with the right amount of emotion without it going over the top.4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, I thought I was dealing with another One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with the action taking place in a make-shift jail instead of an asylum. The ways things were going, I thought both guards and inmates would need an asylum.This is basically a true story of an experiment of creating a prison at the college to see the effects of prison life on those concerned. People volunteered to be guards and prisoners. From almost the beginning of the experiment, things head downhill and go awry quite quickly due to the brutal treatment of the guards.The purpose of this was to see the dehumanizing process and how it would affect the inmates. Things got so bad that I thought that the superintendent in reality was evil and would keep the "inmates" longer than the agreement stated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it has material to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanford Prison Experiment is an actual event that took place in 1971, when the study of the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner vs prison guard took place at the University of Stanford. This movie is about that event, completely accurate if you follow the information how the experiment went.What is amazingly appealing here is the experiment itself, which moved the borders of a knowledge on human psychology. The main point is that it proved how quickly can humans loose their identity under the circumstances, bringing on a surface much grimmer perceptive. The results are widely used after, but not only for the good cause. What is interesting here is that the whole phenomenology of Reality Shows can be seen as grounded exactly on the finding of Stanford Prison Experiment: basically, it is a story of mass manipulation backgrounds.A few words about the movie, of course: I am perfectly happy with the outcome, as it succeeded to evoke the original experiment: the story, the characters, the set and costumes, the tension - everything is there. The magnificent roles of Ezra Miller, Michael Angarano and Tye Sheridan are also something that should be underlined, however all crew did a marvelous job.If you are looking at this movie as a movie, fictional story, well maybe you wouldn't like the plot. But once again, it is from beginning to the based on true story. And a story which really have deep impact on humankind, perhaps deeper than we think.But if you think just a bit of a power of the real experiment, real psychological drama inside, amazing message that it is carrying, perfect roles of the "students" - prisoners and guards, and after that the social implications that are happening today, the movie and its story is basically a masterpiece. Nothing more, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Stanford Prison Experiment is a remake of the German movie Das Experiment. I'm not going to discuss which one is the best because that's pointless. I just think all remakes are pointless unless they are much better, and that's just not the case with The Stanford Prison Experiment. Nevertheless it's interesting to watch, also a little disturbing in a way. I don't know how people would put up with this kind of mental abuse if they were in that case. I for sure would not put with any of it, and I would just attack the guards physically. Now for the acting it's all fine, no Oscar winning acting but also not bad soap acting either. The movie is worth a watch. What would have been interesting was if you would turn the roles after one week. Make the guards prisoners and the prisoners guards. See what would happen then after all the mental abuse they had to put up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting dramatization of a failed experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kyle Patrick Alvarez does well in the director's chair, and brings together a rather believable cast of young actors in this film about the psychologist Philip Zimbardo, and his famous experiment about authority and obedience.Previous films have been based on this event like "The Experiment" (2010) and it's German predecessor "Das Experiment" (2001), where several groups of students were to create a mock prison in the basement of one of the university's buildings. Students were separated into two groups of 'prisoners' or 'guards'. They are monitored to see how authority would be maintained, and left to their own devices. The official experiment at Stanford was supposed to last 14 days but was canceled after only six.What makes this movie interesting to watch is the combination of the characters interaction with each other, and watching the events of the experiment unfold. Billy Crudup portrays the determined, and somewhat passionate Zimbardo during a crucial time in his career. Crudup does well when balancing different sides of this character, when it comes to his passion for his experiment and his unethical approach in implementing it. The participants themselves are well acted as well, most notably Michael Angarano as the lead guard, and both Ezra Miller and Tye Sheridan as in their role as the student prisoners. I thought that dynamic of authority and obedience was interesting to watch, although you can feel the disconnect between the attitudes portrayed by these young actors and attitudes and concerns you would expect to be expressed from students in the 1970's, although the setting and costumes did excel in making it look like that particular decade.Overall it's very enjoyable to watch. The stresses felt between the two groups of students is very present, and the pressure on the experimenters is certainly expressed in the film, but perhaps the scope of the experiment was lost in the confines of making it more dramatic.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating, yet disturbing look at a college experiment gone mad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stanford Prison Experiment is a film, directed by Kyle Patrick Alvaraz, that honestly did not get the attention it deserves and was way overlooked due to its limited release. This film takes an enthralling, yet dark look at a controversial project that took place at Stanford University back in 1971. The film dramatizes the story of twenty-five Stanford University students who were selected by Psychology professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo (played by Billy Crudup) to participate in two-week project known as the "Stanford Prison Experiment". This involved each student being placed in positions as either a prisoner or a guard. With half of students taking positions as guards and the other half taking positions as prisoners, the idea of the experiment was to teach the students the psychological conditioning of felons who are thrown in prison, although it is only vaguely stated in the film. A hallway was cleared out with faculty and staff cleaning out offices and placing spring beds to give the empty rooms the looks of prison cells. However, the experiment quickly went awry when the students taking the roles of prisoners began taking the project too seriously, up to the point where the students were no longer clear whether they were still doing a project, or the real thing.Featuring the supporting cast of Ezra Miller, Johnny Simmons, Michael Angarano, Moises Arias, Nicholas Braun, Thomas Mann, Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Ki Hong Lee, and several others; this docudrama pulls no punches when portraying the events of this controversial experiment that turned out to be more troubling than Professor Zimbardo as well as the staff expected it to be, and this is all done by the strong screenplay and direction by Kyle Patrick Alvaraz and Tim Talbott. As this is based on true events, the scenes here are quite fact-based and faithful to the real-life event. The film focuses on how these students acting as guards take the project way too seriously and treat the students acting as prisoners in a very degrading manner, and thus, robbing them of their innocence and their humanity. We watch as these characters develop, and their lines between right and wrong gradually become blurred. Lot of the material is very tense and disturbing, and some of which get to the point of being discomforting to watch. Aside from this is a subplot involving heated debates between Professor Zimbardo and the staff on whether or not the project is going in the right direction, which plays a significant role in the story. Director Kyle Patrick Alvaraz and writer Tim Talbott handle with the story very maturely, and with authenticity. The writing by Talboot is ingenious, and the direction this film goes is quite interesting, and by the end, will leave audiences filled with questions.The characters are also handled very solidly throughout the picture, and the performances are creditable for this. Billy Crudup is pretty solid in his role as Dr. Philip Zimbardo, the psychology professor who suffers a major moral dilemma when conducting the experiment. Ezra Miller and Tye Sheridan who plays prisoners do a fantastic job as the characters, but the actors who really stand out are Michael Angarano and Nicholas Braun who play the guards. These actors are very committed in their roles as the guards who strip their innocent guy images and turn into ruthless students with sadistic intentions. Angarano and Braun have collaborated in a few films in the past, and are not very known for taking on sadistic roles like these. Watching their performances are quite shocking, though sometimes comedic; especially when listening Angarano shout in "rednecky" accent. The Stanford Prison Experiment is a very captivating and thought- provoking film that is worth a watch. Yes, this film can be difficult to sit through and most likely not recommendable to all but mature audiences. Nonetheless, it is a film that tackles an interesting topic and may very likely lead to some discussions after viewing.</fullReview>

The film captures a disturbing mood that's suggested in the reports, conveying both internal and external struggle of the subjects through intense facial close-ups, using the confined space of the set to convey back- breaking claustrophobia.Significance of the study aside I thought there was an interesting overlap with social theory ranging from Gramsci's hegemony to Goffman's total institutions and Foucault's panopticon.

		<shortDescription>Do we really know our limits?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very much interested in human psychology, as I majored in psychology at university and it always fascinated me to learn that we as humans do not actually know our limits. Although some are sure of themselves of never being able to commit a crime, they still could end up committing it. And this movie shows exactly why this can happen. If you don't like the movie because of its intense and brutal depiction of the human existence, then you shouldn't rate this movie low, because that's the point of the movie and the experiment that is shown in it. If you hate the characters in the movie and are horrified by the actions they do - then you have to admit that the bloody cast did their job well! Eventually, it's a 9/10 for me! It doesn't have any scenes of gore or sex (except for one weird scene which is listed in the Parents Guide section here on IMDb)The Stanford prison experiment represented in the movie is a real experiment conducted in 1971 and the depiction of that time is done well with the clothing, looks, etc. Billy Crudup, who plays Dr. Philip Zimbardo of Stanford University, the chief of the experiment, has done an excellent job. His cold and ruthless appearance fits perfectly for an intelligent and power-thirsty psychologist. Some say many psychologists are psychopaths themselves. Yeah, somehow approved. Thumbs up also for Michael Angarano and Tye Sheridan for giving solid and plausible performances. Ezra Miller's shaky voice disturbed me all the time, his acting was better than usual, though.The movie is an answer to all the questions sane people ask when they watch TV or read the newspaper everyday. Why so much crime, why terrorism? The authority, whoever that may be, tells you that what you do is right and you end up doing it. You don't question it. You become a puppet. What distinguishes the humankind from animals and plants is rationality, but do we always think rational? Certainly not. When there is a dominant leader, then we tend to follow him, even if the task dissents with our norms and beliefs. You should definitely read the Milgram experiment and experiments from Muzafer Sheriff, a Turkish social psychologist who developed social judgment theory and realistic conflict theory and is known as the founder of modern social psychology. His experiments about social norms and social conflict show how important the milieu is in our decisions and in individual psychology.Dr. Zimbardo summarizes this experiment in one decisive statement: "Most apparent thing that I noticed was how most of the people in this study derive their sense of identity and well-being from their immediate surroundings rather than from within themselves."</fullReview>

'Sleepers' and 'Spotlight') who was assisted by a number of academic and non academic colleagues. The results were surprising to say the least and this film seems to stick very closely to the events and what actually occurred.The brilliant Michael Angarano ('Gentlemen Broncos') plays the rather nasty Christopher Archer aka John Wayne who was the most notorious of the 'guards' and he plays the part with real gusto. There are some scenes that some may find upsetting but everything depicted here pretty much happened and this makes this telling have more of an impact than such fictional accounts as say the German film, 'Das Experiment' that was remade in America.

		<shortDescription>So unflinching and brutal that you might need to remind yourself it's not a documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kyle Patrick Alvarez's directorial debut The Stanford Prison Experiment makes no qualms about what it's about. It concerns the famous Stanford University prison experiment that was conducted by psychology professor Dr. Philip Zimbardo, who studied the personality traits and behaviors of a group of male participants over what was supposed to be a two week experiment. The plan was to create a mock prison, located in the basement of the psychology department in Stanford, where three of the men would assume the roles of prison guards and the remaining would assume the roles of prisoners. Upon being selected for the roles and promised pay of $15 a day, the prisoners undergo the process of being arrested, booked, and jailed, while the guards try to maintain order and control over the prisoners. It doesn't take long for things to get completely out of hand, as the guards become physically and mentally abusive within the first twenty-four hours and the prisoners begin retaliating. Observing all the chaos as it unfolds is Zimbardo (played by Billy Crudup), who even himself becomes abusive over the course of the experiment. Joining him in monitoring the actions of the subjects are his girlfriend (Olivia Thirlby) and a team of psychology students.The Stanford Prison Experiment is one of the strongest thrillers I've seen in a long time, and one of the best ensembles I've seen from last year, featuring a cast of young stars that will only continue to climb the ranks as tomorrow's movie stars. The prisoners are made up of Tye Sheridan, who gave us a tender, minimalist performance in 2014's Joe, It's Kind of a Funny Story's Keir Gilchrist, Thomas Mann, who played the awkward and sensitive Greg in last year's Me and Earl and The Dying Girl, Red State and The Brass Teapot's charming Michael Angarano, as well as Angarano's co-star from Red State Nicholas Braun, and the aforementioned Olivia Thirlby. In a sea of challenging roles played incredibly well by such a young cast, Ezra Miller's - who has been on a hot-streak ever since his haunting performance in We Need to Talk About Kevin - heartbreaking performance as the famous "Prisoner 8612," one of two prisoners to be released from the experiment early due to mental instability and an emotional breakdown, is probably the most impressive given all the energy Miller must exhaust. Rather than boiling slowly before finally overflowing with emotion like most of the cast, Miller must showcase his agitation and repeated frustration early, as well as playing a role that requires for arguably the most physicality than any of his peers. Needless to say, he's tremendous and his heartbreaking testament to Zimbardo's unblinking "eye" camera almost effectively matches the authenticity and the pleas of the same testament from the real-life "Prisoner 8612." Crudup's methodical and largely low-key performance is sure to go under-the-radar in the face of all the young and riled talent on display here, but screenwriter Tim Talbott gives him a very quiet character to work with at first. Crudup's Zimbardo is a largely passive and free-spirited soul, who is more interested in how this experiment will surprise him than anything. When he sees the actions of the guards turn violent and abusive, initially against his rules, despite being implored to reprimand the boys, he allows it to build and watches his subjects sleeplessly, for nights on end, as they grow more restless and violent.Assisting Talbott's terrific writing, which gives all the boys their time to shine and brings out the best in them to make this film the best in many of their filmographies, is Alvarez's direction, which is claustrophobic and bent on repetition. Consider the scene where the guards make the prisoners stand in a straight line and repeatedly recite the numbers on their uniforms and the uniforms on the person standing next to them. The result is maddening tedium for the boys, and very well could've been for the audience if Alvarez didn't wisely employ revealing closeups on the faces and the numbers of the boys. Alvarez finds ways to keep it interesting and pleasantly doesn't manipulate us into pathos when things take a real turn for the shocking. His direction is simultaneously simple yet rhythmic and shocking beautiful, which is a rare characteristic for a film with such a drab color palette and a thoroughly bleak story and subtext.But The Stanford Prison Experiment is a raw piece of work, sometimes so believably unflinching and brutal you swear you're watching a documentary. It takes a magnifying glass to the ugliness of perceived human authority and behavior in a setting where no authority or identity is valid. At two hours, Alvarez and Talbott have just enough time to let things boil and develop before, just like Zimbardo had to eventually do to the real-life experiment in 1971, they have to end it all. This is a seriously compelling and rare film that showcases so much with so little and leaves a subtle brand on your brand that reminds you what we all could be capable of given the circumstances.Starring: Billy Crudup, Ezra Miller, Michael Angarano, Tye Sheridan, Ki Hong Lee, Nelsan Ellis, Logan Miller, Nicholas Braun, Olivia Thirlby, Thomas Mann, and Keir Gilchrist.

		<fullReview>If we ignore the fact that how far they took this experiment was just down right immoral, it sends a great message.First off, if you are someone who couldn't care less about the the meaning of the movie, and just want a good movie to watch, I'd still recommend this. It kept my interest the whole time, and I believe it was certainly worth the watch. But its much more than just a good film. This movie perfectly shows us how people act when given authority. I think it is so relevant today. Police brutality is the highlight of the news constantly. This experiment really shows us why. Over half of the subjects that were given the authority role abused their authority. All of them when they asked if they wanted to be a prisoner or an inmate, picked inmate. Very few treated the prisoners with respect. I believe that to be true in current society. Too many people with authority roles let the authority go to their head. They are in it for the wrong reasons. Im not going to go too far into my views on that subject. The bottom line is, this was a great film. It seemed like it stayed true to the real documentary as well. One line stuck out more than anything in this entire film. " You're missing the point... The only thing that separates those two is a coin flip." (forgive me if it isn't exact) I loved that line. Im surprised it isn't in the memorable quotes. In our lives the series of not only our choices, but the circumstances around us, determines who we are, and where we will end up. Its nothing but a coin flip. This movie shows just how much of an impact a coin can make.</fullReview>

It took all of two days for everyone to completely loose it. I thought Stanford had high admittance requirements? Anyway, production values were low and editing was poor. In addition, I don't believe you can decriminalize kidnapping via contract. And I just wonder why the academics couldn't just use actual data from the many. many existing prisons in the country instead of setting up what seemed like a very unorganized, confusing, and last minute experiment.

		<fullReview>First off, the movie could have been longer. If the goal was to show the nitty-gritty parts of human psychology then there should have been more of that because often times the movie seemed to skip time when it shouldn't. Plus, on the odd chance the viewer enjoys some black humor there are scenes that are so to speak "comedy gold" that are present in exactly those experiment-specific parts. I found that the attention to detail - though this movie was by no mans in need of a big budget - was extremely high. Without looking further into the location it was filmed in - the setting was perfect, same as the clothing etc. Secondly, the movie had too many "filler" scenes, like the cinema version of B-roll in TV. If the movie was supposed to depict the experiment then that should have been the main focus. The end had some cheezy docu-drama which also was kinda lame, and should have instead been replaced with real footage/interviews of the people that participated IRL.Other than those three things I think the acting was quite good, in some case well above that. Totally worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Stanford Prison Experiment' is one of the more intriguing films to release this year. In school I studied many different subjects. Psychology being one of them. One of the very first things we learned about was this very experiment. So, this film has been on my radar since its screening at the Sundance Film Festival. For those of you that don't know, The Stanford Prison Experiment was a study about how humans react to certain situations. In this particular case, being in a prison. Headed by Dr. Zimbardo and a couple of students, a make shift prison was built out of a few offices and a hallway. Then 24 students were selected to participate in this study. Twelve prisoners and twelve guards. The study was given two weeks to be carried out and paid $15 per day to it's subjects. What no one expected to happen, happened. It perfectly captured human nature, in a very scary way. It showed that, given a role and no limitations, humans can be incredibly cruel to one another. The film captures this beautifully. It shows these young men lose all sense of self with each and every moment they are there. Within one day most of the test subjects were so lost that they had forgotten each others names. Only referring to each other as the number that they were assigned. This makes 'The Stanford Prison Experiment' one of the scariest films to watch. It displays how we as humans are. Whether we like it or not. Without limits it's scary what people can and will do. Even on a scale as small as this. With every passing day these students were dehumanized more and more without even realizing it. Losing themselves entirely and falling into the role that they were assigned. Of course all this would've gone to waste without its cast. If even one of them broke character this entire film could have come crumbling down on itself. This is what struck me the moment that I began watching. It may not have any big name actors but these guys sure know what they are doing. I have seen many of them in various films but I had no idea they were this good. In many scenes their performances alone carry the film.But not all is well here. Unfortunately this film is to fact based. Yes, it shows that these kids were completely dehumanized but it never tries to go deeper. Watching the kids grow closer to their breaking point with every passing minute was an enjoyable watch but it didn't pack any real punch. It doesn't give any reason to see it again. If you already know about this study and just want a refresher then read about it instead. 'The Stanford Prison Experiment' definitely a good watch. It makes good with the fascinating material that it so dutifully recreates. It's a film that I would recommend to anyone purely for its intense educational value. The more you know about yourselves and others, the better. Yet, if you are already familiar with the study your time is best spent elsewhere. As this film doesn't offer anything past what we already know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worth watching movie! Would you rather be a guard or a prisoner?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands down to the marvelous cast of the movie, when i started to watch the movie i thought that the movie was set to be regular with a bunch of newcomers but i was totally wrong, Tye Sheridan did such an amazing work together with Billy Crudup that portrayed Dr. Phillip Zimbardo and also i would like to mention Jacob Harding, outstanding performances. But lets go to the main question of the movie, ?Do we really know our limits? as the movie progress we can see how the prisoners are changing , how it wasn't just an experiment, this movie is so psychological, all things that were happening made you wonder how far you could go without a limit, and if you really know your worst part. In conclusion this movie should stand out as one of the best directed films of the year that has outstanding performances by some newcomers and that has such a strong message that make you wonder a lot of things. This wasn't a waste of time, if you have not seen this movie you should go and watch it right now. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth watching, but a tad strong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best way you could ever learn abut the Stanford priso experiment (and the way we as humans behave when addressed by a person who seems to be in authority).In fact the movie not just tells us about the actual 1971 Stanford experiment, but It also reveals a lot about how we as human beigns think.It is difficult to write any spoilers, as all the information on the experiment is online on a number of websites. However much you may have read about it, there are a lot of interesting facts that get revealed as you watch the film.The recreations are amazing. After watching the movie, I watched a TED talk by the actual Dr. Philip Zimbardo and was stunned how identical the person in the film looks to the real person! Ditto for the rest of the sets and the "prisoners" and the "mock up".Watch the movie till the end - there are surprises at every corner.Warning - The last 15 minutes need some strong stomach to stomach the scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't waste time. This is a crap movie. Even you can't tell if this is movie or bull**it. It is completely and utter bologna. Nothing in this movie is believable so don't believe the hype. Since it is not believable, all I wanted to see was some sort of accident that killed everyone in one fantastic blood soaked finale but alas, my wish never came true as this movie just kept drudging along as if it was thought provoking... it ain't... no one was believable and no one would act like this in an experiment. Hell even real prisons are not how this movie is portraying them. Go do something else but don't waste your time. Alas there no negative marking on IMDb so I am forced to give this **it 1 point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first 90% is great but it's seriously flawed since it ignores the obvious moral outrage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971, Dr. Philip Zimbardo conducted a famous psychological study which has been cited innumerable times since as a case of experimenter misconduct and the abuse of participants. This film is a dramatization of the study and the events surrounding it.It begins with Dr. Zimbardo (Billy Crudup) and his research assistants interviewing potential subjects for a study for which the participants will be paid $15 a day. What exactly it is, these subjects have little idea but the experiment was to simulate a prison environment and see the effect it would have on the participants--both those who were chosen to be guards as well as those chosen to be prisoners. In most every way, Zimbardo and his team tried to replicate a prison environment in the basement of one of the buildings at Stanford University--including having fake police arrest the designated prisoners and bring them to this mock prison. Unfortunately, very soon after the study began, psychological and physical damage occurred to the participants...yet Zimbardo did not discontinue the study. Even after guards began manhandling the prisoners and severely degrading them, the experiment continued for a hellish week. While Zimbardo claimed that the study was being done to give insight into human behavior, his lack of objectivity, the school's lack of oversight and unethical treatment of the subjects is the reason that the study became so famous. Oddly, however, such comment about the study is almost completely missing...a strange omission to say the least.I am an unusual film reviewer because I was a practicing psychotherapist as well as a teacher who taught history and psychology. So, I probably would get more out of this movie than the average viewer and I am very familiar with the experiment. The film does a great job of re-creating the study and the time period. Folks looked and dressed like folks from 1971 and Crudup looked reasonably close to Zimbardo. I appreciated how the filmmakers tried hard to replicate the events and times during which it was made. What it also did was re-create the horrors and the film was, at times, rather disturbing...even though this occurred several decades ago. But in the film, after Zimbardo finally pulls the plug on the study, the film pretty much ends. There's a short blurb at the end that Zimbardo and his team determined that no lasting damage was done to the subjects...though this is a completely self-serving statement and was not established scientifically. As a result, the film emphasizes what folks thought they learned about prison environments and obedience...but not how the study ended up horrifying many professionals within the field. This is a huge problem and up until the inexplicable ending, I would have scored this film much higher. Incidentally, the bonus features on the DVD (which debuted this week on Netflix) seems to indicate that indeed the end did justify the means in this bizarre study. So is this a film for you? Maybe. It is very well constructed and the acting is very realistic. I am not sure, however, that the average viewer would want to watch the study unfolding as it is unpleasant-- but it certainly is thought-provoking and interesting. I assume that this film could be effectively used by psychology programs to generate discussions about ethics and responsibility. By the way, what's allowed and not allowed in experiments on American campuses has changed significantly since 1971...much of it the result of studies run amok such as this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound lesson in social psychology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stanford Prison Experiment took place in the basement of Jordan Hall (the psychology building) at Stanford University between August 14 and August 20, 1971. The social psychologist who conceived of the experiment was Dr. Philip Zimbardo (Billy Crudup, who in the movie resembles remarkably well Zimbardo at the age Zimbardo was back then). Zimbardo was also the principal investigator and overseer of the experiment. As such, he was as much a participant in the experiment as the volunteers themselves. This ended up having a profound effect on him, which is well portrayed in the movie. It's worth noting that ten years earlier a similar experiment known as the Obedience Experiment had taken place at Yale under the direction of social psychologist Dr. Stanley Milgram.Zimbardo was funded by the Department of the Navy to conduct the experiment. Although it didn't have the same overall setup as Milgram's, it did resemble it in many salient ways. I admittedly don't know enough of the history of psychology and so can't answer the exact whys it was conducted. But apparently other psychologists have reproduced Milgram's experiment (possibly making modifications to it), so maybe Zimbardo's experiment was considered more definitive. Also, I did find it unusual that he didn't have a control group.Milgram's experiment was intended to show how easily a subject (called "the teacher" in the experiment) would listen to an authority figure (called "the experimenter") and administer a series of electric shocks to a learner who was, unbeknown to the subject, an actor who in reality received no actual electric shocks. It was found that roughly two-thirds of the subjects would administer what would be considered a fatal shock to the actors even though the actors pleaded and feigned being in extreme agony. Later, the results were validated by other psychologists for different cultures throughout the world. In a 1974 paper titled "The Perils of Obedience" that Milgram composed, he said, "Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process." In the Prison Experiment the volunteers were separated into guards (authority figures) and powerless figures (the prisoners). It's worth pointing out that the volunteers who served as guards were assigned that role by the people running the experiment. No volunteer purposefully chose the role of guard. As one commented, "Nobody likes guards." The findings of Milgram's Obedience Experiment indicates that a similar phenomenon was observed in the Prison Experiment. The authority figures took their tasks seriously. At first the prisoners tried to slough the whole thing off but things got out for hand fast. After just six days and after Zimbardo himself was being sucked into the experiment to the point that he was growing increasingly upset, it was terminated. And Milgram's quotation above is just as applicable to the Prison Experiment as to the Obedience Experiment.Both experiments suggest that a person's social role, especially if it involves exercising power over others, can have a strong influence on their behavior. In the case of the Prison Experiment this includes their apparel and their means of physically controlling the people over whom they are exercising their power. Psychological means of control, such as verbal bullying, were also employed.Except for Crudup, who portrayed Dr. Zimbardo, I didn't recognize any of the other actors but everyone in movie did a great job. Zimbardo, along with his wife, Dr. Christina Maslach (Olivia Thirlby), went on to investigate the psychology of power and authority. It's worthwhile mentioning that the late French social philosopher, Michel Foucault (1926-1984), also probed the various uses and abuses of power in society. Have these works made any dent in practice on world politics? As far as I can tell, no they haven't. Have they made any dent in practice on professions such as the police that rely heavily on asserting their authority? I can't positively say, but given all the problems that have been occurring in various venues in the US over the past several years, it wouldn't appear so.The movie should make us all think. Most of us believe we're decent human beings. We would never do such things to other human beings. Milgram's and Zimbardo's experiments suggest otherwise.Some seem to think everyone knows the results of such experiments and consequently it was a ho-hum we-all-know-that kind of reaction to the movie. If that's the case, why is the behavior repeated over and over? Humanity can't learn from past mistakes? Such a cynical view isn't going to help us much.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do we all have the potential to turn brutal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Stanford Prison Experiment" looks at a test that some students did in 1971 to simulate a prison, only to see it go too far. It poses the question of whether or not each of us has the potential to turn sadistic if given the opportunity. We saw what the US troops did in Abu Ghraib. In this movie, the guards make you feel as if you're walking on eggshells (and these were ordinary people merely play the roles of guards). With any luck, the movie can lead to further debates about what leads people to be cruel towards each other. Another movie that looks at this is "Murder in the First" (about an Alcatraz prisoner).I recommend the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Experiment Become Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was watching the trailer it's a half predictable movie, but very surprisingly for the story plots. I knew this movie was taken from the real or true story.Most of the psychologist in the army or intelligence bureau doing this kind of experiment also as far as I know. For the examples is what's going on the past at Abu Gharib Prison's, the US Armies doing this kind of prison to get information's from the prisoners.The plot stories in this movies just a looked alike what happened in Abu Gharib Prisons, well I just knew this kind of experiment was created by a psychologist and 100% the what happened in Abu Gharib Prison took the same method what Dr. Philip Zimbardo was doing in the past or it could be he created it.The movies is good, picturing the psychologist side of human being in a less and more of power, just from a stick and uniform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable &amp; bored: the repeated EXPERIMENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks like a remake from Forest Whitaker Adrien Brody 2010 The Experiment. What y'all may not notice, similar experiemtS had been conducted all through the history of cruel mankind.The original Stanford prison experiment was in part a response to the Milgram experiment at Yale beginning in 1961 and published in 1963. The Third Wave was a 1967 recreation of Nazi Party dynamics by high school teacher Ron Jones in Palo Alto, California. Although the veracity of Jones' accounts has been questioned, several participants in the study have gone on record to confirm the events.Then came Stanford University psychology professor Philip Zimbardo, on August 14?20, 1971, led a team of researchers, funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and was of interest to both the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. The experiment, turned out to be a classic study on the psychology of imprisonment and is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.After 2001 German film Das Experiment, and acts of prisoner torture and abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq were publicized in March 2004, psychologists Alex Haslam and Steve Reicher conducted another Prison Study in 2006. This was a partial replication of the Stanford prison experiment conducted with the assistance of the BBC, which broadcast events in the study in a documentary series called The Experiment. Their results and conclusions differed from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, stress, and leadership&#xff08;REALLY?&#xff09;.So tell me, do we expect anything you haven't seen nor read from the result of this EXPERIMENT? I found this movie predictable &amp; bored indeed.</fullReview>
