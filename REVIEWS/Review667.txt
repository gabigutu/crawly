		<shortDescription>Successful and FUNNY melding of East and West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great fun!Jackie Chan brings his brand of physical comedy to Hollywood with another buddy movie. Similar to his "Rush Hour" series with Chris Tucker, Chan sets this one in the American old west and chooses Owen Wilson as his partner.I like these better than the Rush Hours. Tucker and Owen are both excellent playing opposite Chan in both series, but the Shanghai series seems to offer Jackie better venues for his elaborate fight sequences. Saloons, brothels and even wilderness settings are used with great success.And make no mistake, the fight sequences are what make (or break) a Jackie Chan movie. "Fight sequence" of course means something different in a Chan movie as opposed to normal action fare. Rather than true violence, Jackie's fight scenes are more Vaudeville than "Pulp Fiction". More Chaplin than Jet Li. Each fight is painstakingly choreographed to interact with the set surrounding it. Tables, chairs, vases, antlers, shrubbery... the list goes on. A successful Jackie Chan movie seems to contain a comedy-oriented story, a lightly delivered moral message, and lots of action. Shanghai Noon certainly delivers here.I spent the entire movie either chuckling to myself or laughing out loud, and had a very satisfied smile when the credits rolled. Highly recommended.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Winner For Jackie Chan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems this film has been out longer than just six years but I remember it was one of the first modern-day humorous martial arts films to be seen in North America. It also introduced a much wider English- speaking audience to the charm and talents of Asian star Jackie Chan, who now is well-known everywhere, even if he is getting up in age.This is considered one of Chan's better films and the setting certainly is different than normal for him: the American Old West. Good action scenes, some solid humor, fun characters and nice cinematography are all the pluses. Chan speaks English so there is no need for dubbing, either. The only "minus" I found was the final action scene going on too long, but that's typical of films. All in all, this is a very entertaining movie. Owen Wlson and Lucy Liu also are two big reasons this film became so popular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Action/Comedy/Buddy/Martial Arts/Western of the Week</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 8.9 (out of 10)Of all of the `east-meets-west' scenarios Hollywood has concocted to showcase the talents of international action star Jackie Chan, Shanghai Noon turns out to be the most fun and surprisingly fresh yet. His American partner this time is one blonde haired Owen Wilson in his first big lead role. Chan and Wilson have more chemistry and are more fun to watch then Chan and 'Rush Hour' co-star Chris Tucker ever were. Not to mention the high concept setting that successfully mixes the buddy comedy, a Hong Kong martial arts movie and an old American western (the deadest of generas). It is the 18th century. Chan is imperial guard Chon Wang who winds up alone in the old west searching for the Chinese royal family's kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu, thankfully with little screen time). Wilson is, and I remember it so well because it just sounds like a typical cowboy name, Roy O'Bannon - a hapless, 2-bit train robber with an even more incompetent team behind him. Wilson gets huge laughs with his motor mouth and that constantly befuddled look on his face. He looks like he'd rather be surfing. It isn't long before a series of events throws them together and send each into a little bout with culture shock. In typical buddy movie style they are at each others throats one minute and in a tub bonding over drinking games the next. There may be a cliché here and there but watching these two bounce off each other is so exuberant and entertaining it's hardly noticeable.'Shanghai Noon' is helmed by first-time director Tom Dey who makes a remarkable debut. Dey lobs the gags at us, well timed and many times from the periphery of our vision (something noticeably lost when the movie is seen in a pan-and-scan version). O'Bannon's first stage coach robbery and a scene with a drunken Jackie Chan and his drunken horse are absolute riots. The movie also has put equal time into the action department. There are a lot of great fights and action set pieces in here allowing Chan to show off his magic. He makes use of ropes, trees, antlers and all sorts of props when improvising in some terrific - and even exciting - fight scenes. The cocktail premise of 'Shanghai Noon' is so original that it is only in those patented Chan moments where we are brought back into being aware that this is `a Jackie Chan vehicle'. At nearly 2 solid hours the movie threatens to drag, but have no fear. It has enough wit and creativity up it's sleeve to grab our interest and not let go. Many recent action movies are long for the sake of it, but Noon makes ample use of it's time to give us a fully realized and satisfying comedic adventure. And with Dey and two comic pros like Chan and Wilson driving the antics, Shanghai Noon is a hoot and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most enjoyable lightweight entertainments in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pairing Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson together may seem the most unlikely thing to do since color televisions were first invented. But both of these actors are funny, in one way or another--Chan through his innocence, Wilson through his sarcastic, snide remarks. Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writer--he shares writing credits on such films as "Rushmore" and "The Royal Tenenbaums."Chan, on the other hand, is a better martial arts master than Jet Li and a more likable character actor than Chow Yun Fat (whose disastrous film "Bulletproof Monk" made me want to split his head open to prevent him from ever making another American mainstream motion picture ever again).In "Shanghai Noon," Chan plays Chon Wang, a 19th century Chinese martial arts master who ventures out to Nevada in order to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), whose name is misused by Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) on at last one occasion.After Chon Wang (mistakenly pronounced "John Wayne") meets up with Roy, the two decide to form an alliance and rescue the princess -- one for honor, the other for loads of money awaiting them upon her safe arrival back home in Imperial China's Forbidden City.Roy is a lousy wannabe cowboy who used to stage clumsy train robberies along with his band of thieves, who betrayed him and left him for dead. He offers his help to Wang, and tries to play it cool, but he can't -- after all, he's not a very convincing cowboy. But, as the smarmy wisecracking sidekicks always are, O'Bannon just wants money. But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger, he realizes that money isn't everything.Sounds routine, doesn't it? Well, it is, to a certain extent. But it succeeds due to a fine cast -- Chan and Wilson are extraordinarily good together; so good, in fact, that Chris Tucker is just a forgotten memory by the time that the film is over.It's a classic spin on the Old West formula; what "The Princess Bride" or "Shrek" did for fairy tales, "Shanghai Noon" does for Westerns. All the old cliches are poked fun at in a light way. And as great as Chan is, and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas, Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan.Chan's martial arts are usually the highlights of these films, but in this he proves he can do more than just kick -- he can be funny. Well, okay, he proved that in "Rush Hour" (1998), but I like this better.The jokes in "Shanghai Noon" aren't "great," but I laughed a lot at this film. It's smarter than one might think, and is certainly one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite some time. Probably years. I wasn't expecting much (especially because I wasn't an enormous fan of the sequel--see below), but if fun could be rated on a scale of 1 - 10, this would be an 11.I give this film nothing more than four out of five stars because it's not a great film on all critical levels. But it's certainly fun--likely more fun than any film you'll see for quite some time--and for that it will soon be earning a place in my sacred DVD collection.I must say that I wasn't a huge fan of "Shanghai Knights," the sequel to "Shanghai Noon," which involved Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon venturing to England in order to save Wang's sister. But after seeing this film I'm thinking I might just have to pay a small revisit the sequel again.4/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Chan comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped and taken to American by Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), the honour guard of The Forbidden City is dispatched to deliver the ransom and bring her back. Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) accompanies the guards on their journey and finds himself entangled with Indians, cowboys and the greedy attentions of train robber Roy O'Brannon (Owen Wilson).This is essentially a mismatched buddy movie transferred to the American West and in that respect it is not exact an original plot, there aren't any great twists to grab you and a lot of the plot drivers are forced or predictable. However let's be honest - we're not hear for the plot! As with the Rush Hour movies, the plot is secondary to the comedy and the fight scenes. Here Owen Wilson provides the comedy as the laid back train robber while Jackie Chan provides the action and the comedy. The strength here is that this is a little unassuming film that will take you by surprise. The chemistry between Wilson and Chan is effortless and is as comfortable as the Chan/Tucker combo. Wilson's character is hilarious in a very easy way - he is clearly so out of place in the West and partially accepts it but also wants to be more than he is, as one of the bad guys put it "you're terrible. How have it made it this long?"Chan again shows that he is the closest we have to a modern day Chaplin, he is as good at interacting with Wilson as he is with the physical comedy that is his trademark. One complaint is that, as with Rush Hour, we could probably have done with a few more fight scenes. However the comedy more than fills any voids that are between fights.Other cast members are little more than excuses for the action. Roger Yuan and Xander Berkeley provide good baddies (Berkeley especially) but Lucy Liu is almost in her own little 'serious' movie and doesn't have much to do except be rescued (although she does show some of her "Charlie's Angels" potential in a fight scene towards the end).Overall a gentle enjoyable comedy that is made all the more enjoyable by the ease by which it succeeds at making you laugh. Chan's fights are a little less impressive than other films but he excels in the comedy stakes. One very good thing is the customary outtakes at the end - unlike Rush Hour 2 they are NOT funnier than the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Shanghai Noon' is a western-comedy starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Chan is Chon Wang (sounds like John Wayne) and Wilson is Roy O'Bannon, a perfect name for the outlaw he is. Wang is in the USA because he has to save a princess, played by Lucy Liu. He and O'Bannon have to work together, why and how is not important at all.What is important is the fun they have together, and therefore the fun we have while watching that. We have the usual Jackie Chan martial art and this time it is combined with the very funny Owen Wilson talking. For some reason I like him in almost every movie and here he gets at least one laugh in every scene. Try not to think too much and you must be able to enjoy this movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan does it again; this time with "Shanghai Noon." Unlike his previous films, Jackie has finally found a sidekick that works well alongside him and is able to play off of his physical stunts."Shanghai Noon" is unlike any other Jackie Chan movie I have seen. It is his best since "Rush Hour" and is among one of the best all-action movies that I've seen with an actual plot behind it. After watching previous Jackie Chan movies such as "Rush Hour" and "Rumble In The Bronx, I was expecting to be dazzled with his comedic talent as well as action filled sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it had every one of the components and requirements that I require for a good movie.Owen Wilson was comedic treat to this film as he added spark to an already great movie. Other than the cliché plot, "Shanghai Noon" brings a lot of excellent comedy, dialogue, action, thrills and even a little romance. I was expecting Owen Wilson to be similar to Chris Tucker, but in "Shanghai Noon" Wilson proved himself to be much better than other Jackie Chan sidekicks I've seen him teamed with. I was glad I rented this movie so I would be able to recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Jackie Chan! (again...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is a master martial artist and stuntman. Every film he stars in is an exercise in demonstrating his skill in different, creative ways. If you go to see this movie expecting anything different, you'll be sorely disappointed.However, if you're a Chan fan, prepare to be amazed once again. It's not the same spectacle one would find in previous works such as Rumble in the Bronx, but impressive nevertheless. Furthermore, the plot that ties these action sequences together is better than can be found in most films of the same genre. The clash between far east and wild west cultures and cinematographic stereotypes is amusing enough to keep the film entertaining throughout, and Chan's own tongue-in-cheek sense of humor makes the piece that much more delightful to watch.Don't look for this one at the next Academy Awards, but then that's not what Jackie Chan is all about, is it. If you want a couple of hours of mindless entertainment and spectacle, this is the one to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Use the Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Martial arts movies have a hard time in the US. There is a small core audience that likes to see fighting of any type, and a still smaller group interested in the ballet. So to make the numbers, producers wrap them in something else: racial commentary, cop buddy movies, the thriller, comedy. Jackie Chan was always a comedian, but in China, his comedy was in the actual fights. That won't work here, so he has been forced to search for a comedy form. And boy he's tried a lot of them and failed.I think this is his most successful. That's because of Owen Wilson. Owen is not the type of old fashioned actor who tries to adapt to each role. He's the John Wayne, Harrison Ford type who markets a personae that people can exploit if they wish. When Bruce Willis does this, his commodity is a smirk; he is winking at the audience in a layered conspiracy as if to say: `I'm acting this stupid role, so chuckle along with me at how stupid it is.' He didn't pioneer this attitude, but inherited it from Cary Grant, who adapted it from some of Clark Gable's winks. Willis has spawned a bunch of copies, some of whom Chan has tried on.Now along comes Owen Wilson. What Owen sells is a whole next generation of audience-winking. With him, the attitude is `You and I know this role is bogus, so lets trash it.' Its the attitude we all know from some guy in school who made trouble by going along. TeeVee opened a niche for this attitude in acting, and now Wilson is making a career of it. Stiller does this too, and that's why `Zoolander' was such a gas; it exploited just this sort of posing.I'm amazed at how many places Wilson has made this work. His ironic comedy of course. But `Minus Man' was made more chilling with him doing his thing, trashing his own locker. Garofalo is the queen to his king of selfdeprecation, and made `Minus' work. Now consider this film. What works is the completely goofy space Wilson creates. As an example, that speech to himself at the showdown with the sheriff: `I'm going to die! No, be the bullet, be the wind, you can do this. No, I'm going to die!' Interspersed with Chan crushing the posse with a horseshoe. Its rather clever engineering of mood, and the creative force behind this film needs to be congratulated. This is Wilson's best comedy, I think, because we aren't asked to laugh at him. He sets the tone for Chan to step into so we can laugh at him. Its more comfortable and less risky than laughing at ourselves.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent "buddy" team that rivals that of Gibson &amp; Glover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps that statement is a bit of an exaggeration, but perhaps I'm on to something.The obvious natural and easy chemistry between Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson went a long way towards endearing this work into my collection. As a solid fan of Chan's work, I have a modest (in comparison to hard-core fans) collection of his works. In consideration, I have to say that...while this attempt, like his other American attempts, does not exhibit enough of that marvelous comedic fighting style we all know and love, Shanghai Noon is genuinely enchanting, action packed, earnest, and entertaining.Owen Wilson is a natural talent. He brings an honesty to his otherwise shifty personae in everything he does. Frankly, I'm surprised at some of the places he has succeeded in making this work for him. He is a true comedic force on the big screen. This work is a rival to other comedy/action teams, and bears a serious viewing, as I feel it is comparable to my second favorite comedy western, "Cat Ballou." In case you're interested, "Blazing Saddles" is my first.If you enjoyed this, I highly recommend the following:Jackie Chan: Mr. Nice Guy, Rumble in the Bronx, and Around the World in 80 Days (2004)Owen Wilson: Anaconda, The Haunting (1999), and the Big Bounce. It rates an 8.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot of Fun with Great Chemistry between its Two Leads,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shanghai Noon is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very fun movie that contains many scenes that had me laughing out loud, as well as several surprisingly intense and very well choreographed action sequences, it's a clever mix of both westerns and martial arts films, and it is clear watching this from start to finish that it is a unique film. I only have two major problems with this movie, and that is that it takes itself too seriously at times, it gets fairly deep for something that should have only wanted to be a comedy, particularly the scenes with the princess and her capturers are quite dark and grim, and I also felt like it needed much more moments between Chan and Wilson's characters that conveyed a friendship is beginning, I would have liked to see a lot more scenes with the two of them together simply having fun and not worrying about the problem they must overcome. The highlight of the movie and the thing that certainly holds it all together would have to be Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, they are an unlikely duo, but this works out perfectly, the chemistry between the two is outstanding and the drinking game is definitely my favourite scene in the whole movie. Funny, action packed and entertaining, I would recommend Shanghai Noon to anyone looking for a good adventure film. A Chinese imperial guard teams up with a train robber in order to rescue a kidnapped princess. Best Performance: Owen Wilson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imperial guard Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is in love with Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu). She runs away from an arranged marriage but instead she's taken for ransom to America by traitor Lo Fong. Three guards are sent to pay the ransom and Chon Wang begs to join the expedition. In Nevada, they encounter train robber Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and his gang. Wang and O'Bannon are forced together when Wallace takes over the gang and later O'Bannon is found cheating at cards.Killing the uncle is probably not a good way to start the partnership. There are plenty of ways to better start the duo on their path together. That's really my only complaint. The comedy is sometimes broad like a hilarious Blazing Saddles scene. Jackie Chan is hilarious. Owen Wilson brings out his devilish charms. The old west is a great place for Jackie Chan to discover new props for his action scenes. The guys are a great comedy duo and there are plenty of big laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will preface this by saying that I'm really picky when it comes to comedies. That being said, this movie right here seems to think that it's enough to shove a funny stereotype in our faces and then expect us to laugh at it uproariously.I liked this film as an action/adventure film. Jackie Chan is a great martial art lead actor and his talents are showcased well in this film. It's not one of the best he has ever done, but the fight scenes are fun to follow, they're imaginative enough to keep up my interest and the settings have some promise and allow for some cool sequences. Furthermore, the West is filmed with care and all the various locations, while hardly original, look nice and feel genuine.Unfortunately the script is nonsensical, from oneshot characters that make no sense to plot motives and twists that come straight out of nowhere and steal all thunder out of the film. The plot itself is thin to begin with, but when every major conflict is resolved through either a deus ex machina or a cop-out, you get the idea that they really didn't give a damn as long as they could fill the screen with cheap gimmicks and laughs.The humour doesn't help either. There are some scenes that are honestly funny or at least amusing, most of the between Chan and Wilson, who have surprisingly good chemistry together, but most of the jokes are either mindless slapstick or racial stereotypes. Sure, a Chinaman can be funny if done correctly, but a Chinaman alone is not funny by default. Neither is a coward, a Mexican or an Indian. You need actual effort, which this film is unwilling to spend.If you're able to laugh at cheap jokes and clichés, this is not a bad action comedy. Chan and Wilson are talented comedic leads, who would have made this movie work had the script been any better. As it is, it's not to my liking, but I don't regret seeing it either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with great acting but still lacks that thing that makes it memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth be told, I was expecting an incredibly dumb gay western film. But once I saw it, I was surprised at its good story structure and theme.Though I'm not a regular Jackie Chan fan, I actually enjoyed watching the guy in the film. Honestly, I don't know one bit about him, just that he's famous for doing martial arts films, and this is actually just the second film I've ever seen with him in it. And I've gotta say - not bad.And Owen Wilson was the perfect actor for his part. I mean seriously, nobody else could fit the role. He's not the best actor in the whole world, but he certainly took the right turn. He's got the looks, the attitude, the moves, the voice, and even the right hair. His character, Roy O'Bannon (a.k.a. Wyatt Earp) is a cool cowboy, robber, and gunman who's all wild west but still a bit wimpy for his taste. He is shown as ambitious and talented (in being a cowboy) but not hard or serious and thoroughly a slight disappointment to his land, like Chon Wang (Chan). Wilson was able to put both the toughy and the whiny in him in all the right parts and situations. He was even able to show the dynamic change O'Bannon went through at the end. He went from coward to hero without a flaw and still managed to be humorous. What I didn't like most of all was that they put background rock music in an 1881 setting. Sure, it didn't change the film much and the audience needed at least some connection with the modern world, but Wilson was already taking care of that. They at least could have taken out that "Cowboy" song, which is now stuck in my head, by the way!This sounds like a great movie, but as my title suggests, it's missing something. I don't know what it is. Perhaps it was the script, which was actually OK. The film somehow lacks that awe and "wow" that makes a movie memorable. Maybe it's just me, but that's the best I can verify it. Something's missing.Overall, it's an enjoyable film with great structure and form with a great theme. I hope you enjoy it. I sure did. I'm gonna try watching Shanghai Knights now, it's really got me wondering what happens to our characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect blend of action and comedy. This movie stars Jackie Chan as Chon Wang, one of the soldiers of the army of the forbidden city in China. When the princess leaves and goes to America it is up to Chon to bring her back. When he gets to Nevada, where most of the story takes place he meets Roy O'Bannon played by Owen Wilson u'll ever meet. He is a wanted outlaw and in an odd chain of events they become a duo. This is the funniest western, this movie surpasses Blazing Saddles by far. Blazing Saddles is funny but the one-liners that Owen Wilson drop are just so hilarious. "I don't know Karate but I do know crazy, and I will use it". Lucy Lui also stars as the Princess This movie is definitely worth seeing but you kinda wanna steer clear of the sequel "Shanghai Knights" It does not do the first film justice. I have never been able to complete the second one mainly because it is boring. But salutes to Shanghai Noon the funniest western to date. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

Not only is Jackie Chan an excellent physical performer he has great intensity over-all, as shown in the extremely under-rated "Piklik Fo (ThunderBolt)". Also, Owen Wilson makes good as the unconventional outlaw. The comedy is simple enough to understand which makes the movie easy to digest (so to speak).Also the action is tense and towards the end there is a brilliant, nice feeling.

Typical Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson? But over all, Shanghai Noon, despite it's typical clicee's of a buddy/cop movie or even cowboy/samuri if you will, you get into it. I think I was just in a good mood today. You get your Jackie Chan moves with your fun humor and inaccurate history. But just have fun I would say. I'm sorry, I really can't come up with anything else because this is a typical film. Just like a dictionary; look up Rush Hour. Same plot, different time, different actors. I would recommend Rush Hour, Lethal Weapon, or any other buddy/cop movies. You'll get the same thing pretty much. Like I said though, if you get a kick out of those flicks, you'll probably like this one too! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie again this weekend. I had seen it a few years back and had forgotten most of it, so this is like a fresh review. I don't get Owen Wilson I guess. No offense, but he is like somebody who wants to date your sister and you don't want him to because you know what he's after. Then Jackie Chan is like the guy you WANT to marry your sister, you can imagine sitting with him at the Thanksgiving dinner table and enjoying a good time. I agree with the other review, Wilson/Chan did not seem to gel for some reason. Didn't Chan knock Wilson after release of this movie, saying he whined too much on aches and pains after doing stunts? Sounds like a bad match to me from the start. Loved the stunt horse, I was in stitches watching him. Actually he (the horse) and Jackie made for better stunts and humor then Wilson/Chan. Some scenes were making fun of old cowboy movies and that was sort of fun to watch, but a little rehashed I guess for a Baby Boomer like me. Chan's stunts were hot and well timed as usual. You can tell he's a true professional at everything. Guess what I want to say is he makes it look easy. Overall I would call it a good family movie- full of mild humor and sight gags, which Chan is great at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chan's best American film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best action films of recent years! Shanghai Noon is a comedy gem. It features decent action, although in truth some of the weakest Chan has ever done, but the action is still excellent. This east-meets-west in the Wild West kick-fest is brilliant stuff and Chan finds his ultimate partner in comedy crime, Owen Wilson. Whereas the Rush Hour series has the over the top and screechingly loud Chris Tucker, this has Wilson whose laid back, whispery charm works excellently. His delivery of lines is fantastic and he really plays off Chan superbly. Wilson is effortlessly likeable while Tucker is the sort of comedian who may wear thin. The film looks great with some great production design and lush cinematography while the musical score is excellent from Randy Edelman. The comedy is simple and is all about delivery and timing rather than elaborate jokes and this is what Chan and Wilson excel at. Lucy Lui one of the most naturally gorgeous women ever stars as well to add some eye candy. All in all this is my favourite Chan film; it's a perfect combination of Hollywood blockbuster comedy and Hong Kong action. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Shanghai Noon' is one of the few films I've seen in which I saw the sequel (Shanghai Knights) first. And that sort of affects my overall decision of what I thought of the film. As far as comparisons go, I think both movies are equal in enjoyability, characters, dialogue etc. But both of them have flaws. The problem with `Shanghai Noon' is the fact that it doesn't start out very promising at all. I really hate it when comedies begin on an all too serious note. After a disappointing first 15-20 minutes, the film picks up from there and sets an appropriately light-hearted tone.It's surprising that the movie has so little to do with Shanghai, and much more to do with the Old West, not that that's a bad thing. While the idea of pairing Jackie Chan in a buddy-buddy movie isn't fresh at this stage, it's used to brilliant effect here with the usual situation slapstick humour, but better measures of verbal wit. The real star of the movie is Owen Wilson as the cocky, arrogant but well-meaning cowboy. His usual routine has never been better. Not only does he come up with the appropriate quips, but also beats out Chris Tucker's similar but highly annoying character in `Rush Hour'. The sequel had better slapstick fight scenes, but this is probably the funnier movie. The ironic historical references are very funny and highly memorable (what sort of cowboy name is John Wayne?). If you like this type of whimsical, action comedies then this is the film for you. Otherwise, watch it anyway. My IMDb rating: 6.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heck of a lot of fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a fun movie! It's an interesting blend of action, contrived cross-cultural (east/west) drama and tension, weird humor (including fun fun fun anachronisms, courtesy of Mr. Wilson's apparent caprices), and great character acting.The only remonstrances are that Owen Wilson's entire acting stock-in-trade appears to be his boyish bad-boy charm. I can respect that, and certainly appreciate how he can turn it to good effect in a movie like this. But it also feels limited. I'm curious to see what he does in the future.Back on the theme of the unabashed fun of this movie: It reminds me of the rat-pack westerns of yesteryear; not taking themselves too seriously (and it shows), but not without some pathos. A everyman-dimensioned movie.Oh, stop reading this. If you see Shanghai Noon on a shelf at the video rental, don't recoil from it. Consider checking it out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, action fans out there! You've been wanting to drag along your romance/drama SO to a martial arts film that he/she will not hate. This is the one.Shanghai Noon is a great comedy first and foremost. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan is amazing, and unlike Rush Hour (which rattled race issues just a little), the inter-cultural humor is tasteful and respectful. Both actors shine in their niches.Unlike many action films (especially Jackie Chan's), this one has a real plot, and while it doesn't exactly have "something to say that changed my life", there are satisfying themes, the story is original, and the characters have some depth, while being both a parody of and honoring the western movie genre. This is a hard stunt to pull off.Plus, there is plenty of hand-to-hand combat and fighting. As usual with Jackie Chan, there is virtually no blood or gore -- this is soft, cartoony violence, which is not to imply it's cheesy. Kids will enjoy this film.Who should see this film:-- Action lovers (and drag along your SO)-- People who just plain like comedies. It's worth it.-- Drama lovers or arty types who hate Arnold Schwartzenegger but might like to try an action flick just this one time.I rate Shanghai Noon a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little awkward but funny and cute (Kinda like its leading actors, I s'pose)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shanghai Noon" has Owen Wilson. That alone makes it worth seeing.At times, however, it's an awkward juxtaposition of genres that probably weren't meant to go together. This is most apparent in the first thirty minutes. For one thing, it could have used a little more development regarding Princess Pei Pei's motivation for fleeing her country. It's kind of hard to care terribly much about a Princess who abandons her position, country, and family just for a lark. It's not as if she's just taking the night off ("Roman Holiday"). She's gone and she isn't coming back. I guess we're just supposed to cheer her for heroic individuality.However, once Owen and Jackie are official partners, things pick up and don't let up. Unlike most comedies, this one doesn't poop out. Most comedies end with an almost entirely laughless twenty minutes as the plot or the message or both are given perfunctory notice (Tommy Boy, Strange Brew, etc.) That's where "Shanghai Noon" has the action/adventure/western thing going for it. Stretching the genre quite a bit, it's fun and funny and even a little sweet. That shouldn't be a surprise since it stars Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan (two terribly endearing guys). Owen gives us more of his `outlaw with a heart' schtick (ala `Bottle Rocket'). His quirky, sensitive, introspective, garrulous cowboy is a delight to see and hear (especially in the middle of the movie when he and Jackie are imprisoned and when he's showing Jackie the ropes of being a cowboy). Jackie gives us more of his "butt-kicker with a heart" (owing more to Chaplin than Lee) as usual. He fights the baddies with just about everything imaginable: a horse-shoe tied to a rope, elk horns, his ponytail, baby pines, a revolving mirror, a giant bell, a basket, and even a sheriff's badge (used as a Ninja star). At one point Owen says to Jackie, "?when I look at you there's something different about you and I can see it. I can see it in your eyes." This is true of both these characters and these actors.Finally, (to its detriment) this flick takes deus-ex-machina to a new level. It seems the action can't progress for fifteen minutes with some outside, unexpected rescue (and it's always just in the nick of time). The prison break is thanks to Jackie's unwanted Indian bride (who we haven't seen for the last fifteen minutes). She also rescues them from being hanged. Finally, she and her whole tribe show up at the end of the movie to save the day. And when Jackie isn't being rescued by his bride, he is busy rescuing Owen (from two different duels). All in all, however, "Shanghai Noon" accomplishes what it sets out to do. It makes you laugh and even warms your heart a little (like a good shot a rye).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan, Sexy Cowboys and Indians, explosions and a kidnapped Princess, who could ask for more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor-Spoilers.Despite other negative reviews I found this movie to be quite entertaining. I love Jackie Chan flicks and this film was more than fun to watch for me. It has action (superb action at that), wonderful romance (the romance between The Princess and Wang especailly), a tough-ass Princess who's not just another stereo-typical, innocent and helpless wimp, a cool Indian chick who can whoop any cowboy's butt and finally, Owen Wilson, who looked pretty darn good in his cowboy threads (he's not only really good looking here, but he can act too, and he does it well). The buddy relationship between O'Bannon and Wang was charming, one of the best commradories in a western I have ever seen. Even though Owen Wilson is some serious eye candy here, my favorite scene was when Wang finds the Chinese camp and speaks to the Princess and she tells him she can do more for the people in America than back in China. Any history buff can tell you that the Chinese were treated poorly in the West (although in the flick their grief as brought on by one of their own). This film was a pleasure to watch and I really liked the blend of all the different cultures. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chan and Wilson outdo themselves every other minute in this goofy Western of theirs. Full of great action scenes, memorable lines ("you said wet shirt don't break ...") and laughs all the way, it's a treat even after multiple viewings. A rich set of supporting roles enhances the fun; everyone involved looks like they're having the time of their lives. The sequel takes itself a bit too seriously but the original belongs in any collection if you like comedies, westerns, or martial arts. There's nothing really offensive except a few "colorful metaphors" but if you can sit through this without a few big grins you might want to check your pulse. It should be rare to give any movie a perfect score but I can't come up with any lasting reason to dock this one - 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a fair amount of fun to be had with this film. It doesn't take itself seriously or bother going too deep. The tone is bright and happy and it makes for perfect mindless entertainment. But nothing else. Seriously, there is no need to watch this more than once as it is the most forgetable pile of utter silliness in a long time.Owen Wilson is so charming as the hapless but innocent crook Roy O'Bannon who teams up Jackie Chan's Chong Wang/John Wayne to put an evil Sheriff out of business, rescue a Princess and defeat some stock Chinese Bad Guy. It's all harmless stuff with some neat fight scenes that never get too violent and a gleefully light-hearted sense of humor.Randy Edelman's generic Western score is terrible (as usual) and sounds like everything else he's ever done only with a few notes changed. But it's the only weak part of a thoroughly indifferent, inoffensive and passive movie.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tiresome buddy action/comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****Shanghai Noon appears to have its fans, but I'm certainly not one of them, tired as I am of these buddy pictures that deliver weak jokes, uninspired action scenes, and draggy "getting to know you" material. Noon follows the formula without a hitch, which will be a godsend to some, but total boredom for others. Perhaps a better way of determining your enjoyment of the movie is asking yourself whether or not you find Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan funny guys. Wilson can be very funny if given the right material and Chan has also had his moments, even if most of them were back in Hong Kong. Their pairing leads to maybe two decent laughs, both during that jailbreak scene, which is another example of good set-up that ends with a botched gag.The story is nothing to write about, really, just something about a kidnapped princess and the mismatched partners who have to save her. There are a few obligatory things to point out. Lucy Lui's Princess Pei Pei, in spite of all her "strong" moments as a caring ruler, is little more than a damsel in distress. Just when she gets the opportunity to kick ass at the end by all her lonesome, she needs to be saved yet again. And does anyone else find it annoying it's her impetuousness that starts this whole mess in the first place? Then there's the Indian girl, played by Brandon Merrill, who serves no other purpose than to help out our heroes simply because the screenwriters can't think of any other way to resolve a cliffhanger.The finale gets dragged in syrupy sentimentality, with that whole "do the right thing" angle that can be touching when delivered well, but not here. As much as I like law-abiding citizens, it seems rather odd and not entirely believable Wilson's rowdy cowboy character would simply turn into a man of "honor" so abruptly. And when you think about it, the Chan/Wilson pairing doesn't add up to much when you realize the former doesn't even trust the latter until the last five minutes. Their arguments over greed and honor are numerous, repetitive, taken way too seriously and weigh the whole movie down. On a semi-bright side, Chan's moves are still impressive, so you can expect a few somewhat enjoyable fight scenes. Unfortunately, Chan's elaborate costumes tend to obscure his moves, which sort of defeats the whole purpose of these action sequences (the Blade series suffered from a similar flaw, as Snipes' character rarely fought without his huge, overflowing coat on). Shanghai Noon is pretty much second-rate on all counts as a buddy picture, though was followed up by a more enjoyable sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often laugh out-loud funny, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unpretentious comedy has wooden acting, a few very funny spots and great stunt fighting by Jackie Chan. This was my first Jackie Chan flick, and I enjoyed it enough to try another - probably the sequel, Shanghai Knights. Inclusion of puns is often a reliable indication that a comedy will be lame but the puns are good (Shanghai Noon? Chon Wang?) and the comedy is better. The movie fails to grab the audience for the first 15 or 20 minutes but then finds its stride and becomes more engaging. Many other reviewers comment on the chemistry between Chan and Owen Wilson (which gets better as the film progresses), but there is a total lack of chemistry between Liu and Chan. Indeed, the scenes with the most passion are the ones between Liu and bad guy Lo Fong (played by Roger Yuan). And Brandon Merrill sizzles, although no one in the film seems to notice. After about twenty minutes my wife said "everyone is just saying their lines." I did lower my rating for bad acting, but then gave extra credit for Chan's acrobatic, interactive fight choreography. The fight scenes are both funny and entertaining. I gave it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>East careens into West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forgot how much goddamn fun Shanghai Noon is. It's pretty much the quintessential east meets west buddy flick (sorry Rush Hour, love you too bbz), and upon rewatching it I realized that it's every bit as awesome, and more so, than I remember as a kid. You take Jackie Chan, a stoic, robotic Chinese fighting machine with the sense of humour god gave a sock, and pair him with Owen Wilson, a wishy washy surfer dude of a cowboy who can't take one second out of the day to stop talking or cracking jokes, and you've got gold. Of course, they need a film to run about in that's just as solid as they're team up, and that's just what we get. This is a bawdy, unapologetic roll in the hay, a genre bender that tosses the American western, the buddy cop flick and the Kung Fu picture into a big cauldron, fires a few bullets in and gives it a big old stir. It's ridiculously fun for its entire duration, an achievement which the sequel just couldn't keep up with. Chan is Chon Wang (say it fast), a Chinese imperial guard on the trail of runaway Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), who has runoff to America. No sooner does he set foot on Yankee soil, he's bumped into peace pipe smoking Natives, and clashed with a band of train robbers led by Roy O Bannon (Owen Wilson), a fast talking soldier of fortune who doesn't seem to have much skill besides yapping his way out of a situation. The two are thrown into a mad dash across then west, Chon looking for the princess, and Roy after the missing gold from the train. It's what movies were made to be, a pure rush of gunfighting and chop socky, kick ass action sequences, all given the boost of Chan's insane talents. He's like a rabid squirrel monkey, and Wilson a drunk sloth, constantly mismatched yet always coming out on top, like the best comic duos always do. They're faced with taking dpwn a few baddies, including Walton Goggins as the dumbest outlaw this side of the Rockies, and a terrifying Xander Berkeley as a corrupt, homicidal marshal. The core of it rests on Chan and Wilson to entertain us though, and even in the down time between action, their energy is infectious, especially in a manic drinking game that just can't be described in writing. Like I said, the sequel, Shanghai Knights, just doesn't capture he magic quite like this one does, and seems to fall flat. You can't go wrong with this original outing though, and it just gets better with age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan's new action comedy, Westerns, martial arts and buddy movie is stolen by an excellent performance by Owen Wilson.China, the Forbidden City, 1881. The princess (A wasted Lucy Liu) who hates her life is kidnapped and held for ransom in Nevada. The three best imperial guards are selected to rescue her. Chan goes along as a he feels responsible (as he failed stop top her)In Nevada, Chan teams up with a train robber named Roy O'Bannon (Wilson), and they rescue the princess with much help from a hot Indian maiden (The actress is called Brandon Merrill and she is hot).The plot, of course, is only used to get us from one of Chan's Chaplin-esque martial arts sequences to the next, with Wilson's very funny verbal quips. Material like this can be very very bad. Here it is sort of wonderful, mainly helped by Chan's likability and effortless charm and the performance by Wilson. His comic timing is precise, and his character is very hard to dislike.Chan's character is (As in every American movie he has made to date since the Burt Reynolds led Cannonball Run in 1980) a man of limited vocabulary and much action. Most moviegoers didn't know who Owen Wilson was when this was released. Most people only remembered him from 'Armageddon' after racking their brains, This movie should have made him an A list star. He is too smart and versatile to be packaged within a narrow range tho and he followed this up with Meet The Parents, Zoolander, Royal Tenebaums, Behind Enemy Lines and I Spy before 2003's sequel to this movie. Liu, as the princess, is completely under used, until the final act where she becomes a damsel in distress, a brave and plucky one, but a damsel in distress non the less. Not so boldly portrayed is Merrill's Indian woman,(My God is she hot. It's a shame she has not had an acting role prior or since this movie) who is married to Chans character in a ceremony that nobody seems to take seriously and that the movie itself has clearly forgotten all about by the time the last shot comes around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson star in a 19th century Western, where Imperial Guard Chon Wang (Chan) of China's Forbidden City attempt to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) in the United States. There, he meets small time robber Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and together they go through misadventures, until they finally band together to find the Princess and rescue her people.This is basically a good old fashion western comedy featuring Chan's signature martial arts moves and Wilson's mellow and friendly attitude yearning for grandeur. You put the two characters together and you'll get a love-hate friendship and partnership that is mildly entertaining to watch.The plot is quick-paced, helped by the story's many adventures and fast action from the characters. The clash between the east and west cultures and stereotypes are amusing and harmless enough to keep the film interesting. Lots of slapstick humor and whimsical jokes from the cast, especially Chan and Wilson, mixed in with some heroic action and courageous drama. It's not Oscar material, but it's loads of fun.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released in 2000, "Shanghai Noon" features Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (the Chinese spelling of John Wayne, lol) who teams up with good-bad-guy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title "Shanghai Noon" is a comical take on "High Noon" (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's "The Mummy." It's not as good as "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but it's better than its sequels.Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is really funny, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comedy western gets by almost entirely on Jackie Chan's likable energy and Owen Wilson's easygoing charm. That's probably why it took me a while to realise that the dialogue is completely ordinary and there aren't really any jokes; there are more laughs in the outtakes than in the movie proper. This routine approach is backed up by the flat direction and a plot that relies on handily timed rescues, characters conveniently popping in and out, and lucky breaks rather than any narrative ingenuity. The choreography in the fight scenes is really the only time the movie rises above mediocrity. Sort of fun, then, but not particularly funny. The sequel's a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one loud action scene after another with Shanghai Noon, sandwiched with racist Asian jokes and lots of unfunny dialogue. When the occasional gag is funny, it's worth a good chuckle,. But these gags don't come nearly often enough, which is unfortunate because despite a less than intriguing plot, the two leads (Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan) really give it their all in this film, though it's not enough to save it.Chon Wang, an imperial guard from China, travels to America in order to rescue Princess Pei-Pei, whom has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Wang gets caught up in a train robbery, which through a strange series of events, Wang becomes friends with outlaw Roy O'Bannon, whom are now both determined to rescue the princess.There are loads of action scenes, but despite excellent choreography, they never come across as more than loud and dull. These scenes never generate tension, or do anything particularly unique.The comedy itself is hardly sophisticated, and while there are a number of amusing lines, there aren't nearly enough to top the gags that fall flat. The characters are generally weak. While Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon have great chemistry and a surprisingly well done character arc, Roy O'Bannon is undeveloped. In his first couple scenes, Roy seems to be a very timid robber, but this is not referred to for the rest of the film. The villain, Lo Fong, has no personality at all.The cast is surprisingly devoted. Jackie Chan portrays a perfect Asian stereotype. Yes, the portrayal might be a wee bit offensive, but no one can deny the talent in this role. Owen Wilson also gives a lot of energy into his role. The rest of the cast, however, is generally forgettable.The score by Randy Edelman attempts to combine Western and Asian music, but the result is clumsy and awkward. The occasional rock elements and heavy percussion don't help much.Shanghai Noon could be somebody's nightmare. It wasn't quite such an unpleasant experience for me, but it was far from positive. Often dull, often racist, and a lack of truly riotous humor makes for a long 2 hours. This isn't the train wreck it could've been, but that's hardly high praise.</fullReview>

How about we reverse the roles... Make Jackie the ass- kicking playboy. Nope. Of course we will see him play a similar role in the sequel, as well as Rush Hour 1, 2, and 3. I would give it a 5, but I give it a higher rating mainly because I support Jackie for being one of the few successful Asians in Hollywood films, even though it's mainly due to his martial arts skills. I'm still waiting for an Asian actor/actress who becomes a major star for their acting skills and not because they can do their own stunts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shanghai Noon is one soft comedy that I just found myself loving, the movie pulls out a very nice romantic soft comedy that you will just go crazy for. Shanghai Noon has a nice pairing maybe the pairing is not as great as the one in Rush Hour but Owen Wilson style of comedy is one that I have come to love and appreciate.Owen Wilson's style is a laid back demeanor, and that of Jackie is one of comic martial art and scenes the mix is just unique. The movie can be seen to be of a form of a buddy cop genre.The movie paid homage to some nice western classics, like High Noon and Jackie Chan's character is named Chon Wang meant to sound like John Wayne. Also to love in the movie is the unusual suspense, the movie possess its own way of thrill, which include leaving you the viewer to really think: One of the things that I liked and is part of the suspense is the idea that Owen's Character Roy is the worse gunslinger around (this guy can't shoot straight to save his life), and somehow he has managed to survive in the west and even be the leader of an armed robbery gang. The second thing that got me thinking is also about the Roy character that was buried to his neck in the desert and somehow managed to get out from there and get to the nearest town before Jackie who was going on foot and a horse. Although when asked how he did it, he claimed to have dug himself out with chopsticks.The movie plot crosses across two regions, China and the US, in China Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) is an imperial guard and he has his eyes for the princess Pei-Pei (Lucy Liu), who got abducted and taken to America. Wang's affection for the princess made him join the Imperial Guards sent to bring back Pei-Pei, a ransom in gold was also sent by the king to Pei-Pei's captive. When in America in the west the train that they were in gets robbed and by Roy (Owen Wilson) and his crew and that is how Wang and Roy met.The two later joined together in an attempt to rescue the princess from her captive.The combination of the two was well received by many critics, which led to the movie having a huge sale in DVD's, and the movie itself was also a box office success.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>shanghai noon is easily jackie chans best American movie action wise, now don't get me wrong i prefer rush hour as a movie, but shanghai noon is a much better showcase for chan's sort of action and comedy, and for the most part the movie succeeds, and owen Wilson as his partner and friend is hilarious in this. some of the action is brilliantly done, and even though it doesn't touch his hong kong stuff, but is much better than rush hour, and the stunts in this are better and more daring. the reason shanghai noon is so enjoyable is because it works as just a movie, a comedy and an action movie, there's plenty here for everyone. i seen the sequel and i didn't like it, the action was more wire work, and cgi, and it just felt forced, and unneeded. but never the less i recommend shanghai noon, its a perfect film to introduce jackie chan to people and new fans alike</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Shanghai Noon because I do like Jackie Chan, and the premise seemed like the film would be a winner. Although I didn't find Shanghai Noon particularly special, it was a fun movie and I would recommend it.The plot is routine, with some of the ideas a tad forced. The film also feels 5 or so minutes too long, one or two scenes in the middle felt like they could have been shortened. Lucy Liu isn't given much to do either.However, the film is beautifully shot and the scenery and sets are equally ravishing. There is also a rousing score from Randy Eldemann, a smart script with some amusing if not hilarious jokes and sharply choreographed fight scenes. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are both very good, and are a well matched double act.Overall, not perfect, but fun and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is one of the great kung fu stars to step on the Hollywood stage. I liked every American movie Chan has made and this is no exception. Shanghai Noon actually made be one of his best. There is a great mixture of comedy and action combined. Unlike the somewhat annoying Chris Tucker, Owen Wilson makes a great sidekick to Chan.This takes place in the Old West. Chan is sent from China to rescue the kidnapped Princess. Along the way, he become partners with a train robber. Together, they face the challenges of the Old West in many hilarious ways.Overall, this is a wonderful movie with great music, crazy stunts, and good ol' comedy. My favorite scene was the forced marriage between Chan and the Native American girl. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyably silly action comedy with the grand master, Jackie Chan.Chan plays a Chinese Imperial guard in the mid 1800's, sent to America by order of the Emperor to bring back a princess who is captive of a particularly unpleasant Chinese character named Lo Fong. Upon arrival in America, Chan has the misfortune to be on a train when a gang of outlaws, led by the most laid back, incompetent cowboy of them all, Owen Wilson, storm the train on a robbery. Inevitably, as Chan seeks the Princess, their paths become inexorably linked.Some decent fight sequences, Chan's trademark stunt work (though toned down from his earlier work, presumably due to age) and a witty script make this entertaining enough fare.I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasing comedy actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really rate or comment on this film negatively, even though it's a movie almost completely devoid of originality and ideas. Basically this is a formula buddy movie, typical of Jackie Chan's work both here and in China in that it involves elaborate stuntwork, kung-fu with props, and humorous characters and situations. I don't usually bother with Chan's American films since he already made better ones in China, but I wanted to see this one because I've always liked Owen Wilson and I wanted to see how they worked together. Happily I can report that I was pleased greatly with their chemistry, enough so that I might even bother to seek out the sequel at some point.The story is like a comedy variation on the old movie "Red Sun" with Charles Bronson and Toshiro Mifune, except that in this case the Asian hero is Chinese and the object they are seeking is not a precious ceremonial sword but rather the princess of China herself (Lucy Liu). Liu is the weak link in the film if there is one... she doesn't seem to have much talent for comedy, although the film didn't give her too many chances to show it off. Much more interesting is Native American model Brandon Merrill, who made her only film appearance here as the gorgeous and strong-willed woman who takes Chan's character (who her people refer to as "fights in a dress") as a husband.There are some fun moments that come at us, and the film's pace is breezy and light. I liked Wilson and Chan's drinking scene, and the ensuing fight gives Chan an opportunity to revive his much-admired "drunken master" technique. Wilson and Chan make a good pairing because Wilson is so incredibly low-key and Chan is so amazingly high-strung. They're the kind of opposites that always attract, and all the story and other characters are really just trappings for the chemistry they develop.For all that the film does have going for it, it simply lacks a few really outrageous laugh-out-loud moments that could have put it over the top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine Rush Hour (martial arts) mixed with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (outlaw cowboy), and that gives you an idea of what to expect with this fun to watch western action comedy, from director Tom Dey (Failure to Launch). Basically it is the 19th Century, and Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped from her the Forbidden City in her home country, and it is the strict duty and personal responsibility of Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) to get her back, well, with the other three guys, but forget them. On his journey in Nevada, in the U.S., he meets outlaw cowboy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), originally a near bad guy, with no like of violence or anything nasty, but he is soon finding himself wanting to help his new "partner". Oh, by the way, the bad guy is Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), a traitor of Wang's home country, and he is obviously wanting a priceless amount of gold as ransom. Also starring Brandon Merrill as Indian wife, Candyman's Xander Berkeley as Van Cleef, Walton Goggins as Wallace, Adrien P. Dorval as Blue, Rafael Báez as Vasquez and Jason Connery as Andrews. Chan gets his stunts and fighting sequences, and Wilson gets his witty dialogue and gun play, and Liu gets to look glamorous, in a pretty entertaining film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"John Wayne..., that's a terrible cowboy name!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of movie Westerns, I got the biggest kick every time a reference was made or an homage paid to characters and films that had gone before. Most obvious of course is the title knock off of genre favorite "High Noon", and it just keeps building from there. Chon Wang/John Wayne was a hoot, along with the very obvious naming of the bad guy sheriff after high profile character actor Lee Van Cleef. Then there's the bit where Jackie Chan's horse does the gimmick with the blanket, something I'd seen done before by no less notable equine stars as Roy Rogers' Trigger and Tonto's Scout in pictures going back to the early 1950's. Above all, I couldn't help noticing in scene after scene how much Owen Wilson looked like Redford's Sundance Kid, so much so that I could almost picture him as Paul Newman's sidekick in that 1969 film, except Wilson couldn't even come close as an actor. Which is OK if you're going for the over the top kind of comedy that this one does, but then you have to be prepared for mixed results. By that I'm thinking about scenes like the drunken hot tub splish splash that would have been alright if done just once, but got to be tedious after just the second time. There were just too many moments like that one that seemed to interfere with the flow of the story. Brandon Merrill had the thankless task of Chon Wang's Indian wife, who seemed to pop up from time to time to let us know she was around, but without any real connection to the story. So she came through with a save near the end of the picture, but why do the flip flop for Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) as Chon Wang pairs off with the Princess (Lucy Liu)? Not very realistic or believable, especially on the part of the women. I would expect a Chinese princess to have more class than that, and an Indian maiden would certainly have had more discipline.But let's face it, you go into a Jackie Chan film for the martial arts choreography and innovative fight scenes, so on that score, this one delivers. Hard to imagine how you could incorporate trees and moose antlers into a fight routine, but Jackie does it with style. I'd like to know if you could expend all that energy beating up on six Crow warriors and still remain standing, but I think we all know that answer - it's a movie.Say, I noticed something that made me curious relative to a street sign in Carson City in the latter part of the picture. You could only make out a portion of the message that stated 'Bulldog Drummond's ?'. So I did a quick google to learn that Bulldog Drummond's first literary appearance occurred in a 1920 novel. That would have been quite the feat to predict his existence approximately forty years into the future from the story's setting in 1881. Somehow I don't think Chong Wang and O'Bannon needed the help of a fictional British detective.</fullReview>

I thought Owen Wilson played his part excellent as the laid back cowboy, but sadly Chan was the same character as in his other movies. Will his movies ever have a different idea.

A faithful servant named Wang (Jackie Chan)follows the tracks until Nevada, along the way he teams up with a roguish gunfighter (Owen Wilson).Once time in the West that confront against Indians, treacherous sheriff (Xander Berkeley) and perfidious Chinese.The motion picture displays action Western, humor with tongue in check, spectacular struggles with Chan style and is pretty funny.Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson create an enjoyable and amusing pair. When Jackie Chan goes into action with his kicks, bounds and leaps, are the highlights. It's usual in Chan movies make enjoyable duos, a buddy movie style, as male partner: Chris Tucker (Rush hour I,II and III), as female: Jennifer Love Hewitt( The Tuxedo) and Claire Forlani(The medallion) and this one to pair off splendidly with Owen Wilson. Furthermore, Chan owner a funny horse, Jolly Jumper-alike from Lucky Luke series. The movie gets a glimmer cinematography and appropriate music score accompanying to action by Randy Edelman, author, along with Trevor Jones, of the classic soundtrack for ¨The last Mohican¨. The film is well directed by Tom Day and is followed by a inferior sequel : ¨Shanghai knights¨ , set in 1887, London ,where our two friends recover a valuable royal jewel robbed in the forbidden city.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SHANGHAI NOON pairs Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson as, respectively, a Chinese royal guard and train robber in search of a kidnapped princess, winningly played by Lucy Liu. The film is strictly slapstick, as is often the case with Chan's fighting style, and Wilson is very funny as Chan's boastful but reluctant sidekick. There's also some name play, which I will not spoil here -- other than to call your attention to Chan's character's name and its pronunciation. The sinister kidnapper is played to the hilt by a familiar Chinese-American actor, Roger Yuan. The film is too long, but Chan keeps things rocking and rolling for most of the ride. His fight using a horseshoe and length of rope against several heavily armed bad guys is hysterical. I would give this a slightly higher rating except for its excessive length and repetitiveness of the stunts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the early 1880s Chan is a dedicated servant of the Chinese Imperial Army who makes his way to the American West after the Chinese princess is kidnapped. Without any friends and unsure of whom he can trust, he forms an unlikely partnership with bumbling outlaw Wilson and together they embark on the journey of a lifetime to try and find the damsel in distress. Entertaining but uneven action-comedy makes good use of the familiar fish-out-of-water/buddy film formula that worked so well for Chan in Rush Hour, but it takes its time getting started and never hits a stride. The Chan and Wilson duo have their ups and downs, but they're redeemed to a surprising extent by Chan who delivers the goods with trademark fight sequences. **?</fullReview>

When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped from the Forbidden City, Wang feels personally responsible and insists on joining the guards sent to rescue the Princess, who has been whisked away to the United States. In Nevada and hot on the trail of the kidnappers, Wang is separated from the group and soon finds himself an unlikely partner with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a small time robber with delusions of grandeur. Together, the two forge onto one misadventure after another.Its a good buddy-flick with nice lightweight entertainment. The 2nd installment Shanghai Nights is even better, so check that out too.</fullReview>

Unlike his previous films, Jackie has finally found a sidekick that works well alongside him and is able to play off of his physical stunts."Shanghai Noon" is unlike any other Jackie Chan movie I have seen. It is his best since "Rush Hour" and is among one of the best all-action movies that I've seen with an actual plot behind it. After watching previous Jackie Chan movies such as "Rush Hour" and "Rumble In The Bronx, I was expecting to be dazzled with his comedic talent as well as action filled sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it had every one of the components and requirements that I require for a good movie.Owen Wilson was comedic treat to this film as he added spark to an already great movie. Other than the cliche plot, "Shanghai Noon" brings a lot of excellent comedy, dialogue, action, thrills and even a little romance. I was expecting Owen Wilson to be similar to Chris Tucker, but in "Shanghai Noon" Wilson proved himself to be much better than other Jackie Chan sidekicks I've seen him teamed with. I was glad I rented this movie so I would be able to recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers*Shanghai Noon sees Jackie Chan team up with American wise-cracker Owen Wilson for this entertaining kung fu comedy western.Set in 1881, the action starts in China where we meet Jackie as a bumbling Imperial Guard called Chon Wang (pronounced John Wayne). In typically self-deprecating style he is seen on his hands and knees bowing to the soon-to-be-kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu).She is taken to America and a ransom is put up for her safe return. It's up to the three bravest Imperial Guards and Chon Wang to travel to America and hand over the required gold for her safe return.Going to America is the cue for Chon to meet up with Roy O'Bannon (Wilson), a laidback outlaw attempting to rob a train with his less laidback associates. Chon is the proverbial fish-out-of-water and many East meets West gags ensue.This is not a film which should be taken seriously in any way, but nevertheless there are attempts to inject real emotion into the film and these are treated rather heavy handedly. They seem at odds with the goofball nature of the film. For example, the death of Chon's uncle is quickly forgotten and swept under the carpet, Chon doesn't even seem too intent on taking revenge on the person who committed the murder.Romance seems to have been put in simply to fill the multi-generic needs of a Hollywood film. There is little chemistry between Jackie and Liu, and even less with Wilson and his respective love interest (played by a real life rodeo rider who is given little dialogue, but still too much).Despite these flaws the film still works, mainly because of the two stars, and a sharp script from Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Owen Wilson's lazy charm contrasts perfectly with Jackie Chan's animated acting style.For fight fans there is also plenty to enjoy even though the Hollywood system limits the amount of stuntwork that Jackie can do, even though he still does all his own stunts. The highlights includes a fight with two Mohawks, and a traditional bar room brawl given the Jackie Chan makeover.This film is definitely worth a look, but I hope in the future that Hollywood doesn't simply use Jackie as buddy movie fodder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Action/Comedy/Buddy/Martial Arts/Western of the Week</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 8.9 (out of 10)Of all of the `east-meets-west' scenarios Hollywood has concocted to showcase the talents of international action star Jackie Chan, Shanghai Noon turns out to be the most fun and surprisingly fresh yet. His American partner this time is one blonde haired Owen Wilson in his first big lead role. Chan and Wilson have more chemistry and are more fun to watch then Chan and 'Rush Hour' co-star Chris Tucker ever were. Not to mention the high concept setting that successfully mixes the buddy comedy, a Hong Kong martial arts movie and an old American western (the deadest of generas). It is the 18th century. Chan is imperial guard Chon Wang who winds up alone in the old west searching for the Chinese royal family's kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu, thankfully with little screen time). Wilson is, and I remember it so well because it just sounds like a typical cowboy name, Roy O'Bannon - a hapless, 2-bit train robber with an even more incompetent team behind him. Wilson gets huge laughs with his motor mouth and that constantly befuddled look on his face. He looks like he'd rather be surfing. It isn't long before a series of events throws them together and send each into a culture shock. In typical buddy movie style they are at each others throats one minute and in a tub bonding over their drinking games the next. There may be a cliché here and there but watching these two bounce off each other is exuberant and refreshing it's hardly noticeable.'Shanghai Noon' is helmed by first-time director Tom Dey who makes a remarkable debut. Dey lobs the gags at us, well timed and many times from the periphery of our vision - something noticeably lost when the movie is seen in a pan-and-scan version. O'Bannon's first stage coach robbery and a scene with a drunken Jackie Chan and his drunken horse are absolute riots. The movie also has put equal time into the action department. There are a lot of great fights and action set pieces in here allowing Chan to show off his magic. He makes use of ropes, trees, antlers and all sorts of props when improvising in some terrific - and even exciting - fight scenes. The cocktail premise of 'Shanghai Noon' is so original that it is only in thee patented Chan moments where we are brought back into being aware that this is `a Jackie Chan vehicle'. At nearly 2 solid hours the movie threatens to drag, but have no fear. It has enough wit and creativity up it's sleeve to grab our interest and not let go. Many recent action movies are long for the sake of it, but Noon makes ample use of it's time to give us a fully realized and satisfying comedic adventure. And with Dey and two comic pros like Chan and Wilson driving the antics, Shanghai Noon is a hoot and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SHANGHAI NOON (2000) possible spoilers(((( Jackie Chan is an actor who's always been Hollywood's one too many B - movie actors (I say along with van-Damme, Norris and Lundgren). He fights fast in movies like Mr. Nice Guy, Rumble in the Bronx and we go on, but in Rush Hour he showed that he can actually make a good movie, and in 2000 he got hooked up with Owen Wilson and soon Shanghai Noon was a success! The buddy - western/comedy is a nice movie that spins mostly around Wilson's funny character and Chan's fast fighting.The movie has as all Chan's movies funny kung fu scenes, as when Chan fights some Native Americans beside a river and up in some trees, or when Chan fights on a moving train, or when it's a big showdown in a saloon. It is all very entertaining and speaks very well to Jackie Chan's most respected area, without doubt in his manage to move his body around and using everything he sees to fight with. Great buddy-comedy! STARS: *** 3/5 (the sequel is better)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After several years of having dubbed movies released in America, Jackie Chan finally started making some movies of his own. They ended up being smash hits, and actually being pretty good. In Shanghai Noon, Jackie Chan is from the Forbidden City and has just received word the Princess has been kidnapped. On the way out to rescue her, his train is robbed by Owen Wilson and they are thus forced together and eventually work together to get the princess back. Both provide some of the greatest chemistry between a duo, while Chan provides the action Wilson always provides the laugh. They build on each other well, and the everything feels right. The action, as expected from any Chan flick is great, most noticeably the fight in the end of the movie in the tower with the bell. Lucy Liu plays the princess, who unfortunately seems not to do much throughout the movie. Her character seems empty and just sort of there for the purpose of liking Jackie Chan. The script endlessly topples one joke upon the other, but unfortunately after awhile it gets tired and old and seems to replay the same jokes. Sometimes the action feels like it's being prolounged way too much and that it's not always relevant. However, the great chemistry between the two leads and the great action make this an enjoyable movie; it's also worth it to see the sequel Shanghai Knights which will probably come to DVD in a few months. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS was my kind of Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucy Liu is the princess of China, and she doesn't want to marry the man her father the emperor has in mind, so she runs away to the United States, in the days of the Old West. Three members of the imperial guards are assigned to bring her back, and they must also pay a ransom of 100,000 gold pieces because she has been kidnapped. The uncle of one of the guards also goes to the United States with the group, but unfortunately he is killed in a train robbery committed by a bungling group of outlaws. Jackie Chan does a wonderful job, whether it is comedy, drama, or martial arts fighting, as the nephew who at first wants revenge but must later work with the gang's leader to rescue the princess. I had never heard of the actor playing Roy, the gang's leader, but he also gave a standout performance, and the scenes where he and Chan work together are priceless. Among Chan's misadventures: he rescues a young Indian girl and is rewarded by her tribe--he ends up married to a beautiful Indian woman without realizing it happened. Later Chan makes a complete fool of himself trying to pretend he is just a regular guy, though he handles himself quite well in fights that are not typical of the Western genre. His partner thinks Chan's name sounds a lot like John Wayne, so that's what Roy ends up calling his Chinese friend, while the wanted posters refer to Chan as The Shanghai Kid (even though he is not from Shanghai). One scene where the two escape from jail is hilarious, though the humor is not the type most parents would want their younger children to see. Other good performances: Lucy Liu, particularly in scenes where she is speaking Chinese with subtitles, and her kidnapper, a man who makes slaves out of Chinese immigrants. The Indians are quite funny, and so is the very intelligent horse they give Chan. And despite the violent outcome, I enjoyed the humorous performances of the train robbers. The movie is mostly funny, and the martial arts fighting scenes are more slapstick than real violence, though as with most Westerns there is a good deal of gunfire and even a few explosions. There is some cursing but not as much as in the average action movie. One thing I could have done without: most of the music came from about one hundred years after the time when this movie was set. Though ZZ Top's 'La Grange' sounded quite good for one of the fight scenes. This was a real winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came into "Shanghi Noon" hoping to get another fun and exciting Jackie Chan movie. I expected there to be many laughs but also lots of action. I was right about the laughs, but wrong about the action. In this movie, Jackie plays an Imperial Guard in the Forbidden City. When the Princess (Lucy Liu) of the city is unexpectedly kidnapped and brought to Carson City, Jackie takes charge. The princess is taken to a man that is a traitor to the Forbidden City. He asks for a large ransom from the king of the Forbidden City if he wants to see his daughter again. The king assigns four men from the Forbidden City to rescue her. When a train robber (Owen Wilson) attempts to rob the train that the men are riding to Carson City in, Jackie takes charge. He and Wilson eventually hook up in order to save the princess. There is action in this movie, but not as much as there should be. The only thing that keeps this movie afloat is Owen Wilson's great performance. Chan once again gives terrific stunts and gives the best he's got, but the movie falls just short of being the great action flick is could've been.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since first watching Shanghai Noon, I have rented it at least 3 times. Now I have bought it, and watched it at least twice more. Even knowing what is going to happen - and when, I get hysterical watching it. Great scenery, great actors, enough drama, action, and romance to make it interesting. Hilarious lines, and Owen and Jackie seem to be made for the parts. Thanks for a great entertaining movie without the "trash" vocabulary that so many have these days. I LOVE THE MOVIE!!!!

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of westerns or kung-fu flics, so I'd never even noticed when Shanghai Noon originally came out in theaters.I saw a trailer for the sequel, Shanghai Knights, when waiting with my daughter to see Catch Me If You Can. I said, "That looks different. Like it might be fun." She clued me into Shanghai Noon.So rent it we did, and it was a blast.Okay, so it's a Jackie Chan vehicle flic. The plot is devised more to give him interesting things to do martial arts moves with than anything else. But the main characters are interesting and engaging, the humor is acutally funny (rather than just potty humor), and the martial-arts scenes are so beautifully choreographed, and so much fun, that even a kung-fu scrooge like me can thoroughly enjoy them.Interesting note -- as we were watching the train-robbery sequence, I muttered to my daughter, "A kung-fu movie set in cowboy times.... Oh! Shang - High Noon. Groan."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully directed send-up, with Jumpin' Jackie Chan at his absolute funniest. For purists, there are stunts aplenty, but it's the give-and-take between Chan and co-star Owen Wilson that makes this one Chan's finest. I was one of those early converts who waited DECADES to see Jackie Chan make an "American comedy." While RUSH HOUR had its moments, it also had Chris Tucker (and, if you can stomach his Michael Jackson schtick, you're a better man than I am- or will ever be). This time around, he's teamed with someone who's capable of giving as good as he gets. Good writing helps. Chan is the modern Chaplin (pun intended; Chaplin fans, please take note). If you're one of those fence-sitters who hasn't yet taken the plunge, this is the best jumping-off point. Check out Jackie Chan. You can thank me later.</fullReview>

It is a rul in films that opposites attract so in order to make a good comedy movie with characters with chemistry you have to have two totally different kinds of people. Jackie Chan is the obedient rescue type that follows all the rules and does everything by the book, oh and hes not a huge comedian either. Owen Wilson is the loud mouthed cowboy that does everything his way and very spiratically, which also causes him to be a major screw up. The two put together are as good as Jackie and Chris in the Rush Hours. Chans movies with Wilsons comedy truly make this film worth watching.</fullReview>

I'm not a really big fan of Jackie Chan although I do love him in the Rush Hour movies. Owen Wilson is one of my favorite actors.I hate that he's so underrated because he really is a great actor.

I loved the relationship between Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Berkeley) and Roy O'Bannon (Wilson). That was really funny and cute. If you want a good laugh you should see this one even if you don't like westerns (like me). But Shanghai Noon isn't your average western. Anyways.

		<shortDescription>"'Shanghai Noon' is Not Perfect, but It's Still Worth Watching"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shanghai Noon" is not a full-on classic, but it doesn't deserve a lot of the negative comments I leafed through. Jackie Chan (the bumbling but heartstrong Chon Wang) and Owen Wilson (Roy O'Bannon) make an unlikely but effective team because they add naivete and determination to the two misfits. Lucy Liu shows exceptional spunk as the fiesty Princess Pei-Pei, and she holds up against Lo Fong (Roger Yuan adds a laid-back but icy edge to the renegade Imperial Guard). The hyperactive Chon Wang's marriage to a Native American princess, though, could have been edited out of the movie because it is not essential to the movie's storyline. The corrupt sheriff Nathan Van Cleef (portrayed by Xander Berkeley) could have been fleshed out a little more because he resembles a sketch of the stock corrupt public official. It's not perfect for movie buffs, but it is acceptable for a slow Saturday morning when there are marathons of college football games.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of Chan's Hong Kong Movies you will not think much this western/eastern caper. The thing with Jackies Hong Kong movies is the Spectacular stunts and set pieces, which can last for over 20 min. Shanghai Noon is not a bad Movie, in fact it's a nice way to pass an hour and a half for all the family. but if you have seen any of Jackie's past works i.e the Police story films or the Armor of God, or in fact most of his work from the 80s, that it pails into the shadows.Jackie has heard the call of the mighty buck and come running, well he has earned it. Avoid this and Rent Police Story instead. Ok so the acting and story are bad, as they are in Shanghai noon, but at least you can wow and gasp at the sheer danger of the stunts.Maybe its unfair to compare Jackie then and now, he is getting old. but watch his old movies, and see what a true master he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The much ballyhooed Owen Wilson was the worst part of this film. Not that he's an unlikeable personality, he just delivers flat, useless lines, most of which are obvious ad libs. Jackie Chan, always likeable and not so ready to play with the dialogue makes this middling comic western watchable. He's slowing down a bit with age but his quicksilver moves are still blinding by anyone's standards and his unique knack for physical comedy is an always welcome additive. The problems with this film is the substandard direction, third act writing and the fact that Wilson seems unwilling to play an appropriate character. He had the chance to send-up any number of western icons from Paul Newman to Kirk Douglas and manages to prove he he hasn't got a clue what his character was meant to be. He gets on your nerves fast and stays there despite the odd laugh he does manage to generate. The story, though derived from other western sources, is solid enough. Putting Chan in the Old West (Well actually the Canadian West doesn't much resemble New Mexico but hey this a B movie anyway) as a hapless member of the Chinese Imperial Guard tracking down the kidnapped princess he's smitten over is actually quite good, even clever. But it tends to not deliver on the promise it holds, building toward a completely contrived outcome which is a shame. Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD fill in some plot holes but really the wayward direction and the last few pages of the script seem to be the problem. On a whole the film succeeds best when it's sending up some of the more famous westerns, but Owen Wilson and Director Dey all but water it down. Has some good moments but not a classic by any means.</fullReview>

It centres on a pretty Chinese princess (Lucy Liu) who is mislead into travelling to 1883 American cowboy country, getting kidnapped and being forced into slavery. Jackie plays a servant sent by the Chinese to bring her back. From here the fun starts, he finds himself unwillingly teaming up with a wannabe Billy the kid type outlaw (Superbly played by Owen Wilson ? The Haunting), with a mean sheriff (Xander Berkeley - Terminator 2, Gattaca) and a whole lot of trouble on his tail. Daft enough enjoyable stuff even if your not too big a fan of Chan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think we can all safely say that Owen Wilson saved this movie from just being another Jackie Chan movie. Tom Dey's giving carte blanche to Wilson for writing his own lines was the best decision in the entire process of making this film. The action scenes are not as good as other Chan movies, perhaps because cowboys do not know karate and have guns, so the dialogue must be relied on to carry the movie. Attention, ignorant masses: do not refer to Owen Wilson as "the other guy besides Jackie Chan;" he is a star and he made this film work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SHANGHAI NOON (2000) Rating: 7/10Jackie Chan is certainly a hard man to dislike. In 1998 he gave us the neat action-comedy Rush Hour and now he's bringing back life to the tired comic-western genre. Jackie certainly gets good marks in my books, but the real star of Shanghai Noon is Owen Wilson who proves with a fantastic chemistry-filled and swashbuckling attitude that he can go above and beyond The Haunting. The script of Shanghai Noon is very cool, with neat one-liners and plenty of interesting and likeable characters. The photography is amazing, with the stunning western backdrops and brilliantly filmed fight sequences. Speaking of those, there are some very good fight sequences, but some may argue it is not up to Chan's standards. The film also drags on for too long near the end. I was happy with the martial arts but some scenes just didn't need to be there. There are some cool bloopers at the end, so don't stop the tape or leave the theatre as soon as you see black. Shanghai Noon is fresh, entertaining, funny, surprisingly violent and intriguing. I highly recommend it for viewing on a Saturday night when you're relaxed and ready to enjoy some gunslinging action fun.</fullReview>

Outstandingly nutty stunt work and 4. A great script. And yes my friends, this film has them all. Fair enough some people may comment on the fact that the kidnapped princess routine has been done many times before and yes it has, but this film does not just focus on that one aspect of the script. The story takes many different paths which are all hilarious and all come together to build the film and end up in a very satisfying ending. Admittedly the parts where Chan and Wilson aren't on camera are a bit boring but during the parts which they are you will not be able to stop laughing. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Jackie Chan comedy can be good even without a lot of action, as long as it is very funny. Shanghai Noon has a large lack of the action Jackie fans have come to expect from the man. But it is an American production, so how much awe-inspiring action can we really get? Well, I was hoping for more than this. But let me tell you, this movie is funny. I was laughing out loud the whole time. Jackie Chan plays an imperial guard sent to America to rescue a princess, and Owen Wilson plays a train robber, and when they meet up, its almost non-stop hilarity. Chan and Wilson play so well off of each other, and have great chemistry. The action is very...well...its not up to Chan standards, and not as exciting as I was expecting it to be. But as a comedy alone, it works very well. So if you want a good laugh, this is a good movie to check out. But if you want to see some sweet fights, check out some of Chan's older movies, like Drunken Master 2 or Project A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly pleased with this film. The combo of Chan/Wilson is fantastic...better than Chan/Tucker in Rush Hour. Chan is Chan, always enjoyable. His stunts are slowing down, but he makes up for iut with some cute/funny scenes. HE becomes more comfortable witht he camera with every film he makes, and it helps his overall likability. Why this movie REALLY succeeds is Owen Wilson. This movie should push him over the top if enough people see it. He is LEGITIMATELY funny in his own "laid back cool guy" kind of style. Watching him rough it in the old west is hilarious, because you're thinking to yourself, this guy belongs on a surf board on the beach. He really pulls it off here...with fantastic one liners. The way he talks and approaches even the smallest of scenes is funny. His hamrless sarcasm is at it's best here. This movie is an exact replica of one of my all time favorites, "The Frisco Kid" with a VERY YOUNG Harrison Ford and Gene Wilder. If you have NOT seen that movie and liked "Shanghai Noon" The Frisco Kid is a must see. All they have done is replaced Gene Wilder's Polish Rabbi character with Jackie Chan's Chinese Imperial Guard character. They are both fish out of water characters who have to survive in the wild west. Owen Wilson has the exact same character as harrison Ford...train robbers with heart who ened up helping these fish out of water and gaining a friend and partner in the process. I would LOVE to see a sequel to this movie. "Rush Hour", while enjoyable, received too much hype and this movie received too little. I have recommended this film to several people in the mood for a light comedy. I look for BIG THINGS from Owen Wilson in the future...he is one of the funnier guys out there now, and he really does have a UNIQUE style to him that makes him very easy to like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was an award for combining the most movie genres in one, this move would win for the next 10 years. It's about Jackie being an emperial guard and going to the west to save the Princess (Kinda like a Mario Brothers game), then he meets up with Owen Wilson, the worst outlaw in the west, and comedy ensues. The basic premise is the same as Rush Hour, Jackie comes over from China, and then is a fish out of water. Owen Wilson is a more calm sarcastic, and less vulgar, Chris Tucker. The difference between the two movies, is that Jackie get to be the martial arts superhero, in China he is just an emperial guard, no better than any of the other ones, in the west he's up against guys with guns and bar fighting skills, guess who gets their butts whooped? The best thing about this movie is that it has every element a western should have, with Jackie in them, and Owen is along to show him the ropes, and make tons of funny comments on the way. So, go rent this and prepare to see the birth of the weirdest movie genre ever!FOOTNOTE: The home released version of this movie has scenes cut out of it from when it aired in the theaters, to sell the DVD, so get the DVD, see the deleted scenes, and fill up the minor plot holes the rental version leaves you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comedy... Kung Fu... Romance... Hilarious out-takes... and it's a Western! What more could you want for your fistful of movie dollars? Jackie Chan's unbridled energy electrifies the action sequences, which punctuate a taut script laced with humor. Lucy Liu is stunning as the Chinese princess, but the real scene stealer is Owen Wilson. You've seen him in Armageddon and Meet the Parents, but as the endearingly inept gunslinger Roy O'Bannon, Wilson gives his best performance to date. The pairing of Chan and Wilson makes one of the best buddy combos since Glover and Gibson, and director Tom Dey should be congratulated on letting the two actors find a palpable friendship with what appears to be natural ease. Be sure to stick around for the credits, which keep the laughs rolling, and give a glimpse of how hard it must have been to keep a straight face on the set. Spring for the DVD and you'll find a wealth of extras, including great commentary tracks and an interactive trivia game.</fullReview>

This movie has pretty impressive fight scenes. And Jackie is so funny!! I also enjoy the relationship between Jackie and Owen. I watched this film like 10 times and each time I watch it I laugh and laugh. The stunts are good and the fights are pretty good also. Most action comes at the end of the movie. "Lucy Liu" only had like one short fight scene not like in "Charlie's Angels". For all the people who likes this movie there is going to be a sequel it's called "Shanghai Knights" with Jackie and Owen again. This film is great for people all ages I think. This film made it big time I think. Because when I went to see it the whole theater was filled with people. So go rent this film today or just buy it for $9.99 at blockbuster or something... I found this film great in action and comedy and I hope you will to. And don't forget to watch the sequel when it comes out.</fullReview>

I love Lucy Liu, and here we get to see her kick some butt, as well as look as lovely as ever. The two stars' different types of humor work very well together, and it's got some great cinematography, too.

		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight - if you want to watch a Western, go see one of the classics. This movie is not a Western, it just happens to be set there.Jackie Chan is still relatively unknown in the West, but one of Asia's greatest stars. With any luck, more movies like this will make him more popular over here as we sorely need some actors who look like they're enjoying their job. Chan does that throughout the movie and you can't help but grin along.The real surprise had to be Owen Wilson, who has popped up in bit parts in many movies, but until now his roles haven't actually required him to act - what a mistake. He plays a surfer-dude born one century too early making ends meet as a bandit so laid back he's almost horizontal.Combining his verbal skills with Chan's eyewatering martial arts and physical dexterity was a great move. The two play off each other brilliantly (and nowhere better than in a bath scene that had me crying in laughter).It isn't perfect, it needs some editing in places and there is some unnecessary swearing that might offend some, but it *is* a lot of fun. If you haven't seen any Jackie Chan before this is a good place to start.</fullReview>

However, it's engaging and fun to watch. Just don't expect too much. Chan does his usual array of fantastic martial arts and acrobatics, and the real surprise, for me at least, was Owen Wilson.

		<fullReview>Nothing intellectually challenging but it is fun. Owen Wilson has a number of good lines and delivers them in a comic style that will cause you to burst out in laughter. Jackie Chan has a number of good stunts/scenes which will cause to hit the replay button on your VCR/DVD. Lucy Lui has a very small part. If you want some harmless crash-bang-slapstick fun then this movie delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sincerely thought this movie was going to be great but it was a true disappointment. I think Rush Hour is by far a much better movie. The plot is very similar but it was very well developed in Rush Hour, and a lot funnier, while in Shanghai Noon there was something missing. Nevertheless, Jackie Chan is a great actor and he will always be one of my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Ride As Imperial China Meets The Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get the unimportant stuff out of the way first. The story revolves around 19th century Chinese Imperial Guardsman Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) sent to America to rescue a Princess (Lucy Liu) who has been kidnapped and taken to Carson City, Nevada (!?), where she's being held for a ransom of gold. Now, forget about all that. The story is really secondary, and only serves as an excuse for some decent martial arts action (which nevertheless doesn't, thankfully, take over, and for some frivolity between Chan and Owen Wilson (playing the outlaw Roy O'Bannon, with whom Chon Wang teams up.)There are some decent enough laughs here (I especially liked the drinking game O'Bannon plays with Chon while in the bathtub), and you have to give some credit to a movie that allows you to fall asleep for ten minutes (I confess that I did) and pick right up without feeling as if you've missed a beat. (At the same time the wordplay on Chon Wang/John Wayne got very old very fast.)Lucy Liu was, I thought, unfortunately underused. She was extremely well cast (mind you, that was probably not difficult since there are not exactly scores of young, attractive Chinese actresses in Hollywood.) Liu possesses a mysterious and exotic beauty that lends itself to the image of royalty, but she wasn't really given very much to do in a movie that revolved around Chan and Wilson.By all means take a look at this. It's enjoyable, funny, has plenty of action. Not a classic by any means, but I still rated it 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a typical Jackie Chan movie with a silly plot and ridiculous fight scenes. None of the plot is believable. There is some needless swearing and killing that seems to server only to raise the rating to PG-13.Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable movie because of the charm of Jackie Chan. He always seems to be having fun no matter how much trouble he gets into. The plot and his problems only serve to provide a framework into which he can fit fight scenes with their incredible, yet funny stunts. I'll remember the stunts in this movie long after I have forgotten the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>East meets west. Jackie Chan rides low in the saddle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very funny parody of the classic westerns we grew up with. Plenty of action and countless random acts of comedy. Chon Wang(Jackie Chan)represents the Chinese Imperial Guard, as he travels to 1821 Nevada to rescue Princess Pei Pei(Lucy Liu). Out of place Wang runs into a bumbling train robber Roy O'Bannon(Owen Wilson), who tries to school the pigtailed Chinaman in the arts of being a cowboy. The reluctant partners run into tight situations on their way to finding the princess.Chan is outstanding combining his comedic wit with manic martial arts. Wilson seems like a preppy drugstore cowboy hung out to dry. His lame character is also a big source of the movie's humor. Supporting cast includes:Xander Berkeley, Brandon Merrill, Walt Goggins and Jason Connery.Sit back and be prepared to laugh. Nothing here to think about, just relaxing entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this averages a vote of around 7! Shanghai Noon is not a completely terrible movie, but it didn't keep me engrossed with thrills and spills for the entire 110 minutes. I turned it off after the first half an hour to watch something else before coming back to it.I've never seen a Jackie Chan movie before and I have been curious as to what he's like, surely he does better work than this? That said, I rented this movie mainly because of Lucy Liu (pre-Charlie's Angels). She doesn't have a very big role but I enjoyed her scenes. I've never encountered Owen Wilson before and I vow to never watch one of his movies again because he just annoyed the bejeezus out of me. He has the MOST annoying voice and just everything about him bored me to tears. He's not funny in the slightest and he didn't really seem to fit into the role of his character. I dare say he was one of the major reasons I disliked this movie. The story was a nice twist on the whole Western theme, but the major themes have been done to death. If you're looking for comedy, look elsewhere. You know I was actually disappointed that I missed this at the cinema, but now I'm glad I didn't waste the ten bucks. I think the die-hard Chan fans will like it, but the general consensus among others seems to suggest a big fat flop of a movie. I happen to agree...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A muted Jackie Chan film that does not feature any of the great stunts that made some of his films classics in Hong Kong. There is a scene involving a tomahawk in here that was already used in Project A Part 2(1987). Jackie Chan does alright in a film that limits his talents. Follows the same plotline as Rush Hour(1999). The only part of the film I really enjoyed were the scenes in the Forbidden City. Another aspect I found interesting was the importance that the pony tail held in Manchu China. Xander Berkeley gives a wonderful homage to B movie and Itailan Western, Lee Van Cleef. Shanghai Noon(2000) at times reminds of the Italian Western comedies of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. Fellow Hong Kong star and Jackie Chan childhood friend, Yuen Biao has a small cameo in Shanghai Noon(2000).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What made this movie more enjoyable than the average Jackie Chan movie was co-star Owen Wilson's odd but great sense of humor. The chemistry between Chan and Wilson is terrific and Owen Wilson's ramblings add so much to this film. Fans of the typical Jackie Chan movie will still be entertained by his amazing stunts, but Jackie has never been funnier. The story isn't much more than an excuse to see Owen and Jackie in action, but they more than make up for a somewhat weak plot and other minor, underdeveloped characters. For what kind of movie this is the cinematography is worth mention. Great shots of the wild West. If you thought Rush Hour was half decent or have fallen in love with Owen Wilson from any of his other movies then go rent this movie now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely Cramped Jackie Chan Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is such a wonderfully appealing screen presence that you can't help but feel guilty when you don't fully embrace one of his films. However, when witty one-liners become the most important part of a Jackie Chan movie, something is clearly wrong. Shanghai Noon begins with the interesting idea of sticking Chan in a Western, but there's no real payoff in the action scenes. There are at least two fights in cramped bars, another in a cramped bordello. With a couple exceptions, the props aren't really used to their full potential either. All too often Shanghai Noon feels comfortable just using Jackie Chan as a walking sight gag without making any effort to use his true skills.Chan plays Chon Wang (insert endless series of "John Wayne" jokes here and you'll rise to the "comic genius" level of this movie), a member of the Imperial Guard sent to American to retrieve the kidnapped Princess Pei-Pei (insert endless series of "Pee-Pee" jokes here and you'll rise to the "comic genius" level of this movie). He goes West with three other guards and his translator uncle. When the uncle is killed by the slightly wacky new guy in a gang of outlaws, Wang must continue his search alone, until he meets up with the head of the outlaws Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) and before you can say "Rush Hour" they become an unlikely duo. And off they go in search of the Princess, chased by the former members of O'Bannon's gang, a slightly evil sheriff (winkingly named "Van Kleef" and played to the hilt by Xander Berkeley), and the traitor Lo Fong who kidnapped the princess.Shanghai Noon was written by Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, who seemed to take pleasure in draining the Leathal Weapon franchise of all character in that series's fourth installment. And here they have produced a comically self-contained script. We know that Chon Wang is mocked by the other imperial guards. But we have no idea why. We know that Lo Fong was a traitor. But we have no idea why. None of the characters have any backstory at all. I'm not looking for a Victorian novel here, but still... Shanghai Noon is also the kind of movie where the characters speak in Mandarin (I think) when their in China, but then whenever the Chinese characters interact in America, they speak in halting, accented English as if they feel the responsibility to try to adapt to their new land.As I said at the start, Jackie Chan is unfailingly appealing onscreen and no actor plays "drunk" as well). However, for the most part his stunts in this film just aren't on par with his best work, much less his mediocre American movies. There isn't even anything on par with the pool hall scene in Rush Hour for heavens sake! He has decent chemistry with Owen Wilson, but surely Chan must wish that he could find a way around these odd couple pairings. Wilson is a stitch as the outlaw who talks the walk, but can rarely walk the walk. And Lucy Lui is fairly awful as Princess Pei Pei. Sometimes her English is accented, sometimes not. But mostly she just has no part and does nothing to elevate the role otherwise. Pity.Shanghai Noon ends up beating the same drunk (not dead) horses over and over. It wastes the charisma of its two stars almost entirely. I'm being as generous as possible in giving it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big Jackie Chan fan, simply because he's not a good actor and after a while, his movies are cookie cutter remakes of each other, basically a showcase for his balletesque fight scenes (which are entertaining). For me, it's not worth sitting through bad acting and a weak script to get to Jackie's fight scenes, which is why I hardly watch any movies he's in (and Rush Hour was horrible). But in this film, he gets a side kick that plays off him well. Owen Wilson is excellent in this film, playing basically the same character he played in the great film "Bottle Rocket." His laid back, care free delivery provides some of the film's funniest lines. I have to say, I was laughing out loud at a couple scenes. Whereas in "Rush Hour," Chris Tucker dominated the movie, overshadowing Chan throughout most of it, these two actors work well together.I'm not a fan of "period" films that use lines that weren't around during that time (like the TV show "Hercules") but you can forgive it in this film. Sure, its plot is stock, but Chan and Wilson are such a great team, that you're willing to overlook just about anything. I couldn't care less about a sequel to "Rush Hour." But I would like to see a sequel to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected Shanghai Noon to a lot of fun and entertainment. Well, it was more than that. Shanghai Noon isn't just fun, it's clever and has a message, and although flawed, Shanghai Noon is definitely worth your time.Chinese Imperial Guard Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) travels from China to Nevada in search of Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) who has been kidnapped. With the help of train robber Roy O'Bannen (Own Wilson), who he doesn't trust, and a horse with a personality and attitude of its own, the two go up against the gunslingers of the west in a series of misadventures.There are many great things about Shanghai Noon: Tom Dey's assured direction, Miles Manner's kick-ass script and Jackie Chan's kung-fu liveability. But Owen Wilson really steals the show as the saddle-swinging Roy, his performance is watchable and he puts in a lot of effort, showing he can go past the disastrous result of The Haunting. The film is very unpredictable, but the very last 5 minutes of the film seem slightly rushed, and the camera is all over the place sometimes, so some dialogue is hard to understand and some action scenes are hard to watch. Otherwise, this is a totally full-of-life action/adventure that you'll like a lot.Entertaining, fast and fun, Shanghai Noon is recommended for all ages.I rate Shanghai Noon 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Jackie Chan showcase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since 1962, Jackie Chan has appeared in over 70 films in China, but until recently, he was virtually unknown to most U.S. audiences. He has always been well known among those who enjoy martial arts and he is famous in those circles as the daredevil actor who does all his own stunts, some of which have been wildly dangerous.However, Chan has always transcended his martial arts confinements, because besides being a talented martial arts athlete and stuntman, he is also an excellent comedian. He is a master of physical comedy who has often been compared with Buster Keaton, whom he idolizes. Now that he is learning to speak English, he is sure to become a big hit in the states.`Shanghai Noon' along with his smash hit `Rush Hour' (grossing $141 Million at the box office) have marked a turning point in his career. The emphasis in both films is on Jackie Chan the comedian rather than Jackie Chan the stuntman and karate expert. Sure, there are numerous scenes where he frenetically subdues a dozen or so thugs while climbing up walls and somersaulting through the air, but these action scenes are far sparser and less spectacular than in his Chinese films.`Shanghai Noon' didn't do as well at the box office (still a respectable $55 Million) as `Rush Hour', but it was actually the better film. Chan is clearly the star in this film whereas he was overshadowed by Chris Tucker's outrageousness in `Rush Hour'. Despite its insubstantial story, a sendup of American Westerns with a side order of Chinese, this film is a good showcase for Chan's broad range of talents, especially his physical comedy.Owen Wilson adds a wry note to the film by creating a bank robber that is as out of place in the American West as an Asian cowboy. Wilson plays his part like a California surfer who has recently completed a set of Tony Robbins tapes. He is so incongruous to his surroundings that almost everything he does is funny.Though not a superlative film, `Shanghai Noon' is entertaining and funny and worth seeing for light comedic entertainment. I rated it a 7/10. It continues to establish Jackie Chan as a comedic force to be reckoned with, and from whom we are likely to get much great entertainment in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of you have probably went to the bottom of my review, looked at the rating and had a hissy fit. Yes, I gave a kung-fu cowboy movie an 8. And yes,it deserved it. Shanghai Noon'll never earn any awards (except maybe an MTV award,but who cares about them?) but it's still worthy of renting.Jackie Chan plays Chon Wang (or John Wayne,see the pun?),a no-good member of the Chinese family. A man has come and kidnapped Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu). Chon's uncle (some old chinese dude)travels to America,and reluctantly takes Chon along. While they are in the train,someone kills Chon's uncle. it turns out to be Owen Wilson and his gang. Wang,in a fit of rage, goes after them and wonderful,magical adventures insue. (Look,I'm never going to review the Lion King,and I want to put that line in at least one review.)The movie is full of eye-popping stunts and fight scenes,and most of them are really great,even for a Jackie Chan movie. It's also a funny movie,especially when Owen Wilson gets into the story for real. The ending battle is really good,with Liu showing the moves that got her into Charlie's Angels. A good movie for all to enjoy. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Jackie Chan movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best Jackie Chan movie I've seen, and I think I've seen them all. In this film Jackie demonstrates his excellent skills in physical comedy. Great timing and facial expression. He and Owen Wilson work extremely well together, and I would love to see them together in another film. At first my husband thought Wilson's "California surf dude" caricature was inappropriate, but, as the comedy unfolded, we found that contrast to the typical Western hero to be a great source of comedy, and we found him to be a great partner for Chan. His slight resemblance to Redford made the "Butch Cassidy" scenes work well.The DVD was a lot of fun because the bonus materials made us laugh all over again after the movie. I was surprised that some really great scenes had been deleted from the movie, but happy that they showed up in the DVD bonus material. I adored the three Chinese toddlers. I don't know why the editors cut that tiny, one-minute scene. The children are precious. They don't actually DO anything, they just look adorable. Other deleted scenes would have been fun to see in the movie. We even found ourselves amused by the silly quiz game included in the DVD.In addition to the great physical action and silliness, the movie was beautiful to watch. The visuals were fantastic, from the breathtaking scenery (both East and West) to the beautiful, colorful costumes. As always with a Jackie Chan movie, the intricate choreography was great fun to watch. Often in his movies he seems to wipe out all the bad guys, but in this film the fact that he doesn't always win allows him to explore his comedic talents more. We got a bang out of the tomahawk scene, which offered a surprise to the audience, along with a great laugh. Even the bathtub scene, goofy though it was, filled us with belly laughs. Even little details, such as the few bars of an Aerosmith song at the appropriate moment, added entertainment value for us.I could go on and on, because we enjoyed this flick so much. We intend to watch it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy action movies more than any other type as my reviews will testify and love martial arts flicks in particular.Try as I might,however,I just cannot get excited over Jackie Chan and find it difficult to understand exactly what it is that recently has endeared him to international audiences.The problem for me is that I cannot equate ferocious no holds barred fighting with the sort of lowbrow comedy which has always been Chan's major calling card.His poor English and over the top facial mugging detracts from his undoubted martial skills and this proves to be the case with his sixth US movie SHANGHAI NOON. There is some good stuff in this pleasing Western comedy though and it really comes to life in the final reel when Chan eschews the humorous stuff and engages in some fierce combat with spears and three sectioned staffs and the like and gives a glimpse of how good he would be if he were like this all the time.Something I did have a problem with in this movie was the performance of Owen Wilson which was irritating in the extreme as for some reason he decided to adopt a third rate vocal impression of Bruce Dern throughout.No more please!Lucy Liu was effective as the kidnapped princess but I think that the truly beautiful Kelly Hu from TV's MARTIAL LAW would have been better as she would also have been for the big screen CHARLIE'S ANGELS. Overall,SHANGHAI NOON is good fu but not great fu.</fullReview>

This movie managed to entertain me, probably because I fit in the Native American demographic, but I gotta say Jackie's (Man-Who-Fights-In-A-Dress) role in this film was likable, since I can usually tell what a male-chauvinist he is in other films (Owen Wilson's comment to Brandon Merrill in this movie might've been poking fun at that). It seems everybody covered the good ground there is to cover..... I will bring in SPOILERS and what other rants I have. First of all, if there's any comments on Brandon Merrill's Indin' blood quantum, I'd like to see yours first!!! Brandon Merrill is full blooded Cheyenne from what I understand and looks every bit it! Also, in 1881, there were no Indin's except for my people, the Apaches, and they were in Arizona. Even then, most Indin's were wasting away on their brand-new reservations. I don't remember what the roads leading to Carson City looked like, but I do agree from what I remember they don't look like Western Canada! Besides, Jackie Chan is 46, who cares if he's slowing down, he gets a couple of major injuries a movie (save for this one, they really did tie him down on the death-defying part), is still moving relatively swiftly and has remarkable Zen abilities, I'd like to see any of you pull that off at 46! Not to mention it's obvious what conflicts in screen play there were in this flick, but you can't help the feeling the actual grunt work had to be fun. Still, Jackie should've killed the dude who offed his uncle in this movie, Owen Wilson should've been better written in here and Brandon Merrill should've been the only Indin' in this picture! But Jackie pokes fun at Westerns in his own special way! A 7 for fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We enjoyed the film. Have to agree with the user that commented about the Indians. What was up with the casting of the Native Americans? Jackie Chan looked more Indian than his tribal gift wife did. I liked her though. She just looked as though she had Irish or some other European ancestorial background as did others. (more likely Canadian)Jackie's stunts were not his best, but certainly very entertaining. Wilson was great too. Overall a good choice for a fun evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am stunned at some of the negative reviews I've read on here. I'm not a Jackie Chan fan and have seen a couple of his movies and thought they were alright, but this one I watched twice and busted out laughing both times. I think this is a very funny, clever movie and Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson were hilarious. The script was well written, the story line was great, the action was great, the acting and humor was fantastic. I say I'm not a Jackie Chan fan but if he continues to make movies such as this I will be one. Great movie!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie had some taste to it, it was extremely hilarious. I like Jackie Chan's demeanor when he is filming his movies, the out-takes at the end are always a trip to watch. Chan's character comes to America seeking a Chinese Imperial Princess who ran away, at least thats what she thought she was doing. He comes across an outlaw in a train robbery who plagues him while he's searching for the princess. Chan experiences a cacophony of American life when he witnesses an old fashioned gun standoff, gets married to an indian squaw and becomes friends with "Wyatt Earp."Good movie, a 7 in my list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better story-line, fewer fights - still a marvelous Jackie Chan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch this movie for the same reasons you watched Jackie Chan movies before, you might be disappointed - or not.Given, there are Jackie Chan movies with a larger and longer firework of fighting scenes. But on the other hand, there are few Jackie Chan movies where the plot in itself carries the movie better than this does.Shanghai Noon relies not only on the fighting scenes, which are scarcer than before, but on the story-line itself: and what a story-line it is: Jackie Chan fighting his way through the American Wild-West to free his princess, dealing on the way with a partner-turned-villain, struggling with a renitent horse and always being saved by his omnipresent sharp-shooting Indian wife.The movie is therefore really enjoying without relying too much on the fighting scenes, which -as always- introduce a lot of novelties into martial arts (especially the Indian and saloon scenes). Add to this the usual Jackie Chan tongue-in-cheek humor -this time fueled by East-West contrasts- and a feast for the eyes called Lucy Liu and you're up to a really enjoying movie.By the way: from the few fighting actions Lucy Liu delivers, a lot can be expected of her for "Charlie's Angels"....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge improvement over Rush Hour, but still nowhere near his Asian films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Rush Hour was a huge success for Jackie Chan, it still was a huge disappointment for someone like myself who has seen almost all of his Asian films.Shanghai Noon, is a big improvement, mainly since Jackie (and his relative Willie Chan) were executive producers on the film so it feels more like a Jackie Chan film should. But as a whole, the film still pales in comparison to some of his Asian vehicles like "Project A", "Who Am I?" and "Drunken Master 2".As far as plot is concerned, this film is similar to Rush Hour except that it's set in the Wild West. The fight scenes are fantastic, but still are lacking that extra spark that makes his Asian films so special.Perhaps if a studio was willing to let Jackie direct his next picture (as well as producing it), we might be treated to a spectacle rivaling some of his most well known films.But this film still stands heads and shoulders above similar American action films and should still be checked out by fans and non-fans alikerating:7.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The usual ingredients for a Jackie Chan film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shanghai Noon", as noted in my summary, has the usual blend of free-whirling acrobatics and physical humor one would expect from a Jackie Chan movie. Yet, do not begin watching this movie expecting to witness the sheer vitality of Chan's previous American blockbuster, "Rush Hour". For one, Chan's team-up partner this time around is the laid-back Owen Wilson, one whose straight-forward, observational sense of humor seems to give Chan less to react to than Chris Tucker's relentlessly manic improvisations. While occasionally funny in a "chuckle-under-your-breath" sort of way, Wilson has some moments where he is grating and irritating on the viewer. This is most problematic when the film cuts away to Wilson's character in the middle of one of Chan's fight sequences (which, despite Chan's middle-age, are still consistently dazzling). It ruins the flow and excitement of the sequences. Rest assured, there are still enough of these action set-pieces to satisfy the viewer. For me, Chan's combat with the Native Americans is most memorable. Sadly, the plot of this film will more than likely not be remembered as fondly. Essentially, it just serves as another scenario for Chan to hook up with a co-star, beat the bad guys, and rescue the kidnapped princess. It even has the obligatory, explain-it-all-to-the-audience scene where Chan does exactly that, tell Wilson his objective in this movie so the viewer knows the film will stray from no tried and true conventions. But if you just want to see more of Chan's brand of eastern action and tireless comedic abilities, this movie is just that. However, be aware that this film is more deliberately paced than the usual Chan film. The "moments" that are contained within every Chan film are fewer and farer between. Final Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shanghai Noon makes Rush Hour look like fine art. Imagine watching Jackie and his buddies standing around in a brightly lit saloon set:"Okay we need to have another fight now.""What are we fighting about?""Who cares. You just stand here until I get done with these other guys."This film has no dramatic tension. At all. None. Even Jackie's relationship with his "wife" only serves to provide the solutions to a couple of lame plot dilemmas. Worse, the stunts are not up to par.The only redeeming point was the landscape cinematography. Except that Nevada does NOT look like western Canada!I yearn for the subtle nuance of previous Jackie Chan films.</fullReview>

And, a typical Jackie Chan movie with his unique comedy and his amazing stunts.The good part is that the movie is set in 1850s in America and it's half free from the Hong-Kong gangsters unlike every other movie of the genre.But all in all, it's just another Hollywood martial-arts movie with a stereotypical Asian martial-art hero. A gentle, no-surprises martial arts comedy that you'll come out of the theatre smiling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Owen Wilson was in this one too...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't simply 'another' Jackie Chan movie. Okay, yes, he is an amazing martial artist. But he didn't write the movie, and he didn't direct the movie. With his Buster Keaton-esque humor, he amuses and delights in this, probably his 40th feature. He was terrific back in the days of Cannonball Run, and he hasn't lost an ounce of it. But in this movie, director Tom Dey isn't at fault when you complain "we want FIGHT SCENES." First off, there are PLENTY. And to be brutally honest, Tom Dey pulled amazing comic timing out of the most unlikely pair, Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Which brings me to my point. Owen Wilson, improvisor and humorist extraordinaire makes this film terrific. He's utterly hilarious, playing the lost, subtly witty, modern cowboy. Inexplicably, as the film is set in the Wild West. Making what could have been a stock, Rush Hour-ish movie all the more humorous, over the top, and extemporaneous. Better than anything Jackie has been in yet, and only because it acknowledges his skill and goes for all the laughs, by giving him first class accompaniment. Bringing me to my next point. Randy Edelman provides a top notch score, almost too well orchestrated for this movie. Edelman adds an aesthetically pleasing, tongue in cheek hilarious element to the screen. Let us all lament overlooking Misters Wilson and Edelman, and give Mr. Dey a round of applause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lays entertaining waste to western movie clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pow! Whack! Thud! That's the sound of Jackie Chan laying waste to Hollywood stereotypes.Thanks to a series of martial arts movies remembered as much for their laughs as for their stunning stunts, Chan put to rest that character cliché known as the inscrutable Oriental.Now he's taken on the Saturday afternoon western with a flick that adds several new dimensions to the old cowboys versus the Indians mainstay.Set in the year 1881, Shanghai Noon is about Chon Wang (pronounced John Wayne), a member of the Chinese Emperor's Imperial Guard who is sent on a mission to rescue the beautiful Princess Pei Pei, played by Lucy Liu, after she is kidnapped and taken away to Carson City, Nevada.Through a series of misadventures, Chon meets up with outlaw Roy O'Bannon, played with surfer-dude tenor by Owen Wilson, through whom he learns `the ways of the cowboy.' There's no branding of forearms here, just a lot of drinking, carousing, jail-breaking, poor marksmanship, and avoidance of bounty hunters.Of course, everyone goes to a Jackie Chan movie for the action, and Shanghai Noon is replete with high kicks and karate chops. Train robbers, Native warriors, posses, and slave-driving mine owners all end up worse for wear after taking on Chan's fists of fury. Sad to say, however, he seems to be getting a little old for the really wild stuff and is no longer the reigning champion of the action-adventure, not after Jet Li's emergence on the scene.But combined with Chan's trademark sense of cute cornball humour, it's enough to keep the movie rolling along. Especially funny are the scenes with his horse, which acts more like a faithful dog than an equestrian thunderbolt, and Chon's short visit to an Indian village.What's more, this movie is refreshingly well-shot, re-appreciating the geographical beauty that us North Americans seem to have forgotten amidst our busy lives and personal agendas.And while the bad guys get what's coming to them, not everything is black and white as our heroes learn along the way the values of thinking for one's self, helping others, and responsibility. Finally, Shanghai Noon goes some way to capturing the diversity that really did make up the Wild West, otherwise known as the Golden Mountain by the not insignificant number of Chinese who worked the mines and built the railroads in pursuit of their own dreams.There are flaws. The Indian wife that Chon gets inadvertently hitched to seems Indian in tan only, and the tying up of the loose ends tends to drag on. That said, Shanghai Noon remains a cut above the usual Hollywood fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basic plot outline: Set in the days of the Wild West, Chon Wang is an Imperial Warrior, bound by a regimist Chinese Empire. This devout servant goes on a mission to help save the Princess Pei Pei, who has been kidnapped and taken to the States. It becomes your typical 'unlikely partners bound together through circumstances beyond their control and become best of friends' film, when he ends up teaming with outlaw Roy O'Bannon. This motley duo fumble their way along, as time starts running out for the Princess.Review: Well this was disappointing. Jackie Chan rules. Even a commercial Jackie Chan, as in 'Rush Hour' rules. But Jackie Chan, totally 'Hollywoodised', doesn't rule. First time director Tom Dey really didn't do this film justice. It had all the elements of a typical Chan fliq, and was technically perfect. But it sorely missed that Chan Humour Factor. It had cheesy Hollywood humour, flittered with multiple reversals as a comedic technique, blatant, obvious, commercial. Its Chan... we want FIGHT SCENES!!! Lots and lots of cool fight scenes. What is all this nonsense about plot and dialogue... sheeesh! It was still enjoyable, but will be a disappointment to all Chan Fans.</fullReview>

Chon Wang as he is called is a Chinese imperial guard with his head in the clouds. When the princess he is in love with is spirited away to the States he is the last person they want to send after her but his tenacity and ability to adapt (all this means is that he can generally beat his way through any obstacle) give him the edge in rising to the occasion. Both helped and hindered by Owen, a rather hapless cowboy, who he encounters on the way. They team up to make as effective a partnership as ever hit the screen. This is one movie, though, where a great woman stands behind the two men, here in the guise of Wang's wife despite his reluctance at being the groom...</fullReview>

I loved the scene where him and Owen Wilson's character gets all liquored up especially, that was a good laugh... However, one thing that puts this movie down is Owen Wilson's acting. He is, IMHO, simply a bad actor. His voice stays the same all the time, so you never know if he's being serious or sarcastic for example, and I just get the feeling someone's holding out the script in front of him every time he does a scene in the movie, he seems so distant in almost every scene. So in the end, the movie as a whole gets a 6/10, Chan a 8/10, and Wilson a 4/10.</fullReview>

This was done as a western. quite frankly I ma sick of jackie chan jason scott Lee or Chow Yun Fat could ahve done a better job. This film was and wasn't the ultimate commentary on the stupidity of the hollywood elite following the 1997 fall of Hong Kong. it was bomabastic, it was daffy, I would have prefered a plot...however, I found the sequence involving the three hookers turning into buzzards interesting.

		<fullReview>This is really a good Jackie Chan flick. The action is good and plenty, the stunts are unbelievable and hard to follow and there are many, many big laughs. OK this one is not only good stuff (which film is nowadays) and there are a few scenes I'd rather had not seen or would have, but only if altered, but these are not frequent enough to spoil the film. If these scenes had been good it would have got this film a 9 or 10 easily. The supporting cast is good too, especially Owen Wilson, who I had already seen before in The Haunting, but in that film I only thought he had a weird nose and nothing more. In this one he is different though and not only pretty good at what he does, but funny too. The bad guy, or better guys are doing their job, nothing more, some better than others and quite frankly, some more irritatingly than others. The female supporting cast is good as well, there are two females here, Lucy Liu and Brandon Merrill , the latter one unknown, who both act good and who just happen to be pretty as well, so no criticism about the cast here. All in all this film has a good supporting cast plus everything that has made Chan what he is today. That means there are bloopers at the ending you do not want to miss. The bathtub blooper really is darn hilarious.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film, it is Jackie back to his comic best. And it shows that at last Hollywood is moving towards the films that Jackie fans in the East (that includes Europe) have been used to for over a decade.This is indeed the best film I've seen during the lacklustre summer. Where X-Men tries to be funny, Shanghai Noon actually is funny. Where Gone In Sixty Seconds tries to be original, Noon is original. Where Mission Impossible 2 tries desperatly to be cool, Shanghai Noon is cool.The locations, the fantastic cinematic atmosphere is brilliantly orchestrated. But it is a shame, espically in a Jackie Chan film that we didn't see the action that we know that Jackie can do. Perhaps it was the hollywood insurance men wagging their finger at every stunt that Jackie wanted to do.So, okay the action is watered down...this is a comedy film first, and an action film second. The on-screen chemistry between Chan and Wilson is brilliant and thankfully for Hollywood, they've given a worthwhile plot and script.The direction is fluid and fast. The kung fu sequences are brilliant, although I was disappointed that at the end there was no big kung fu sequence between the Imperial Guards and Lo Wang (the bald bad guy).Also throughout the film runs the idea of "slavery", where in the east you are basically a slave to the royal family (or state), whereas in the west you are a slave if you are not white.Anyway, this is a funny film and I hope this marks a return the Jackie Chan films of old.</fullReview>

I actually thought this was a more enjoyable movie than "Rush Hour", but Jackie Chan in Hollywood still isn`t the same as in the good old days. "Shanghai Noon" was the first of Jackie Chan`s films I saw at the cinema, and as all Jackie Chan-fans know, the stunts that went wrong can be seen when the film is over, and this is always a lot of fun. This is a must-see for Jackie Chan-fans. People looking for a serious romantic drama or something like that should avoid it, because you wouldn`t like it. 8/10</fullReview>

Hollywood has improved the look and feel but the raw and dangerous stunts have been calmed down somewhat.People watch Jackie Chan for that unique blend of comedy and action. Both are still there so all is well. At several points the whole audience was laughing out load so it wasn't just me, and the Indian fight has his touch of using the environment around him as a weapon as well as a wonderful moment with the axes.Both fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this film.</fullReview>

Invented a type of movie that appeals to all those die-hard martial arts fans who see all his not-so-commercial flicks purely for their stunts and fight scene content, yet still proves entertaining for others who are not so enthusiastic about seeing him knock a bad guy out with a shoelace or something just as obscure. They did it with Rush Hour, and have done it again with Shanghai Noon. Teaming the martial arts master with a somewhat lesser-known comic actor then working the 'unlikely duo' angle in the script. Owen Wilson made the movie for me, as did Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. The only thing about the movie that I found strange was how disconcerting it was watching Lucy Lui in such a submissive role after watching her character almost eat people alive in Ally McBeal!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, as Chan's films usually are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't the best film made by Jackie Chan. Obviously, time passes by and Jackie isn't so agile as he was some years ago, but he always manages to make something entertaining for us. This film is funny and interesting; it won't let you yawn a single time. It has many references to several known movies, including the famous final exit from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid... My rating is 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an average movie for Chan. The 'east meets west' formula has outlived its lifespan and this movie pushes this concept to breaking point. I just can't see Chan as an Imperial Guard in America in the late 19th century. The action scenes are lacking as Chan steadly ages. There are also plot holes such as when we find out that the American Indian can speak Englsih after all. Chan's character also seems to forget how a villian kills his closet living family member, his uncle. There are a few laughs but this movie could have been improved if there were less time-wasters and more action sequences. There is an obvious difference between the movies he once made and the ones he makes now. That is the lack of action and an increase in character building, dialogue, morals, and periods of boredom. I will therefore give Shanghai Noon a six out of ten. If your a fan of Chan you will be dissapointed but may still enjoy this movie. If your not a fan you may enjoy it anyway, but then again you might not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chan And Wilson Take The West By Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(**contains possible spoilers**)East meets West for laughs and plenty of action in director Tom Dey's `Shanghai Noon,' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. In 1881 China, Royal Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is smuggled out of the Forbidden City and taken to Carson City, Nevada, where she is held for a one hundred thousand dollar ransom in gold. The Emperor promptly dispatches his top three Imperial Guards, an interpreter (Henry O), and the interpreter's nephew, Chon Wang (Chan), to deliver the gold and bring the Princess safely back to China. During a botched train robbery in Nevada, the interpreter is killed, and Chon Wang sets out to find the man responsible; but first he must discharge his duty to the Emperor, by finding Carson City and the Princess. Along the way he meets up with a left-handed gunslinger named Roy O'Bannon (Wilson), who was the leader of the gang that tried to rob the train. The cowboy who killed his uncle, a man named Wallace (Walt Goggins), Wang learns, was a new guy to the gang; Roy didn't know him, and nobody, of course, was to supposed to get hurt. Once that issue is resolved, it's shades of Butch and Sundance as Wang and Roy team up to rescue the Princess (and the gold). Dey alternates the action and laughs, often combining the two, and keeps it all moving along at a good, even pace. The likable Chan puts plenty of spirit into Wang, and the fight scenes are spectacular; well choreographed and orchestrated. He also proves himself adept on the comedy front, at times infusing a bit of Stan Laurel in his expression. The charismatic Wilson also shines as Roy, with a subtle, straight-forward delivery that is right on the mark. There's a chemistry between the two that works splendidly, and their timing is perfect. And they play it with a contemporary attitude that fuels the off-beat ambience; at times, it's like a Newman and Redford in the Twilight Zone. Liu, as well, gives a notable performance, lending a Royal mien to her Princess Pei Pei. There's a number of memorable scenes here, including one in which Wang encounters the Sioux (and we can only guess what's really in that peace-pipe); and another, early in the film, that finds Roy buried up to his neck and left to die in the desert, only to be found by Wang, who puts two chopsticks in Roy's mouth and tells him to start digging. The comedy plays well throughout the film, managing real laughs without resorting to slapstick or sight gags. Also worthy of mention is that the opening scene was filmed in China, in the Forbidden City. The excellent supporting cast includes Jason Connery (Andrews), Brandon Merrill (Indian wife), Roger Yuan (Lo Fong), Xander Berkeley (Van Cleef) and Russell Badger (Sioux Chief). `Shanghai Noon' is, above all, a fun movie; a light-hearted and often hilarious spin on the old west, forever changed (historically and cinematically), now that Wang and O'Bannon have happened onto the scene. This is one pair of cowboys you're going to remember, and this is one funny movie you're going to want to see more than once. And that's a promise, Pardner. I rate this one 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan returns once again in the second of his "team up with an American" filmssince Rush Hour. This time he heads to the wild west to rescue his master's daughter from terrorist hands. Like all Jackie Chan films, Shanghai Noon contains a lot of humor, lightning fast kung-fu action and a cool attitude. I liked the fighting scenes which were extremely quick and well timed. Chan's cowboy side-kick provides half the laughs with his funny attitude and gun slinging action. The acting was good and so was the plot. The same can be said for the humor. The only complaint that I have is that the word s*** was used TOO extensively. Even the native americans used that word. All in all, Shanghai Noon should be able to bring back the laughs that Rush Hour provided, with the action packed fight scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun feel but it let me down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this I had high expectations. I'm a big Jackie Chan fan. Anything he's in I have to see. It had a good concept and I liked the trailer. I also heard that it was even better than MI:2. Nope, sorry. I don't think so. It had all the elements of a good fight film but it just didn't grab me like Rush Hour did. Jackie Chan stars Chon Wang (say it real fast), a Chinese guard in training that hitches a ride with his uncle and three guards to America to find a kidnapped Princess (the lovely Lucy Liu). But when things go wrong Jackie has to team up with the nicest train robber ever Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). What follows is the obligatory buddy action film but in the wild wild west. The film has some very corny moments that make you feel out of place. The bad guys also are very thin, paper like. There are no new breaking ground elements to the movie either. Jackie is great and fun to watch. Lucy Liu is great to look at and she can hold her own with the boys. The bad part about this film other than the villains is Owen Wilson. I have nothing against him he just didn't fit here. He way too nice and not funny at all. He's not a person you care about too much in this film. His brother Luke would have been better. (I think he's the better actor.) The fights scenes are what keep this film from being dull and boring. Jackie does some amazing things with the stuff around him. He is the master when it comes to fighting with his surroundings. If your a Jackie Chan fan go see Shanghai Noon. For everyone else, it's fun, at times exciting, has Lucy Lui and the fights are great. But there are better action comedies out there. This one tries too hard and doesn't live up to expectation.</fullReview>

The film follows the standard "rescue" plot, and is almost a Western "Rush Hour".The cultural differences between East and West play a more defining role here, and helps take this movie a bit higher. Jackie Chan uses his abilities to get laughs well in this movie, and the plot and sub plots keep you going.I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He may be getting older but hes still great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After browsing through the other reviews I've noticed that a few points are coming up. 1) Owen Wilson was really good 2) Jackie Chan is slowing down as he gets older and 3) He continues to play the "fish out water" routine. Now while the first point may be true, the other two are a little bit presumptuous. Jackie may be getting older but his stunts haven't slowed down that much, take a look at "Who Am I" for example (released a year before), and after all there are only so many ways you can try to kill yourself. Also, his major American movies released have not been directed nor written by Chan, explaining the lack of major stunts, overuse of close-up camera work and repetitious plot. The third point is that Jackie has only played the "fish out of water" character about 3 times, watch his other movies if you don't believe me (Especially Drunken Master 2). What I'm trying to say is, don't let all these negative comments give you the feeling that this movie isn't BIG enough or different enough from other Chan films to watch as it depends what you're looking for. If you want a fun, action orientated comedy then watch this and you won't be disappointed. If you expect more then you probably will be. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow...never judge a movie by its trailer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all accounts, this movie should have been bad. I mean, it's a Western...a COMEDIC Western, featuring a Chinese martial arts expert who arrives in the West to beat up a bunch of stupid hicks while getting advice from your atypical blonde cowboy on how to survive from the West. At least, that's what one would gather from the trailer.However, the actual movie itself has a solid plot with plenty of interesting characters thrown in. The humor is simplistic, yet at the same time doesn't go into the realm of stupid or idiotic (re: the now-defunct TV series "Working"). The martial arts sequences are beautifully choreographed, which is to be expected of any Chan film. The cowboy Roy O'Bannon, played by Owen Wilson, is surprisingly effective as comic relief: a wannabe cowboy who is ignorant of the life itself and acts as an expert while dispensing advice on the "cowboy life" most likely inferred from the reading of dime ovels.I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this film. Not exactly Oscar material, but if you're really bored and with a group of friends, I heavily recommend this film. You won't be disappointed. Out of ten stars, I gave this film a "pleasantly surprised" 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Main Thing by nicardo@bigfoot.com Review of Shanghai NoonI liked this movie. It is entertaining. It will make you laugh. It does not matter that it is a remake, of sorts, of `Rush Hour,' another Jackie Chan movie from two years ago. Instead of the annoying Chris Tucker, Jackie is paired with Owen Wilson, and the story is set in `The Olde West.' You got cowboys and Indians, robbers and sheriffs, physical comedy, and predictable plot lines, misadventures, and lots of humor and craziness. Everything you could want. Compared to MI2, this is a work of art. I would have to list it with Blazing Saddles, Little Big Man, and Cat Ballou as far as having fun watching a western. You might feel that way too, when you see a saloon brawl fought to the music of ZZ Top.Let's see... Next time Jackie will play an Imperial Guard who travels to Rome in 87 A.D. on an impossible mission to rescue a kidnapped princess, and becomes a gladiator, fighting his way out of the coliseum, and through the matrix of time, back to the present to make many more enjoyable movies, which is, the main thing.Comments and e-mail welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan in yet another strangely enjoyable buddy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Rush Hour thinking, well, this is probably going to suck, but there'll be great fight scenes. I came out liking the movie a lot. Same thing with Shanghai Noon! Is there a costar who DOESN'T have good chemistry with Jackie Chan?This movie could have been a lot worse. It could have been worse than Wild Wild West (for example). But instead it's consistently enjoyable. I don't really know what to compare it to, because I don't think there's been a "western" like it that's been successful. Shanghai Noon is a tongue-in-cheek Western with great fighting (love that horseshoe!), offbeat ethnic humor, and a lot of unexpected plain old silliness. Silliness that could have fallen flat but which generally works.The movie could have been edited tighter--the fight scenes could have been longer (in Chan's Hong Kong movies, they are, but I suppose American audiences prefer them shorter?) but some of the dialogue is wordy. I'd take 10 minutes of gab and replace it with 5 minutes of kicks and backflips. But that's just me.The movie is very well cast. Chan is, of course, great. But so is Owen Wilson! (I think this movie, regardless of its current box office status, will be a boost to Wilson's career.) This is my favorite Chan movie since Supercop. A pleasant surprise and definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Hollywood Jackie Chan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Jackie Chan hit Hollywood in recent years, I waited long for an excellent Hollywood film from him. Let's face it, Rush Hour in 1998 was not Jackie-enough and had a weak story. When I first heard of Shanghai Noon and his team-up with Owen Wilson, I thought it would be another RH. But thank goodness, Shanghai Noon turned out to be excellent!Shanghai Noon's like a dream come true for Jackie Chan...roaming the Old West and use his martial arts/stunts with cowboys and Indians. Chan said himself that he wanted to be a cowboy, and he did here! It was very unique and cool to see Jackie ride a horse, wear cowboy outfits, and best of all interact with the era. Chan really really fitted well with the setting, and this is the only film where you actually see Jackie in the Old West! His acting here is also the best I've seen in years, and this really got me.Owen Wilson is a better Western partner for Jackie than Chris Tucker (who's annoying). Wilson's got the act and the comical moments that made me laugh, at the same time he's not too extreme with his act thanks to his coolness. Lucy Liu's good as the Princess from motherland China and I can't think of any other Asian actress to play her role.Shanghai Noon's story is totally balanced with a great mix of action, comedy and catchy dialogue...and the flow went very smoothly. Seeing Jackie use the rope and horse shoe is an original thing to see! The comedy's plenty and very entertaining, and the dialogue...keep your ears open for fun.It's just too bad that Shanghai Noon came out the same week as Mission: Impossible 2. This one's got a lot of goodies, but M:I2 overshadows it with its own. Shanghai Noon's got the potential to gross at least $100 million if it was not for M:I2.Overall, the best Jackie Chan Hollywood production. Worth seeing 5 times in the theaters, and worth getting on home video! Watch it! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember the name Owen Wilson...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one way I would voluntarily go to a theater to watch a Jackie Chan film, and that is if my favorite actor Owen Wilson stars in it. So when I found out he was in `Shanghai Noon,' I was there. The film is funny and successful because of Wilson, who sadly isn't known by most movie goers. Wilson is multi-talented and here pitches in to breathe fun and life into a wacky style of film that Chan will never escape. Chan is enjoyable here but left on his own, he only knows two things--how to play the fish out of water, and how to do inventive fighting. That gets tiresome after a while, while the smart tone and charm of Wilson never does.The action in `Shanghai Noon' is self-aware with subtle inventiveness, in other words the complete opposite of the awful Mission Impossible 2. Chan and Wilson are good together because they both know their strengths and know not to try and upstage the other. Without Wilson this movie wouldn't work though. If audiences wise up one day you'll be going to an Owen Wilson picture, not a Jackie Chan one. Three and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know what? I'm going to save you the suspense of reading through to the end of this review to find out my impression of this movie. I LOVED IT! There, now you know so be prepared for a glowing review.The plot of this movie is essentially about a royal guardsman from China that comes to the west to rescue a princess that was kidnapped and held for ransom. The only problem is that Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and yes, it sounds amazingly like `John Wayne' is in a country where he isn't familiar with western customs. In order for him to fulfill his mission, he must enlist (whether he wants to or not) the help of a fast-talking cowboy, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). And this is when the story gets really interesting.I've seen many Jackie Chan movies (if not all of them) and while many of his older movies contained many incredible stunts, Shanghai Noon is an all around better package. The stunts were still equally impressive but what made this movie stand out was its writing and chemistry between Chan and Wilson. The chemistry was incredible! These two actors work really well together and Chan adeptly shows his comedic acting skills. This was by far his best acting work and it looks like he and Wilson genuinely enjoyed working with each other. Speaking of Wilson, he definitely was a crucial part to the humor of this movie. His ability to play a goofy yet fast-talking cowboy stole many scenes and made watching this movie a riot. Compared to his last movie, `Rush Hour', there is no comparison. This is a more enjoyable movie to watch.I have to say though you can see Jackie Chan's age creeping in. He has definitely slowed down but for anyone who has never seen any of his older work, you won't miss a thing. To add to this movie, the scenery and sets were great. Much of this movie was shot here in Canada and it seems that they made a genuine effort to be somewhat authentic. Overall, you should see this movie. It's entertaining, funny, and all around fun. You won't leave disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite "Rush Hour" but a really close second.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Jackie Chan's "fish out of water" routine is almost played out, the new twist he puts on it in "Shanghai Noon" is a bit implausable, but nonetheless enjoyable. Chan plays Chon Wang, a member of the Chinese Royal Guard. When the princess (lightly played by Lucy Liu) is kidnapped and held by a Chinese exile for ransom, the of the Emperor sends three of his most brave and trusted guards to America to find her. Of course, Jackie ends up coming along too. Through a series of misadventures and chance run ins he ends up befriending Roy O'Bannon (greatly played by Owen Wilson) and together they go on a search for the princess. Jackie Chan is truly a marvel to watch. The fact he does his own stunts only enhances the thrill and enjoyment of the movie. His sense of comic timing has also improved greatly, and this movie is actually better timed by him than in "Rush Hour". Owen Wilson is the star of this movie. His Roy sounds like he just completed a sensitivity training course and the dry wit is priceless. Most of his work has been in the writing field, but some indie work and "Armageddon" have shown he is a talented actor as well. Maybe he can give brother Luke ("Home Fries" ) some lessons.Lucy Liu is Princess Pei-Pei, and while she has a couple good moments towards the end, she mostly is forgettable and weak. She comes out of her shell towards the end and saves her role in that final reel. "Shanghai Noon" is maybe Jackie Chan's most inventive movie, and packs quite a good laugh. If he can find a new plotline (as I said before, the stranger in a strange land bit is getting old) and capture all the elements he's learned so far, his next movie should be exceptional.3 1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

If you want to have a good time, this is it. The rating would be low by movie critics and high by movie-goers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chan goes Wild West to save kidnapped Chinese Princess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This awful kungfu-movie is no better than the crappy HongKong-kungfu-crap they made 30 years ago. Easy jokes, ridiculous story and a setting (19th century Wild West) that just doesn't become Jackie Chan. This ultimate collection of cliches (yawn) is interrupted by several action scenes which are, as usual, the highlights of the film. However, most action scenes are hardly original and Chan only succeeds in impressing the viewer in one or two scenes. The real higlight of the film is ZZ Top's La Grange. Forget this movie, or use the FF-button to watch the actions scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome movie! Jackie Chan is (as usual) excellent in his role and Owen Wilson did pretty good too. Not better than Rush Hour, but equal. Also, even though it's probably not a great movie like most of Jackie's, I will say this: This movie puts the new Wild Wild West movie to shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Owen Wilson is the reason to see this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of the initial comments reflect a healthy appreciation for Mr. Chan's movies. I have a seen a few and I agree that "Druken Master" and "Supercop" are some of his best but I don't think he can make those films anymore. He has to move in a new direction as a result of a higher profile and age.This movie is filled with both high and Low humor. My advice is to ignore most humor that doesn't come from Owen. He has a few poor lines but for the most part, it seems that the director gave him a lot of freedom to write his own material. If you have seen Bottle Rocket or Rushmore, you know Owen is smart and funny. He made this movie a pleasure to watch.Owen Wilson, as many thought, was annoying. I can't call these people wrong for their opinions, but I feel they are. I didn't go to this movie to see Mr. Chan, I went to see Owen. I was quite pleased to see him play such a prominant role. It's as if the director saw his "dignan" from Bottle Rocket and asked him to replicate the character. During the scene where Owen teaches Mr. Chan to become more like a cowboy, there was an aphorism spoken so sweetly by Owen I began crying with hysterics. (I cry when I laugh heartily) It had to do with Roy O'Bannon being a horse and coming in to nibble on some oats and then running away to freedom. My word, it was worth the price of the ticket.The movie reviewer for the New York Times,(I forgot his name) mentioned that Owen Wilson revisits his character of Dignan in this movie. I had no intention of seeing it until I heard that. It was well worth it.I give the movie a "b+", Owen saves a banal comedy.</fullReview>

Just so you people know, Owen Wilson was Roy. The combination of Chan's slapstick humor and amazing stunts and action scenes and Wilson's timing and verbal humor make an amazing, astounding and hilarious movie. Not to mention a fight scene with La Grange playing in the background. Definite A+.Owen Wilson was almost as good as in Bottle Rocket. And that's a reallly high standard.</fullReview>

I was wrong, when you want to watch an action movie, you're looking for Shanghai Noon! This movie has lots of actions, ya know Jackie Chan! Also this movie use history's fact and their fiction stories, all blended in perfect. This is not a perfect movie, but fun to watch. I gave this 8/10. Because I laughed and enjoyed the movie.

		<shortDescription>Only 10 Feet Away From Being the Best Jackie Chan Movie in a Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is slowly getting his way in Hollywood--sloooowly.Back in the 80s Hollywood producers cast the charismatic actor in worthless crap like "The Big Brawl" and "The Protector", where none of his natural charm and only some of his acrobatic/martial arts skills were exploited.In the 80s and 90s, Jackie completely conquered the Asian market with his often self-directed films. After some American success on the video shelves in the late 80s, and with redubbed versions of a couple of them making dough in the 90s, Jackie sprang back in 1998 with a big American-made hit, "Rush Hour".Obviously, Chan was happy to have finally cracked the US market in a big way, but he was reportedly unhappy with the limitations put on his trademark style, and with the limitations of his director to choreograph the martial arts stunt scenes.So, for his next big US action/comedy buddy film, "Shanghai Noon", Chan took advantage of his new Hollywood cache and insisted on choreographing the fight scenes, using his own crew. He was even listed as Executive Producer.But the power play only solved part of the problem. Because, even though Jackie and company did indeed perform the amazingly acrobatic stunts and highly inventive fight scenes he is known for--the director shot them so poorly they can hardly be seen!"Shanghai" is Director Tom Dey's feature debut (will they ever give Chan an experienced director?) and he seems to be doing everything he can to make Chan's action sequences indecipherable. He frames them so closely that the star's hands and feet--integral parts of the ballet--are off the screen! AND he edits the action with multiple cuts, completely destroying any sense that Chan is actually performing his stunts. This is especially amazing because Chan had built his career on doing his own stunts.That's the kind of thing you have to do with non-action stars (and no-talent action men like Stephen Segal and Chuck Norris)to make them look good. But Jackie is really doing this stuff! There's no need to fake it! It's ridiculous.Contemporary American directors who have tried to make movies about dancing usually make the same mistake. Remember Stallone's lame ass "Staying Alive"? All you saw was short clips of twirling feet and twisting bodies, no dancing at all). That's because Travolta couldn't really dance and Sly had to fake it with editing and camera tricks.Remember how truly talented dancers like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire were shot in their films? In LONG SHOTS, so you could savor their every movement. They didn't need to be faked up with MTV style quick cuts.American directors need to think of Jackie Chan as a Fred Astaire. Set the goddamn camera back about 10 feet, step away and let him do his thing! Let us see what we paid for!All in all, "Shanghai Noon", is still very entertaining, despite the director muffing up the action scenes. Dey does a fine job with the other elements of the film; both Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan give fine comedic performances. If we could have seen Chan's fights, the film would have been a classic.The best solution probably would have been to let Chan not only choreograph, but also lens his own action scenes as well.If only Jackie Chan could bring the best of East and West together--the writing and dialogue of the West, with the action scenes of the East (jackie's Hong Kong flicks have always been severely strained in the credulity and dialogue departments).Perhaps he'll be allowed to co-direct his next American feature.In any case, "Shanghai Noon" will make good money--but it could have made massive, massive blockbuster bucks if the director had only move the camera back ten feet.</fullReview>

Anyways, this fish out of water flick is over kill. They try and chance the story line with a social message thinly put in. Problem is we also seen this in every 90's movie made, over and over and over. By the number bad guys, and disagrement by the lead actors, a predictable ending.

		<shortDescription>Nothing special about this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, being a big Jackie Chan fan, I would have to say that I don't see this as a smash hit with Hollywood. He always tries to mix comedy, extreme action (heavy stunts), and a bit of preaching in his recent movies. And that includes First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy. Being an action fan, I believe that it's rather difficult to pull everything together. One thing that needs to hold everything together is PLOT. The movies he direct usually lacks a rich plot. I guess one could say too action oriented. If you know what I am talking about here, you have about the general expectation of this movie.Owen Wilson wasn't a surprise in this movie. I seen him in Jet Li's Once Upon a Time in America, his unusual behavior as a cowboy can be funny, but sometimes, it's just too much.Like all his other movies, Shanghai Noon was aimed for a younger audience. This is a movie for kids and young teens, as well as elders and people who want to relax but find some fun within. This is definitely not a movie for raging teens, angry people looking for a release, nor gfx techies.I give this movie a 7.5/10 and mostly based on the fun factor</fullReview>

Owen Wilson was hilarious!!!! I normally don't like Jackie Chan movies, but I've already seen this three times.Jackie Chan plays Chon Wang, a Chinese Imperial Guard who comes to America to rescue Princess Pei Pei(played by Lucy Liu). Jackie's performance was great. And, as always, he was funny and a great martial artist.Owen Wilson was my favorite actor in this movie. He played Roy O'Bannon, a not so bright cowboy who teams up with Chon. This was Probably Owen's best performance and the funniest. He was charming and handsome in this dazzling comedy.Shanghai Noon was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, it gets better every time I see it(Especially the outtakes). Jackie and Owen make a great team and have such great chemistry. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh until it hurts.</fullReview>

If you spend money on this movie you will regret it. Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are two of the worst actors in cinema. The ONLY reason this movie is not just another "TV movie of the week" is beause of Jackie Chan and his martial arts (which I didn't see much of). This movie was far from funny. I also just found the worst line in cinema history. In the movie, Owen Wilson puts Jackie Chan on the floor for the first time, surprised, he says "I don't know Karate, but I know Carazy, and I'm not afraid to use it".

		<shortDescription>A fun mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Used to be all that was good about a Jackie Chan film was the martial arts scenes. Watch Jackie fly through a window! Watch Jackie fight the bad guy on the ledge of a tall building! The story of the movie was pretty much built around the carefully choreographed fight scenes. His latest, Shanghai Noon, has a good story-I think. The story is not so well told, but I was able to piece it all together after I left the theater.It's confusing from the very beginning: Opening in China, a princess (Lucy Liu) is meeting the very undesirable man chosen to be her husband. Among the imperial guards bowing to revere her is Chan's character, Chon Wong, who is smitten with her. He later overhears a conversation between she and her American english teacher about sneaking away to America, where she can find a husband of her own choosing. A scene later, the imperial guards are called together again because the princess has been kidnapped. What? Did I miss something? Chon Wong gets to tag along with the other imperial guards traveling with the ransom of jewels and gold to New Mexico. A scene or two later, the princess arrives at a Chinese workers' camp where, you guessed it, she's kidnapped. Then the train carrying Chon Wong and the other imperial guards is held up by a group of bandits led by Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Jackie Chan-style stunts and martial arts scenes ensue. The storytelling doesn't improve.I had fun at this movie, but only because of some funny physical comedy and a few well-staged action sequences. Its creators never figure out a way to bring the plot together in a way that keeps the story flowing. In a word, it's sloppy. The plot is so clunky that instead of taking you for a ride, it drags you behind the horse.To its credit, it never intends to be taken too seriously. The biggest laughs come from lines aimed at the now-extinct genre, the western (although, Wilson's line that, even if you didn't see the movie, you probably saw in the trailer, `John Wayne? That's a terrible cowboy name!' bombs. John Wayne was an actor's name, not a cowboy's). No convention of the old westerns is safe here: the quick-draw showdown, the train robbery scene, the bar fight scene, the cowboy/indian rivalry are all given pies in the face. The time to stop picking on this genre, I have to say, has come. Please stop.The film has a few new things to say about racism and prejudice, about learning to accept those who are different than us, and having the courage to stand up for change if the existing system is wrong. In other words, this film's target audience, teenagers, will enjoy this movie and might actually take a positive thing or two from it.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that mixes elements "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "Blazing Saddles" and Chan's own "Rush Hour" with various levels of success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan continues his leap into American movies by taking on the most American genre of all -- the Western -- in Shanghai Noon, a film that mixes elements of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "Blazing Saddles" and Chan's own "Rush Hour" with various levels of success.Owen Wilson easily steals the movie right out from under Chan. The quirky Wilson makes a better American partner for Chan than Rush Hour's Chris Tucker. Like Chan, Wilson's likability as a hero stems from his lack of cockiness -- both express a goofy amazement in their own achievements that's endearing.Chan's usual Buster Keaton-meets-Fred Astaire-meets-Bruce Lee fighting style is on display as always, albeit with fewer acrobatics than normal. Missing is Chan's one big stunt -- there's no hanging from a helicopter, no walking down the side of a sky-scraper -- even the closing credits montage of outtakes doesn't feature the usual quota of bone-shattering mishaps involving the actor/stuntman. One can't help but think that at 46, Chan may be slowing down a bit.With the action toned down, the humor is stepped-up to compensate. Besides the aforementioned Wilson, yuks are generated by a tribe of Native Americans straight out of a Mel Brooks comedy -- the same goes for Chan's drunken horse. Xander Berkeley is also thrown in as a psychotic Marshal with Snidely Whiplash facial hair, looking like something out of a silent movie (I spent much of the film waiting for him to tie a damsel to some railroad tracks). Berkeley, thankfully, manages to make the villain menacing and funny at the same time. The use of current day rock songs in the soundtrack also serve to pump-up the fun quotient.The movie also comes equipped with a sequel-ready ending that guarantees, box office returns willing, that the cast and crew of "Shanghai Noon" will ride again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chan produces a solid action-comedy, but one that doesn't really benefit from the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan returns with his second, big-money American production and this one is even better than the first (Rush Hour). Chan knows himself and his movies, and he sticks to his strengths in Shanghai Noon, and produces a solid action-comedy, but one that doesn't really benefit from the big screen.Chan is Imperial Guard Chong Wang (say it aloud fast) who is the baggage carrier for a delegation sent from the Forbidden City to the American West to rescue a kidnapped princess. Early in the film, Wang is separated from the rest of the delegation and ends up unwillingly partnered with bumbling outlaw Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). As the two continue on to rescue the princess, much of Chan's signature fight scenes and comedic bumblings are spoon-fed to the audience.Chan knows his strengths are inventive fight scenes mixed with doses of humor. In an early fight with Crow Indians, Chan throws hatchets at the warriors, only to see them plucked out of the air and returned at him. The wide-eyed surprise on Chan's face, coupled with his hasty retreat, is funny material. Later, in the camp of friendly Indians, Chan gets high on a peace pipe, while the Indian leaders insult him in their native tongue.That was one of the many things that leant realism to this film. Costuming, historical depictions of the old West, and language all give this film a sense of having really happened. Chan liberally sprinkles Chinese and Native American among the English, using subtitles as appropriate. Except for one scene at the end of the film, no one uses English who should not be using English.And no one uses English better than Wilson. His inept cowboy doesn't even realize how bad he is; rather, he spends his time congratulating himself on how smarter he is than the run-of-the mill outlaw. Like Chris Tucker in Rush Hour, Wilson is the comedian to Chan's straight man. He keeps up a running patter throughout the film, but unlike Tucker, his patter is streamed in a low, soft voice with minimal use of profanity.Director Tom Dey shows a deft touch as he mostly stays out of Chan's way. He gives the martial arts star plenty of room to move and showcase the amazing stuntwork that has propelled Chan from Hong Kong to Hollywood. Chan uses traditional Chinese weaponry, evergreens, moose antlers and horseshoes with equal dexterity. The wild West gives Chan plenty of opportunity to showcase his creativity, and he takes every advantage.The only real downside to this film is that nothing is sized for theatrical release. The FX are minimal--the stars are Chan's stuntwork and Wilson's mouth, not the action. The scenery is mostly muted, and the Western vistas few and far between. This film will look much the same on video as it did on the big screen. Which is, when you think about it, fortunate. This is a film that you'll want to see many times over because Jackie Chan is always fresh, active and funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went with my 13 year old son, expecting to get some shut eye. I almost split a gut laughing. Jackie Chan is not my favorite, but teamed up with Owen Wilson made for a very funny movie. Even though this is just another one of your "silly" comedies, I found myself laughing so hard, I thought the usher was going to ask me to leave. Beware, not everyone was as amused as I was. I went to see, "Big Mamma's House" the next week and it was just the opposite, everyone was laughing except for me. Am I weird?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this film hoping it would be more than the typical Jackie Chan movie. While Jackie Chan is always fun to watch, he is alongside two actors giving boring performances. Owen Wilson and Xander Berkeley are two names I will watch out for in the future. Nothing interesting came from these charactors. Most of Wilson's lines were just irritating. Having said that, I did enjoy the stunts, and action sequences, especially when Chon Wang finds out how good his Crow foes are with an axe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really fun. Owen Wilson was fantastic. He was the funniest side kick ever. His dialogue and delivery were perfect. Jackie Chan doesn't disappoint either. He's such an incredible athlete and his comic timing and delivery is getting better all the time. The fight scenes weren't as well directed as in his other movies. I, like others whose comments I've seen, prefer to watch kung fu action from more of a distance with less cutting but it was still exciting to watch.As for the rest of the movie, the plot line was nothing new, nice and simple. Lucy Lui was good and even had her own action shots. Mostly this movie was fun, lots of good laugh out loud laughs. The action was good and the story moved everything along well enough. I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Chan shines as the star in this fantasy Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much mindless entertainment -- but that is great if that is what you are in the mood for.Not enough plot to get in the way of the action -- and just enough of a story to facilitate the violence.This is a real ?fantasy Western' in the old style: the bad guys wear black, the good guys are saved by the love of a beautiful woman, the obligatory bar room brawl and the tried and true ?everything tied up on a neat package' ending.About 20 minutes could have been cut -- but it would have to be in the action scenes -- which is this movie's raison d'etre.Owen Wilson as Roy O'Bannon does a fairly good Robert Redford in `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' imitation.Lucy Liu is pretty much underutilized: little screen time and less dialogue. She is there only to create a story to hang the movie on and as set decoration.Jackie Chan is the real standout in the acting category. He does not give the one-note performance so many action stars are guilty of (Stallone, Van Damme, etc., etc.). He actually turns his part into a real character that is, as much as is possible, believable.There were some real glaring historical and factual errors: Edwardian furnishings long before the Edwardian period existed, Plains Indians in the desert in Nevada (?). There is just not enough attention to the small details.Many of the plot twists are telegraphed long before they occur -- NO subtle foreshadowing.This is not a thinking person's movie -- but most people do not go to the movies to think. They are there to be entertained -- and on that level this movie succeeds admirably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shanghai Noon is "Shanghailarious"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackie Chan is an Imperial Guardsman to the Chinese emperor. He is sent to the old west in 19th century America to aid in the return of the Chinese princess who is being held there for ransom. In the states, he forms an unlikely alliance with a goofy, but amiable, outlaw played by Owen Wilson. Chan and Wilson make an absolutely hilarious comedy team in this riotous, action-packed western send-up. Cliche after cliche falls prey to the film as the two heroes run roughshod through the west. Wilson's comedic delivery is truly remarkable, while Chan holds his own, as well. Of course, Chan again excels in stunt after stunt, setpiece upon setpiece. As always, keep watching through the film's closing credits for some amusing outtakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A diverting film, though by no mean Chan's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be candid, Jackie's previous American endeavor, "Rush Hour," turned to be somewhat of a disappointment for me. The action was there, as was the clichéd storyline, although Chris Tucker as a co-star did not necessarily appeal to me; I don't find 26-year-olds acting as if they were in their teenage years particularly amusing.Thus, it was with some skepticism that I went to watch "Shanghai Noon" after hearing that Chan would once again be paired with an American actor. I expected big action and excruciatingly tedious interactions between the two main leads, but was oddly enough provided with the opposite impression.The highlight of this film comes in the form of Chan's and Wilson's complementary roles. Wilson plays the part of the outspoken, wild cowboy, while Chan opts to convey his feelings through action, following his typical style--an homage to the great silent classics of the past. Wilson's wit is subtle enough to highlight the talents of Chan, and what Wilson himself does not possess, Chan brings out in him through what he has to offer to the silver screen. It's a rather remarkable accomplishment, which in several scenes creates a somewhat touching spectacle.So where does the film falter? Most of the action scenes are really inspired, and feature ingenious uses of ordinary items such as trees or ropes, but there is one main difference between the two actors: one is a cowboy, the other a martial artist. As a result, all of the conflicts in the story when the two characters are present consist of different enemies--a gun-rearing adversary for Wilson, and a martial artist or hand-fighting foe for Chan. In these moments, the film separates the two characters and leads them to different environments, which detaches the viewer to the point where it becomes painfully obvious that there is no real main conflict: it is simply two characters fighting a motley crew of random enemies.The detachment provided by these scenes often leads the viewer to find something else to draw themselves into the film with; as a result, the performance of Wilson -slightly- steals the show for the majority of the story. The director obviously attempts to balance this out by adding emotive scenes in which the two characters bond to a certain extent, though by the end of the film one tends to recall more about Wilson's acting than Chan's feats, which is quite a shame.Chan is growing older, and as a result is more restricted to the style of stunts that he can accomplish without heavily jeopardizing his life. Yet this film remains his strongest American attempt thus far, and features some astounding scenery with a wonderful orchestral accompaniment. It should prove to be a delight even to those who are not familiar with Chan's earlier material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackie Chan does it again; this time in "Shanghai Noon." Unlike his previous films, Jackie has finally found a sidekick that works well."Shanghai Noon" is unlike any other Jackie Chan movie I have seen. It is his best since "Rush Hour" and is among one of the best all-action movies that I've seen with an actual plot behind it. After watching previous Jackie Chan movies such as "Rush Hour" and "Rumble In The Bronx, I was expecting to be dazzled with his comedic talent as well as action filled sequences. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it had every one of the components and requirements that I require for a good movie.Owen Wilson was comedic treat to this film as he added spark to an already great movie. Other than the cliche plot, "Shanghai Noon" brings a lot of excellent comedy, dialogue, action, thrills and even a little romance. I was expecting Owen Wilson to be similar to Chris Tucker, but in "Shanghai Noon" Wilson proved himself to be much better than any other Jackie Chan sidekick that I've seen. I was glad I went to see this film and would recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shanghai Noon is the movie to see this Memorial Day weekend. It is a two fisted, two kicked, two six shooters blazing movie that keeps your faith in the westerns and kung fu films.Jackie is a real scream as an Emperor's Guard sent to America to help retrieve a kidnapped princess. He is still the read deal when it comes to stunts and fights. The western bar brawl scene is probably the best I've ever seen on film. Owen Wilson continues his quirky character streak as the wanna be outlaw whose noterity could use a little work and a better selection of cahoots (his posse is one of the dumbest but funniest in recent memory). And the real find here is Brandon Merril as the "Indian Wife" that knows more than we think she does. A real beauty and a gifted actress to boot, considering she isn't given much to work with.This film is summer entertainment to the highest degree. And the best Memorial Day weekend film I've seen in four years! Bring the family (the small but family filled auditorium last night was proof of that). And let's give this film the support it deserves!</fullReview>

I usually love Jackie Chan's films, but it seemed to me as if this was more of the same material, particularly in the fighting sequences. And for a comedy I didn't seem to laugh all that much, nor did I see many around me laughing with enthusiasm either. Perhaps I let the broken chair I was sitting on, the guy with the big head right in front of me, and the subtly out of focus screening taint my viewing pleasure, but maybe because of my high expectations, I found myself only disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie! If you like Jackie Chan, it's a must see. Yeah sure, it was a bit stereotypical in some areas (like say, the plot), but who cares? one good thing about stereotypes is seeing how people try to unstereotype them (did that make ANY sense???). Owen Wilson was absolutely HILARIOUS as the not-too-smart-yet-very-likeable side-kick. I loved the 3-way culture clash (Asian, American, Native-American). Gave way to some interesting fight scenes. And I do believe that most teens (or at least the ones I know) will laugh along with Jackie during the Peace Pipe (read: Water Bong) scene. A couple of nice surprises in the movie (such as the last scene). My favorite, though, had to be when we found out that one of the other Guards was none other than the great Rongguang Yu of Iron Monkey fame (He's the one who fights Jackie). If you liked that fight scene rent Iron Monkey.Anyway great action, great laughs, great movie. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Western buddy movie since "Butch and Sundance"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to a Jackie Chan movie you know what you will get: breathtaking action, self-deprecating humor and no sex. This time around it's two out of three, and the sexual element was minimal.The main plot deals with Jackie's efforts to recover the Chinese princess from a treasonous kidnapper. But the engine that powers the plot is the buddy relationship between Jackie and the bank robber.My only beef (and it's a small one) was that the two women in the story didn't have nearly enough to do. In the few scenes they had they were shown to be very strong women. In the case of the Native American woman who Jackie marries. She'll disappear then reappear at just the right time.Even though a comedy, there are some serious moments dealing with racism and the explotation of the Chinese railroad workers.The night before seeing this film, we went to see "Mission: Impossible 2". There was lots of action in that one, too. But all the characters were flat and uninteresting. The characters in SN are not totally three-dimensional, they don't need to be. But they are a bit rounder than the M:I2 crew. And the ride was a lot more fun.The only other thing I can say is: don't take any restroom breaks or you'll miss something good. IMHO the drinking game that Jackie and his buddy play is the funniest thing that I've seen on film in a long time.To conclude: see this movie. No reservations. Nine stars. Uncle Steve says check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much More Fun Than MI2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was my first Jackie Chan film, and it's surprisingly good. I was expecting a bad plot/script that simply hooked the action scenes together, but that was only because I just saw MI2. Shanghai Noon, though, has a real story, and a touching one at that.This is a slower, more contemplative movie than the trailers want us to think. That's why some critics say it lags here and there. If a Jackie Chan movie goes five minutes without his breaking something, that doesn't mean it's lagging. There's a real issue being developed in this film, right from the start in the Forbidden City. That's the question of personal freedom and honor. The Chan character has to settle that for himself, loyalty to the Emperor and the lock-step mentality of the East, or loyalty to something more important, his own sense of what's right. His selfless motivation in the beginning of the film gives him the opportunity to live a less restricted life in the West. This also ties in well with the fact that Chan and his partner Owen are being chased by the law, so the ideas of being in the law and outside it, and being bound by the imperial decree and being free of it co-mingle here. A smarter movie than it will be given credit for.However, most of the movie isn't about the high ideals, it's a funny, exciting film that's shot beautifully. It has a very clean look, very crisp. It has lots of good scenes, such as the bath Chan and Owen take, and no bad ones. A perfect summer movie, and I would be thrilled if it beats MI2 week after week.</fullReview>

It had some of the most funny scenes since Blazing Saddles, and they just kept coming; smoking the peace pipe, playing China drinking games, drunken horses, surfer dude cowboys, etc. etc. Oh, it also had some great fight scenes and even showed a little on how people from China were exploited while helping to build the West. It was a very well made movie, it had a little for everybody, if you go see this movie, you will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Owen Wilson, the amazingly funny guy from "Bottle Rocket" plays a cooler, but just as dopey, Dignan in this very funny movie. If Jackie Chan weren't so darn amazing to watch in his karate sequences, and pretty funny himself!, this would have been just fine with Owen alone. Owen is up to his old "gang" leadership traits again, ala Bottle Rocket, saying things like, "You're not in the gang anymore", and "I'm the one who likes to say that!" (referring to one of his outlaw partners saying "Stick 'em up" during a train robbery before he got the chance to). The twist at the end regarding Owen's character, "Roy" is a nice little treat as well!This isn't a typical buddy movie, it's quirky, and very exciting in different ways. Go watch Bottle Rocket for more of Owen Wilson and Rumble in the Bronx for more Jackie Chan...hell, go watch "Shanghai Noon" again, I know I will!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining, funny, and action packed! This is easily the best movie I've seen this year and by far, my favorite Jackie Chan movie. With many Jackie Chan movies, I find that the action is always good, but the story is sometimes lacking. I'm always waiting in anticipation for the next action scene. Not with "Shanghai Noon". There is a lot of great action and the story is incredibly funny and entertaining. Jackie Chan is his usual funny self. In this movie it's easy to see why he is so often compared to Buster Keaton. Owen Wilson gives a stellar performance as the not so capable cowboy thief and his comic timing is perfect. This wins in two categories for me, Best Action Movie and Best Comedy of the year 2000 (so far...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having made it to a Sneak Preview of this film I was amazed that this one-time showing was before a packed house. Jackie Chan will not disappoint his legions of admirers with this one. (rumor has it that he is scripting a sequel) Owen Wilson can only be described as a real "find" physical in appearance to a young Robert Redford. Lucy Liu is powerful in her role as the Princess, distant, alluring, aloof, a real powerhouse when she needs to be. Go see the film once for the plot, and then go see it again for the truly staggering period details of the "old west". Characters right out of that time, beautiful portraits of people, the sounds, the smells, the drama of that era so perfectly captured by the cast, crew and director. I can hardly wait for this release on DVD. A real surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thankfully, more like "High Noon" than "Shanghai Surprise"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into "Shanghai Noon", I was a little worried. I'm a big Jackie Chan fan, but would this film be more like "High Noon" (the classic Western with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly) or "Shanghai Surprise" (the awful film with Madonna and Sean Penn)? Thankfully, it's funnier than one and a lot better than the other. (I'll let you figure that one out.) This certainly isn't Jackie's best film (rent "Supercop" if you've never seen it), but it's an awful lot of fun. It lives up to the poster: The Classic Western Gets a Kick in the Pants. The film covers all the Jackie standards--corny jokes, great physical comedy, and wonderfully inventive fight sequences. Throw in a great sidekick, and you've got a good time at the movies.Jackie stars as Chon, an Imperial Guardsman in China's Forbidden City. When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped and taken to Nevada, the 3 best guards are sent after her. And Chon goes along to carry the interpreter's bags. Once in Nevada, Chon meets up with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), and gets separated from the rest of his party. Chon wanders through the West before finally arriving in Carson City. Along the way, he and Roy form an unlikely partnership and team up to rescue the Princess. With sadistic Marshall Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley) chasing them and roadroad tycoon slaver Lo Fong (Roger Yuan) holding the Princess, it won't be easy.The martial arts scenes are as good as expected: Jackie makes great use of any object he can lay his hands on, and always manages to use the surrounding environment to his benefit. We've all seen Indians chasing down a cowboy, but you've never seen it end this way. You'll also see a new spin on the 'unarmed man surrounded by 3 gunmen on a city street' scenario. And the final battle is much more inventive than a simple shoot-out. Being a Western, of course there's a shoot-out: they just add a little something extra.There's also a high level of comedy throughout the film--fight scenes included. That's where the chemistry between Jackie and Owen Wilson comes in. Jackie hit paydirt using 'fish out of water' scenes with Chris Tucker in "Rush Hour", and you see the same things in "Shanghai Noon". Wilson's Zen/Hippie/Surfer cowboy (who talks a great game as a gunfighter, but doesn't quite have the skills to back it up) plays nicely off Jackie's duty/honor/country warrior. Their interactions are always easy to watch (unlike so many movies that try to force the 'buddy thing'). Wilson (who had many great lines in "Armageddon") and Jackie obviously had a lot of fun, and it's evident in their performances. Liu ("Ally McBeal", the upcoming "Charlie's Angels") and Berkeley do good things with their limited parts, but I'd watch Liu in just about anything! One problem: I was never really interested in Yuan's character. I expected more out of the main bad guy--call it "Gladiator" syndrome.Other than that, I had a few other problems with the film. In this day and age, I just don't see the point of drug and alcohol used as humor. "Look, I'm high" and "Look, I'm drunk" just don't do it for me. There were enough funny moments in this film to carry the humor--they didn't need to take the easy way out as often as they did. I also thought the use of modern slang coming from the Indians was funny at first, but they really overdid it.One thing I have to mention: play close attention to the names in the film. Jackie is given names by the Indians, the makers of Wanted posters, and by Roy. Marshall Van Cleef's name pays homage to Spaghetti Western star Lee Van Cleef ("The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Ugly" and "For A Few Dollars More"). And Roy's real name is clever indeed."Shanghai Noon" is an excellent Summer Movie, worthy of 3 stars (out of 4). Good action, lots of laughs, and actors/characters that you enjoy watching. And make sure you stay around for the outtakes during the closing credits (another Jackie standard).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Shanghai Noon" is just what a good summer film should be: colorful, energetic, not too taxing on the old brain stem, and a lot of fun. It's an interesting film to set up against "Mission: Impossible 2", but I don't think either film is going to suffer for it. The Tom Cruise film is a high-tech, big-effect stunt spectacular a'la "The Matrix", whereas "Shanghai" is a good old-fashioned chopsocky actioner with a novel western twist.The film follows a Chinese imperial guard, Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) sent to America to rescue a princess who has been kidnapped by a former guard who fled the city and is now a railroad baron who profits by the suffering of the Chinese workers who do his bidding (the film certainly does better by its sociohistorical trappings than last summer's "Wild Wild West" did). However, there are a series of mishaps along the way, and Chon ends up first married to an Indian squaw, then with a $1000 price on his head. Fortunately (?), he hooks up with Roy (Owen Wilson), a would-be master bandit who tries to show him the ropes of how to survive in the wild west. Of course, it would help if he knew how to do it himself..."Shanghai Noon"'s plot is basically the same as 1998's "Rush Hour", which paired Chan with motormouth comic Chris Tucker, but here the elements are combined with a lot more flair and energy. Commercial director Tom Dey makes a competent feature debut; his continuity in editing is sometimes off, but he supplies some nicely authentic period flavor as well as displaying a good sense of comic timing, something not enough directors have nowadays.The film really does have a good sense of the Old West. From the rickety telegraph lines running next to the train tracks to the dusty dirty streets of the cattle towns, the picture goes to a lot more trouble to look and feel real than most period comedies do. Special credit goes to the crew for an impressively authentic railroad camp, complete with ramshackle tents for the workers and piles of ties scattered everywhere.Jackie Chan has broken every bone in his body in the service of his art, and though he is not quite as nimble and adept as he was in his younger days, he still kicks more butt by 8 a.m. then most action heroes do all day. Of course, it also helps that he's extremely funny and likable, and his ingenuous nature gives a fresh quality to the standard fish-out-of-water routine. Of course, I could just be saying this because I'm afraid to get pounded with a horseshoe on a rope, which Chan does to about three guys in perhaps the picture's neatest action scene.Still, as far as I'm concerned, Owen Wilson walks away with this picture. Imagine watching a western where the hero is a cowboy who learned everything he knows by watching cowboy movies, and that captures the tone of this killer comic performance. Wilson clicks with Chan big-time, and he's got a ton of witty asides, as well as an idiosyncratically laid-back Zen surfer style that you don't usually see on the range. Just the way he walks into a room is unusual and interesting. I hope that Wilson can find a lot more good vehicles for his singular talents (or maybe he can write himself one; he did a pretty good job as co-writer of "Rushmore").I walked out of "Shanghai Noon" in good spirits, cheered and roused by some good action and entertaining comedy. I think that's exactly what the filmmakers intended, so if they don't mind me borrowing a line from their major competition this weekend, I'd like to say...mission accomplished.</fullReview>

The basic premise of the movie is the same as in Chan's 'Rush Hour'-- Foreigner comes to States to rescue kidnapped victim, cultures clash, and lots of Chan's original style of action/fight scenes occur....The difference between Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon, is the lack of Chris Tucker... which allows Chan's subtler form of humor to shine. Shanghai Noon also has more fight scenes than Rush Hour, though not as many as Chan's non-U.S. films.The movie is definitely worth watching, especially if you are a Jackie Chan fan...

		<shortDescription>Finally, A Primary U.S. release worthy of his fans admiration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a die hard Jackie Chan fan since I was about 8 years old. I have seen almost everyone of his movies. And I could always see why Jackie Chan, being the true entertainer he is (as oppossed to a flash in the pan many action stars are)could not make a successful movie here. he is more interested in making his fans happy than he is caring for his own health and fattening his wallet. Well, Shanghai Noon has it all. The script is well written. The action scenes are worth the ticket alone. Owen Wilson was perfectly cast for this part... adding more comedy than Chris Tucker did in Rush Hour. I was happy to see that many of the odd moments incorporated into Chan's films were left out. Such as extremely stupid "bad guys", those cartoonish faces the "bad guys" make when getting hit and just the plan bad stereotypes his enemies always seem to be modeled after. My only complaint of this movie is that some of the action scenes had too many cuts. The sheer fun of a Jackie Chan movie is watching him do his thing with a minimum of cuts during the scene. He moves too fast to fully appreciate his ability in a scene with too many cuts. However, this is made up with one spectacular scene in the end. I saw this movie at a sneak preview which was sold out. When the final credits rolled, the audience cheered and applauded. Odd as it is to say, I was quite proud of Jackie... he deserves this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Snuck into a sneak preview yesterday and I was not disappointed for a Chan American flick. I expected much of the movie to revolve around his action sequences, but they actually tie into a plot on this one - and the plot's not too horrid either. Jackie never got into it like he did in the films from the Old Country, but the man still showcases his skills here. And now, a word on the co-star.Owen Wilson. This man has comedic talent. He has great timing, and the stuff he says in completely unexpected, but I find myself (being the smart-booty type I am) thinking that I probably would have said something of that manner in the same predicament. I guess it's a Texas thing. But he's a homegrown boy, a natural comedic talent (hell, he co-wrote "Rushmore" and "Bottle Rocket", among others), and I would love to see him show up in some other great indie or mainstream films. He's just a grand Texan with mad talent. Plus, he's a University of Texas kiddo too. GO LONGHORNS! Boy needs to get back to Austin more often - it's always fun to spot movie people around town.So, overall, great casting on the main roles (although Lucy Liu gets on my nerves and didn't impress me at all), awesome that they used REAL American Indians to PLAY the Indians, and great, gut-busting comedy. Worth the time. And most college kiddos (whether they dabble or choose not to) will almost fall on the floor during the Peace Pipe and bathtub scenes. Can we relate or what...? We're so shallow...No, seriously now, it's a great comedy, has good action, this is wonderful laugh-enducing work by Owen Wilson, and worth the ticket. Go see it. Now. No, you don't understand... RIGHT now. .......You're still sitting at your computer, aren't you? Why won't you *listen*??? I am the *ultimate* word on film! Don't make me hypnotize you now, boy. You wouldn't want me to do that. Oh no. Don't p**s off Texans. We can get real nasty-nasty. GOGOGOGOGOGO!!... the power button will make your computer do fantastic tricks if you push it! I promise!Go see the movie.

		<fullReview>Shanghai Noon: When the Chinese princess is kidnapped from the Forbidden City and taken to America the three bravest Imperial Guards are dispatched to recover her. Oh, yeah, they also send her cousin to carry the baggage. Every western stereotype you can think of is brought to bear in this movie - cowboys, Indian's, bank robbers, evil sheriffs, coolies, etc. - and that's exactly why it works: they poke fun at everything and everyone, political correctness be damned! If you have ever been a fan of the old-fashioned westerns, you will especially appreciate some of the subtler humor i.e., the sheriff's is named after Van Cleef (Lee Van Cleef having been second only to Clint Eastwood in the spaghetti western genre). The pairing of Chan and Wilson was pure genius, for although they both play simple klutzes, their comedic styles couldn't be more different if they tried. While Chan relies heavily on physical humor - playing to the camera and grimacing horribly in pain (often for real)), Wilson is introspective and low key punctuating his jokes with a toned down whining nasality. Yet, both still manage to achieve their desired effect. The two also mesh extremely well and feed off one another's energy, which adds to the ambience. Of course, the question on everyone's mind is whether it contains the patented action sequences we expect from a Jackie Chan flick. The answer is a resounding "Yes"!There are some several incredible stunts - the logrolling scene from the trailers is especially impressive. As always there are amusing choreographed fight scenes - Chan's arsenal of weapons includes everything from traditional Chinese martial arts weapons (it is the first time I've seen a three section staff in a movie in the past decade) to trees and moose antlers. Also, typical of his films, the fights also maintain a cartoonish quality, highlighting Chan's acrobatic style over blood and gore (it is usually Chan's characters that do the bleeding).If you are starved for a comical action film pull up to the trough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He's still Jackie, just slightly slower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin to complain, let me say that I gave this film a 7 out of 10; I don't dislike it.That said, there is a certain amount of sadness to this entire scenario. The action scenes have slowed, the stunts become less spectacular, and in some cases, clearly not performed by Jackie Chan. Now I don't blame him for this...at the ripe old age of 42, Jackie has destroyed himself for our entertainment time after time. So much so, in fact, that his poor, tortured, patched and re-patched body just can't handle the kind of abuse he used to heap on himself. It shows.In addition to the obvious slowdown of the action, it once again becomes painfully clear that very few american directors know how to clearly portray a complex fight scene. Even with Jackie not at the top of his game, this is incredibly complicated choreography compared to most american fare. Where a Hong Kong director would pull the camera back and give us long takes, making certain that the moves and positions of the combatants are clear to the audience, american directors insist on bringing the camera in close and cutting often. This blurs the clarity of the action and creates a lot of confusion as to who's where, and who's fist is colliding with whose face.Complaining aside, action is only half the draw of a Jackie Chan film. Comedy has always been a strong element in his ouvre, and "Shanghai Noon" doesn't let us down there. Any longtime Jackie fan knows of his incredible gift for physical comedy, and his goofing is as good as ever here. The real surprises lie in some very well-written comic dialogue, and that dialogue's delivery by Owen Wilson. Given that Wilson is a gifted comic writer himself (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore), one has to wonder if he re-composed some of his dialogue himself. Some of the eastern-cliche meets western-cliche exchanges between the two are inspired.Lucy Liu, on the other hand, I found disappointing. It may seem a strange thing to say about a chinese actress, but I found her unconvincing as a Chinese. Her performance seemed like a shallow american interpretation of what a chinese woman would be like. As a longtime fan of Hong Kong action cinema, I just find myself wondering what Anita Mui or Maggie Cheung could have done in the role.All in all, this is on a par with "Rush Hour"; a solid american take on the Hong Kong institution that is the Jackie Chan movie. It's just no "Drunken Master II", that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess Jackie Chan should thank Quinten Taratino since it was Taratino who help made Jackie popular in America. Ever since the MTV Movie Awards appearance, Chan movies have been popping up left and right over here. There are some good Chan movies, and some not so good. Now since RUSH HOUR, Chan is in his newest American film, this time it's a kung fu film mixed with a western called SHANGHAI NOON. In SHANGHAI NOON, Chan plays Chon Wang (sounds like John Wayne) a clumsy guard for the royal Princess in China. It turns out that the princess (Lucy Liu) doesn't want to marry the husband that her father choses for her, so she runs off with her tutor to America. Unaware of the tutor's plans, he actually kidnaps her, and with the help a a former bodyguard for the royal family, demand all of the king's gold for her life. Chon Wang along with three powerful guards go to American to look for the kidnapped princess in Carson City Nevada. They come across Roy O' Bannon (Owen Wilson), a clumsy robber who usually "wings" all of his heists. After O' Bannon and Wang have a few confrontations with each other, they decide to put their differences aside and help rescue the princess. SHANGHAI NOON is a decent Jackie Chan film, it's no SUPERCOP, but it's better than OPERATION CONDOR and RUMBLE IN THE BRONX. Chan does show his amazing talent with his kung fu and doing his own stunts. I thought that I was going to be bored with Chan's fighting, but he does mix some new things into his fights. And Owen Wilson is at times funny and at other times annoying as the partner who helps Chan. Wilson reminds me of Danny DeVito in TWINS, in some scenes he's good, in others he's downright annoying. But since this is different than the Asian Chan films which is pretty much 90 minutes of fighting, this actually has a story blended with it, so it helps the pacing of the film. SHANGHAI is a film that Jackie Chan fans will love. I am a Chan fan, so I fairly enjoyed it. The stunts or action isn't as impressive as SUPERCOP, but it does manage to stand on it's own. And please stay through the credits, as usual, Chan displays his usual outtakes of his accidents while shooting. Some of which are really funny. *** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The extremely thin plot and Chan's usual sceptical acting (but then that's not what made him a star in the first place) is saved by the constant action and some slapstick moments that would be more at home in a 'Dumb and Dumber' type of film. Owen Wilson excels as Chan's cowboy "guru" and will have enhanced his credentials as a comedy actor. The historical significance of the exploitation of Chinese in labour camps was not really brought to the viewer's attention, I think a lot of people who watch the film will just accept it as a fictional addition to the plot. This film has got the lot: guns and dynamite, Indians and Chinamen, sherrifs and monks and even a whisky drinking horse ! It achieves exactly what it set out to; a serving of kicks, spins, chops and punches with a few laughs on the side. 'Rush Hour' meets 'Rawhide'. Just the movie for a lazy Sunday night with a tub of ice cream...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more than worthy successor to Rush Hour -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING! Contains mild SPOILERS - read at own riskJackie Chan's back again, and this time he's in the Old West. Jackie's latest entry into American film is even better than his first attempt (first, that is of his 'new' American works) Rush Hour. Full of action, comedy, beautiful scenery and an amazing horse, Shanghai Noon proves once and for all that Jackie Chan is here to stay. With humor on level with City Hunter, a partner (Owen Wilson) who works just as well as Michelle Yeoh in Police Story III, and action scenes (not including one bar fight) easily on par with Police Story IV's final two fights, Shanghai Noon succeeds and succeeds well.The film does, however unfortunately start off slow, and to truly die hard fans of Jackie Chan the first 25-30 minutes have a very strong "doesn't feel like a Jackie film" feeling to it. At first I was worried Jackie had some how ended up with another film like The Protector. However, after this slow start, the film takes off, and pulls you in for a wonderful ride. A few of the comic highlights involve Jackie's amazing horse, a horse shoe used in a fight, and a gun battle during the finale of the film. The fights, except for the one mentioned earlier are all very well choreographed, and it is clear that many of the stand ins must be Jackie Chan's Stunt Boys. Try to spot Yuen Biao (one of Jackie's boyhood companion at the Opera academy), as I totally missed him. The stunts in this film are at a minimum compared to Jackie's earlier works (remember the ouch in Armour of God), and at least one appears to have blue screened, but all is easily forgivable, as Jackie was nearly 46 at the time of filming. All in all a great film. I gave it a 9 out of 10 due to the opening 25 or so minutes, but a definite success for Jackie.As a final note: It is well known that this story had been in Jackie's mind many years, but he does not appear to have been given any writeing or story credits from what I noticed. I hope I just missed it, but if I did not then I feel that this is a great disservice to one of the most successful director/actors of our time.</fullReview>

I expected a Jackie Chan film to be at least humorous and entertaining, but this has to be one of his best efforts, and Owen Wilson did a fabulous job. I would love to tell you more, but part of this film's charm is the surprising (and totally unexpected) dialog. The sets were wonderful (an earlier reviewer was correct, they didn't sugar-coat the chinese laborers...)... and the action sequences were pure Chan - while not detracting from the story line... oh, and don't leave the theater too quickly, like other Chan films, the laughter didn't stop with the end of the film, the out takes were equally hysterical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since coming to these shores (a second time), Jackie Chan's output has been rather typical American action fare, with bits and pieces of Jackie's trademark comedy and martial arts action. Shanghai Noon is no exception, but it is helped by a good performance by Owen Wilson and by gorgeous Calgary scenery. It's worth seeing, especially for Jackie fans, although even they might begin to see that Jackie's getting a little long in the tooth for some of his stuntwork (one stunt is clearly CGI). Still, Jackie is a very engaging personality, and that goes a long way to helping viewers forget the remarkable lack of logic or cohesiveness in the plot of Shanghai Noon. Check your brain at the door and have a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOVED THIS MOVIE! Not surprising for a Jackie Chan film. The action was non-stop. The historical aspects were multi-faceted and thought provoking. The costumes and make-up were outstanding, the musical scores selected were perfect, and the locations were breathtaking. Jackie Chan never fails to amuse and amaze the viewer with his speed, stunts, and humorous nature. What I enjoyed seeing were the following aspects: Native American actors and actresses were portraying Native Americans. Mainly Chinese actors and actresses were portraying Chinese persons. The Chinese involvement in the building of the railroads was not sugar coated for the American public. Those were bleak times in History in the name of "Progress", I was glad they showed it, as many do not know that Chinese laborers were used in the building of the railroads. I would highly recommend this film for those who love Jackie Chan or Westerns or just enjoy an action packed film.GO SEE THIS MOVIE! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A loyal Imperial Guard sets off to America to rescue a kidnapped Princess that he serves in China. After the train he is on is robbed by Outlaws, and his uncle is killed, a set of circumstances will put the guard in the company of a rapscallion cowboy named Roy O'Bannon, to form an unlikely a duo as you are ever likely to see.Laden with Cowboy clichés and trumpeting that it is a West meets the East fish out of water shenanigan, Shanghai Noon could so easily have been a film to roll your eyes up to heaven with. Thankfully it turns out to be a non pretentious, non moralistic mess that entertains those looking for a comedy that just wants to cheer you up. Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (say that real fast to get the joke) opens up his bag of martial arts joviality and impresses as much as he amuses (check out the horse shoe set piece). While Owen Wilson as O'Bannon leaves behind some previous stinker pictures, to engage us royally as a comedy actor and provide us with dynamite chemistry playing off the charming wonder of Chan (the sequel was inevitable). With both men clearly happy to run with it and let each one share the limelight.It's a positive delight is what it is, blustering set pieces go hand in hand with cheeky in-jokes and Western genre standards, whilst the end credit out takes are some of the funniest out there. Highly recommended viewing to those in need of a pick me up and to those who know that sometimes harmless fun can be a cinematic treat. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The honest China man and...an outlaw cowboy with issues?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly did not know what to expect, after seeing the 'pre' on the trailer. It was however a screamingly funny situation that started with an outlaw cowboy and a kindly Chinaman looking for a princess, in America. This duo when they came together was another one of those, 'fresh-eyed' originals. I get chills thinking about when I first saw it with a new friend that I had back in 2000. I still love this movie. The premise is a funny one, right off the bat these two are good at what they do, but are looked upon as mere screw-ups, by their employers, well at least Chan's Boss looked at him that way. But the coming to America to track the princess, meanwhile Wilson's character is a robber and a thief, who has an ongoing schmooze for the female kind. A Royal Chinese guardsman and a frontier cowboy, with issues. What a pair of jokers. But you can't help but love these two anyway. The cowboy, (Owen Wilson)who always seems to analyze things, and over talk them. Chan's character, is looking to do the right thing, for King and country, in cowboy territory. From the first collision with these two ill-fated men with separate missions, Wilson's cowboy, is thinking that he is in control, because the simple little China man does not understand the predicament. Only to the Cowboy's surprise, that the little visitor is very much, a knowledgeable one, if Wilson's character will stop 'jawwing' so much. One of the funnest parts to the story, was those two trading shots of liquor in the bathtubs at the 'Cat-house' then after going for quite a long time, with their drinking game, the woman opens the door to see how they are doing and they look up covered in bubbles, drunk as skunks, and with two tubs ...they are sharing the same one, laughing like crazy! They go through quite a few Miss-adventures leading up to their finale' at the church. This for me beside side-splitting laughter, superb directing and a look at some of the bloopers, makes this one a super-hit!I recommend for the discriminating sense of humor, that enjoys oddities and good clean fun!

		<fullReview>Basically the same sort of thing as the rest of Jackie Chan's movies, only this one casts him as Chinese imperial guard Chon Wang, who has to rescue Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) in the Old West. That's the plot, but of course, the movie is really an excuse to show off Chan's fighting skills. Adding to everything is Owen Wilson as bank robber Roy O'Bannon, who keeps getting himself into embarrassing situations.One really funny scene is when Chon's cohorts are traveling with a pioneer family who gets ROYALLY confused about the men's ethnicity! Overall, maybe "Shanghai Noon" doesn't add anything major to the cinematic landscape, but that's not the purpose here! We're here to see Jackie Chan pull his stunts. And boy does he!

It is with no doubts the absolutely greatest Chan-movie made in America and Jackie himself is very proud at this masterpiece. It's really surprising that this movie had much lower success than Rush Hour when it's many times better. It's funnier, the fight scenes are way better and Jackie has much more charisma. And the chemistry between him and his sidekick Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) is perfect. I love the part when Jackie - after he saves an Indian boy from beating - gets stoned with the Indians and in the sudden delirium he gets married with the Indian chief's daughter. As a present he gets an originally trained horse, who later gets totally drunk when he drinks a full bottle of whiskey while waiting at the inn stable :-))) The movie contains great gags, some unexpected plot twists and fantastic martial art scenes. I think that even Jackie didn't expect he would be able to make such an amazing movie an America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Jackie Chan is the biggest screw-up in the Emporer's guard. However, when his honorable uncle is sent by the Emporer on an important mission to America, Jackie is allowed to come as his personal servant. However, Jackie's uncle is killed in a train robbery, and soon it is up to Jackie to fight his way across the wild West and save the Emporer's daughter from evil kidnappers.I love Jackie Chan, and this is possibly the most enjoyable Chan film for a non-Chinese speaker to watch (well, maybe Rush Hour 2 is better, but Shanghai Noon is second best then). Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are a really good comedy team, with Chan playing the "straight man" most of the time. This film has one of the greatest drinking scenes in cinematic history, in which Chan gets to clown around and play his more familiar role.Wilson plays a hilarious "sensitive new-aged cowboy," with a lot of great lines.The jokes are well-written and well-played. The plot is not compelling, original, or realistic... but who cares?On top of the fun comedy, Chan does some good fighting and good stunts. The scene fighting with horse-shoes and rope is some of his better work. There is also a memorable scene, in which Chan is involved in a classic Western bar-room brawl.Overall, this film is not great art, but I can remember very few films I enjoyed more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, and pairing them up for this movie was a great idea. Jackie is excellent and funny, with enough new moves to make it different from his other movies. Owen Wilson plays the smart-alecky know-it-all cowboy, but he's really just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. He's not exceptionally good or bad at anything really (except for shooting!!), and it's actually a nice, workable change from movies that have heroes that never miss or get shot 500 times and keep going. The comedy moves right along, with several semi-intellectual comical scenes that make me appreciate comedy that's more than just silly, slapstick goofiness for the sake of a laugh (although, fortunately, there's plenty of that,too). All in all, these guys are as funny together as Jackie was with Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour "series". Although, now that both "series" have gone to a number Two (sequels), I think it's time to quit while they're ahead.</fullReview>

However, if you are looking for a combination western buddy picture, wry and slapstick comedy and a martial arts display, this here's your movie, Pard'ner. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan just clicks, and with a cute script that pokes fun at the clichés and traditions of the Western genre, "Shanghai Noon" is an extremely enjoyable film. Xander Berkeley does a nice job as a lawman that just will not give up his quarry. Lucy Liu, whom we all know has wonderful talents, appears held back by her limited role in the script, and I wonder why the writers didn't flesh out her role a bit better. All of the other cast members just blend into the Western sets, which is a big disappointment in the case of Brandon Merrill - I would have liked to see her given more than just two lines!"Shanghai Noon" is certainly not the first 'East-meets-Western' movie, but in my opinion, it's the funniest!

		<fullReview>Likeable as it undoubtedly is, `Shanghai Noon' never manages to elicit more than a few mild chuckles during its 110-minute running time. You sure can't blame the actors for not trying since both Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson provide charm and energy to spare: Chan as a Chinese Imperial guardsman sent to America to ransom a kidnapped princess, and Wilson as a sardonic, well meaning, but bumbling highwayman who meet up and become unlikely buddies in the 1880's American West. The fault, therefore, must lie in the screenplay, which, though it has its heart in the right place, never breaks out into the full-fledged absurdism a set-up like this needs to really make it work. The film draws heavily from a number of earlier Western spoofs ? i.e. the nick-of-time gallows rescue a la `Cat Ballou,' the mocking derision of Western movie star names in `Back to the Future III' (albeit in this case it is John Wayne who comes in for the ribbing as opposed to Clint Eastwood in the earlier film). There's even a bit of the atmosphere of `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' in the train robbery and the hiding-out-in-a-bordello scenes. Somehow, though, the authors of this film don't quite know what to do with all the elements they've gathered. Chan and Wilson certainly make for genial and entertaining partners, but the comic lines just aren't there for them to work with. Most of the jokes revolve around tired references to Chan's cross-cultural, fish-out-of-water bumbling. More successful are Wilson's glib one-liners that help to domesticate much of the action and make it relevant to modern audiences. The script, unfortunately, softens its edges by frequently lapsing into point-making sentimentality ? particularly in the scenes with the shanghai-ed princess. These sequences interrupt the lighthearted, comic tone without adding any real depth to the proceedings.Of course, one does not attend a Jackie Chan movie seeking either great acting or even decent comic timing from the martial arts stunt man extraordinaire. We come, of course, for the jaw dropping action sequences that are sure to be a major part of any Chan vehicle. Although we are not exactly disappointed by his work in `Shanghai Noon,' it was obviously decided early on in the making of this film to use this as a bridge to help Chan cross over into more mainstream filmmaking and, therefore, the moviemakers emphasize the story, dialogue and characters at the expense of the elaborate stunt work. That would be fine if the quality of the former were anywhere near the level necessary to overcome the insufficiency of the latter, but I'm afraid that Chan's physical action sequences in `Shanghai Noon,' though certainly not bad by any stretch of the imagination, still lack the no-holds-barred exuberance and playfulness of much of his previous, less narrative-oriented work.`Shanghai Noon' is, I suppose, a tolerable time waster (and its glorious Nevada backgrounds make for some mighty impressive viewing), but, given the high energy level of its two stars, one wishes it were so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best martial arts movie...ever! (sorry Crouching Tiger, Bruce Lee)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shang Hai Noon is one of those rare movies that transcends several genres.The comedy is first rate with Jackie Chan playing straight man to Owen Wilson's fantastic "clown". (For American movies, these are Jackie's best roles -- e.g. Rush Hour).The martial arts is some of the best I have ever seen. Having practiced MA for 16 years, I can say that this is the REAL THING. It's tough to pick a favorite fight scene; there are three specific ones which are each very special.The Horseshoe Scene, though, is one of the best examples (ever) of Jackie Chan's talent -- it's one of the most difficult forms in all of MA and he absolutely nails it.Fight coordinator Yuen Biao is significantly more imaginative and true to the Form than many (any?) of his colleagues, including Yuen Wo Ping (many Jet Li's films and Crouching Tiger, Hidden [Wires, oops] Dragon). If there was any "wire-work" in this movie, it certainly wasn't obvious.(I must state here that I am not a fan of the absolute brutality which is emphasized by Jet Li, Steven Segal or many of the others. If you enjoy brutality, this film isn't for you.)While the martial arts is spectacular, it is just one component of a very good film. The direction and editing are quite notable. There are several parallel storylines which are interlaced very nicely. Also, several of the action scenes have parallel events which come together seamlessly. The whole movie has very nice "flow" to it.The acting is also first-rate. Roger Yuan, Xander Berkeley, and Walt Groggins are each great villains (both believable and despicable). Lucy Liu is quite regal (as well as drop-dead gorgeous) as the princess Pei-pei.Even the music is great and well-timed to dramatize the corresponding sequences.I will say that some of the comedy is a bit 'cornball', but it's all in good fun.Overall, I would say this movie is quite simply a whole lot of fun.9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very childish and weak comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the movie is rated PG-13, it's a very childish and simple movie that is aimed toward the young viewers. It's comedy and story is totally predictable and thus offers very little fun and originality.I'm actually quite fond of movies that try to mix some very unlikely genres together. I however guess that mixing western with material arts wasn't a very good idea. It really doesn't look and feel right. As a movie that is set for most part in the wild west, it also is a far too clean looking movie. It has bright colors and actors with perfect shining teeth.I like Jackie Chan but not really as much in his Hollywood work. He's acting and accent are far too lacking for that and even his comical and fighting skills don't really shine within this movie, even though there are still a couple of nice fighting sequences within the movie. Most of the comedy from this movie needs to come from Owen Wilson, who however isn't given the best material to work with. No, as a comedy this movie is simply too lacking, fore it's far too childish, totally predictable and just plain weak at parts. The only thing this movie is really funny in is with its characters names, that of course reference to some classic western actors and real life persons.This movie was actually Owen Wilson's 'big' comedy breakthrough. Before this he also played some slightly comical roles but more in some 'serious' movies, such as "Armageddon", "The Haunting" and "Anaconda". Lucy Liu is also in this somewhere but she gets far too little to do. Same goes for Xander Berkeley, who seemed like a potentially interesting villain.Here lies another problem of the movie. Characters just come and just as easily go within this movie. It really isn't very consistent and its confusing who is going to be for instance the main villain, the love interest, etcetera. The movie feels messy because of this and it made it actually quite annoying to watch at times, also since the story is being so formulaic and therefore totally predictable.Just a weak, annoying and childish comedy. Not sure why it's currently being rated so high. I hate these Hollywood type of immature comedies/buddy flicks.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shanghai Noon (2000): Dir: Tom Dey / Cast: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Xander Berkeley, Brandon Merrill: Comedy about the collision of two cultures. We have Jackie Chan as an Imperial guard in China as well as Owen Wilson as an amateur train robber who is betrayed by his gang. Chan is on a quest to Carson City to rescue a Princess kidnapped by a traitor. The rest involves a series of mishaps as Chan and Wilson become wanted criminals. Simple and predictable with a lot of action and stunts. Directing debut for Tom Dey who does a fine job at combining the two genres into one comic centerpiece. Chan and Wilson provide great comic chemistry. Chan is out in search of answers and justice while Wilson fumbles through life attaching to anything and anyone who will listen. It is unfortunate that they will wind down to an action climax that halts everything. Lucy Liu is unfortunately working with standard material as the Princess. She had great potential to rise above this due to her celebrity status but remain sheltered in stereotypes here. Xander Berkeley is also featured among notable casting but nothing in supporting roles is very broad. This film purely belongs to the leads and thankfully their chemistry propel the film beyond being what would be consider pitiful in lesser hands. The result is a mediocre yet enjoyable comedy about two cultures and two genres. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big fan of Chan, so allow me to be critical, if I may, about what, at the end of the day, is not a bad movie at all.This film is worth seeing at least once. It's worth catching on Channel 5 in a couple of years' time. It's a pop-corner, a family fun, watch it one minute, forget most of it the next, thrill ride.As usual Jackie Chan's creativity is enough to impressive even non-fans of the Kung-Fu genre. He dazzles, and entertains convincingly enough to forgive him for Rumble in Hong Kong. In this film, he uses similar moves to the ones executed in far lesser-known Hong Kong movies of the eighties. There are interesting new ideas that are pulled off in exemplary form, whilst Chan maintains his friendly and charming persona to the death.Once again, however, Chan has fallen victim to his own circumstances - meaning that he has had to be paired with the current comic of the time. We've had enough of Chris Tucker by the end of the first Rush Hour, and its sequel, Rush Hour 2 was a year away from release. In the mean time, Jackie is paired up with the ever-charming, Owen Wilson, who's in the film to make the ladies blush, and the men think, "he ain't such a bad guy." Wilson's addition makes the film more available to the Western market, who still, it seems, want an American star next to Chan, to guide him through the language barrier in a comically pleasing way. In all honesty, it grinds, and towards the end of the film, you will be left thinking that Chan should have left Wilson a long time before the film's climax.Lucy Liu plays the Princess/love interest/innocent captive in a convincing way, but I couldn't help thinking she was the ice-maiden in Ally McBeal, and the bondage gangster with a foul-mouth in Payback. Her character had to play it innocently, so she appeared to have no freedom to explore her character, leaving the smallest amount of character detail to the two main protagonists.The script is cheap and cheerful, and won't win any awards, but aids the progression of the storyline in a humorous way, without being clever, or arty about it.It's not a real Western. It's more like a kids impression of a Western, with a spin-kick or two added to the pot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When East meets West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Original Date of Review - February 12, 2005) There are tons of mindless, worthless, no name westerns out there. Even John Wayne and Clint Eastwood have one or two films nobody wants to put their hands on even if Blockbuster or Rogers is selling them for $9.99. Now in the 21st century, westerns have practically died out with those films now having many references to history or western context.One breed of film that hasn't been around as long can be just as entertaining. Martial Arts. From Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li, martial arts are fun-filled action films. Even a newfound Tony Jaa has burst into the martial arts genre with his new film Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior, out in theatres this weekend.However, when you take both films and smash them together, add a loved martial arts star (Jackie Chan), and have a comedic funny-man to represent the western front (Owen Wilson), you get an awesome new breed of film I like to call an "Eastern".Taking place in the 19th century (if memory serves correct), Chon Wang (played by Chan; Chinese for John Wayne) plays an Imperial Guard of the Chinese emperor. When their beloved Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is kidnapped by their mortal enemies, Wang offers himself to personally find her where she's been kidnapped: The US of A. Now in the Wild West, Chon finds himself in the good ole' state of Nevada. Meanwhile, Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) is a crook that loots trains and saloons with his group of friends. They cross paths and they soon enough, they venture through a tough adventure. The unlikely duo teaches each other, as they learn new things that lead to tons of action and tons of comedy. Together, they help each other get what they want in an action filled western-style adventure film.Overall, Shanghai Noon is a great action film. It's got a great, unique combo of both martial arts action and classic eastern shoot-out scenes. This combo is brought to life with the personality and likeness from both Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. However, the film drags a bit and sometimes, you feel a lot could be cut out. The drama seems out of place and doesn't seem very well done, as they should have concentrated a bit more energy and effort into it. Lucy Liu does a nice job with her role though and the action scenes, both martial arts and western are impressive enough to stand on its own. Definitely a Chan classic. Wonder what two action genres Hollywood will combine next and maybe with their crazy ideas can come random success.My Rating: 7.5/10 (A High 7.5)Eliason A.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chan and Wilson make like a latter day Hope &amp; Crosby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHANGHAI NOON (2000) *** Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Brandon Merrill, Roger Yuan, Xander Berkeley. (Dir: Tom Dey)Jackie Chan put his international superstardom to the test in this rambunctious fish-out-of-water buddy film set in the wild, wild west and succeeds in this his second attempt at teaming with a comedic partner (see `Rush Hour' with Chris Tucker which has set the trend in motion). Chan stars as a member of China's Forbidden City domain during the late 19th century as a lowly servant who winds up as a member of a party to rescue their princess who has gone abroad to America only to become kidnapped with a high ransom of gold in demand for her return. As Chon Wang, the nephew to the interpreter, he finds himself on a train en route to Carson City, Nevada only to become a renegade avenger when the train is ambushed by thieves who've killed his elderly uncle in the process. Led by amiable bungling cowpoke wanna-be outlaw Roy O' Bannon (the genially goofy Wilson) the gang attempt to blow the train's safe only for it to be hurtled off a bridge due to the overuse of TNT. Wang and O'Bannon tumble off the express and eventually become partners after a series of surprisingly funny events which occur including Wang's induction into an Indian tribe resulting in his marriage to a sexy squaw (the striking Merrill) who tags along for the journey to release Princess Pei Pei (the saucy Liu from `Ally McBeal') from a disgruntled former member of her court, Lo Fong (Yuang) and an unscrupulous marshal named Van Cleef (Berkeley actually doing a mean impersonation of the late Lee Van Cleef). The duo become enmeshed in many shenanigans including a few fights, gunfights and a very funny brothel bathroom bath sequence involving a non-sensical drinking game. Chan's unique fisticuffs involving the martial arts with everything but the kitchen sink as a sparring prop (his ponytail, a hatchet, a rack of moose antlers, etc.) and his persona of a real-life Warner Bros. cartoon hybrid of Buster Keaton slapstick, Gene Kelly finesse and Bruce Lee lethal ass-kickings are put to the test with aplomb. Much could be said the same for the low-key, assured knuckleheaded insouciance of Wilson (who will always be to me, Dignan from his debut in `Bottle Rocket') who manages to blend his dumb/cocky likeability to a genuine comradarie with Chan in looking out for his sudden partner's greenhorn status.The action sequences are fast but not furious, always on the border of a Three Stooges act gone awry, and the teaming of the odd couple a key factor to make up for some of the film's familiarity (with occasional spurts of originality including a villain's offing an opponent with a cinematic first, wielding an oyster shell to the jugular: death by bi-valve (!) and the use of spontaneous urine to escape from jail; don't ask, just trust me on this!) Chan may breathe some fresh air into his long, weary career as a daredevil action star insisting on doing his own stunts even if it means breaking a funny bone in the process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]Our story opens in Forbidden City, China, 1881. Princess Pei Pei has been kidnapped and ransomed for 100,000 pieces of gold. The royal translator and three Imperial guards would accompany him to Carson City, Nevada to deliver the ransom. The translator wanted to bring along his nephew, clumsy guard Chon Wang (say it out loud). The train trip to Carson City was cut short when a band of robbers, headed by swashbuckler Roy O'Bannon, who really isn't a very good outlaw, boarded the train. He was accompanied by three other guys. One of them was Wallace, who was very, very mean. He killed Chon Wang's uncle, and later on when Wang escaped the train and found O'Bannon buried in the desert, he blamed him and left him for dead. Chon Wang's travels took him to an Indian camp where he inadvertantly got married. His wife would follow him under cover. Wang met up with Roy again in a saloon in town. A fight ensuses. Wang has the fastest hands the old west has ever seen, but unfortunately he, along with Roy, were thrown in jail. They escaper curtosy of Wang's wife. Roy agrees to accompany Wang to Carson City, but first teaches him the basics of being a cowboy; Princess Pei Pei was being held hostage by Lo Fong, a former guard turned traitor.After escaping a lynching, Wang and Roy rescue the princess and hide out at an old church. Meeting them there were the other three guards, Lo Fong, and Marshall Van Cleef, a psychotic killer. He's been after Roy for years. Wang took out Lo Fong with flying colors and Roy put an end to Van Cleef's evil ways. Then, Roy's old "friends" including Wallace show up but they're taken care of. In the end, Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon are made lawmen; a very good movie. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson are great together. If you liked Rush Hour, you'll love this movie! I hear there's a sequel, Shanghai Knights, opening soon. I'll bet it will be just as good as Shanghai Noon. If you're a Jackie Chan fan, I recommend films like Rush Hour I &amp; II, Twin Dragons, he was even in Enter the Dragon, which, sadly, was Bruce Lee's last film, but I'll bet Bruce would be proud of Jackie today. Owen Wilson fans, I suggest Meet the Parents, Zoolander, he's even in The Cable Guy a little. So what are you waiting for, partners, check out Shanghai Noon today!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very much *unlike* Rush Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone seems to agree that Shanghai Noon has a lot in common with Rush Hour. Jackie Chan arrives in a country that is alien to him, to rescue a young princess (close enough...), and is shown around by a local American whose every moves are the exact opposite of Chan's.Well, Rush Hour was the first Jackie Chan movie I saw, and I loved it so much that I was really sad not to have known his movies before. Then I saw Shanghai Noon and hated it.What I thought about Rush Hour after seeing it was that the movie seemed to have been made for fun, and by that I mean the actors' and crew's fun. It seemed the movie had been made without trying to convey this or that emotion, but for the mere fun of doing it. On the other hand, Shanghai Noon seems to be the result of a precise market study, like if the average viewer's tastes had been analysed and the movie made to fulfil those tastes. Example: There seemed to be someone that decided there should be a native American girl in the plot. But then, nobody could put her to a good use so she just made guest appearances throughout the movie with no good reason.The plot was jumping around and full of useless inclusions, the scenes with the native Americans were trying, the bad guys didn't have any depth, the fights, although wonderfully choreographed, lacked some fun (remember the vase scene at the end of Rush Hour?) and it seemed even Chan was tired of his role.Last but not least, Owen Wilson was far from reaching the wonderful contrast between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker...All in all, this movie was a great disappointment. Now I have to see Chan's old movies to make an opinion for myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great premise. The old west meets the chop-socki east. Stick a martial artist in the old west and watch the sparks fly and the hilarity that ensues. That is the idea but the idea falls flat. Shanghai Noon is not funny. It is not even a great kung fu film. Usually Jackie Chan films are fun at the very least. Even something like Rumble In The Bronx, a film that has very little story to it, was entertaining because of Chan and his incredible wizardry in the art of fighting. But in this film I was not only not entertained, I was bored with the prosaic effort. Compared to most of Chan's other films this is a squalid pastiche of every western that has gone bad. It's like the producers of this film went through Sergio Leone, John Ford and Clint Eastwood's trash from years gone by and took all the discarded material and meshed it all together and Shanghai Noon is the result.I guess I was expecting more in Chan's martial arts. In many of his films he dazzles the audience with his ballet looking moves and his verve to entertain. In this film, he looks tired and old. I didn't get the feeling that he was into what he was doing. And that does not bode well for the film.I guess I could go on and on and berate the film for a few more paragraphs but that is almost pointless. Being as ardent towards the film as I am, I just want to forget that I saw it and move on. I must admit however, most people that have seen this film enjoyed it and I am in the minority here. But I just don't see it. It felt lazy and not on par with Chan's other previous efforts. But see it for yourself and judge for yourself.It's too bad though, I had high hopes for this film and after seeing a disappointing MI2 on the same weekend, I had hoped one of the big movies would live up to the reputation which has followed it around. But no such luck. I guess I will have to go see Gladiator for the fifth time or maybe Road Trip for the third. Seeing a repeat showing of these two films would still be more entertaining that the other two. And that is a shame.2 out of 10. A very lame film with few laughs and even fewer great poetic martial arts scenes. A huge disappointment.</fullReview>

This isn't as good as it could of have been, although if they'd changed the bad bit then the film wouldn't have worked as well. As usual the choreography is amazing, and Owen Wilson does a great Roy O'Bannon. Owen usually works with Ben "Zoolander" Stiller, but this shows that he can blend just as well with any other actor. Jackie Chan doesn't have this problem, as he never works with the same people for long periods of films. Altogether this film does live up to it's standards as well as it being quite a bit better than it's sequel. As the acting and storyline are both very good, I would give this 4 stars.</fullReview>

I don't think it is even worth mentioning that both the editing and cinematography were at times startlingly bad, or that the plot line (which is full of holes) was completely predictable and stupid. These things we would of course expect. The so called humor is also bad. Virtually every joke in this film is recycled. I've seen them all used (better) before. Also, the writing for this movie is soooo bad. Laughably so. (Yes, I did laugh a few times during this, but it was only when I couldn't believe just how bad it was). The writer must think very lowly of his audience. Not only are his characters completely implausible, saying and doing stupid things, but at times the film is completely irrational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New definition for "funny"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Jackie Chan has stopped making good movies after the Super-Cop series. From Drunken Master II and on, and that was like six to seven years ago, his movies have had zero plot, and have been action sequences strung together on the flimsiest pretense of a story. This movie proved to be no exception.To sum it up, this movie is a tool for exploiting the ignorance of westerners of the East, and vice versa, to make money. Raised Chinese, I can spot the errors in the film miles away. Since when was the huge courtyard of the Forbidden City used for regular martial exercises? It is a palace, for crying out loud. And did the film makers think no Chinese in those days were smart enough to know "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"? Going around the West in imperial Chinese uniform is, to say the least, conspicuous. And how far would one get in the States dressed that way in the late 1800's? Not very far, I suspect.But if I were able to suspend my disbelief for so long as to believe all that happened in the film were possible, there is still the matter of the following: the entire film is based on racial/ethnic stereotypes, and most of the humour derived from that. What age do we live in, people? Those were funny back in the 50's and 60's. But in Year 2000? The fact that the film is doing not so badly makes me shake my head at the implications on societies, both Western and Asian, at large.My advice to Chan is this: either do like John Woo, and make Hollywood style films better than the Hollywood people and wow them, or stay at home like many other Chinese film makers, and make Chinese/Hong Kong films that are authentic and true to oneself. Not this sell-out "let's make a total fool of myself and sell tickets" garbage.</fullReview>

If you like silly comedies with a lot of physical humor, maybe this movie is for you. This movie was so badly put together that it could hardly be considered a movie. People fight for no reason. At the end two people who should be helping each other fight the "Bad" guys end up fighting each other so they can have more fighting scenes. The indian girl is there for no reason except to bail Jackie out of the silly predicaments he gets into. She doesn't appear except to do this. If this movie was just a collection of Jackie fight scenes it would be okay, but it gives out the pretense of being a real movie with a plot.This movie uses every stereotype of the wild west, and the far east as seen by the west.I might be considered humorless but I am not a big fan of the 3 stooges meet kung fu. For those of you who are into pie throwing humor, this might be the movie for you. For those of us over 15 (mentally) give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackie Can turns a movie with potential into a confused, whimsical parody. ** (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SHANGHAI NOON / (2000) ** (out of four) Ever question why movie theaters do not have clocks in them? I think I just found out the reason why, and it is Tom Dey's new production called "Shanghai Noon," an action comedy that uses routines of the road movie, the buddy comedy, slapstick parody, and probably more. The theater owners do not want audiences to realize how much time of their lives they are wasting away watching a movie as horrible as this piece of junk. You know a film is bad when you keep looking at your watch throughout its running time; you know a film is even worse when you keep looking for a watch throughout its running time, even though you know you are wearing no such time device. "Shanghai Noon" placed me in that vary situation. Jackie Chan is one of the most bewildering actors in business right now; I feel depressed that other countries will be subject to his film's, which come from the same beautiful United States I proudly live in today. In "Shanghai Noon" he once again practices his peripheral bad-taste character sketch, this time portraying an Imperial Guard named Chon Wang during 1881 in China's Forbidden City. Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) has been kidnapped by her American tutor, Calvin Andrews (Jason Connery), who is working for an ex-Imperial Guard named Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), who demands a hefty ransom paid for her release.  To the amazement of nobody in the audience, Chon Wang is chosen to recruit the princess home. During the journey, he runs into a group of outlaws led by Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), who eventually becomes his partner and friend. He also meets Marshall Nathan Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), who is determined to capture and or kill Roy.  For the first time that I can remember in a movie featuring Jackie Chan, excluding the involving "Rush Hour," the story is acute. Although the setup is a little displeasing, the movie depicts events that construct a potentially strong narrative plot line. Unfortunately, this is Jackie Chan we are talking about, and it is his martial arts comic action that turns a somewhat fortunate story into a zany, nonsensical western action picture without direction. Nothing much occurs during the film's second act. Wang and O'Bannon make attempts to rescue the princess but only place themselves in greater danger every time. The entire middle of this movie is one unfunny comic situation after another, which would not be all that bad if the comedy was actually funny, but it is not. I never once laughed, or even cracked a smile, with the movie's desperate, contrived whimsical endeavors.  Another flaw in "Shanghai Noon" is the complete lack of character development. We never learn anything personal about the characters; they are all one-dimensional, shallow plot puppets. I was not interested in the story simply because I did not care in the least about the characters. Since the entire movie is based on Princess Pei Pei being in danger, the lack of concern for the people on screen is a serious conflict. "Shanghai Noon" is a good looking production; the film captures the eighteenth century with a believable and contemporary historical feeling and an atmosphere that is both scenically sweeping and visually enticing. Director Tom Dey captures the old west through suitable performers in nifty costume and set designs. The film's energetic appearance and swift action scenes make it even more of a catastrophe that this production is as awful as it is.  The film goes on and on in a seemingly measureless agony of non-stop ridiculousness; "Shanghai Noon" has no sense, no purpose, and no intelligence. If there were clocks in movie theaters, this would be one of the occasions in which staring at the hour hand would be more intriguing than participating in the movie itself. In a way the movie insults American audiences by making a movie this bad; they must have the idea that people have absolutely nothing better to do and have no life, because that is the only legitimate reason one would have for seeing "Shanghai Noon". </fullReview>
