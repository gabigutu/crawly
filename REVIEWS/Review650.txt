		<fullReview>I don't understand why this movie was booed at the Cannes Film Festival. This is a beautiful story. It is a story in which we learn so many lessons about life's most difficult moments and how one can find the courage to survive. Excellent acting and beautiful script. The cinematography is beautiful.An American man, Arthur Brennan, played by Matthew McConaughey travels to the "Suicide Forest" (Aokigahara forest) to kill himself at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, the site of numerous suicides. There he encounters a Japanese man, Takumi Nakamura, played by Ken Watanabe, who wants to kill himself as well, and both men begin a journey of self- reflection and survival.But more than the suicide theme, there is the story of Arthur Brennan and his relationship with his wife, Joan, played by Naomi Watts, which is told to the viewer with a series of flashbacks. The core problems that exist in so many marriages are brought to the surface and examined during the unfolding of the story. It is a stark reminder of how easily we sometimes let love and relationships deteriorate when we don't have to. Thinking we will one day have time to fix the problem. Beautiful story and excellent acting from all. I loved this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the critics. This film is worth the watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so the critics panned this film as boring and lack luster with some very harsh comments, but my curiosity was sparked by the unusual plot so I gave it a go. Ten minutes into the film, I was near ready to give up on it and agree with it detractors, as it was very slow moving at the start, however, as the story developed I became interested in the 'why' and committed myself to discover the answers. Matthew McConaughey offers a very good performance as does Ken Watanabe, both of whom demonstrate their desperation, frustration and hopefulness with convincing commitment. Naomi Watts completes the group of well matched, well directed talent. I found the cinematography to be excellent as well. I did figure out the plot twist before it was revealed, but the way the director exposed it, I thought, was quite brilliant, and, just when I thought the film was over, we are presented with still another surprise that actually made me smile. All and all, Sea of Trees delivered as both entertainment and a moral study from which every observer can benefit. I enjoyed it, and, given a chance, I think most views will as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it in a sneak preview screening.After seeing the horrible "The Forest" i was a bit reluctant to see another movie about the suicide forest, but was surprised that this movie deals with different themes.I watched the movie because i wanted to watch a movie, and in that i found a lot of enjoyment. The movie had some good pacing and it deals with basically a present and past storyline entwined and both are interesting enough to have you go "no wait, i want to know how it continues" with every switch.The acting was good, the story was perhaps a bit on the "cliché" side near the end, but in all satisfying. I have to mention the cinematography, because there are some beautiful shots in there, sometimes it felt so strange when shots where done without a steady cam but in ends up feeling more "organic" in the end.So if you want to watch a nice story driven film, give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthew McConaughey does a great job in the most generic story of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew McConaughey is Arthur Brennan a man who comes to a famous forest in Japan for suicide to do so himself. His perception is changed when he meets a man named Takumi Nakamura played by Ken Watanabe who needs his help getting out of the forest.The movie starts off as a culture clash between the American and the Japanese as they discuss their reasons for being in the forest. We see through flashbacks that for Arthur it has to do with his wife, Joan, played by Naomi Watts and for Takumi it's because of a demotion that will affect him tending to his family. The start of the culture clash goes over my head as neither one of them has given me a good case for ending their life. Then the film hits us with the spiritual differences between cultures, and the whole monologue becomes lame in its predictability.However, the chemistry between McConaughey and Watanabe is good enough to keep me attracted to what I see on screen, but not as effective as what McConaughey was doing with Watts. Their back and forth as a married couple on shaky ground could not have been more formulated, but it was more about the acting, which made the generic really natural, raw and life like. From the Awkward moments they share while having dinner with their friends, to the way Joan disrespects what Arthur does for a living, I am swept up in the belief that they are a real couple. Overall, McConaughey had two really good dance partners for this machine he's running. At the same time, he was given some great solo moments to shine bright like a diamond. Adding to the brilliant acting, director Gus Van Sant creates a very spiritual environment used to explore life and death and everything in-between. It was ghostly and haunting as well. The imagery may have been subtle but it captures its beauty nicely, and the music composed complements the environment so well. Very captivating. The Sea of Trees biggest fail point, and it is a big one, is the narrative is so formatted, I felt like a fortune teller looking into a crystal ball. As touching as the performances were and what top notch film crafting I see, I cannot get past how unoriginal this story line is. In their attempts at laying out the darkness of life, how the ups only go so high, but the downs can go really low, they created a pathway that a viewer could go through blindfolded. No surprises and no originality. In the end, The Sea of Tress is a decent small vehicle for Matthew McConaughey to drive, showing off his acting chops behind the wheel as a lead actor, but I've seen him do just as good of a job in far better small vehicles.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the movie is underrated. I know it is not one of the best movies that anyone should watch,but it is not that awful. A great crew in this movie. The script is not that good.The movie will really touches u.The drama was good. A good experience for anyone. there is no doubt that Matthew did a great job at this movie, but he should take care of his coming movies. I compare between his role in this movie and mud. I think the difference can not be noticed. The same of his voice at both movies. overall the whole cast and the movie is very good for me. I recommend the lovers of drama to watch this movie especially the psycho movie lovers. do not be so harsh on Matthew. Each actor need a variety.It is a good one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let unjustified bad reviews stop you from seeing this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was truly well done, all three main characters were real. Regret, guilt, love buried in a challenging relationship. A soul journey that couldn't have been told any better. Matthew McC. had me in tears which really only rarely happens. He got me all through. The film led you step by step towards the whole, you could follow each revelation, lesson of Arthur's journey as if you were with him, there. An atypical Gus Van Sant Film sure. BUT he was able to capture the fine in between the lines way of the Japanese culture which talks in symbols more than direct expression, in a beautiful and still GVS-creepy surprising different way. Go see it if you had regret in your life, you won't regret it ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The See of Trees - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I wanted to see a film so badly just to see what all the bad reception was about. For what was my most anticipated movie of 2015 to suddenly get forgotten after one screening at a festival, which that alone is bad sigh that your movie is bad. I loved "Elephant" and I couldn't wait to see this, but my heart sank after seeing the bad press the film got from the Cannes screening. Even reading the bad reviews I still couldn't get a gasp of how this turned out bad and it only made me want to see the movie even more.And I finally got a chance to watch it and while I don't think it's as awful as people have said, but this is unfortunately a messy film that could have easily been good. If only it was in the right hands.I remember a time when I couldn't stand McConaughey, but he really has proved himself as an actor that it eventually did win me over. And in this movie I would say that McConaughey did a decent performance and in the scenes where the character is having a breakdown I thought he was pretty good. Unfortunately it wasn't a great performance and that's because there was plenty of times where I found myself laughing at the wrong moments. There's a scene in this movie where McConaughey character falls over and lands straight down onto his face, and the sound of him in pain was so weird but laughable at the same time. I can't believe Gus Van Sant looked at that scene and thought it was good. Like, Come on Gus.Gus Van Sant has made many movies that I liked and some that I consider misfires. But I personally think that this is Gus Van Sant biggest misfire, because there's nothing special in the film making and a lot of things felt like it was missing something. It lacks detail and there's so many things in this that I felt was a miss opportunity of being great. And the cheap flashback scenes really do drag this out and wasn't that interesting that I kinda zoned out every time it cuts back. It would have been great if there was a little bit of Mystery to McConaughey character of why he's there and what is he's motivations to bring himself to do this and drop little hints to get us thinking. But instead we get lazy flashback scenes with him and his wife (played by Naomi Watts) that makes it very clear straight away of what he's motivation are for ending he's life, because it's that predictable.This movie is so predictable that I saw a lot of things coming. Like if a scene seems a bit too happy (for a depressing movie like this), you know something bad is going to happen and of course something bad happens. This really hurts the movie in terms of the emotional elements, because when there's tragic or emotional happening, I'm not really feeling it as I saw it coming miles away.For a premise like this, that involves two suicidal people lost deep in the Forrest that's known for people going there to take their own lives, should at least been interesting. It should have a took a risk by asking unique and challenging questions that would make you think.What really makes us so alive?OrWhat's the reason to stay alive?It should have challenge you as an audience member and while some may disagree with it, at least it gets you talking.Overall rating: The Sea of Trees was dull, empty and a massive disappointment. But hey, at least I finally know why this was panned by critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth and redemption wrapped in shades of darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a movie with a story that has depth and meaning - not just grotty realism or flights of fantasy, no matter how speculative, without a shred of truth.I really enjoyed the performances as these kind of characters wouldn't be easy to portray, yet they were convincing, engaging - even masterful. Matthew was fantastic in his role. He portrayed a deeply depressed man for most of it, so everything had to be delivered in a lack-lustre, listless manner. However, the high energy, dramatic turns are usually the ones most honoured. I enjoyed the story as although there were shades of darkness there were also glimmers of light and hope and beauty. Guilt can be one of the most negative emotions, stealing hope and joy. But it's as pointless as all the other negatives. I like how the MC found his redemption through helping someone else find the right path. The same can be true for everyone.The pacing might be a little slow, but the movie had a lot to say and show. Speaking of showing, the cinematography was beautiful. And the music added just the right kind of emotion and tone, sometimes lifting the sombre tone of the story by hinting there is always hope and help if we know where to look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sea of Trees is an excellent movie with a very original script. In my opinion the negative reviews regarding this movie are not representative. I loved this movie and did not make me feel bored for a single moment. It a fusion of adventure, drama, romance, fantasy all in one perfect package. Matthew McConaughey and Naomi Watts are really convincing and realistic in this movie, a perfect match. The director has done quite a job. Striking scenery and moving the plot back and forth to keep you in suspense all the time. I would enjoy seeing this film again and would recommend it to viewers with good taste to sit back and enjoy it. After watching this movie you keep it in your mind and consider the precious value of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I broke my golden rule before watching this film and read the reviews. Despite the bad vibes that the majority of reviews give out about this piece I decided to still watch and I'm glad I did.This is a story of a broken relationship that is on the verge of being fixed until cruel fate takes that opportunity away and the consequences and realisations that it holds for one man.Put simply, a guy is unfaithful in the early years of his marriage. His wife will not forgive him and there follows years of awkward relationship after she turns to alcohol but the marriage survives. She is then taken seriously ill and the things that should have happened early in the relationship start to come together just as she is cruelly taken away. The guy is devastated and contemplates suicide, heading to the forest in the foothills of Mt Fuji renowned as a beautiful place to die and it is here that he discovers those things that he never knew about his wife. I am not a great believer in things spiritual but this piece uses spirituality to great effect. The three things that he tells the funeral director, things that he never knew about this wife are answered by the experiences he has in the forest.He thinks he needs somewhere to die when, in fact, he is looking for a reason to live.A thought provoking piece, the only down point for me is that I predicted how the wife would die 5 mins before it happened, you just know that something out of the blue and cruel is going to happen. Disregard the nay sayers, this is a good piece of work worthy of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One should know about Symbols before watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no idea what kind of movie i was watching, maybe i Just decided to watch it because of Matthew Mcconaughey playing in it but then it got me. I knew about C.G. Yung and Joseph Campbell's method of analyzing symbols and mythology and however at the beginning I did not realize it and even thought it might be a horror movie but then slowly by slowly it opened to me like if you see some one and they look familiar but you don't know how you know them and then that aha moment comes. After that I enjoyed every moment of the movie and could not stop thinking about it for some time. I have to be fair though and admit that the flash backs could get a bit boring sometimes but I think it is just because the situation the couples were in was boring and nerve racking any way so in the movie they could not change it.it is how it is.At the end I'd say its a clean, honest and truthful story without lies or exaggerations. the acts are great the scenes are well chosen and effective and well again if you know a bit about symbols you might learn something out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence instead. A lame exploration of deep issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry this review is poorly written. I'll try to clean it up later.My God, the patience you would have to have to watch this movie and like it. The pace is slower and more painful than a cat playing a mouse to death. It is not, like some bad movies I've seen incoherent from end to end. I mean the story is consistent with its atmosphere. So if one takes out the agonizingly boring beginning, its not terrible, but its barely OK. A couple of men face the stereotypical male demons of shame, guilt, "achievement," and the burden of women. They consider suicide but end up confronting their ghosts, demons, etc...through the judging and questioning of the other. In a sacred brotherhood of overcoming, the two struggle together, yada yada yada. Don't get me wrong, the themes are important ones. And some of the clichés should be repeated because they matter. But the story and script was not compelling. It was during the flashback that I remembers Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. It also used flashbacks of regrets and shame, male bonding, sacrifice and sentiment. It even also uses song to bond the men. MCML, however, had some really original aspects. it also considered their sexual issues, issues of war, morality and mortality. Of course MCML lacks the symbolism of the suicide forest, but it touches on other symbols, both creatively and profoundly. Admittedly, MCML is tortuous and less coherent. You have to make sense of it, and its not fed to you. But it is interesting, whereas this was just not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the trees. They'll be more interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I lived near Aokigahara when I taught at a private institution on Mt. Fuji. One day my friend and I hiked into it hoping to find adventure. We found no dead bodies, no skeletons, no signs of any humans having been there, and our compasses worked fine. Basically, it is an area of lava tubes, some partially collapsed leaving numerous holes of a variety of sizes. Our conclusion was that amateur hikers probably stepped in a hole and broke their legs and couldn't get out. It is geographically confusing as one tube looks more or less like another, but the place is not far from a highway and it would be nearly impossible to get lost there despite what the movie may make you believe.Oh, yeah, the movie. Despite a rather good cast, the film simply falls flat. The actors basically go through the motions to pick up their paychecks. The best, or a least most believable, part is the relationship between the Matthew McConaughey character and his wife, played by Naomi Watts, and even that is inconsistent. It's a movie that tries to bring up deep themes but falls short. The adding of spiritual and religious elements just muddies the water even further. The movie suffers from the worst fate that can afflict a movie that attains to be philosophic - some parts are absolutely laughable.I'm not sure I really cared about what happened to any of the characters. There was never any angst built by the plot and you will not be sitting on the edge of your seat. In fact, you'll miss nothing if you do the laundry while the film is playing. If this was a ploy for the local area to stimulate suicide tourism, it probably failed, though suicidal thoughts may have crossed the minds of some who were forced to watch the movie to its conclusion.Although some scenes may produce unintentional humor, I would not recommend watching it. Too bad, because there really could be a good movie built around the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not the film Aokigahara deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought Gus van Sant would be more suited to make an interesting picture about the phenomenon of the Japanese suicide forest Aokigahara than the creators of the recent bland horror movie The Forest would, you thought wrong. Say what you will about The Forest, it had no other pretensions than being an average spooky flick (except maybe for the 'average' part, but then they should have tried harder). The Sea of Trees, not so. It's a bold potpourri of supernatural thrills, Japanese versus Western belief systems, tear jerking drama and philosophical reflections on the nature of suicide. At least, it likes to be. It sadly fails in every respect, making this a prime candidate for the title of 'Worst Gus van Sant Movie'.The ingredients for a terrific movie are all there. There's a haunting mystery (a forest where people voluntarily come to kill themselves), a shot at emotionally compelling drama (a husband and wife not getting along but coming together over the latter's impending demise), some damn fine actors (McConaughey, Watanabe, Watts, need I say more?) and lots of wonderful cinematography. The movie only succeeds in offering that last bit to our satisfaction. Whether it's the director or the screenwriter who couldn't be bothered with stringing it all together seamlessly into an intriguing whole is hard to tell. It's certainly not the actors, as all of them appear bored or distracted. In Watanabe's case, matters are made worse due to him apparently having been hired as Hollywood's token Japanese man for this occasion, making him rant on about Japanese superstition ad nauseam. We simply can't learn to care about either him or his American companion, who set out to kill himself but had a change of heart in his desire to help his new local friend get home alive. It's seemingly enough of a motivation after the devastating death of his wife to make him find new faith in life and forget all about his suicidal plans, but not for us to go along with his new lust for living.We simply cannot care about it all, which also stems from Van Sant's odd choice of going nigh 'full Hollywood' in his dramatic scenes set in the States. Usually he opts for what many consider a more European style, but in this scenario, studio tear jerking methods got his preference. And so we have to sit through dull and ultimately predictable flashbacks explaining the protagonist's desire to end his life, even though, illogically, he and his wife never really got along anyway. The scenes in the forest, meanwhile, offer little more captivating moments or surprising twists. Admirably shot and lit as they may be (though much of it not actually filmed in Japan, but rather Stateside) and accompanied for the most part by decently melancholy music, we still grow restless over the lack of empathy triggered at our side of things. It's not so bad that it makes us want to kill ourselves, but it's still frighteningly frustrating to come to realize that a director who often has something worthwhile to share with his audience, really has absolutely nothing noteworthy to say about a fascinating topic of conversation as the so-called Sea of Trees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All aboard the guilt train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost fell asleep during the movie, it's so slow. Had high expectations, as the movie is about the all mythical..majestic Aokigahara, and a guilt trip taken there by a grieving Spouse which is directed by Gus Van Sant. Didn't live up to it, at least for me. Although, both Matthew McConuaghey and Ken Watanabe were both quite well in their roles, Naomi Watts was okay too. It falls apart in pacing and editing mostly. Basically the plot is about a married couple who has their ups and downs in their marriage, and suddenly the wife gets terminally ill. Struck with grief, the husband finds a perfect place to die, which is the "Sea of Trees" or Aokigaraha forest. While in there, he finds another grieving and lost fellow, and befriends him..who eventually shows the husband, the light. In those moments while the both guys travel through the forest and look for a way out, the husband deals with his grief, and lots of guilt from his life and marriage, and finds solace in the company of his fellow lost man.It was pretty darn slow, but the cinematography was good. Some nice and beautiful camera-work and shots. Music was okay. Could get an Oscar nomination or two, particularly in the Cinematography section. Acting wise, Matthew was nowhere near his best, from the likes of Mud or Dallas Buyers Club. I think he had a better performance in Interstellar. Nonetheless, wasn't bad either. He has the exact same crying scene from Interstellar in this movie at one point.Some might like it, some might not. I found it okay-ish. Not the best from Gus Van Sant, as I think, this movie didn't do justice to the majestic forest we know as Aokigahara, and it's story as the "Suicide Forest". See it and decide for yourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A more or less not define film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-The Sea of Trees is a 2015 American drama mystery film directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Chris Sparling. The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Ken Watanabe, Naomi Watts, Katie Aselton, and Jordan Gavaris.-The film is about an American man who attempts suicide in Mount Fuji's "Suicide Forest", where he meets a Japanese man who is there for the same reason. Principal photography began on July 28, 2014, in Foxborough, Massachusetts; the production moved to Japan in September of the same year. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. The Sea of Trees will be released in France on April 27, in Italy on April 28 and in Japan on April 29, 2016. In Greece, the film will be released on May 1 and in the Netherlands on May 12, 2016.--Reception: -The Sea of Trees was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 0%, based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 2.4/10. At its May 2015 debut at the Cannes Film Festival, the film was met with harsh critical reception; it was loudly booed and laughed at by an audience of critics, with critic Scott Foundas calling it a film "for nobody." Some critics were more impressed by the film; Pete Hammond wrote "Their film deserves a better fate" and he praised its "paired sentimentality." While Hammond was also impressed with the "beautiful lush score", others found it "cloying" and "ever-present." -Further critical dissatisfaction with the film has been attributed to the fact that "the twists and turns of this narrative fail to ring true with too many implausibilities in the plotting to give any credibility" and with its "complete lack of narrative momentum, it all adds up to a film that's easily Van Sant's worst, and is a sad black mark on McConaughey's mostly excellent recent run. Ultimately, "Sea of Trees" feels like an entirely appropriate title: it makes you feel like you're drowning, and it's full of sap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was lucky to see this via press.It's a good movie. The acting is as expected by the actors and the cinematography is decent. Some weird cutting and editing, and the music could be better. It's sort of just there. It doesn't really seem to be incorporated with what's showing on the screen. But I have to give credit to the writer(s). It's an interesting story about a grizzly yet fascinating place. I would however, put more focus on the relationship between the "souls" there and the past of the professor. As far as theme goes, there really isn't any. It's too weird of a setting to really have a meaning worth remembering. But as entertainment it's a good movie. Some very beautiful shots. If you're looking for a good movie starring your favorite actor, this is not it. But, if you're looking for an interesting movie you probably wouldn't watch, this is it. It's not a waste of time watching, but it won't be re watched. It's a been there done that movie. Good quality and concept, but a bit too poorly of an end result. But I'm still glad I saw it.</fullReview>

Lets throw it all together before the summer and take it to Cannes! Everyone that saw Age of Ultron must be waiting to read news of Cannes! When was Cannes relevant last? 1999? Palm de Ore? Serious? The Coen Brothers are judging this year; don't take it serious this year yet again. After all they were paid off to write the God awful Angelina film; gags.Sea of Trees; terrible script, a bunch of just won or washed up actors. Did Terry Mallick direct? Oh, no, he didn't. I guess they were hoping based on the title and rubbish script or trailer to yet be released we'd just fall in love a la a lot of other Matthew films and say oh yea, I saw the trailer it looked great I gave it an 9.Uh, no.Fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another deep cerebral of Gus Van Sant that was very slow and not that entertaining that can be very slow and it was for me and many others. With all these foreign movies I am at least getting used to subtitles. They don't annoy me as much as much as they used to. Because I was seeing a lot of horror movies, many of them B-Pictures, I thought that this might be considered one of them. Well this might be considered Van Sant's Horror. Well it isn't horror for me but with that title "The Sea of Trees", it might have been considered it. Well it isn't for me. It seems to be about a group of people that annoy others. Of course Matthew McConaughey a favorite actor of Van Sant's is in this picture who plays the main character. Only for die-hard fans of Gus Van Sant but not particularly anybody else.</fullReview>
