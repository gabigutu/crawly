		<shortDescription>Macho naturalism extraordinaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.This is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you've ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.Yves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.This is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There's a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.Henri-Georges Clouzet directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930's. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzet's direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.Clouzet's wife, Vera Clouzet, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.No student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. "La salaire de la peur" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, "The Duel", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a true masterpiece in every way! When I rented the DVD and read the story it sounded familiar, because I had watched the newer version before in color with Roy Scheider, which was good as well. But watching the original film truly blew me away. This movie is well made in every detail. It puts a lot of detail-work in the creation of the characters, and once you think that is over and the "regular action-part" starts, it becomes even better and the story takes a 90 degree turn! After I had finished watching the entire movie, I needed at least 5 minutes just to "digest" it and rethink this fantastic film. If you got a chance to watch it, don't miss it! It is entertaining from the first to the last minute!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A completely novel plot. Happened upon this on late night TV about 10 years ago. Thought I had seen all the best of the classics and then this came on. "Where have you been all my life?" was the overwhelming question. What an incredibly beautiful and stark movie at the same time. Absolutely unprecedented. Everything about it--especially the cinematography (check out the scene with the turnabout for the trucks) is superior. If you care about plot, allegory, intelligent directing and acting, this is one which is second to none. Nitroglycerine being transported across the Venezuelan countryside. . .who comes up with this stuff? The remake (Sorcerer) is decent, but doesn't even come close. Outstanding flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wages of Fear Vs. Sorcerer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, by Henri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by William Friedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, the earlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so. Although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate and the various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to the South American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-risking jobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES... distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience more rooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, with charismatic leads in Yves Montand (WAGES...) and Roy Scheider (SORCERER), plus WAGES... also provides feminine charm in the form of beguiling Vera Clouzot as the café waitress who loves Montand. Both films have tense action sequences as well, but somehow for all the staging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangely slow, slogging along in the mud just like the protagonists in their less-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough good things in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time and resources to check out one of them, it's WAGES... that really pays off!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unforgettable bit of existentialism on exposed celluloid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (Méli?s, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Le salaire de la peur" is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70's, 80's and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries' loads, it has hardly been surpassed.The plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film's deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn't go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel's character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.Apart from that, Clouzot's wife Véra (also well-known from his "Les diaboliques") plays to the "most breathtaking angles" gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno's gin joint. It's a man's world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it's existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in "Salaire" (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping action film and a powerful study of failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wages of Fear" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at 1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of which were made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Bu?uel. Cluozot's own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because "if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them". Henri-Georges Clouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of film that instantly announces that it's the best of its kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, "Les Diabolique" - which is saying a lot. I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded. Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.One charge that hangs over his head is misogyny. With regards to "Les Diabolique" this is simply ridiculous; with regards to "The Wages of Fear", I can see how one could harbour the uncomfortable feeling that there is, perhaps, something in it. But what, really, does the evidence amount to? The fact that one of the heroes is inexcusably cruel to his girlfriend? It's not as if the film endorses this, or invites us to take pleasure in it, or even, for that matter, allows us to. The characters are all flawed, and the film doesn't seek to deny it. It does, however, make an attempt to explain it. That town in the middle of nowhere is, we feel, really in the MIDDLE of nowhere; it must be the dustiest and most demoralising place on Earth. After a while we feel as if we could start kicking someone, just to break the monotony.There's no doubt that the initial monotony gives the rest of the film half its strength. William Wyler once said that if you want to surprise or shock an audience the best thing you can do is bore them half to death beforehand - and although I can think of absolutely no reason why this should be so, allowing for a little exaggeration, it's true. The seemingly aimless opening sequences help make every single frame, from the moment the nitro-glycerin is mentioned, electric.So much is, in retrospect, amazing. There's the way Clouzot manages to show us the humanity in these seemingly squalid people. (Even the oil magnate, just when we think he's the world's most heartless capitalist, reveals he has a heart with an unexpected remark, and yet the remark doesn't feel at all out of character - it's the kind of masterful characterisation film-goers live for.) Then there's the obstacles these drivers must face. All are memorable; most are so perfectly realised they deserve to be called mythic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant thriller. One of the most suspenseful and exciting movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, 'Les Diaboliques' and 'The Wages Of Fear', both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension. Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. 'The Wages Of Fear' could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that's what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make 'Wages Of Fear' a truly unforgettable experience. Suspense movies don't come much better than this! Simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting and Involving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening scene of Wages of Fear (1953), director Georges Henri-Clouzot provides an inkling of the kind of claustrophobic ride we are in for. In a steamy, impoverished Latin American town called Las Piedras, insects grope clumsily in the dust, struggling to escape the strings that children have tied to them. People from all over the world congregate in the streets and bars and the air is thick with choking dust. Clouzot makes clear the desperation of the residents, "It's like prison," explains one of them. "Easy to get in, but escape is impossible." The Southern Oil Company (SOC - same initials as Standard Oil) runs the town and enjoys its profits while the villagers are compelled to work odd jobs just to stay alive. After a fire breaks out at one of the oil fields killing many workers, the anti-union American boss seeks experienced drivers from among the townspeople to put out the fire. It is here that the anti-American flavor runs thick and where much of this part of the film was originally excised for American audiences (but has since been restored). Four men, desperate to escape their trap, agree to drive a truck loaded with nitroglycerine 300 miles over treacherous mountain roads in the hot sun for the sum of $2000 each. Transporting the nitroglycerine for them is a way out of hopelessness -- either through a big paycheck or through sudden death, with the latter appearing the more probable. Though sadly past the point in time when we can still be shocked over gangster capitalism and men selling out for money, the story is nonetheless compelling. The four who are chosen to go on this fool's errand include Mario, a young Corsican played by Yves Montand in a role that brought him widespread attention. He is carrying on an affair with a local servant girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot) who is in love with him. His treatment of her, however, is atrocious and reflects the attitude of the male-dominated society they live in. Also picked to drive one of the trucks is Jo, an aging Parisian small-time crook (Charles Vanel), Luigi (Folco Lulli), an Italian with less than a year to live, and an ex-nazi pilot (Peter van Eyck). This unlikely group will play a cat-and-mouse game with death for the remainder of the film.Clouzot depicts several incidents that bring the tension to the boiling point. In the first one, the trucks must travel at least 40 mph over a pot-holed stretch of road to prevent the vibrations from setting off the nitroglycerine. The second involves a sharp, narrow turn that requires the trucks to back up onto an unstable, rotten wooden platform causing it to buckle. Almost immediately afterwards, the trucks are stopped by a huge boulder in the middle of the road and must siphon off some of the nitroglycerine to blow it up. Finally, Mario must deftly maneuver the truck over a depression of spilled oil with the wheels stuck in reverse. As the long treacherous journey unfolds, roles are reversed between Mario and Jo as Mario becomes the strong dominant one and Jo, in Charles Vanel's brilliant performance, becomes shaken, fearful, and docile. Their relationship becomes the highlight of the film as the two become mutually dependent on each other for survival and comfort. I found Wages of Fear to be an involving experience that kept me riveted throughout, though I did sense that there would not be a two and a half-hour film unless somebody survived. Although the unexpected plot twists were gripping, the best part of the film for me was the revelation of each character when faced with fear. It reminded me of the "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", a film that also showed men discovering the truth about themselves and others while pursuing their dream of wealth. Wages of Fear lived up to its accolades, but for me the discordant ending clashed both with the tone of the film and with my experience of the universe not as arbitrary or capricious but as filled with meaning and purpose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent human thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often heard of Clouzot referred to as the 'French Hitchcock' although this film seems to share more of a cousin hood with the work of John Houston.Wages of Fear is about how a bunch of immigrants in Latin America, for money, take on the reckless task of transporting a large consignment of explosive nitroglycerin across 300-miles of obstacle-riddled paths, every moment aware that a single concussion could ignite the entire shipment, blowing them all to bits.The film begins with the setting of the locale and introduction of its principal characters - the regular irregulars Mario and Luigi (just realized the striking similarity to Nintendo's famous plumber duo, hmm), the mafioso type new entrant Jo who strikes up a friendship with the raffish Mario becoming his mentor but antagonizes the rest of the townsfolk with his bossy attitude, Mario's mistress Linda who naively worships him but is in turn kept as a pleasure item. The town is a dead-end rife with poverty and unemployment, its only industry being the Southern Oil Corporation (SOC) a Yankee enterprise. The residents are too demoralized to even consider escape to better climes. Like Mario explains to Jo in the course of a brilliantly spliced sequence of jump-cuts that covers the entire aspect of the town, "It's like prison. Easy to get in, but escape is impossible."A major fire at the oil-wells calls for immediate shipment of explosive to isolate the blaze, but it's too late to bring in the specialized transportation. The company offers a payment of $2000 each for 4 locals who will carry the hazardous shipment in ordinary trucks. Mario, Jo, Luigi and a Jew Bimba take on the job, the promise of money to help them escape from the town sufficient even to temporarily offset the fear of death. Thus begins the arduous, tension-ridden journey that occupies most of this 148-min film. The trucks must move above a certain minimum speed to minimize vibrations (a ruse reused in 1994's Speed). On the way they face various blocks including a rickety wooden bridge the trucks must back up over. Mid-journey one of the trucks blows up. Mario and Jo who are in the other truck must overcome their horror at the catastrophe and cross further hurdles including a lake of oil created by the bursting of a pipeline.In the course of the journey we see a reversal in the roles of Jo and Mario. Initially Mario looks up to Jo, in awe of his cool and worldly-wise manner. But Jo is soon revealed to be in reality a scared old man for whom Mario has only a contemptuous pity. This character drama makes for engrossing viewing and in no small measure due to the excellent performances, especially Charles Vanel as Jo.The story moves smoothly thanks to very precise cutting, and some of the nighttime photography, as also the scene at the oil lake, is worth mentioning. Clouzot obviously has a sure hand over the bulk of the proceedings although he slips up in a couple of places: The oil company is portrayed in a rather ham-fisted (and badly acted) way as this evil uncaring monolith that would gladly blame dead employees for disasters to avoid compensation and resort to thoroughly unethical means to get its job done. Most of the supporting characters are cardboard. Also, some of the miniature work is painfully obvious, although that'd be likely a limitation of technical facilities available to the crew. The ending of the film is finely executed but seems all too contrived to give you your daily dose of irony.In the end, this remains a taut and finger-licking good old-school thriller, which bothers to provide characters interesting enough for us to care about their life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Ending to Brilliant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I intend to deal explicitly with the ending of this film. Be warned.Many comments have dealt with the gradual build-up of tension and character which makes this film so riveting. They are all true. But a lot of people cannot understand the ending, and therefore condemn it. The ending is, however, integral to the meaning of the film as a whole. These four men are warned that taking this job, no matter how much it pays, will cost them their lives. We understand that they are in a situation where one mistake will cost them their lives, and only fearlessness can save them. We see that M. Jo, a bully who gets what he wants by pushing people like Luigi around, turns into a snivelling coward when faced with a couple of tons of nitro he can't bully. His fear causes him to lose others' respect, his self-respect, and eventually his life. But our hero has no fear, and so of course he must survive, right? Wrong. Fear protects us, keeps us from endangering ourselves. Without fear, our hero cannot keep himself out of danger. Therefore he dies. Stupidly. And it's his own fault.Think about what was going on in 1953; millions of people had eight years earlier come out of a situation as nail-biting as driving a truck full of nitro. They talk about the "lost generation" being the survivors of the First World War, but the same happened in the Second. The ending makes sense of the title; not only the wages of sin but the wages of fear (of having to face extreme fear, that is)is death. It is brilliant how a film which is so entertaining on a superficial level is also so deep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four unsavory down-and-outs whiling away their hours in a poverty-stricken South American village accept the fool's errand of transporting two truckloads of nitroglycerin across terrible roads to an oil company accident site. Once some preliminary character development is disposed of and the men are on their way, the movie settles into one hell of a nail-biter, sort of a French, 1950s inversion of "Speed" -- if they go too fast, or make one false move, they go up in flames.The first hour of "The Wages of Fear" is a marvel of production design. Director Clouzot packs his frame with things to look at, and the village, though built specifically for the movie, reeks of authenticity. The mise-en-scene alone is fascinating to watch -- some incidental action going on in the background of one shot (like a hothead smacking his girlfriend) is then picked up as the principal action in the next scene. And the Blu-Ray looks terrific; every mud puddle and heat-dazed fly is clear as a bell.The second half of the film is pure suspense. It's a study in male machismo and one-upsmanship. The oldest member of the group, who struts around like Mr. Big Shot in the town when he has nothing to fear, crumples like a baby when faced with the prospect of death for real. But the movie doesn't let us be disdainful of him. As he says at one point, he's scared because he has enough life experience to know what death is, unlike the young hotshots who think to be frightened is to be weak.Clouzot doesn't seem to have a rosy outlook on life, if the film's fatalistic ending is any indication. Or maybe he's just making the point that life is futile for men who approach it in a certain way."The Wages of Fear" feels way ahead of its time, both in style and substance. I had trouble believing that it was actually made in 1953.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WAGES OF FEAR (Henri-Georges Clouzot - France/Italy 1953).The first hour is devoted to introducing the characters and establishing the setting in the small poverty-ridden town of Las Piedras in an unnamed South-American country. Most of the men hang around aimlessly, waiting for an opportunity to get out of there. When an unscrupulous American oil company offers big money to drive supplies of nitro-glycerine to put out a fire in an oil-field 300 miles away, four out-of-work men (Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli and Peter Van Eyck) jump at the opportunity as a way out. The dangerous load of nitro-glycerine is to be delivered in two hulking trucks, and soon, a tense rivalry develops between the two sets of drivers, magnified by the unforgiving heat, the lure of filthy lucre and the rough and rocky roads where the slightest jolt can result in catastrophe.I am very much a devotee to many of Clouzot's other films, but with this film he never manages to get things on the right track, to get in the kind of rhythm he does so well in LE CORBEAU (1943) and LES DIABOLIQUES (1955). The set-up takes way too long, a full hour, and since Clouzot is not known for playful wit or humor, it's takes patience to get through the first half. Since most of the town's inhabitants come from all corners of the world, all the characters speak Spanish, French, Italian and English, all in various accents, which doesn't help either. Then, in the second half, the action kicks in, and we get what we paid for.The film has achieved an almost infallible reputation by now, and surprisingly, it's even in the IMDb top 100. With Clouzot at the helm, it's always worth watching, but I don't find it all that good and it didn't age very well. The main problem lies within the fact the film is constantly advertised as an action film, which it is, to a certain extent, but as far as action is concerned, the film is bound to disappoint. Perhaps it was something special in its day, but it's hardly a match for many similar films made during the '80s and '90s, that - for once - are in many ways much more effective. A relatively weak Clouzot, that should have been trimmed (the U.S. release was trimmed with 20 minutes). A bit disappointing.Camera Obscura --- 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to talk about a film that is exceptionally dark for its time then look no further than The Wages of Fear. The film follows four men in a desolate South American village who are strapped for cash and will do almost anything. They agree to transport a shipment of nitroglycerin by truck across the rugged terrain of Central America. The catch is that nitroglycerin is an extremely dangerous substance that has to be handled with extreme caution. Thus one bad bump in the road could be the end for these men. Along the way then encounter all sorts of obstacles, including each other. But they have no choice but to press on, desperate for the money that awaits them at the end of their treacherous journey.The Wages of Fear captures what true suspense is all about. The film is full of incredibly high tension scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat in stomach churning anxiety. You feel every drop of anguish the characters feel as they run into obstacle after obstacle, growing more and more tired and frustrated with their circumstances. The tension amongst the group mixed with the tension of the situations these men get themselves into makes the suspense almost unbearable but wildly exciting. This film engages its audience so fantastically. You feel a part of you amongst the action as the film draws you further and further into the riveting suspense this film delivers. I don't remember the last time I was this engaged in a film and was so anxious about what could happen. The gravity of the film is so immense as it forces its fear upon you so unapologetically powerful.But of course it gets better. Not only is The Wages of Fear an riveting suspense film, it is also an intense character study. We have four characters transporting the nitroglycerin, Mario, Jo, Luigi, Bimba. Each of the men have a unique personality and different ideas about this job. Some are desperate for the cash and will stop at nothing, even if it means risking not just their life, but everyone else's as well. Then there are those who would rather give up when things become too harrowing and too risky. The clashing of these two ideas create some intense scenes of psychological anguish. The ironic thing is that these four characters begin the film as friends, but the journey transforms them and turns them against each other in thrilling and disturbing ways. The film has a fantastic script which examines these things intensely and eloquently. It is a truly brilliant cinematic feat.The film works so well as a character study, while also being an incredibly intense film full of riveting suspense. The combination of these two elements is done so perfectly, neither one taking over the other. Instead they blend beautifully, making an astoundingly powerful film. I wouldn't hesitate to call this film a masterpiece, so I will. The Wages of Fear is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once this takes off [spoiler]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>you sit on the edge of your seat. You can read the plot of the film on the many other postings here. Once the story is reduced to two men each in two little sardine can truck cabs 'strapped' to nitroglycerine, you are glad you put up with some anti-imperialistic claptrap at the beginning. The director uses one standard shot, head-on of each truck crew through their windshields with alternating close ups of faces as they talk and we learn more about them and just when we have had enough 'getting to know you' some crisis erupts: an impassable turn, a boulder blocking the road, and finally the pool of oil.With what mastery Clouzot sets up that scene: the trucks do not travel in tandem but a mile or two apart. By the time Mario and Jo come upon the boulder-blocked road, the others have already conceived a plan to use a bit of their cargo to blast the rock away. The fuse is lit; the men scramble as suddenly they realize debris could hit their trucks and set off the nitro anyway. Rocks fall all about them but all is safe; they continue on their way, released and relieved. They smoke, and the German character begins to shave as the truck rumbles along, his truckmate marveling at his nerve as he explains how Nazi prisons made him the way he is. The director cuts to Mario and Jo, following and chatting, our eyes following their conversation through the windshield. A noise is heard and eyes bug out. A column of smoke on the road ahead. Their mates are gone, and in one of the most frightening scenes in film, Mario must pilot the truck through the oil left by their departure while Jo guides him.I recall Life Magazine, I believe, had a spread on this film when it came out with many photos. Two years before, I'd lived in an oil refining camp in Eastern Venezuela and while it was on the Caribbean, occasionally we would take a jungle road to a beach away from camp. This made it seem all the more realistic. This film deserves the highest rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the road of hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A director of several terrific detective movies made in the forties such as "le corbeau" (1943), you can consider Henri Georges Clouzot as one of the best French film-makers specialized in suspense. Here, he broaches a new topic for him: the adventure movie with "le salaire de la peur" (1953) and this is a stunning movie.You can divide the movie into two obvious parts. The first one focuses on this bunch of men who lives in this Mexican small town cut disconnected from the world, even the time. If this part is a little uninteresting (but essential in the way that Clouzot emphasizes on their boredom and the mission to carry nitroglycérine with trucks to an oil well is an unexpected opportunity for them), on the other hand, the second part justifies the vision of the movie. When the four men have accepted the mission, they aren't out of the woods: there are a lot of dangerous situations where death can arrive at any moment. Clouzot manages to maintain the interest thanks to an asset whose he is the master: the suspense.A brilliant and absorbing movie still just as good as it was more than fifty years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>«Le salaire de la peur» has not aged very well. In spite of the fact that the solid performances by the four leading actors and Armand Thirard's cinematography remain effective (and in spite of the criteria of the Criterion company, which has become some sort of "film Bible" for many unbaptized in the immensely wide scope of world cinema), the flaws are more evident now. To start with the 39- minute first act is quite hard to follow, especially for a Spanish- speaking person like me: in the novel the action takes place in Guatemala (Central America) , but where does this movie take place, where is this place called Las Piedras that by 1953 still has creoles talking with Spaniards' accents, where indigenous dress as Andean people or undress like Amazonian tribes? The closest town to Las Piedras seems to be Caracas (capital of Venezuela, South America) as seen in a sign of plane fares, or it could be Tegucigalpa (capital of Honduras, Central America) according to a dialog: you take your pick. All this mishmash is possible, yes, but at least I could not deal with the endless parade of offensive "Latino" stereotypes, from the taxi driver who stops his car precisely in the middle of a mud pond, the barefoot venal black immigrant officer or the sweaty and greasy owner of "El Corsario Negro". Then take act two, which as Georges Arnaud's novel is also the weakest dramatic section of the movie, since the characters have been well established in the first act. So this is mainly a block of action sequences in which the nitroglycerin-loaded trucks go from one obstacle to the next, to reach their goal, the oil field in flames. Admittedly a couple of the pieces are real gems (the long sequence of the rotten-wood platform or the solution to take a huge boulder out of the road), but it is just that, a chain of obstructions and how to deal with them. The last act centers on the persistence of the two surviving truck drivers, leading to a surprise ending that seems too moralistic after everything we have seen before, when all the characters we have seen since the beginning deserve a similar conclusion. As for the critic of American companies in foreign lands, today that is no news and it can also be said of European and Asian enterprises in those alien territories, as well as the local companies: they all give similar ruthless treatment to workers (and the land itself). This is the kind of commercial "macho movie" that asks for a remake among the action film crowd. There have been a couple of those and a few imitations, the more remarkable being William Friedkin's «Sorcerer» (1977), in which he wisely reduced the running time from the original 142 minutes to 121.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off slowly but then rapidly accelerates. Yves Montand is brilliant in the lead role. Given his background as a singer, his performance is almost uncanny. The story is strong, compelling, simple yet profound. Men risk their lives and nobody really cares. Men reduced to scrounging will do just about anything to make a buck. This movie is about every deck hand, lineman, truck driver, construction worker and blue collar worker on this planet who makes a living by doing the hard, dirty, dangerous work that society still demands. Somebody has to do it. Four thousand years ago workers were hauling and lifting huge blocks of stones to build temples; the same work is being done today. These workers are taken for granted, forgotten until they are needed and then they are heroes, for the moment. This movie is a tribute to the courage of those whose work puts them in harms' way. This movie should be recognized for what it is: a director's personal statement about the condition of mankind, divided along class lines, the exploiters and the exploited, the indifference to human life in the quest for profits and how there are always those who come forward and do the heavy lifting, even when they know that they may not survive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping thriller that defies your heart and defines the cinematic notion of "Suspense" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gripping, dark, intense ? never has my heart's resistance been so challenged. Once the trucks took off to their hellish journey, I was literally grabbed, accompanying these four unsung heroes, like another passenger ... along with the haunting presence of death? Henri-George Clouzot, Hitchock's most valuable rival, made suspense films with a sadistic nerve and a humanistic genius, he defined suspense even better than the Master. Hitch said when two fellows are dining in a restaurant, and the table explodes ? you understand there was a bomb underneath. It's surprise, but no suspense. Suspense is, according to Hitch, when you KNOW there is a bomb, and you want the two guys to leave the table, because you know WHEN it will explode. I humbly and respectfully disagree ? For me, suspense is precisely when you know there is a bomb, BUT you don't know when it'll explode. It's suspense when any second can take you off your seat. And in "Wages of Fear", four men volunteer to transport nitroglycerin by trucks. Any blow, any shock, and they're gone ? they know, we know, the only unknown here is ? "When?""When?" illustrates the truth that fear is an emotion connected with the future. Past can be repressed, present is a soon-to-be past, but future scares. And when you know, you drive a truck that can explode at any moment; you're tormented between two contradictory feelings: that you might die and that you can't die. Self-preservation is a so incompatible instinct for such a mission, that the only character we understand is Jo, Charles Vanel in a breathtaking performance. Jo perfectly embodies the idea that fear is a fear of the future, his past; his gangster past is used as a mask to impress the others. He even fools us in the beginning as we believe he'll be the ultimate bad-ass, contrasting with the kindness and romantic side of Mario, Yves Montand as his partner, the joviality of Luigi the Italian, and Bimba, the Dutch whose laconic tone, and avarice of lines, draw a perpetual enigma in his face. They're the courageous drivers of the trucks of doom. Jo is the bravest before the mission, but when it starts, the inconceivability of his death makes his nerves finally crack, in a pathetic cowardice that doesn't belittle his manhood anyway."Wages of Fear" is a fascinating character study about how far, desperate and jobless men would go. I know I should have started with the beginning, but I don't think I have as many time as Clouzot had to plunge us in this fascinating universe, this South American town in the middle of a desert, populated by foreign workers who spend their time, trying to find a way to spend it, a rich and colorful, multicultural atmosphere that makes us forget about the mission ? we get used to this boredom, a kind of 'Hustonian' melancholy where the losers, don't lose this pleasant ability to be themselves, despite the adversity ? and flirting with a pretty girl, who likes to acts like your little cat ? Vera Clouzot as the sweet and innocent waitress Linda, is like a female incarnation of these men who're the real sheep in a land when the wolf is the unethical American Southern Oil Corporation (SOC), a Sierra Madre whose only treasure is a suicidal mission, rewarded by 2000 dollars.SOC will play the pivotal role by hiring men for the suicidal mission. Transporting trucks of nitroglycerin to the Oil fields ignited by a gigantic fire, which only an explosion can extinguish. It takes a lot of guts to accept this mission, the men are so eager to leave the town; you wonder how they came here in the first place. I think it's because they don't belong to anything, no country, no union, no family ? their lives are maybe more uncertain than their death, which at this point looks more promising. But self-control and determination have to be proved during the mission. As one Texan said, fear inhabits you forever. Later, Jo reminds us of the way, fear is an emotion that you can't talk about, only live it ? and it takes a non-heroic but no less admirable courage to reckon his fears, like Luigi when he didn't want to fight Jo, like Jo when he admitted he was scared ?And during this captivating road to an imminent death, the imminence of an explosion is always teasing your thoughts, on the 'washboard' road, it's probably the most suspenseful movie sequence ever, the two trucks are about to collide, one can't accelerate before one point, the look on their eyes, the sweat on their foreheads, and me, holding my breath, waiting for the explosion ? then they met a platform above a precipice, a boulder blocking the road, and the explosion, well, let's say that ? even though I expected a truck explosion, it managed to surprise me, and to shock me. THIS is suspense ?If you read this, you know how it ends, and I guess the ending works as a the second plot twist, the first one being Jo's real personality ? life in its splendidly despicable irony, you literally waltz with death until it dumps you at the unfortunate second you lower your guard ? Was he stupid to be so dangerously jubilant? I think it depends on how we see things, if you know, you'll die, you're scared, if you think providence will spare you now, you're screwed. Tragic, it's the film noir, noir like nowhere, the nihilistic optimism that inspire the most heroic but ultimately tragic actions. And how ironic to realize at the end that fear is not necessarily bad, Jo was probably the most intelligent because he valued his life, where the others, sick, lunatic or romantic didn't see the danger ... I guess that was the viewer's department.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fear and loathing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four desperate outcasts in a seedy tropical village volunteer to drive a pair of trucks loaded with volatile nitroglycerin over unpaved mountain roads to a remote oil field, where a well is burning out of control. Henri-Georges Clouzot's stark, pessimistic adventure contains enough pure suspense to pull any viewer to the edge of a seat, but until 1992 the film had never been seen (at least in this country) in its uncut, original form. Before it was first released, scissor-happy censors trimmed nearly 45-minutes of footage (mostly from the early, introductory scenes) to help soften the strong anti-American subtext, but even in the truncated version the bias must have been obvious. American oil (and the need to keep it flowing) is still the monument under which every character is ultimately buried, a point made explicit when one driver is crushed beneath his truck in a pool of crude. The director's restored cut is even is incredibly downbeat (note the vultures hovering over every other scene), but the film still packs a thrilling, unforgettable punch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a classic case of a movie being dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the movie i am shocked that it is considered a classic. Maybe because it was unusual for the time , i cannot judge that, but i was extremely disappointed. Especially with the character build up . The one that stands out the most at being ridiculous to the extreme is Jo. In the beginning he is presented as a tough guy who fears nothing , but this does not work at all . He seems ridiculous from the first second he enters the scene . After a while he turns out to be whiny and full of fear , but because the whole build up of the character was so not believable , i did not care at all about his fate or supposed transformation. Of course you can say he should be presented as ridiculous but if that is the case why bother making him such a big character? What really disturbed me is the way the relationship between yes montand and the girl in the city is presented. It is very sexist and the whole macho culture of the movie was getting on my nerves a lot after a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think that space invaders, aliens, dinosaurs, cyborgs, or monsters of one sort or another are needed to make a film a thriller? If so, I recommend you watch Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 black and white masterpiece The Wages Of Fear (La Salaire De La Peur), about the evils of runaway greed and capitalism, all in the name of oil. It'll change your mind. Over half a century later, and in light of the current American war folly for oil in the Middle East, the film is remarkably resonant and cogent- even down to the loudest criticism of American profiteering and imperialism coming from?.the French. However, when they're right they're right. If one wants to know why 'Ugly Americans' are loathed in the Middle East it's not because of the rhetorical claptrap about a 'clash of cultures', nor Evil vs. Freedom, but because of decades of exploitation where a select group of mainly American corporations, unanswerable to anyone, get rich off of exploiting the masses where they swoop in. It happened in the Middle East, as well as in Latin America- perhaps the only place in the world where anti-Americanism (really anti-American corporate imperialism) rivals or surpasses that in the Middle East. As a minor character in the film rails, 'Wherever there's oil, there's always Americans.' But, if all this film were was an anti-American screed it would still not grip viewers today. What it is, is a great portrait of the extremes that human beings- OK, men, will go to just to have things, and to what lengths their machismo will drive them.The film's screenplay was adapted by Clouzot and Jérôme Géronimi (Clouzot's brother Jean's pseudonym) from a novel by Georges Arnaud, and, despite its nail-biting nature, as well as Clouzot's reputation as 'the French Hitchcock'- aka 'The Master Of Suspense', for such great thrillers as Diabolique (Les Diaboliques), this film is far beyond merely the technically great cinema that was Hitchcock's stock in trade. That's because it is not merely well made, but provokes deep questions about the fundamental nature of existence, human nature, and fraternity. It's far closer to something like John Huston's The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (although it's a greater film), and its influence can be seen in many later films, such as Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch- in an opening shot of a naked child torturing cockroaches on a string, and Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West, when we experience a good few silent minutes of opening shots on the squalid Latin American town, Las Piedras, the film is set in, just to get ambiance. Reputedly, the film was shot entirely over the course of a year, in southern France, in Camargue, with a few imported palm trees and cacti to give it a South American look, but one could not tell it from what is on screen. Clouzot is at his very best when drawing out the suspense, which, by definition, is the time between big events, the possibility of danger or horror, not the thing itself, which is usually anticlimactic. What the viewer imagines will always be more frightening than the reality, which is why the best suspense or horror films are usually those that are the least action-packed, show little of the monster, or are not dependent upon mere special effects. Yet, even when we know what will occur, the scenes are filmed so well as to draw the viewer in. This is particularly effective and true when Mario is shown slowly pulling the truck up off the bridge, and a metal hook from its side catches the bridge cable, and as the truck gets fully on the road, the bridge breaks below him. This sort of scene has been done many times before. Will it or will it not break? In a film as great as this, where all four main characters end up dead, to expect the cable to last is, at best, a crapshoot, or wishful thinking.It is the writing that sets the tenor of The Wages Of Fear, and what makes the suspense/thriller aspect of the film so great. Yet, what raises the film into the high art category is its blunt, simple, but never ham-handed, portrayal of the evils of corporate greed, and the sacrifice of human life so a select few can get rich, as well as the nihilistic despair that drives those who willingly play into their exploiters' hands. As rough as Clouzot is on the exploiters, he's even harsher on the meekly hypocritical exploited. Let Politically Correct Hollywood try that in one of their didactic screeds, and maybe there will be hope for American film. Till then, The Wages Of Fear should always find gainful employment in a cineaste's library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A object lesson in film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many good words have been written about this brilliant film that it seems unlikely that any more are necessary. However, there are a couple of points which occurred to me as I watched it again yesterday.Firstly, the language. This is a truly multi-lingual film, and one of its chief joys for me is the wild multiplicity of thoroughly mangled foreign accents and the earthy, slang-filled dialogue. It's great to hear Italians and Germans and Americans talking in French, Frenchmen and Russians in English, Englishmen in Spanish. Eet iz as if I wurz to write ze 'ole of zis revieew lyik zis. And when the two French guys (Mario and Jo) are together, their speech is peppered with really down-to-earth slang and obscenities.The subtitles of my copy (although good) didn't always manage to convey the exact sense of the rough talk. One instance was blatantly censored; as Jo and Mario are leaving the depot with the laden trucks, O'Brien shouts a very male "Merde!" at them for luck: the subtitles' "Break a leg!" misses the muck a little. O'Brien tries again, with a more human "Good luck, boys", but Jo's response, hidden in the roar of the accelerating truck is, "Et un Coca-Cola dans le c*n!" For non-French speakers, men don't have one.The second point, neatly enough, follows on from that. Although movies can be "about" almost anything you want, Wages Of Fear presents us with an intense, highly-charged subtext of what it means to be a man and how men relate to each other. There is a whole load of unacknowledged sexuality just below the surface of this film - hey, Mario even gets to kiss Luigi - and I feel that any accusations of misogyny levelled at this movie need to be interpreted in a slightly wider context.I first saw Wages of Fear at an after-school film club over thirty years ago, where we were lucky enough to be introduced to a number of movie masterpieces by a teacher who simply adored good film-making. He would talk coherently and intelligently beforehand about each film for a good ten minutes (without notes) and this was one of his all-time favourites. He was right, of course. Thanks, Tony. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general I steer clear of foreign films, not just because I dislike reading subtitles, but also because I never feel as comfortable viewing them as I do films from my own culture. Perhaps I don't like to stretch myself as much as I should. I approached this film with trepidation. From the first second of this film I was absolutely absorbed into the world it created - a world dominated by desperate men from disparate cultures trapped in a sordid backwater. Without money, passports and marketable skills, they spend their time indulging in drunkenness, indifferent sex and mindless violence until they are offered an escape through a trial by fire, survivor takes all and the chances of survival are slim indeed. Wages of Fear provides the ultimate in suspense, character development, physical and psychological action. It is a visual masterpiece, not because of the beauty it displays but because of the complexity, depth and darkness of the world it portrays. It reminds me so much of Treasure of the Sierra Madres, an examination of courage and character under the most dire circumstances. A wonderful feature of this film -- there is absolutely no background music which increases the reality and suspense because the viewer cannot anticipate the action. You get to sweat and tremble along with the characters as they drive over washboard roads and crumbling mountain paths. The acting is superb, and this from a person who has in the past dismissed Yves Montand as a frivolous song and dance man. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense with subtly powerful social comment. A masterpiece of cinematic craft.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film runs along the traditional template of any story - a beginning, which unhurriedly and deliberately sets the scene, a middle section that carries the plotline, and a brief ending that resolves everything to no one's satisfaction. The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddnly there is a change - a way out for a 'lucky' four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town. But its nitro-glycerine, and there is no time to get specially-fitted trucks to carry it over the rough mountains roads. Rather than risk their own employees, the oil company offers a large reward to four volunteers. Cue the action as first the men compete for the places on the two trucks, then as the winners embark on their terrifying journey, where every bump could spell instant death. On the journey their true characters emerge. One, Jo, is broken by the ordeal, but is eventually redeemed. 'How exciting could a simple road trip be?' you might ask, but the one and a half hour screen journey is petrifyingly spellbinding. Fate seems to be stacked against these bedraggled heroes, but it is their ingenuity, effort and bravery which captures our hearts. I won't reveal the details or the ending, which is tragic and some say its only flaw. It's in black and white, and mostly in French, but it will never be old-fashioned. The best film I have ever seen - and I've seen a few.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most explosively charged thriller of all time. The suspense just blows you away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's primary rival, the French prodigy Henry Georges Clouzot, defined a new type of thriller with "The Wages Of Fear" and a new type of fear. Oh yes, it wasn't the Ray Harryhausen sea monsters of stop motion, nor was it aliens from outer space or Nosferatu or more sinister, the blonde Hitchcock Femme Fatale. No, it was much more real than that. Even a valuable lesson perhaps. Don't, and I repeat, don't carry Nitroglycerine around. You might get hurt. No film portrays being careful with dangerous substances quite so well as this film, because it give you the feeling that YOU are handling it. And that's the unsettling thing about it. Like James Coburn said in Sergio Leone's "A Fistful Of Dynamite", "if this falls, you'd have to alter the maps". Precisely so with the substance in question. Nitroglycerine. Who would be crazy enough to handle that. That's precisely what our film's protagonists may have thought had the pay not have been so big as to persuade them. On top of the unbearable, nail-biting, teddy bear clenching suspense, this film is one fantastic character study. Character revelations, weaknesses and heroics all come into play as the Nitro changes all their lives.It's South America. A remote village in the middle of God's nowhere. Outcasts, wanderers, desperadoes, fraudsters and nobodies from all around the globe work for peanuts in factories and mines, staying hopeful as to their unpredictable futures, for maybe one day they'd have enough money for a flight out to start a new life. Many await an opportunity for even a sign of work. But one thing's for sure - the desperation among the men make them very competitive. To the point where everybody is such a tough guy. Things change however when a very confident and tough French man named Jo comes to town. Mysterious but well dressed, he easily attracts the attention of a fellow French man named Mario. The two get along instantaneously, reaching a type of partner-hood that leads to neglect of the other men in town. Almost straight away, Jo is seen as a force not to be reckoned with. The tough guys of late are no more. People keep their mouths shut. He is established as a cutthroat with bad attitude, while Mario always keeping himself quiet. A wise man indeed. But among all men, human nature will always prevail.One morning the news comes out. In a remote oil mine far far away, miners have been killed in an explosion and a fire is consuming all the oil and environment around it. The fire must be stopped and the damage repaired. The mining company comes to the harrowing conclusion that Nitroglycerine is the only way at their disposal. There is only one problem. Who would be crazy enough to drive Nitro across some of the most difficult and death defying terrain through South American rain forest to the oil mine? Normally this would apply to everybody. But the job becomes like a one off chance to see Willy Wonka when the pay is announced. It comes as no surprise that every man jumps at the chance, life second to the smell of money.Following many tests, trials and errors, four men are selected to drive the two trucks. Mario is the most fit for the job. A German named Bimba and an Italian named Luigi drive in the other truck. Cheating was the only way Jo could drive with Mario as he was unqualified for the job. Then one night, the trucks are loaded with barrel upon barrel of Nitroglycerine. The trucks begin their suicide journey at snail pace through the streets of the town and into the murky hills of the rocky, muddy, slippery hills. For one slight bump could be the difference between life and death. A small disturbance in the substance would create such a powerful explosion as to rock the landscape miles in every direction. Are these men heroes or cowards? The tension breaks them as it breaks us, and we find out more about them as each bump raises the blood pressure in our veins. Clouzot's patient direction and masterful editing gives the film's title a whole new meaning. It's fantastic. But nothing beats the human study and the poignant message: Are men as tough as they appear? Although Clouzot didn't make as much of an impact on film as Alfred Hitchcock had and not nearly as many films, he was however a worthy competitor. With this film and Les Diabolique, Hitchcock's jealousy retaliated with the master works Vertigo and Psycho. Everything about this film is patient suspense. And nothing beats patient direction to make you feel uncomfortable - Something Hitchcock mastered long before. The power house actors namely Yves Montand as Mario brought the film to life. Charles Vanel as Jo had the most complex character and he molded him brilliantly. We feel sorry for him, we hate him, we like him and we identify with him. The actors absorbed their roles so well that by the end of the film, you feel as though you've been on a journey with these men, and rightfully so. Human emotion on the whole spectrum is showcased in great method, realistic performances. And the script was so well written - the dialog achieving a kind of audience disconnection that puts emphasis more on real conversation between actors. Very tense indeed. But this film wouldn't have been half as good had it not been for the claustrophobic editing.A technical achievement in itself. Flawless in every respect.Please, do yourself a favor. Go and watch this film right now! Adventure/suspense at it's most unbearable....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly perfect blend of action and substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The simple premise of four out of work men driving two truck nitro glycerine laden trucks across a forest to cut off the fire at a burning oil field is turned into a two and a half hour masterpiece, with some of the best character development ever filmed followed by some of the most tense action scenes in cinema history.The fact that this film does have a full hour of characterisation before it gets going is enough to see off most modern audiences. Unfortunately I didn't watch this film alone so the room wasn't free of shouts of 'NOTHING'S HAPPENED! THIS IS BORING!' Even though this is an action film, and one of the best of the 1950s at that (which pits it alongside the terrific works of Japan in this decade), it should not be treated as something to watch half drunk of a Friday night. After this first hour you will know just about everything regarding the personalities of the four men who are going to be the ones selected for the dangerous task, which makes the journey's change from friendly contest to a desperate competition where the men will do anything to be the first to reach the oil field and receive the reward all the more obvious and affecting. A huge corporation exploiting the working class in this way undoubtedly leads to many people reading into this film quite a lot. But even with this aside, once the film enters its second hour it showcases some of the best action scenes ever filmed. The recklessness the men develop over these scenes ultimately lead to their downfall, especially that of Mario. Overall this is too essential to miss. Many people will be bored stiff by the first hour, which is ironic because they are depriving themselves of the second half's awesome action that they were probably craving in the first place. Along with The Seven Samurai, this is the ultimate action film of the 1950s and one of the most tense films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wages of Fear" is without doubt a true classic - a film you can watch again and again. Four desperate men on a journey that will reveal their true character as every turn in the road brings a new challenge to test their mettle. This film is so good that avid fan such as myself derives as much pleasure from watching first timers viewing it as from seeing it again myself. The suspense is such that their faces cannot but contort and wince in anticipation, their eyes as big as dinner plates are absolutely riveted to the screen as the action unfolds. The tension in this film is palpable so check your pace maker before pushing the 'Play' button. By the way, it is an ambition of mine to track down the location of the scene where the trucks back out on to the platform. I simply cannot depart this earth without having stood on that very spot. Can anyone help? I believe some of the scenes were shot in Venezuela and others in El Salvador. Any leads would be most appreciated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the short list of best films ever made. One of those films that you get so wrapped up in you forget you're watching a film. The acting is superb and the cinematography first-rate. I love the shot near the beginning of the film where Linda is crawling across the floor to Mario, soft light from outside playing across her body, breasts partially exposed; he fondles her hair sorta petting her like a dog or cat. A perfectly crafted short little sequence that explains their relationship and perhaps Mario's attitude toward women in general better than pages of prose ever could. But the movie is really about the struggle for existence in an unforgiving world where any display of cowardice costs your claim to manhood, and as such, the action and suspense scenes are among the most finely crafted in cinema history. If you're a fan of international cinema, SEE THIS FILM!! BTW, the Criterion Collection edition is first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But I'll Still Take 'Sorcerer'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French film was re-made for English-speaking audiences in 1980 with the title, "Sorcerer," and I've watched that film a half-dozen times. It's excellent and, frankly, a far more interesting movie than this one. That is not to say Wages Of Fear is not without merit. It's just that most of the first hour of this film is wasted. It has little meaning. At least in the 1980 version, it showed how four men from around the world got to where they were and why they took the chance they did. here, even tough the pre-journey intro is much longer, it's vague with too many scenes that mean nothing. Once the action starts - the two-truck, nitroglycerin-filled 300-mile trip through rugged terrain - this is an interesting film as well. Then it paints a better picture of the personalities of the four men while keeping good suspense. That general suspense story is the same in both movies but the obstacles along the way of the treacherous journey are different and the fate of the men a bit different.There is some excellent black-and white cinematography in this film and a big reason for me to see it again, this time on DVD. However, I might skip some of that first hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Wages of Fear, four men in a remote South American town have the enviable task of transporting a metric buttload (technical term) of nitroglycerin across mountainous roads in poor condition. It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.Yves Montand, in a rare dramatic role, plays Mario, the ostensible protagonist of our tale. He's been stuck in this backwater for some time, but it costs a lot of money to get out ? plane fares are through the roof, and there's no train, and there's no neighboring village. In short, you're stuck there until you can buy a ticket ? and pay for a passport, of course.Mario spends his days looking for work, wooing tavern worker Linda, and despairing about the lack of work. There's an American oil company in town, but they're no longer hiring. His monotonous lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of fellow expat Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough-looking older man who quickly wins Mario's favor at the expense of the rest of the men in town.The oil company, in fact, has its own problem ? one of their large derricks has exploded, causing a huge oil fire. Company man Bill O'Brien decides to send two trucks loaded with nitro from the town up the mountain to the derrick. (The eventual idea is to set off charges, which will somehow contain or extinguish the fire.) O'Brien has no trouble scaring up volunteers for the task, since the men of the town are largely unemployed. Four men will be selected to take the two trucks. Only one truck is needed; the second is truly just in case there's an accident with the first one. The men will receive $2000 when the work is finished, more than enough to secure passage out of the backwater.Mario and Jo are chosen, as are Mario's roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and German expat Bimba (Peter van Eyck). The two trucks depart early in the morning, full of gas and of nitro. Danger awaits.Theirs is not an easy task. The road is full of ruts. In one place, the wooden deck that trucks use to make a sharp turn up the mountain has been damaged from disuse. It's hot and muggy. And one has to be very, very careful, as even the smallest bump might set the whole shebang off. There's also tension among the four drivers ? Luigi is unhappy that Mario is spending more time with Jo than with him, Mario is unhappy with what he perceives as Jo's cowardice. Bimba seems to get along with everyone, though.The whole time I was watching this movie, I was certain not all four were going to make it. I will not spoil what is now a sixty-three-year-old movie, but I was still genuinely surprised by the ending. This ain't no fairy tale or sitcom. This is a movie about desperation, redemption, sacrifice, and comeuppance. It's not necessarily about justice.The Wages of Fear is a singularly terrific movie from start to finish, exquisitely shot and expertly written. Its money maker is its tension, something present here in spades. The writing is impeccable; even personality changes make perfect sense within the film's context. There are intricacies within a straightforward plot. This is a must see for lovers of thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since becoming a fan of his work after seeing the astonishing 1949 movie Manon,I was thrilled to spot a 3 disc boxset of auteur film maker Henri-Georges Clouzot on Amazon UK. Struggling to decide which one to watch first,I found an excellent review on IMDb's Film Noir board,which led to me putting all my wages on fear.The plot:Stuck in a dead end town, Mario,Jo, Bimba and Luigi try to make ends meet,as a big US corporation (boo!) controls the nearby oil fields. Taking part in "shady" dealings,the company gets a tight grip on the town,which forces the people to stay silent over the abuses,due to it offering the only jobs in town.Discovering that one of the oil fields has erupted,the company decide that the only way to stop it is to use nitroglycerine.Going round town offering a handful of cash,the company grab the attention of ex-gangster Jo,the quiet Bimba,the quick-witted Mario and the warm, hard working Luigi. Getting told that they have to drop the nitroglycerine off to the oil field in trucks,the gang soon discover one major,risky problem:the oil field is 300 miles away on a road of death.View on the film:Flying in at 2 and a half hours,co-writer/(along with Jérôme Géronimi) director Henri-Georges Clouzot (who broke a leg whilst filming) and cinematographer Armand Thirard sink the trucks into an engulfing Film Noir atmosphere,where low-lighting allows the smallest glimmer of hope to be seen in the town. Keeping a close eye on every turning of the wheels,Clouzot brilliantly uses tightly held,lingering shots to build a mood brimming with anxiety over the title.Stomping down the Film Noir road, Clouzot makes every sharp turn land with an unrelenting thump,by blazing down scorching hot whites with mud and grit gathering every drop of sweat,which is burnt away by the oily Film Noir doom being lit on the horizon.Piped down from Georges Arnaud's novel,the screenplay by Clouzot and Géronimi beautifully spends the first hour giving the viewer an opportunity to (almost) interact with each character,from Mario's abrasive,Film Noir loner nature, to Jo's sincere desire to drive by the Film Noir darkness. Expanding on one of his major themes drawn from the very beginning of his credits,Clouzot gives the characters an inability to escape from the Film Noir oil fields that they are driving into,by making each pedal pressed pull them all away from a paternally safe "stop point",into a decaying road of ruthless doom,paved with grubby cash. Grabbing the role after Jean Gabin turned it down for the character being a "coward", Charles Vanel gives an incredible performance as Mario,thanks to Vanel keeping Mario's humble roots shining as the oil of Film Noir streams over Jo and Mario. Crushed into a million pieces, Yves Montand gives an incredible performance as Mario,whose rough edged smile Montand chips away at to hit a Film Noir loner who will roll over anyone who gets in the way of a handful of cash,as Jo and Mario rage with fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate suspenseful road trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinatingly nihilistic film about the meaninglessness of life. Life: It can be appallingly poor and dull. Or it can be soul-crushingly suspenseful. Ask not what is behind the fence -- it is nothing! This film starts out as a banal depiction of life as a senseless tableau. A child lacking underpants is so bored he plays with bugs. Adults lay about with nothing to do but snarl territorially, throw lusty glances, and bake in the sun.When an opportunity arises to risk life and limb for $2,000, no one turns it down. Jo, a man who cheats in life, is not chosen but takes a walk with a younger man who is and soon the younger man is hanging from a tree and Jo takes his place.Once the perilous journey begins, we see what each man is made of. Mario (a macho and handsome Yves Montand) has taken advantage of a lovesick barmaid and callously shoves her off the truck on his way to the assignment. He is a consummate problem-solver, a man who never gives up in pursuit of a goal. Same with the schizoid Bimbo (Peter Van Eyck) and woman-loving Luigi (Folco Lulli). Director Henri-Georges Clouzot expertly captures the commitment and camaraderie of soldiers on a mission.Mario's riding partner Jo is made of weaker stuff. The constant potentiality of death begins to unhinge him. He suggests turning back. He tries to run away. Finally his means of escape is destroyed and, like Moses, he glimpses the Promised Land but is denied entry.It saddened me to read that Vera Clouzot, who played the lovely, pitiful Linda, died of a heart attack at age 46, seven years after this incredible movie was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 3/9/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir:Henri-Georges Clouzot): Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring of four gentlemen from a poor village in what I think was Central America to complete a monumental task of hauling explosives 100 miles on dirt roads to help the SOC(Southern Oil Company). The movie starts with the arrival of one mafia-like gentlemen named Jo into the small village looking for an opportunity to make money. After seeing another Frenchman named Maury, looking like he was doing pretty well for himself, he sticks around. The other two future drivers are locals who have learned that you have to work for the American company to survive , but one named Luigi decides to take this new job after contracting concrete in his lungs from his current position. The director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, sets the stage by introducing the characters and the area for at least 30 minutes before introducing the main plot line. The explosives that they are carrying in the trucks are very brittle and this is shown to the interviewees so that they understand the danger involved. These folks though, have nothing to lose --- and so they pursue the possibility of $2000 per person without a whole lot of reservation. The hazards that await are mostly natural ones like a giant boulder blocking the road, and the sickness of one of the drivers but definitely hard to deal with. The movie is not really about the trek, but rather how the characters handle their quest. Character's true identities are revealed as they battle the road and themselves. Because this is a foreign production there is an air on un-certainty about what is going to happen and for me creates some extra suspense. The performances are worthwhile and the direction is almost flawless with my only real issues being the quick ending and quick demise of one of the trucks. This is kind of an anti-Speed movie that is almost as thrilling as the before-mentioned American movie. At 2 and 1/2 hours long it never gets boring...an excellent movie overall and a brilliant piece of filmmaking by the French director.</fullReview>

The Wages Of Fear is the most intense film I have ever experienced, and possibly one of the best adventure films that I have endured. The only complaint with this film I have is that the start is too long and tedious; with a quick edit this could have been rectified, but besides that, this film is a true piece of art.The Wages Of Fear doesn't hold back at all.

		<fullReview>"Le Salaire de le Peur" ("The Wages of Fear") is a harrowing journey of four men going down in bumpy roads, miserable places, won over by the most difficult obstacles, a long way performing their jobs transporting a great load of dynamite to be used on a burning oil well. It's a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but it's a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. It's a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant "Les Diaboliques", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.I saw "Sorcerer" (the American remake), read Georges Arnaud's novel and watched this film. To me, they all stand on the same level. They're incredibly good, very exciting but they're not great. Arnaud focus more on the mission's perils rather than the characters and sometimes the story doesn't turn to other interesting possibilities; neither Clouzot or Friedkin films are the book, lacking of some of its good ideas but developing some new ones."Sorcerer" is an adventure about mercenaries looking for money and thrilling experiences while "The Wages of Fear" is a human drama about desperate people risking their lives to earn a living in the only possible way, and therefore more realistic than its remake. But Clouzot is a master in creating scary and real danger at practically every frame. A bar fight against local power man; the training closely observed by their patrons with conductors sabotaging each other; a truck making a difficult turn in a place that threats to collapse at any moment; the fear in the drivers eyes and hands, maneuvering as if each turn could be the last. The director delivers one of the most inspired and frightening moments of all time (not present in the book) when a giant stone stands on their way and the solution found to remove it to use part of the explosives. Heart couldn't handle very well that scene so perfectly made, with no soundtrack, very few dialogs and a constant action. And you relate very easily with the characters struggle, amazingly performed by Yves Montand (and I could never imagine him in such role, one of his earliest), Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli, similar in being all afraid of what they're doing but their fears are expressed in many different ways. Some panic, some control it, others disguise from time to time trying to look adventurous. The difficulties I had with this were the erratic and long introduction of each character, too many humored bits that weren't so effective (those could have been easily trimmed down) and the ending - not in the sense of being a let down but its goofy presentation seems awkward. The treatment given to the theme, the heart of the matter which is their mission and the rest (even the romance involving Montand and the girl, which is slightly distractive but useful) achieves a positive result. Certainly a movie of a different level and exciting even today. 21st Century flicks can only aspire to be something like this. Call me crazy, but Hollywood can even try again with a remake but this time read the novel, make wise choices and you might reach something similar or better. There's themes that can be explored in a very interesting way to make it a more challengeable film and adventurous. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satire on Americanisation of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst Wages of Fear is rightly regarded as one of the greatest adventure films ever made, it is also a great satire on the post-war Americanisation of much of the world.The cutting remark from the dialogue that "Where there is oil, there are Americans" was prescient in this regard. One could imagine the cries of racism were this remark uttered in a modern film made in an English speaking country.The character of the SOC manager, ruthless, ambitious, gluttonous and money-hungry neatly encapsulates all of the negative stereotypes that have circulated for the past half-century. He is indeed a robber-baron turned oil-baron, and this is exemplified by the hints of his shady past with Jo. Furthermore, the depictions of the exploitation of the third- world poor in the oil town may have come straight from a John Pilger documentary.Henri Clouzot's direction is excellent and the film abounds with irony, with memorable scenes including the Vera Clouzot character praying under the tree looking up to see the hanged man, the idea of the Dutch driver shaving just before his death and, of course, the final "waltz of death" scene in which celebration turns to tragedy. The first hour of the film is extremely slow and Vera's acting is awkward, particularly as she was attempting to play a character much younger than herself.Indeed, even when the epic truck odyssey begins, the pace is much slower than that to which one would be accustomed from modern films. Nevertheless, the two lead characters are excellent and their psychological backgrounds are explored in some depth.Casting Yves Montand was a successful move, even though it makes it predictable as to which of the characters will survive at least long enough to deliver the oil. The deaths of the characters in the first truck is a low-key moment that contrasts starkly with modern Hollywood productions. That scene is particularly ironic as it comes in a seeming lull in the film after the dramatic bridge and boulder scenes.The surface narrative has a simple elegance on which the tension is built and the characters "fleshed out." Underneath this surface is the added depth of the political commentary on the greed of the oil companies and it is this added depth that elevates this film to classic status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. It is one of the most riveting thrillers I have seen and at least for me was an unexpected surprise as I normally don't enjoy thrillers this old. And even though I do enjoy some I normally don't think that they can hold a candle to the modern thrillers. Mostly because they are clichéd, have loud music and even if they had something new when they were released, I have seen some other movie in which they have done much better.This movie broke all my preconceived notions. This is one edge of seat thriller, where are on the edge for most of the film.While I am not the sort that goes on hunting alternate meaning and metaphors in a movie, I do enjoy the complexities in characters. Beside the thriller part which was amazing, I loved the interaction between the characters. At the start, Mario is shown to be normal guy who is a sort of follower of Jo. Jo is an aging ex-gangster who doesn't seem to be afraid of anything. They are both on a mission to deliver nitroglycerine, without any safety equipment and through an ill- maintained road. But as the journey goes on, the sides starts reversing. Age is catching up with Jo, he is afraid and has a bad case of nerves. And as Mario becomes more confident he starts despising Joe and treating him as his lackey.An amazing and interesting thriller with a bonus of a gripping psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After wading through the early exposition, I settled into this film and found it to be about as tense as any I've seen. The people in the small village are literally in prison. We even see a shot of the shadows off a trellis superimposing prisoner's stripes on the people who pretty much wait for something to happen. When a job opportunity arises when an oil company needs men to drive truckloads of nitroglycerin to a fire site, they arise from their sloth and head into an encounter with hell. This is so much more than a simple adventure. We begin to be fascinated by each of the characters as well as the peripheral ones. We root for them and die with them. When one of them turns cowardly, we understand the kinds of forces that are working on him. When one of the trucks eventually blows up, it appears as a flash and little puff. How delicate are our lives. There are different kinds of escape and these people embrace their chance. The wages of fear are 2000 dollars, not much for a man's life, but creates adventure. The performances are outstanding as well as the pacing and first impressions don't mean much when people are all on the same plane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Proof of what Hollywood cannot achieve. A little bit more of two and a half hours and the stylish action was not more than a rock explosion. This movie is so nostalgic! Help yourself by watching it, a white and black fantasy over a stunning mountain. Heavy drivers immerse in danger by carrying nitroglycerin containers; their minds are at proof by challenges where Mother Nature elements defy the constant sorrow of man of feeling superior to the Wind, to the Mud, to the Mountain. Nature is the blossom where this characters build up in a trip everybody is invited, every character is formed on a awesome and sutile script, Yves Montand in a particular role, the characterization is terrific because they universalize prototypes: and remember we are in the 50's! What a directing, inhumane Henri George Clouzot, so many feelings cannot cope in such dreadfully threatening passages, so many words spoken with charisma and greatness. The night entraps every single shot in a cozy blanket, feel free to prepare to this movie: it is not a challenge. Think it as necessary. 50 years old and this grandfather of movies will teach you the meaning of adventure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal mix of noir and adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows that french have invented noir, but they haven't limited it with urbanistic policiers and crime stories. Henri-Georges Clouzot's films are a living proof of this fact. "Salaire de la Peur" is one of his 3 famous masterpieces (other two are "Quai des Orf?vres" and "Les Diaboliques") all of which had an enormous influence on world cinematography. One of Empire's editors Ian Nathan had put "Salair de la Peur" among top 10 greatest actions/adventures of all time. His top 100 list might be controversial, but this is something where I totally agree with him. Clouzot's film became a milestone in many genres, among which are thrillers, actions, adventures and dramas. But even these 4 genres are not enough to describe the depressing and thrilling atmosphere of "Salair de la Peur". If your synonym for adventure is Indiana Jones, then you'll be surprised by the dark philosophy of this film (even though I love Indy myself). Indeed, the best word to describe this movie is noir. Noir at it's best. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-crafted thriller, character study, social drama, and political commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the rare thriller that will allow itself time to build effectively to leave a longer lasting impression. Henri-Georges Clouzot's "The Wages of Fear" is that kind of a thriller--one much more deeply invested in bringing out the nuances of the character than the sensationalistic impulses to blow stuff up, but nonetheless creating gripping, stylistically gorgeous drama.The story is about four men who are hired to drive two truck-fulls of nitroglycerin over a rocky mountain pass for use in extinguishing a oil rig fire. The infamously unstable nitroglycerin results in one of the slowest albeit extremely tension-filled races against time ever filmed in cinema (forget "Vertical Limit", this is the real deal). Every bump, every falling rock, every obstacle potentially becomes a life-threatening situation. Of course Clouzot gleefully sets everything he can within the limits of reality in their path.Of course, this main story begins after a long opening featuring the characters in a small, desolate South American town. The objective of these opening scenes are two-fold: to develop the characters so that their emotional reactions to the ride are more fully significant, and to provide a strong political commentary on the actions of oil companies (especially Standard Oil) in the region. A biting commentary it is, and no more distracting to the cause of the storytelling because of the way the characters are eventually treated. Jo's story is, of course, the most interesting of all, as he pretends to stand as the more comfortable, capable man of the world only to become the most cowardly. The beginning ultimately also justifies the ending.Of course, the main character we focus on isn't actually all that likable, and what's interesting is that's the point. Mario is abusive, self-centered, and rather narcissistic (though possibly not as much as the German fellow). His own fate is rather more fitting to the ending than a lot of people complain; I've heard some say that the ending is unnecessarily dark; I had to think awhile about it, but considering the rest of the movie I have to disagree.This is a movie that many film-buffs and up-and-coming filmmakers should make an extra effort to see. It's the type of movie that takes what is an almost shockingly simple premise and turns it into an intricate, involved character study, social drama, political commentary, and genre thriller film, all at once. It also shares aspects with Clouzot's famed noir "Le Corbeau". That would be another movie to check out.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb French film, with an easy basis for a terrible job! Four Europeans, stuck in South America, are offered a chance to work - at a price. Driving volatile explosive over dangerous, hot terrain. Can you imagine doing this, or being offered to do this yourself? There are fine performances from the characters, building up the tension regarding the 'cargo' and of course the human interest in the band being brought together.A very good film and a shame it's not seen on the TV (At least here in Britain) often enough. Every ten years would be good, but I've only seen it 20 years ago! Still, British TV used to be the best in the world, but sadly 'reality TV' has taken us over.

		<fullReview>Wages of fear is a big lesson for action filmmakers who use a lot of technology but are largely unable to recreate an element of human sentiment in their action films.In all seriousness they can learn a lot from a great man who was more popular with his Gallic Hitchcock acronym :Henri Georges Clozot.In 1953,when he made this film,he did not even have one tenth of the kind of technology which is employed by today's technology savvy filmmakers.Wages of fear is a great film with existentialist undertones whose first half is a bitter depiction of nothingness for its four protagonists who languish in hot South America. It is in second half of the film that we witness a flurry of meaningful action.It is quite odd but due to heavy masculine presence Clouzot decided not to have much room for female characters except for a sensual role played by his wife Vera Clouzot.It is a true fact that before this film human misery,desperation and hopelessness were never shown in such vivid details as shown in this film.The sadness depicted in Wages of fear can still be felt in our contemporary world.</fullReview>

The movie is in Black and White. There are no really attractive people in this movie (other than Yves Montand).But this is one INCREDIBLE story! This is a real white-knuckle story! Every time I wanted to think 'Ok, it's going to be alright now', instead, something else happens to scare me.The fear is not based on special effects, or on eerie music. There are no monsters.Just FEAR. And fear that is tied to money. The Love of Money is the root of all evil, and it will also get you to try to get past your fear.Wages of Fear is an incredible movie. See it from beginning to end. Don't get up for popcorn or sodas or the telephone. Don't take your eyes from the screen, either.

		<shortDescription>The perfect suspense thriller?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wages Of Fear is a damn near perfect suspense thriller. The story concerns four men, broke, desperate, and stranded in a small town somewhere in South America (Venezuela, I presume). They are offered a way out of their miserable existence when an oil well catches fire three hundred miles away and the oil company needs four men to drive the nitroglycerin to the site to blow it out. The trouble is that the three hundred miles they have to drive is some of the most rugged, hostile terrain imaginable.The tension and suspense is palpable during the driving scenes, but what takes this movie to a whole other level is that it takes the time to familiarize the audience with these men. We feel like we know them, and sympathize with them before the journey starts. The whole cast is great and believable, and it wasn't long before I truly forgot I was watching actors in a fictional film. These men made it real, as did the brilliant direction of Henri-Georges Clouzot. Clouzot's style is gritty and realistic, with cuts between the trucks and close-ups of their actions (hands on the shift lever, feet on the pedals, etc) serving to heighten the tension. The lack of a musical score also lends a sense of realism and helps to bring home the sense of loneliness and isolation felt by these men. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You're getting paid to be scared." Just one of the great lines in this great movie. I am constantly amazed at how suspenseful the movie is ... even with repeat viewings. So -- with my more recent viewings (of the excellent Criterion DVD) -- I began to consider some of the themes.What if the men were rich? Would they have not even considered taking the risk? If that is so, then why do very wealthy men and women (like Martha Stewart etc) still take risks engaging in insider trading, accounting scams, and tax evasion? Could it be that some people take risks because ... in addition to the rewards ... they are thrilled by the risks?At one point, Luigi says to Bimba, something like, "After tomorrow, we'll be rich ... if we are still alive. And if we are not, then it is all over anyway." So is this a story about courageous men who risk their lives for money? Or it is a story about men who are prepared to die ... and perhaps prefer to die ... if they cannot get what they want? And is that the attitude that can get us through each day ... and get us what we want? "Do or die?" Or it that the moral position that justifies injuring others to get what we want?What if it were me? Would I have taken the job? At what point would I have given up? Perhaps I would not be afraid of dying. But would I be ruthless...and would I be unwilling to quit when the obstacles appear to be insurmountable?"You don't know what fear is. ... It's catchy like smallpox. And once you get it, it's for life."Why is it that more men than women like this film? The leads are men who face danger. On the other hand, these ruthless and dnagerous men begin to crumble with fear ... not just the fear of dying, but the fear of failing. You'd think that women would appreciate a movie commenting on the foolishness and inconsequence of male fantasies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been hunting this one down for a while until I managed to get my hands on a copy. Luckily it was the original director's cut and not the edited American version. I went into this movie with extremely high expectations and I was not disappointed in the least. The performances were uniformly excellent. I was drawn in by Mario's unfailing tenacity as much as I was repulsed by his willingness to commit a reprehensible act in his drive to accomplish the mission (see the movie to see what I mean). I sympathized with Jo, who, although a whiner and coward, was the wisest of the bunch.The cinematography is alternately beautiful and bleak, capturing the graveness of the situation wonderfully. The oil slick scene is amazing. The tension builds to almost agonizing levels, and then goes a bit further. I'm a Hitchcock fan, but I don't think Hitch ever directed anything that reaches the level of suspense of The Wages of Fear.People have said that they thought the introduction went on too long, but I'd have to disagree. The long introduction serves to firmly establish the characters and give weight to their actions. The full 148-minute version is the one to see if you enjoy strong character development, but the 131-minute version is available for those with less patience.And yes, there is not a happy ending. Some might say it was a letdown. I admit to feeling that way for a minute or two until I started replaying the movie in my mind (and this is a movie that stays with you, guaranteed). I came to appreciate the bleak ending, and in fact, relish it. I found it to be--and I believe that this was the director's intention-- just desserts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has two flaws. The first is some of the logic is screwy; the second is the oilman O'Brien is not a character, he's a grotesque anti-American caricature, in sharp contrast to the beautifully limned characterizations of the protagonists. Neither of these flaws make a whit of difference in my reaction to this film. THE WAGES OF FEAR is all the things others have claimed: an action-packed suspense classic with a strong existential flavor. But, first and foremost, it is a masterful MOVIE. When you watch WAGES as an example of storytelling on film, there isn't a wasted second or a wrong step. The 'slow' first half in the hot little village is never less than exhilirating...you can smell the stale, moist air and taste the salt of your own sweat after an hour of Clouzot's detailed, swooning-from-the-humidity immersion of the audience into this hellish purgatory: by the time O'Brien is looking for drivers, you know exactly why these men are so desperate to risk death to get out. (One man, denied the job, commits suicide; another, who did get the job, may have been murdered by one of our 'heroes'.)The long, long journey they must travel to get their $2000 is unforgettable: every emotion, every frayed nerve-end is exposed during the ordeal. We see these men at their most elemental and vicious and cowardly...but we also see their incredible nobility and love later - when they have gone so far beyond turning back that their hope, their dignity and courage are the only things they have left to combat their fear and despair. Even though none of these things matter when a hard bump on the road will immolate saint and sinner alike, they become the only things that matter; it's a beautiful, timeless message for a film to contain. Those moments in WAGES where we see the men at their best (the scene where Luigi is discovered alive after the blast, Montand's comforting the dying Vanel at journey's end) are even more indelible and affecting than the noirish scenes of the men falling apart from stress - and THOSE are considerably powerful. Remade for no earthly reason I can discern, and another example of how superior French films before the Nouvelle Vague were to those that followed. Godard, Truffaut, Resnais: none of them ever made a film approaching the power or beauty of CHILDREN OF PARADISE, FORBIDDEN GAMES, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or this movie. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whats with the French and Explosives?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILEROverall this is a classic, no doubt! There are some moments where a bit more attention to logic and detail would have hoisted it so much higher around attention risk and explosives.Why they are transporting Nitro long after Nobel had stabilised it to Dynamite is not clear. Seems it was made 'on site' after the Wells Fargo Office incident of 1866. A bit of Cirque Du Soleil wobbling on OHS nightmare planks whilst loading the goods by the 'workers' presages impending events. Generally though it holds up reasonably well until the boulder in the road.It takes much 'golly gosh darn why us?' before note they note they have explosives... (wow!) which would be the first choice of any road builder. Luigi hops up and 'drills a neat hole with a steel bar the size of a mans forearm in the time it takes Bimba who seems to know his stuff, to wobble precariously off the truck with a jerry can of Nitro, and set himself up for a Nitro Head Spliter by syphoning it orally. The 'rope' suspending the hammer is clearly safety fuse but logical they had some with the Nitro but no detonators. Not 'rope'. Now this is lit and suddenly they remember, having backed up the trucks, the 'rock rain'. Too late. This is where Gerard Depardieu in Jean De Florette wears it. Salaud! But given the size of the flask and the position in the sometime porous rock it would be unlikely to project upwards. And miraculously the road is clear bar a black patch of burnt ah... imagination. Now we get to the Luigi and Bimba crater. No sing of the truck or the guys: given blast is going down and forwards in respect of the truck. No metal nothing. They have I think 42 cans each assume 5 gallon each. So about 800 litres. One lunch thermos full produces blast 1 (rock) whilst 42 cans produces blast B. Um. Blast B looks about right sadly given in 2016 we have many Explosives in Truck Bombs in recent history to compare to.Pedantic? Perhaps but otherwise its brilliant. I recall 'Mario running down Jo' years ago as a kid. It stayed with me. OBriens voice in the office sounds like Daniel Plainview (There Will Be Blood 2007), and the sense of trapped listlessness in the town at the start echoes the despair in Heart of Darkness (Conrad) and recalls parts of The Passenger (Antonioni) and goes some way to explaining the behaviour of the characters. All filmed in France too.The ending? A 'moral ending' with the wages of xyz in his pocket was 'correct' if rather illogical &amp; smacked of 'how can we finish this?' Mario oblivious to basic risk having survived the trauma of the scenario and killing Jo, then literally waltzes off the road with his money.Salaud! Oh yeah, the English subs on my version didn't quite reflect some of the abuse hurled in French. I have worked around but not with explosives in mining and have been in a 'rock rain'. A little attention to detail would have made this great movie 'complete'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people argue that it was too slow and/or boring and pointless, i highly disagree with this statement. The first half of the film was very important to show how the characters survived in a dry, empty wasteland. There are no jobs, they are low on food, low on money, and the prices for everything are up the sky. That is why they are desperate to get out, risking their very lives is better than rotting away from hunger and boredom in a dirty corner. And most importantly, it introduces how the characters are in a deep, brilliant way.*Mario is a young, disrespectful foul-mouthed man, but he has the guts and courage enough to do anything in order to return to France. A real though bastard. *Jo is an old ,arrogant man who pretends to be brave, manly and classy. In reality, he is a nostalgic coward, desperate to get out of the hole. *Luigi is a friendly, kind-hearted kinda guy who sometimes acts violent and rude to survive, even when he doesn't wants to hurt anyone and prefers to get along with his relatives and friends. *Bimba is a man that has seen the worst things the world has to offer, many times life has turned it's back to him, but even so he still wants to stay calm and civilized. He doesn't has anything at all, that's why he's capable to do anything.The characters feel real and coherent, the situations are brutal, the stress is high, a truly timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterwork Of Sustained Suspense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Les Diaboliques, The Wages of Fear is one of Henri-Georges Clouzot's best-known works that remains as effective today as it was back during its time of release. Certainly amongst the finest examples of suspense in cinema history, the thrilling manner in which it manages to sustain its nail-biting tension for the majority of its runtime makes it an instant classic.Set in an isolated South American village, The Wages of Fear tells the story of 4 men who in order to escape from their miserable lives accept a handsome-paying but highly-dangerous job of driving two trucks over mountain dirt roads. The trucks are loaded with the extremely volatile nitroglycerine which might go off at the slightest bump, thus required extra attention on the part of the drivers.Co-written &amp; directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the first hour of The Wages of Fear isn't an easy sit for the picture takes its time to introduce &amp; acquaint its characters but once those trucks start moving, every single moment that follows is an edge-of-the-seat stuff for there is a foreboding sense of tension that looms over the film throughout its remaining runtime.Shot in crisp black n white, Cinematography makes excellent use of camera plus its clever execution single-handedly elevated those suspenseful moments to a nerve-wracking level. Editing could've done away with more sequences in the first hour but it's perfect in the later half. Sound design also deserves a mention for it plays a key role in keeping the suspense alive.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck, Folco Lulli &amp; Véra Clouzot, and their input is as commendable as it is valuable to the story although Mrs. Clouzot does go a bit overboard at times. But what impressed me the most about these characters is that each one of them has their own identity, their own history &amp; their own fear plus their chemistry with each other is pretty much spot-on.On an overall scale, The Wages of Fear is certainly amongst the greatest films of the 1950s &amp; is a cinematic treasure whose quality will never be diminished by the test of time. While the first half isn't without its shortcomings, the second half of The Wages of Fear is smartly directed, deftly written, brilliantly photographed, tightly edited &amp; fabulously performed. An ingenious piece of quality storytelling, The Wages of Fear comes thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (Méli?s, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Le salaire de la peur" is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70's, 80's and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries' loads, it has hardly been surpassed.The plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film's deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn't go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel's character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.Apart from that, Clouzot's wife Véra (also well-known from his "Les diaboliques") plays to the "most breathtaking angles" gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno's gin joint. It's a man's world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it's existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in "Salaire" (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere.</fullReview>

The film tells the story of 4 men who go on a suicidal mission have to make nitroglycerin shipments within 300 miles on a hazardous and dangerous road (and as you would expect there were some deaths but I won't give it away for people who didn't see the film yet) which the movie is so suspenseful I think this is also another movie on the suspenseful films that Hitchcock wouldn't have the guts to make list along with Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957), Clouzot's direction of this movie completely changed my perception of cinema forever which for me the most important thing for a movie is not only the story but also the emotions of the characters in a certain genre of film. Yves Montand gave a breakout performance in his first dramatic role in this movie as the lead character Mario who has no job but is just a hobo until he gets hired on the life or death mission along with Jo (played by Charles Vanel), Bimba (played by Peter Van Eyck), and Luigi (played by Folco Lulli) who have no jobs in a poor South American village and unfortunately this movie was snubbed in a lot of categories for which it could have been nominated for an Oscar (and if the film were made today it would have been nominated for some Oscars and possibly win a few). This is a film that should be on every movie lover's to do list of movies to watch because it is certainly worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wages of Fear is Explosive Cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most deeply and disturbingly nihilistic films ever made, as well as one of the most heart-pounding thrillers on record, Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is as much about the origin of manufactured fear as it is about the folly of courage that feeds on it. But as lofty and abstract as Clouzot's allegory may be, his execution is vibrantly physical and immediate. Turning the screws with a relentlessness that impresses even in this age of the ruthless, high-tech thriller, Clouzot strings together situations of vividly, almost sadistically imagined danger. Set in the sunbaked, impoverished, dusty, fictional banana republic of Las Piedras in Latin America that is under the thumb of an American oil company, 'The Wages of Fear' adopts a fable-like form. The town is bursting with desperate foreign derelicts, stranded there without money and who will do anything to earn the price of a ticket back to civilization. When the American oil company needs two truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine to put out a runaway fire at a remote oil-drilling site, a desperate foursome belonging to different points on the map is hired to man the two trucks for 300 miles through a treacherous terrain, at the end of which liberation lies. The wages of their fears will be salvation. The trucks are equipped with nothing more than ordinary spring suspensions. They are only given a 50-50 chance, but are offered good pay ($2,000 for one week of work). Now the excitement begins!When Clouzot's quartet decides to take up the job, the motive is greed and the results are as black a vision of human infidelity as any. The cliff-edge tension is nerve-wracking as they stumble upon one roadblock after another ? a hairpin curve, a boulder on the road, passing through an obstructing pool of oil, riding for long stretches with explosives on roads that are bumpy and finally their own stress. Henri-Georges Clouzot successfully conveys both- situations that shiver with ice- cold suspense and the downbeat theme of fear and its various manifestations, with exceptional stewardship.The Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that not only manages to laugh; it goes grinning into the void. You can do nothing but sit there in sheer awe, waiting for the screen to explode!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a decrepit South American village, men are hired to transport an urgent nitroglycerine shipment without the equipment that would make it safe.Bosley Crowther wrote, "The excitement derives entirely from the awareness of nitroglycerine and the gingerly, breathless handling of it. You sit there waiting for the theatre to explode." (One might think he was explaining the plot of "Speed", but this is far better.) Due to the negative portrayal of the American oil company SOC, the film was accused of anti-Americanism and several scenes were cut for the U.S. release. In 1999, the Criterion Collection released a DVD which included 21 minutes of film which had been removed for the U.S. version. This latter, at 147 minutes, is the one everyone should see.The film brought Clouzot international fame, and allowed him to direct the better-known, if not quite as critically-acclaimed, "Les Diaboliques".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Also, don't shave while riding in a moving vehicle.I just now finished watching this movie, "Wages of Fear," and I'm fairly amazed at how the filmmaker created so much suspense over such a simple idea. I guess a film critic or other expert might spot the technique of it all, but for me it's a mystery, I was truly engaged and even slightly nervous, when (for example) the Dutchman was cautiously siphoning the nitroglycerin into a thermos, and then transferring it into the drilled hole in the rock.How could this be? How could a man doing nothing more than carrying a thermos in the most careful and delicate way, and then slowly trickling a liquid down a stick into a hole, be so suspenseful?I don't know, but it was.Other things had me riveted too, like when a hook on the truck caught onto a cable, both slowing the truck and threatening to collapse the platform at the same time, with several close shots of the turnbuckle straining and coming undone, and the wheels spinning and the truck swerving to the side, almost off the platform, all of it resulting in an avalanche of lumber just behind the rear wheels of the truck.The pool of oil too, complete with the older man almost drowning in it, it was amazing and it was all so simple... it makes you think every movie could achieve that much suspense, instead of the truth, that so few movies do.And I can not stress it enough, do not NOT waltz while driving!Wait until you get home, until you're on the dance floor with that beautiful girl!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French screenwriter, producer and director Henri-Georges Clouzot's ninth feature film which he co-wrote with screenwriter Jérôme Géronimi and co-produced with French film producer Raymond Borderie (1897-1982) and Louis Wipf, is an adaptation of a novel from 1950 by French author Georges Arnaud. It premiered In competition at the 6th Cannes International Film Festival in 1953, was screened In competition at the 3rd Berlin International Film Festival in 1953 and is a France-Italy co-production which was shot on location in Camargue, south of the ancient metropolis of Arles in Southern France. It tells the story about four men who are located in an isolated and desert South American town called Las Piedras which is marked by high unemployment and poverty. After a fire in an oil well at an old field owned by a South American Oil company, the Oil company announces that they are seeking young men to carry out a mission that the employees at the Oil Company are able to do themselves, but has evaluated as too risky. Motivated by the appealing assurance an uncommonly high salary, numerous men who perceives the task as a golden opportunity eagerly volunteers, and out of this group the four men named Bimba, Jo, Luigi and Mario are chosen to transport two trucks loaded with fuel containers which are filled with highly explosive nitroglycerin to the oil field in order to put out the flames.Distinctly and engagingly directed by French filmmaker Henri-Georges Clouzot (1907-1977), this exceedingly suspenseful fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a riveting and incisive portrayal of how four men's personalities alters when they embark on a long, sweltering and hazardous journey that bares promises of a brighter future. While notable for it's naturalistic rural milieu depictions, prominent black-and-white cinematography by French actor and cinematographer Armand Thirard (1899-1973) and use of sound, this adventurous and existentialistic low-budget film which examines themes like friendship, capitalism and greed, depicts several condensed studies of character and contains a good score by French 20th century film score and classical composer Georges Auric (1899-1983).This often humorous, somewhat romantic and pervasive psychological drama from the early 1950s, where a man from the Netherlands, a man from Italy and two men from France are driven to the edge of their sanity by the notion of wealth and a voluntary suicide mission, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, quick-witted dialog, substantial character development, the poignant acting performances by Italian-born French actor and singer Yves Montand (1921-1991), French actor Charles Vanel (1892-1989), Italian actor Folco Lulli (1912-1970), German-born American actor Peter van Eyck (1911-1969) and the fine supporting acting performance by Brazilian-born French actress Véra Clouzot (1913-1960) in her debut feature film role. A memorable thriller which gained, among other awards, the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film at the 6th Cannes Film Festival in 1953, the Golden Bear at the 3rd Berlin Film Festival in 1953 and the BAFTA Award for Best Film from any Source at the 9th British Academy Film Awards in 1955.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clouzot French "Hitchock" 1953 Oil Thriller Grand Prize Cannes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wages of Fear (1953) Henri Georges Clouzot (the French "Hitchock" who directed this thriller as well as wrote the script) gives us this tense and suspenseful drama about four men so desperate for freedom that they willingly risk their lives to deliver a dangerous cargo. In a small, isolated, hot and dusty Central American village, there's only one thing to do: dream of getting out. An opportunity for escape presents itself -- but only to those with nerves of steel. An American oil company has offered to pay big bucks to get two trucks filled with nitroglycerin over to a well fire. The catch: the unpaved terrain contains enough bumps and crags to make the unstable material explode... and instantly kill the driver. Nonetheless, the company has many applicants hungry for work, and a quartet of the coolest are chosen. But even these stalwart men will discover that fear of their deadly payload can ignite even the most frozen emotion. The film has a strong cool theme of fear and its manifestations. This is the restored full length version. Now this film works better as a thriller than as a political comment. Originally much was said about the films anti American sentiments. This is a strong exciting involving film. From my point of view (of watching a lot of foreign films) I wish he had hired some actors from Spain or Mexico that spoke real Spanish rather than use Americans and their Gringo Spanish learned lines. Yves Montand, is in this film in his first dramatic role. Charles Vanel gives an excellent portrait of an aging man feeling fear and resignation. William Friedkin remade "The Wages of Fear" as "Sorcerer" in 1977 and it was a technically better film as he has much more resources. This film has great black and white cinematography and shows us the French master in its arranging of scenes and editing. It would not be fair to mention how this picture ends, other than to say that the conclusion is deliberate and ironical by today's today's standards. 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Felt An Explosion Of Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered to be a classic of French cinema and currently ranked at number 165 on the IMDb Top 250 I went in to THE WAGES OF FEAR with very high expectations especially since the version I was going to watch was the director's cut running at almost two and a half hours . After seeing it I have to admit I felt rather disappointed by it There's a good story at the core . A handful of men are paid by an oil company to transport nitroglycerin through a South American jungle . Nitroglycerin as you might know is a highly volatile explosive substance . Shake it about then it's BOOM BANG and there's not enough of you left to have a proper funeral , only a memorial service . If you don't know this don't worry because there's a scene where someone points out how dangerous nitro is . This does lead to the question if it's so dangerous then why use it ? Surely dynamite is a much more stable explosive for putting out oil fires . As it turned out I consulted Wikipedia and indeed nitroglycerin is the explosive of choice for putting out oil fires and has been ever since oil fires have happened . I guess you have to overlook otherwise there wouldn't be a story The problem is there just isn't enough of a story justifying a film lasting two and a half hours . The first half hour is taken up with introducing the characters and everything moves with a slow languid pace . Then after that we get to the story proper of men driving trucks with a highly explosive cargo down bumpy third world dirt tracks . Director Henri-Georges Clouzot does very well in convincing us the action is taking place in South America when in fact it was filmed entirely in France but I didn't think he achieved much else . For a story involving characters whose lives could end in a blink of an eye at any moment there's a singular lack of tension , I know it's not the fault of the director but the version I saw had some dodgy subtitles where when characters speak English the words appearing on screen aren't matching what is being said by the characters which led me to wonder if the French and Spanish translations are also similarly mistranslated . Regardless of that point I still felt short changed by THE WAGES OF FEAR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off very captivating and interesting and then goes downhill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the first half of this, despite the pace very engaging in its slow, languid style, punctuated by some very captivating images. Vera Clouzot crawling around, cleaning the dirty floor with her half-crazed mannerisms is surprisingly sexy. The sense of boredom, heat, dirt, desolation and despair is palpable and convincing.The second half of the film is surprisingly formulaic and predictable. It starts off with some nerve-wracking Hitchcockian scenes they soon loose their suspense. I had a pretty good idea what was to become of the drivers and was pretty much unsurprised by turn of events.The conclusion is unbelievable and bordering on stupid with it's anti-Hollywood ending.I think this movie would have been a lot more interesting if it stayed in the god-forsaken town and didn't attempt to venture out into the world of suspense. Still, a striking debut for a director, just a bit overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, this is why we love IMDb. A cheap snuff film posing as an art film, somehow manages to rake in some decent ratings from viewers who have the audacity to voice their uninformed opinions, which mostly involve obsessing over how believable something is in every technical way possibly, while a truly suspenseful film like WAGES OF FEAR garners a mere above average B rating score. This is an example of a suspense film done well. One must appreciate Clouzot's knack for drawing his audience into the drama. From the scenes at the cantina to the road scenes, his mise en scene is rich and fully realized. One can easily smell the danger in the air and the texture of the road. The characters are strongly developed to the point where we actually care about what happens to them. This to me is much more compelling than a chase sequence. It's the silent tension created from one who is trying to manage what he may not have the power to control.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nitroglycerin thrill ride causes a lot of horror and overwhelming suspense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To borrow from Col. Needham's synopsis: "In the South American jungle supplies of nitroglycerin are needed at a remote oil field. The oil company pays four men to deliver the supplies in two trucks. A tense rivalry develops between the two sets of drivers and on the rough remote roads the slightest jolt can result in death."And thus, the wheels are set for a road trip you'll never forget--provided you're able to sit through the nerve-racking suspense director Clouzet sets up once the wheels hit the road.The story is really a combination of character study and shattering suspense once it gets underway. As some have already said, it does take its time to set up the situation. Once the set-up is made, it's an endurance test some viewers will find hard to bear. Obstacles are thrown into the driver's way at every turn, including a pool of oil that one of the men has to wade through in order to help truck driver Yves Montand get across it. What happens in this sequence is the high point of suspense and horror, easily one of the most difficult situations the audience has to sit through in order to reach the downbeat ending. I feel sure American audiences would have appreciated eliminating the final turn of events for the surviving driver, but that's the only objection I have to the plot's final twist.The grim tale is told in the most realistic manner possible and the cast is excellent. In a way, it's the sort of achievement that John Huston had with the men facing difficult obstacles in "Treasure of the Sierra Madre." Summing up: Unbearable suspense makes it hard to sit through once the nitroglycerin trucks are on the road because the nail-biting suspense is overwhelmingly powerful. A masterpiece of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate, 300-mile long, reality show from Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I wonder which movies of our era people will be still watching 100 years from now, WOF is the first one coming to my mind. A masterful study on the most basic of human emotions, probably the first we know when arriving in this world and the last we'll leave behind: pure, naked to the bones, unmitigated fear. The plot is simple: four men volunteer to truck hundreds of gallons of nitroglycerin along the 300 miles of a dirt road, to be used to extinguish an oil rig fire. And they'll do it because they are all Europeans stranded in an Amazonian shanty town; men desperate to go back home and the $2000 U.S. they'll be paid each for the job will make that possible.Fear is the single topic here, even if you may get confused after watching the first hour, which may seem slow and uneventful. But there's where the story is being set, where the characters are introduced. We come to know Mario, the Corsican pretty boy way too full of himself; Luigi, the jovial, ebullient, honest Italian cook. Bimba, the cynical but reliable Dutch survivor of Nazi camps; and Jo, the French tough cookie, an ageing gangster. They are all stranded in that Amazonian hellhole where they are looked upon as tramps even by the raggedy locals. That explains why they would ever risk their lives in that job. And then the trip and the thrill starts with no let up until the journey's complete; even after that.Many movies have tense moments, moments of fear, of terror. Well, the moment of terror here is just one, but one lasting one hour. How different you see life when each of your moments can be the last, every breath your one left, every thought your definitive! That, I think, resumes what WOF is all about. Beautiful cinematography, even in B/W--I loved the dancing shadows of tree trunks at the beginning of the trip--a pace that doesn't let up, and a gritty depiction of proceedings. This is not about being fearless, mind you, but about doing a job while being scared to death.WOF has a few intentional flaws, with the purpose of emphasizing the men's desperate mood &amp; situation, their isolation. The first: why a company that is losing tons of money in that oil rig fire doesn't bother sending trucks with explosives and construction stuff ahead of the foursome, to clean up the road of boulders and emergency fix structures in need of repairing? Why won't SOC bother issuing the men a two-way radio to be kept informed of their progress? These yanks are cheap but they aren't stupid. Another flaw, of technical nature, concerns the suspended platform. The trucks didn't need to go all the way into it. Truckers don't do that. They just go a bit back, then forth, back again, turning a bit every time. But if they had done so we wouldn't have had those intense moments of both trucks hanging over the abyss. Also, someone pointed out that pipelines don't carry oil in that state and, while a total ignorant on that matter, I agree. There is no pump strong enough to push oil that thick along miles--but a water-clear pool of oil wouldn't have made possible the most dramatic sequence of the movie. Other flaws are not so intentional.A major flaw concerns the character of Linda, which looks superfluous to me. At that time there was usually no place for women in such a plot, except as love interests for men, waiting for their guy(s) at the end of the line or as simple toys for sexual relief. Anyway, here she's eye candy more than anything else; but already at 40, Clouzot looks way too old to play an urchin less than half her age-?judging by her body language and overall behavior--and her jumping of the truck looks silly rather than moving. Another flaw concerns Jo's sudden metamorphosis from toughie to pussy. The same guy who hours before calmly stared down the barrel of a gun in the hands of his enemy, who rudely took out the competition, turns into a chicken just moments into the trip. Such a transformation, while not impossible if well developed, lacks credibility as seen here. I also see as a minor flaw the fact that we are given so little background on the men. We know more or less their past but not of their journey to this place. On the other hand I disagree with the dance and drive ending being a flaw. Linda's dance is open to discussion but for Mario that conclusion makes all psychological sense. He feels he has defeated Death and now he wants to run &amp; roll over his enemy's body. He has loosen up, he is exultant, euphoric; but most of all, he's tired--and that brings up the logical outcome. Anyway, one to keep. 9/10.BTW, I disagree with the journey being such a revelation of characters. The men, except for Jo, work as a team. That's what people usually do in such situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four men, including Yves Montand and Peter van Eyck, are desperately down and out in an unnamed South American country. They're hired by an oil company to drive two massive trucks through rough and dangerous territory with loads of unstable nitroglycerin. The two trucks depart with sirens screaming, warning away the town's residents just in case the nitro decides it doesn't want to wait to reach its destination.And what a trip it is. From corduroy roads through collapsing wooden bridges to impossible changes in direction. The four men don't get along well either. This isn't the story of four ordinary goes performing heroic deeds. They bitch and squabble their way through the jungle and over the mountains.I've checked the "spoilers" box but I don't think I'll lay out the ending anyway. This is one of those films where some of the suspense depends on our not knowing how things will turn out.This isn't some dark European drama, shot on a shoe string budget in the dark, drenched in philosophy. No monolingual English speaker should be put off by watching an old black-and-white movie with subtitles. For one thing, the characters sometimes lapse into English. For another, there isn't all THAT much dialog to begin with. And finally, the film itself is so filled with tension and action that the subtitles soon become ground instead of figure.If the plot sounds familiar, by the way, it's because you may have seen it before, if you watched William Friedkin's 1977 "Sorcerer." Hollywood has a way of remaking movies involving adventure, action, or gripping mysteries, if they've been successful in other countries. And why not? American stars are bankable, more money can be spent on visual effects, and the English remake can dispense with those noisome subtitles. The fact that very few copies are as good as the originals -- and certainly not as inventive -- makes no difference. Not if another nickel can still be squeezed out of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Thriller That Takes Time to Start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear follows the lives of four men who agree to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerin for an oil company to put out the fire on a derrick that has been burning for days without stopping. These are men without prospects or hope who've found themselves in a little South American village without money and jobs, who only dream of leaving and whom no one will miss if they die. That's what makes them so suitable for the oil company: they're dispensable.This is a fascinating premise for a suspenseful thriller. But Clouzot took too much time setting up the situation. The movie begins with impressive realistic shots of an ordinary day in a poverty-stricken, forsaken hell-hole where everyone is semi-naked or dirty, jobless, and suffering from the heat. It's a picture of filth, squalor and cruelty. But Clouzot's camera just keeps shooting filth, squalor and cruelty for almost an hour before the actual action starts. He made his point ten minutes into the movie, the rest was just pointless.I grew tired of the first hour because it lasted two long. But I also grew tired of Linda (played by the mediocre Vera Clouzot), the only female character in the movie, and the love interest of the main character, Mario (an amazing performance by Yves Montand). Watching the movie, I remember fearing Clouzot would find some way of putting her inside one of the trucks. Fortunately that didn't happen and once the four men leave the village, I didn't have to suffer Vera until the disappointing ending again.After the first hour the movie becomes thrilling; it becomes not only a fast-paced adventure thriller but also a meditation of courage, cowardice, the value of human life, the friendship and hatred that arises between men in difficult situations, and human ruthlessness. Clouzot does not portray mankind in a bright light. People, he says, under the lure of money, can and will do anything to succeed.Although Yves Montand was the main character, my hats are off to Charles Vanel for playing Jo, arguably the most complex character in the movie. Jo shows up in the little village and quickly fascinates Mario with his grace and calm demeanor under pressure. One can even say Mario worships him, following him everywhere around. But during the journey Jo reveals to be nothing but a coward, shattering Mario's illusions. Jo is fascinating because even though he's a coward and a hazard for the mission, there's something familiar in him that should draw sympathy and compassion from any person.The ending is a disappointment, like every movie by Clouzot I've seen tends to be. He seems to put happy endings where unhappy endings should be, unhappy ones in the place of happy ones, and moral ones where ambiguous ones should be. It's very strange. All I know is the ending left me wandering what was the point. These complaints aside, I enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"To get that bonus, they'll carry the entire charge on their backs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot captured the mantle of "The Master of Suspense" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing mostly to his two most recognised thrillers, 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' It's a difficult title to live up to, but Clouzot knows precisely what he's doing, even if he seems to lack Hitchcock's distinctive sense of showmanship. What I've always loved about cinema is its ability to manipulate reality, to elicit genuine emotions from situations that, in real life, would seem mundane, or even ridiculous. An example I've used before, I believe, is Tarkovsky's 'Stalker (1979),' in which a peaceful and benign forest is inexplicably transformed into an environment of intense mystery and foreboding. Now consider 'The Wages of Fear,' when actor Peter van Eyck funnels what is probably water into a drilled hole in the rock. There's zero suspense in this simple act of pouring. However, taken within the context of the story, this water suddenly becomes nitroglycerine, and I got sore fingers from gripping the chair so tightly.'The Wages of Fear' contains two particular sequences that rival anything Hitchcock ever did in terms of suspense. In the first, to which I briefly alluded above, a small amount of nitroglycerine is utilised to demolish a huge boulder blocking the road, the slightest lapse in concentration certain to lead to disaster. In the second, Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) wallow pathetically in a deepening pool of crude oil, drowning in the black tar of America's capitalistic greed {the motif of oil epitomising greed is not an uncommon one in cinema, and most recently turned up in P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood (2006)'}. What I think prevents Clouzot's film from being truly brilliant is the opening half-hour or so, which is not only unsuspenseful, but damn near uninteresting. Of course, I suppose, it's important to note the changes that take place in the characters both before and after their new job ? the dominating Joe quickly reveals his cowardice, and the sycophantic Mario takes over the role of boss ? but Hitchcock, at least, would have made these introductions far more compelling.Towards the film's ending, I have conflicting emotions. On the one hand, it is a wonderful masterwork of cinematography and editing, as Mario's driving is intercut with the waltz of his acquaintances back in town, to the tune of Strauss' "The Blue Danube." There's an astonishing momentum to the camera movements; we foresee what is about to happen at least a minute before Montand's character does, but are powerless to stop it. He carries on his Dance Macabre (a figurative "waltz with death") until he loses control of the truck, begetting a spectacular, fiery plummet over the cliff edge. On the other hand, the entire incident ? however satisfying filmically ? doesn't seem like a natural progression of the narrative, possessing the air of a conclusion affixed only to achieve a surefire audience reaction. Unfortunately, similar cases of characters acting illogically litter the story, providing what might be described as mere cheap thrills: Mario continues to reverse the truck even after being told to stop, and Luigi, at one point, ludicrously decides to run towards an impending explosion rather than away from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say -- this is a fairly simple but excellent movie that has become a classic and is rightly considered must-see viewing by many movie buffs. And as far as existentialism goes, it's a lot more fun to watch this than to read one of Sartre's brain hemorrhagers. The plot is super-simple -- a bunch of pennyless adventurers are hired to drive two trucks loaded with nitroglycerine to a drilling site where it is desperately needed to blow out a fire. It's essentially like Smokey And The Bandit, only with nitrogylcerine instead of beer. Beat that, Burt Reynolds.The characters come across as realistic and intriguing, though not necessarily as terribly affable. I particularly liked Peter von Eyck as Bimba the German. The only scene I didn't like was when they had to back up their lorries onto a bridge-like construction ending over an abyss, because I thought it was contrived and overly dramatic.I've heard from two persons who saw this back in the day when it came out, one said that they almost couldn't bear the tension, the other that it changed their perspective through its bleak existentialism. I'm just remarking this to give you an idea how this movie was originally received.Finally, they really did a good job of making the South of France look like South America!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut, gruelling lesson in suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few thrillers that can turn a very simple premise in a diatribe in suspense and terror and in that aspect I think it is important that a film like Wages of Fear is celebrated for both its effectiveness and its simplicity. Whereas others will seek the causality of their thriller in convoluted plots, police procedurals, supernatural killers and what not, Wages of Fear is content to be inspired and firmly grounded in reality. Four unemployed foreigners, trapped without visas somewhere in Latin America, are hired by an American oil company to drive two trucks filled with tons of nitroglycerin that is needed to kill the fire in a burning derrick. The wage is $2,000 each; a getaway ticket and a promise of luxury. But at what cost? The wages of fear indeed.At the hands of a lesser director, the premise could have been handled in a workmanlike way, with a movie-of-the-week attitude. Clouzot instead spends the first 50 minutes setting up a very believable world for the rest of the movie to unfold into. Not only is every player given his due shades of characterization, but their motives (escape from Latin America and money) become fully understood. The small town they live in is depicted as a living hell of sorts. Full of mosquitos, the scorching weather, impoverished natives, malaria, little food and money. The set-up is so expertly handled that the decision the characters have to make (take the job or not) becomes painfully obvious.And then comes the bulk of the movie. A grueling lesson in suspense that would make even Hitchcock himself green with envy. As if driving a ticking bomb through bumpy roads isn't enough, everything else that can go wrong does. Clouzot adds another layer of hard-hitting realism by making both the obstacles the characters have to overcome and their efforts to do so utterly believable and as hard as they appear to be. The total absence of music only enforces this sort of pain-staking realism. Even if it appears to be a little far-fetched at times; it's still a movie after all. But it's so far removed from the studio melodramas of the 50's that it shines by comparison. Just think of the relationship Mario, one of the drivers, has with a poor girl. What appears to be the requisite love story is turned on its head and becomes one of abuse and need. There's no "I love you/ I love you too" schmaltz to be found here. Some people may be too eager to accuse Clouzot of misogyny but I wonder where the line stops; is it the screenwriter, the director or simply what this character is all about. The way Mario treats the girl might leave an unpleasant aftertaste in one's mouth, but sometimes that's how life is. All the Hollywood sugar-coating in the world can't change that.A perfect companion piece to this kind of solid 50's film-making would be John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre, if the analogy has any merit. As a testament to the movie's absorbing power, I was glued to the screen for every one of 146 nail-biting minutes. Truly a classic thriller that stands up to close scrutiny and remains one of the best, 55 years later?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nerve-wracking and magnificent, and the anti-American oil stuff now just seems quaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wages of Fear is a magnificent thriller, the last hour-and-a-half of which will have you chewing your nails up to your wrists. The first hour is interesting but, to my mind, a bit slow. We spend a lot of time getting to know the squalor of Las Piedras. The anti-American point of view now just seems quaint. Las Piedras is a tiny South American (or possibly Central American) town that reeks of poverty and bakes in the hot sun. Children with sores, tired donkeys and mangy dogs fill the dirt streets. It's the final stop for down-and-outers whose only hope is to find work with the Southern Oil Company (you can infer SOC easily is a stand-in for Standard Oil), which dominates the place. "Americans here? You kidding?" says one man. "If there's oil around they're not far behind," says his companion. SOC has a headquarters office in Las Piedras; the oil field is 300 miles away. Into this fly-infested hole arrives Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough, middle-aged French gangster out of luck and out of cash. He encounters Mario (Yves Montand), a ne'er-do-well in his twenties from Corsica who's stuck in Las Piedras. Mario does odd jobs to make enough money for meals and whiskey, beds and takes for granted the young woman who works at the town's cantina, and longs to get out of the place and back to Paris. The two of them bond in a way, the confident tough guy and the young, not-quite- amoral thug-in-training. The shifting relationship between these two is what drives the story; that they can get blown sky high at any moment after the first hour is what keeps us watching. When an oil fire erupts at a well head, Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs), the local American SOC boss, decides to send containers of nitroglycerin in two trucks from Las Piedras over three hundred miles of rocky, pot-holed road to put out the fire. He'll hire two men per truck and pay $2,000 per man for those who get through. The one drawback is that nitro is notoriously unstable, will explode in heat and if jostled and the trucks have no safety equipment. The visa-less bums, last chancers and sweating drunks stuck in Las Piedras line up. These are men who are so close to being the dregs of humanity you won't want to spend time standing next to them. You're not going to hire those tramps, one of O'Brien's subordinates says to him. O'Brien makes clear the film's point of view regarding American oil companies. "Those bums," he says, "don't have a union or any families, and if they blow up no one will come around for contributions." And so fifty-six minutes into the movie, Jo and Mario in one truck and Bimba (Peter van Eyck), a blond German, and Luigi (Folco Lulli), a happy Italian dying of lung disease from working in the SOC's cement operation, set off in their trucks. Even they begin to have second thoughts when they watch how slowly and carefully the jerry-cans of nitro are loaded. From now on we're in the cabs of those two trucks, sweating with the heat and our nerves. The road cuts through baking semi-desert, filled with potholes and rocks, and over mountains covered with scrub, shale and boulders. We've got to get through the washboard, a long stretch of dusty road carved into ruts by the wind. If the trucks keep going at 40 miles an hour, all is fine. Go under 40, "boom." Go over and "boom." There's a hairpin turn high on a mountain so sharp the trucks have to back onto a wooden platform to turn around. We find out the wood is rotten and the platform is shaky. There's a boulder as big as a truck that will have to be blasted apart...but only by using some of the nitro in a hazardous improvisation that requires siphoning, a falling hammer and a lit fuse. And worst of all is a large, expanding and deep pool of oil which will have to be driven through. By now we've come to know, if not especially like, these four men. Luigi is strong, coarse and relatively happy. Bimba is resourceful but fatalistic enough to make you a little nervous. Jo? He turns out not to be so tough after all, while Mario becomes the senior partner of the two, and determined enough to run a truck over a man's leg. How many survive? You'll need to see the movie. The ending is just right. Considering the passion French intellectuals have always had for smoking their Gauloises and condemning what they term American cultural and economic imperialism, Henri-Georges Clouzot makes his points but never at the expense of his film. The first hour may have messages to give, but they're understated and never smack anyone over the head. (However, the movie was cut by nearly an hour for it's initial American release. In addition to losing a fair amount of time in Las Piedras, all those anti-American swipes somehow disappeared.) The journey on the two trucks is so continuously gripping that any messages early on fall to the side of the road. Yves Montand, in one of his earliest movies, and Charles Vanel, an old hand, dominate The Wages of Fear. For those who recall Vanel only as the wily, good- humored police inspector in Clouzot's Diabolique, you're in for a master-class in the versatility of a first-class actor. The Wages of Fear is a classic, powerful adventure of men placed at risk by their needs and their natures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>42. WAGES OF FEAR (french-italian-thriller, 1953) A young Corsican, Mario (Yves Montand), an aging Parisian, a German and a fatally ill Italian are stranded (penniless) in a backward South American village. Close to the edge of damnation they all desperately seek a way out. The owner of an American-based fuel company offers the men $2 000 to transport 2 truckloads of nitroglycerin over a 300 treacherous-mountainous miles. Though the feat is wrought with danger, the men are desperate to get their money no matter what.Critique: This is regarded as the greatest suspense thriller ever made, and once you see it you'll probably agree. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot adapted the screenplay from a novel by Georges Arnaud, creating a totally realistic world full of poverty and despair. The people living in this wretched part of the world aren't fazed, however, as their spirits remain strong. The principal's efforts to rise above it all, though heroic, prove ultimately fatal. Clouzot creates a couple of tremendously unforgettable scenes: the men pushing their trucks over dilapidated bridges, across mountains, broken down roads, and an oil well. Like no other film since we feel the desperation and dismay the characters go through. The ending is a bit of a letdown, further reinforcing Clouzot's pessimistic nature.QUOTE: Jo: "I'm trying to remember. The fence. . .what there was behind the fence. There's nothing!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most powerful films of all time. It was made during the time of the French new wave and existentialism thus you can only guess at the ending, it probably has a Sartrean twist. So simple a story and yet so metaphorically rich, it weaves together an element that all humans share, mainly living with each other and death. The direction and story line is flawless and I only wish it was longer to enjoy more the vibrant quality that this film has possessed. It deals with a South American town where people of all nationalities are stuck like flies on a glue paper. Everyone wants to get out but they don't have the means or money to, work is sparse. An oil fire occurs far away at one of the oil pumping stations and the only way to put it out is to ship Nitro to it in trucks. Noticing the danger of the job, many men risk their lives for a chance at destiny. We have Yves Montand as Mario, a young thug who is cool and keen, he hooks up with Jo (Charles Vanel) as a tough guy old man who looses his bravery once it is put to the test in the desolate jungles and back road mountains. Peter van Eyck as Bimba, a man who is not afraid to die because he has already seen it in a Nazi prison work camp. Folco Lulli is Luigi, a kind hearted and durable proletarian who is dying of rotten lungs. In one memorable scene in the bar, he is given a gun by Jo and says he will not shoot him because, "I am not a murderer". These characters are merely human in all they represent, in their weaknesses, in their flaws. We can't help but endear to all of them.The driving scenes are some of the best ever, there is excitement only because the voyage is still unknown and perhaps there is a foreshadowing that these men might not make it. It is a universal story, something so elementary and wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We had the opportunity of watching the wonderful Criterion DVD with the director's cut recently. This version is what the director intended us to show, since the version that was released commercially was shorter. We had seen the film years ago and frankly, we were more impressed then than now. Don't get us wrong, "Le salaire de la peur", Henri Georges Clouzot's has a lot to admire. The previous copy that we saw must have been the one that was cut for its American distribution. The film was deemed anti-American at the time it made its debut.Clouzot, like most of his contemporaries, had clear ideas about how they perceived American corporations overseas. Which is the case he makes with the oil company drilling in what appears to be Mexico, or a Central American country. Clouzot shows us a dusty town in the middle of nowhere where a group of mainly European expatriates, idle their time in the oppressing heat with nothing to do.It's into this milieu we come upon when the film opens. We are taken to the local cantina, where the men go to hang out. When Jo, a French man on the other side of the law arrives, he finds a fast friend in Mario, who appears to be the leader of the men we meet. Mario, who is much younger, yearns to go back to Paris. His wish is such that he has kept a ticket for the Metro to remind him of his beloved city.Jo, who has been friends with Bill, the American administrator, goes to see him to see about a job. What he proposes is something different, he needs four men, for two trucks that will bring badly needed nitroglycerin to a drilling site about 300 miles away. The road is treacherous and the drivers must bear in mind that any little thing will make their cargo explode and kill them.Mario is chosen to be in one truck with another man, who never shows up at the appointed time. Jo, appears instead. The other truck will have Luigi and Bimba. The four men don't realize the size of the task they must undergo and the dangers along the road.Clouzot's cut added the scenes in town in the cantina. Linda, the bar maid and the lover of the owner, is played by Vera Clouzot. The role appears to be superfluous since she doesn't add anything to what we are going to see, slowing the action. Once the men are on the road, a different movie emerges.The great Yves Montand plays Mario. It was his first starring role and he impresses with his virile looks and his no nonsense approach to his character. Charles Vanel, another excellent French actor makes the most out of his Jo. Jean Gabin, who was supposed to have played Jo, declined because he felt he didn't want to appear as a loser to his adoring fans; his loss was Charles Vanel's gain. Peter Van Eyck and Folco Lulli are seen as Bimba and Luigi, the second truck drivers.The transfer to the Criterion DVD has been done with extreme care because the film still has a great look. Clouzot made an excellent thriller that even after more than fifty years still moves us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nail destroying tension, a fine cast and super sour direction make this 50s French thriller an unmissable classic An extraordinarily gripping thriller from Henri-Georges Clouzot that establishes and maintains a level of tension rarely equalled elsewhere in cinema. He starts in a South American bar where poverty drives the men to fight for any jobs going. Four of the men agree to drive a consignment of nitroglycerine across a tortuous 300-mile jungle road to an American-owned oil refinery. They're not much of a team, each driven by greed, but they have to work together if they're to survive without being blown up by their cargo. Clouzot, though, isn't interested in Hollywood-type happy endings and, from the start, you're aware that there's no guarantee that any of the drivers will reach their destination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the things I enjoyed about wages of fear was the way in which it simultaneously established and yet refused to be defined or determined by the personality of its characters. We have the main character, whose typically youthful and laid-back demeanor, along with his vigor and his sexual energy, bely (or perhaps subtly express) the capability towards ruthlessness, a zeal that carries with it a more brutal taint when necessary and that reveals itself only later when the tensions become more and more pronounced. We have Jo, the shady new arrival, whose initial calculating coldness, especially when juxtaposed with the florid main character's vibrancy and sense of camaraderie, metamorphosizes into an aged feebleness, as well as a more paralyzing anxiety that reflects his maturity compared to the young and headstrong leading role. We have ___, perhaps, initially, one of the most mysterious characters, whose slightly sociopathic and violent tendencies, we learn later, arose from his three year internship in a nazi labor camp. To the question "how old are you?" he responds "I'm 100 years old; sometimes it only takes a few months to age 100 years." (continued in next paragraph)</fullReview>

It draws you in with compelling, three-dimensional characters, then places them in a situation that imperils both their lives and sanity. And it takes the audience along for the ride. Clouzet's direction is masterful and all of the performances are right on. The setup is fairly simple: four men with nothing to lose but their lives agree to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerine through some of the most desolate and dying backroads that the unnamed third world setting has to offer. Their obstacles each provide a tense scene that has you on the edge of your seat, giving seven or eight scenes more intense than any in your average thriller. From what I've read, this film was butchered upon initial US release due to its harsh portrayal of third world interests, so beware the chopped up version.

		<fullReview>The first quarter of this movie was not particularly exciting but did set the stage for the rest of the movie. So, if you initially feel bored--STICK WITH IT!!! The plot is so incredibly simple that it seems like it must be a pretty boring picture: an oil company in South America needs to transport shipments of nitroglycerin 300 miles to an oil fire ASAP. However, due to the rotten condition of the roads and equipment, the trip seems like certain death, so they get some hungry out of work guys to do this. It doesn't sound very interesting, I'm sure, but it is. The writing, editing, pacing, acting and direction are PERFECT during this LONG trip. So many times, I found myself tensing up or moving in my seat as each near-death event occurred. The only negative? Well, the ending might be a bit of a letdown for some (though, in hindsight, I liked it despite being a bit of an anticlimax).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense lesson in suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henri-Georges Clouzot is probably most famous for his atmospheric mystery drama 'Les Diaboliques', but just as good is this film; Wages of Fear. The film gives a commentary on the things that people will do for money, and it follows a treacherous journey across South America for two two-men teams of truckers transporting nitroglycerine across the continent for an American oil company, on the promise of $2000 when they reach their destination. The men taking this task on know very well what the risks are, but they decide to do it anyway just because they need the dough. Rather than just feeding us this premise, however, the great maestro has opted to make sure that we fully understand the situation that our protagonists are in. The first hour of the film just sees the main characters in their native village, scrimping and slowly killing themselves just to make enough money to live on. These guys have to drink lemonade when they go to their local drinking establishment, and this image of themselves is putting them on the back foot further still, as no one in the town will employ the people that they see as tramps. This back building gives the audience something that the main crux of the story wouldn't have otherwise; and that's understanding from the audience.Once the action starts properly, Clouzot really lets rips with his awesome directorial talent. Like he did with Les Diaboliques two years later; he really shows that he knows the meaning of suspense. The nitroglycerine loaded trucks in the movie could explode with the slightest vibration, and once again Clouzot makes sure that you understand the situation. The movie firmly balances itself on a short string, and any minute the leads could go up in flames; which gives the action a very potent degree of tension and suspense at all times, even when there isn't all that much going on. There are some very good stunts in the movie, however, and things such as the oil lake and the huge boulder in the middle of the road represent the best of them. The characters are both well introduced and well rounded, and Clouzot has given each of the four main men in the film their own distinctive character and because of the extensive situation building that the director gave us towards the start of the movie, we always care for them; which helps the movie no end when it comes to the more touching moments of the story. On the whole, this is a GREAT motion picture. It's a lesson in suspense and it's a film that anyone who considers themselves to be a fan of thrillers should see.</fullReview>

Supposedly the trucks must either travel at least 40 MPH or less than 6 MPH on the cement road, yet they both go from over 40 MPH to a dead stop on the cement. Even worse was the scene where the trucks were forced to take a sharp u-turn. I was screaming at the stupidity of the characters when they insisted on backing an EXTRA 30 feet out onto the wooden platform after they had already turned around enough to continue forward. You don't need to be an experienced truck driver to see this. I could not believe all of the praise for these "suspenseful" scenes on the comments posts for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>forget the suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clouzot was a very strange director. Even he admitted that he used suspense as a device to examine his characters. Only Diabolique seems to have any real suspense. The nitro in this film is used the same as the letters in The Raven and the murder in Quai Des Ouvres: he is up to his old tricks of immersing you in the rot and smell of existence: buzzards, spitting, smoke coming disgustingly out of noses during a kind of Russian Roulette, etc. Only one other film do you feel the sheer heat of a place as much as this: Stray Dog. Nineteen Fifty three was more or less around the apotheosis of Existentialism, And Clouzot hardly needed a bedside copy of Being and Nothingness for his handbook. This film, because of it's length, has the greatest wealth of his bodily references.... Even down to Vera Clouzot's underarm hair: you see a flash of it as she raises her hands in a dance turn with Folco Lulli, and how often do you ever see a woman's underarms not shaved, even in French Films, much less anywhere else. For those who found the film suspenseful, fine. I didn't. Not at its heart, anyway. That would be like saying Polanski's Repulsion was suspenseful. Both are films of immersion, descents into madness and chaos. And now here is a spoiler: if you do not want to know how the movie ends, bye bye. The end is ludicrous. But then so are most in his films. None of them hold up very well, with the possible exception of the the end of Diabolique: its mystical take kind of works. However, the mystical take of Montand's death here is simply stupid. If he has to go off the road and down a cliff, let the truck he is driving simply suffer a sudden blowout, or differential fatigue, some kind of mechanical malfunction...not playing with it on the road like a three year old......and even then, certainly not have Vera Clouzot know telepathically that he has gone over to his death. But there are so many fine touches in this movie, you watch it for them. Too bad it could not have been a much more disciplined effort, but what it there makes most movies today seem tired and trite. Also, for those interested, notice the striking similarity of the opening images of this film, and the first shots of The Wild Bunch. Just too bad he could not have ended the film on such a pure note. But bravo anyway, great treat, wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die has been a great source for finding films I otherwise would never have heard of, and possibly would not consider seeing, and this was a French/Italian foreign language film rated well by critics I hoped would be a worthy entry. Basically in a desolate South American village several men are trying to find a way out, their main problem is that they are essentially marooned there, there is only one road out of town, it goes as far as the oil drilling rigs, but they are nowhere near having the money needed for a flight, and there are no jobs to be had, so each day just blends into the next. But then change comes when a major fire breaks out at the oil drilling site, the oil company needs to find and hire men who are willing to take a risky journey to transport highly volatile nitroglycerine across rough terrain and virtually abandoned bumpy roads, four men are hired to drive two trucks: sarcastic Corsican playboy Mario (Yves Montand) and French aging ex-gangster Jo (Charles Vanel), and Mario's Dutch roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and quiet but intense salt mine worker Bimba (Peter van Eyck). On the journey the trucks encounter many perils, not just the bumpy road and having to drive at a steady pace to not explode, but tight roads to turn, unstable bridges and structures to cross and reverse on, large rocks in the middle of the road that they need to blow up to remove, and when one of the trucks explodes it leaves behind a deep puddle of oil to trawl through. The four men accepted the job because of the money being offered was more than enough to allow them to leave once the job is done, but with the job being so dangerous few people expected them to return alive, in the end Luigi and Bimba were killed with their truck exploding, Jo dies from severe injuries, and Mario is the only driver to make it safely to the oil drilling site to assist the fire, he is ecstatic to drive away in the empty truck and return to devoted lover Linda (Véra Clouzot), but careless driving means it is a shocking and fateful end for Mario. Also starring William Tubbs as Bill O'Brien and Darío Moreno as Hernandez. The film starts very slow as you are introduced to the characters and seeing the terrible lives the live in the village, but once they accept the dangerous job and get driving you are gripped, you are compelled knowing that any minute something could go wrong on the three hundred mile journey and their cargo could blow up, they sweat and shudder all the way, and obstacles put in their way keeps the tension going, it is a fantastically suspenseful and nil-biting adventure thriller film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly perfect thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For about forty minutes of this film, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. Nothing was really going on, the characters were ambling about, talking in circles, and there was no semblance of a plot developing. Despite my best intentions (and everything I've learned about cinema), I lost interest.However, once the oil well disaster occurs, sparking the plot, I was hooked. It's such a contrived and nonsensical story (was there really such an urgent need for the nitroglycerin that the oil company was willing to risk it all blowing up?) but it's pulled off so expertly and thrillingly that the film thrives because of it, not in spite of it. Every trivial problem is life-threatening, every moment is potentially deadly, each normally banal act becomes increasingly important and serious. The sense of doom developed is palpable, and it's entirely because of the plot.Coupled with that sense of doom is a terrific atmosphere of fatalism. It lingers just under the surface throughout the film, finally bursting forward when the first truck explodes and Jo becomes injured in the bog. That great final conversation between him and Mario, in which he expresses his desire to survive, despite taking the high-risk, low-reward job, is a perfect summation of the film's themes; Mario's subsequent collapse in front of the exploding oil well is one of the great shots in all of cinema (reminding me strongly of There Will Be Blood) and superbly symbolizes the dread and desperation that he has undergone. That final twist is just icing on the cake.That first act hurts it, but this is a nearly perfect thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Europeans and Americans abroad - a kind of a dark action comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great action-triller classic, the suspense really never slackens. It also has a strange, dark humoristic element which is fed mainly by the fact that all the main protagonists are far away from home and don't exactly know what they're doing.The location somewhere in a tropical or subtropical land is a dead end place. Europeans from different nations, all males, strand there and would like to go away as quickly as they can. They are a curious bunch of crooks of different ages and social stratas, no sense of friendship exists between them. And then, there are the Americans (called amerlocques, in true slang fashion). They work the local oil fields and are presented (in the European's comments, that is) as a greedy breed apart who will move on as soon as the resources are exhausted. They even have their own cemetery, comments the main character, all prefabricated! There are many of these quirky lines throughout the movie. The cross language style works very well in this movie, hearing the original sound certainly adds to the pleasure.The Europeans are hired by the Americans to transport highly explosive nitroglycerin to an uncontrollably burning oil well. They cannot resist doing this high risk job which might guarantee their return to Europe. One team consists of a German and an Italian. The second of two Frenchmen, and they, of course, are the main characters. Yves Montand and Charles Vanel make a great team. Especially Vanel is really brilliant. At first sight they are just the typical old gangster and young, admiring hood couple. But they both have a strange kind of goofiness which makes me suspect strongly that the director had Laurel and Hardy in mind ? the physical frame of the two fits to a T, anyway.The two greatest scenes: Montand and Vanel sitting in a little park (sort of) in the dead end town. In the background a sculpturally shaped black woman takes an open air shower (full nudity in 1953, no less!). The woman stoops and starts screaming. A large, hairy spider moves tentatively over a white towel. Montand gets up, steps over and crushes it with his white canvas slipper beaming like Stan Laurel, kind of ?ain't I the most daring guy around?" Then there is the problem of crossing a large puddle of crude oil with the truck. Vanel walks in front, checking for obstacles. His legs get entangled in a large branch already under tension from the truck's wheels. Montand does not dare stop the truck, Vanel submerges in the puddle, gets run over and comes up totally black. It is horrific but in a perverse way also comical. The truck gets stuck in the puddle, Montand drags Vanel out, then he has to take a dive himself to fix a cable. He comes up black and black Vanel, lying deadly wounded against a tree, toasts to him with a thermos flask. It's as dark as humor can possibly get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film with something to say: «You and I aren't paid to work, we're paid to be afraid», sic. It may not look like much but's that's probably more than a couple of years of Hollywood ( especially, since they ran out of «inspiration» and can only «re-make» versions of cartoon super-heroes). A story of men with a job to do, a confrontation of two opposite ways to look at WORK and at life, a film with characters that don't show-up in theatres anymore. It's a stark movie. The extreme risks involved, the urgency of the situation, the the extreme monotony of the Latin-American summer, the extreme characters all produce a over-contrasted image of todays' (even today, yes, and ever more) world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest suspense films...Highly recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Le Salaire de la peur is without a doubt one of the greatest suspense films ever made. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot was known as the "French Hitchcock" but his output of films was small due to illness. He did however manage to make two terrific films, "Le Salaire de la peur" (The Wages of Fear) and "Les Diaboliques". (Hitchcock supposedly made Psycho in response to Les Diabolique.)Le Salaire de la peur is about a group of desperate men stuck in South America who are hired to drive two trucks with nitroglycerin across treacherous mountain terrain to a burning oil field so the explosives can be used to put out an oil well fire. Along the way they are confronted with one obstacle after another. There is an absolutely hair-raising scene on a wooden overhang on a cliff, and the scene in which they try to remove a boulder in the road nail-biting. There are no special effects here which results in scenes that have an incredible amount of tension. Yves Montand is the leader of the men and he's just great. Charles Vanel is also in the film. He was Alfred Fichet, the private detective in Les Diaboliques. Also in the film is director Clouzot's absolutely beautiful wife, Vera Clouzot (she was also in Les Diabolique.) The film is subtitled. I highly recommend this film as well as Les Diaboliques. See it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The suspense of Clouzot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves to be in best best 100 of all times. It is not, probably because of political reasons. Henri G. Clouzot was accused of collaboration with the Nazis...The suspense of Clouzot arises from situations where men test their will against forces of Nature or attempts to violate the laws of physics. They defy the Gods....Hitchcok's is about good guys against bad guys. Perhaps for this the Academy never gave him an Oscar...The suspense of Clouzout is slow, like slow torture. This is the most effective kind.. Also there are very few jokes or moments of joy. In Hitchcock wry humor is a plenty, sometimes killing the suspense...This film has directly inspired Sam Packinpah's "The Wild Bunch". The cart's wheel stuck on the bridge, is a direct copy of similar situation in Wages of Fear. Similar is also the fate of the four "heroes" in both movies.As for the DVD I watched a PAL English version. It is acceptable, but this movie deserves a restoration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I too believe that this is one of the greatest films of all time, ranking right up there with Citizen Kane &amp; Les Enfants du Paradis &amp; Grapes of Wrath. It has the majestic sweep &amp; the scope &amp; the deep sense of human tragedy that those films have. I don't feel it's a "suspense" film, it's much much more. It's a metaphor of the struggle to survive that is shared by every human being ever born. I have no problems with the symbolic images &amp; acts that open &amp; close the film: the cockroach "dance" &amp; Mario's last drive. They too are metaphors which would be digestable if such metaphors weren't so out of favor these days. Particularly, the ending: who doesn't believe deep down that when one struggles to keep death at arm's length, one has a chance to postpone it, but if you forget &amp; celebrate your luck, chances are your time has arrived. If I have any problems at all, it's with the casting of Vera Clouzot. She's too immaculately refined &amp; happy-go-lucky for someone in her situation. She certainly doesn't seem to mind the trip up the stairs with the bozo boss. This was the one thing about Wages of Fear that made me think of Hollywood (particularly John Ford). But everything else about this film is so brilliant that its small flaws are easily forgiven. By the way, in the last 30+ years I have seen versions with both the first 40 minutes &amp; the last 15 excised! Abominable!! God bless those responsible for making this version available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film except for the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I was struck by the old saying, "the more things change, the more they remain the same". The attitude displayed by the oil company foreman toward the well being of his employees is still widespread today. The film had some very taut scenes that, although a bit dated by todays standards, still play very well. One scene involving a pool of oil would have been a fairly daring depiction for its time and even now can make you think about what you would have done given the same circumstances. The only thing that mars this film is the ending. I have no problem with downbeat endings but the manner in which this one took place struck me as unbelievable. The ending brought down, by some degree, a well written movie. Recommended, especially for the rock scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First-rate suspense, great acting, social realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This outstanding film about a highly dangerous transport job establishes character in depth before the real suspense begins. Anti-American sentiment runs strong in the depiction of oil-company managers in a Venezuelan shanty town. They are thick-skinned vulgarians who, in the process of "just doing their job," have desensitized themselves completely to the poverty and hunger around them. One foreman hires an old friend, who is French, along with another Frenchman, an Italian and a Dutch man to transport nitroglycerin in two trucks to a distant site. The slightest jolt will blow the trucks and their drivers to smithereens. The men selected for the job are desperate for work, being foreigners stranded in an economically depressed country and desperate to get out of the abyss of poverty they have fallen into.Once the journey begins, the tension is unrelenting. The director masterfully plays on the viewer's nerves. I was often shrieking out loud, so complete was the illusion of suspense and fright. Unlike so many American action films, the destruction depicted is not contrived but is an inevitable consequence of the difficult work conditions and the generally depressing environment. Most viewers, I think, will expect some of the 4 men to die along the way, but the ending is full of psychological irony. This film also amounts to an insightful study of virility and courage in the face of death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be put off by the long, leisurely first act. Once the trucks roll out your heart will be in your mouth, and even the most jaded action-adventure fanatic is likely to go rigid with anxiety and stay that way right through the horrifying coda. Among the uniformly excellent principals, Vanel is superb and Montand sublime -- a fully human action hero who, without bulging biceps or snide catchphrases, could eat Schwarzenegger's lunch and make him say "thank you" for the pleasure. Clouzot's other great thriller, LES DIABOLIQUES, is an MGM musical compared to this. Not to be viewed by anyone about to take a driver's test or renting a U-Haul for the first time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen literally thousands of movies, and this one is unique. It is its own, and holds its own.The suspense is sometimes on a par with Hitchcock's best. [Twice, even my fourteen year old son had to sit up, and forward onto the edge of his seat!]The International flavor is unparalleled. We hear four different languages spoken. We see a mixture of cultures that other filmmakers can only dream about -- White European, White American, Native American, Hispanic, African, and on and on.The acting is flawless all along the cast. Particularly interesting is the interaction between characters within and across genders.While the story starts out slow, overall it is entertaining. And while melodrama is approached, it never is breached; reality is never really abandoned so a very difficult and fine line is successfully walked.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>30 years ago while stationed in England I caught the last half hour of "Wages of Fear" on BBC. Although I did not know the name of the film, it made such a favorable impression that I kept looking for it once I got back to the world; but it was never shown on American television. When William Friedkin made "Sorcerer" I was able to connect the dots and put a title to my elusive film. In many ways Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a bridge between the Italian Neorealism of the early 1950's and the French New Wave of a few years later. Even more obvious is its link to early Hollywood Renaissance directors Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, and Stanley Kubrick. Peckinpah pays homage to "Wages of Fear" with a similar introductory scene in "The Wild Bunch" and again in "Straw Dogs". Kubrick does it with "The Blue Danube" waltz in "2001", juxtaposing exterior shots of the moving space station with interior views of the stewardess serving a passenger (just as Clouzot cut between the truck cruising down the road and the party back in town). Penn was a little less obvious but the violent shifts between comedy and tragedy in "Bonnie and Clyde" can be traced back to a similar narrative technique in "The Wages of Fear".Most of the criticism about "The Wages of Fear" comes because Neorealism presents a more stylized reality than classic Hollywood narrative. The intent is to bring the ordinary features of the world into better focus by exaggeration. Expressionistically imitating reality while announcing that what is being shown is not real, the belief being that the more real the imitation the more fraudulent. Thus the use of narrative techniques that actually call attention to themselves. So the process of Jo (Charles Vanel) becoming a hero to Mario (Yves Montand) is shown through a montage of brief disjointed moments of connection. And Mario's journey from idolizing Jo to disillusionment and back to idolizing is much the same. Jo, Mario, Bimba (Peter van Eyck), and Luigi (Folco Lulli) are desperate men stranded somewhere in South America (probably Venezuela). They need money to escape so when an American oil company offers $4,000 to each pair of drivers willing to transport a ton of nitroglycerin (300 kilometers over poor roads) to a burning wellhead, they sign on for the job. Death could happen at any moment and the reactions of each man along the journey is compared and contrasted with what the viewer learned about them back in the village during the first half of the film. There is a certain foreshadowing as it is pointed out at the start that this is the kind of intense task where even the survivors will be permanently scarred emotionally. The four are not heroes, just a mixed group linked by a willingness to value themselves at only $2,000. The oil company (an American one) is able to operate in this remote region because there is plenty of manpower who share this mindset. The film is more anti- capitalist than anti-American and whatever political message it had in 1953 is more generic today. The cinematographer, Armand Thirard, keeps things claustrophobic throughout; in the dead- end town and in the cab of each truck. Clouzot sets up his most suspenseful sequence, where the trucks must back up on the unstable wooden platform in order to get around a hairpin bend, by having the first (smaller) truck narrowly succeed, heightening the tension as the bigger truck attempts the same maneuver. What establishes this as European art cinema is its willingness to break primary film conventions. Clouzot was free from the need for a happy ending and could let anything happen to his characters. Conventional narrative required that a character's narrow escape early in the film was because he had a purpose later in the story, but that is not the case with "Wages of Fear". You first realize the power this gives Clouzot when a stray rock rolls down a hillside toward a Jerry can filled with nitro. In this film such an ironic anticlimax is actually a real possibility. If you liked the original "Flight of the Phoenix" you will enjoy this film. And if you are a Peckinpah fan it is a must watch. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wages of Fear" is a tense thriller from the French director, Clouzot, about desperate men willing to risk everything for a chance to escape their lousy existence.The story involves a group of men stranded in a South American oil company town. None of them have steady work and none can afford to take a plane out of town, so they sit around and drink and argue with one another.Then one day, an oil well explodes up in the mountains, and the company needs volunteers to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerine up to the drill site so they can blow the fire out. The company's union drivers are too valuable to risk, so the foreman offers the job to the men stranded in town, knowing full well they're desperate enough to do anything.The four men selected to drive are Mario (Yves Montand), Jo (Charles Vanel), Luigi, and Bimba. Each has different fears and motivations for making the journey, and the director develops each one's personality from the start of the film through the drive itself."Wages of Fear" is a very tense film in the second half as the two trucks make their way over treacherous roads, encountering obstacles along the way that require the men's creativity in overcoming. Some rise to the occasion, others crumble under the pressure. A quick death awaits anyone who makes the slightest mistake. By the end of the film, the viewer is emotionally wrung dry.From the European period of stark cinematic drama, this thriller is one of the best.</fullReview>

But whatever, much of life is about pain, we know that if we are on here because we love a movie like "The Wages of Fear." Have I reached 10 lines yet? No? Well...Consider this the light that will lead us home. I saw this movie again recently after first seeing it once about 10 years ago, in an art-house theater, the Castro I think, in San Francisco. What stuck through the years was of course the suspense, also because it's what the movie is famous for. What my recent viewing of it revealed was the richness of the characters and relationships in the story. The relationship between Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) is the most deeply explored and turns into a clever and ironic mirror of Mario's relationship with Linda (Vera Clouzot), whom he mostly treats like garbage in the beginning of the movie, especially after his new friend Jo has arrived and the two of them become inseparable. Only later, when the two men start to go through hell together, does their relationship take a turn for the worse, and Mario assumes the same dominating, emotionally and physically abusive role he has in his relationship with Linda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Suspenseful Excercise in French Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Salaire de la Peur/The Wages of Fear(1953) is a psycological and tense masterpiece of the French cinema. It bridges the gap between the pre war films and films of the French New Wave. The story is excellently done and the scenes during the middle part of the film is shown with hand trembling suspense. The Wages of Fear(1953) as with Jean Pierre Melville's Bob Le Flambeur(1954) and Jules Dassin's Rififi(1955) are a few fine examples of some great Film Noir pictures to come out of France during the 1950s.The Wages of Fear(1953) introduced a new and exciting actor by the name of Yves Montand. This is the motion picture that made him an international star and would make him into one of French cinema's best leading actors. He does an outstanding job in projecting macho qualities as well as qualities of concern in the role of Mario. The most interesting scenes are the ones with him and fellow actor Charles Vanel.The direction of the movie is done with total perfection. Henri Georges Clouzot does a terrific job in handling the suspense scenes. He also does a good job in setting those scenes up. From watching this film I come to know that I am watching the work of an artist.I love the cinematography of The Wages of Fear(1953). The cinematography is helped out by some smooth editing on part of the people who made this film. The camera work increases the suspense and triples the tension that is felt between the main characters. The cinematography glides like an angel and flows like clouds.The main villains in the movie are the Oil company that employs the four main characters. The scenes with the Oil Company was cut when first released here because because of its negative portrayal of the American oil company. These scenes have been since restored on DVD. I can see why these scenes where cut because they give the film an anti-American flavor.Its a great film because it has all that is important to cinema work well. The relationship between Mario and Jo is very similar with the relationship of the two women in Les Diaboliques(1955). Henri Georges Clouzot was known then as The French Hitchcock and for good reason. It has a very sad surprise ending with some good music.Le Salaire de la Peur(1953) along with Les Diaboliques(1955) are unfortuately only a handful of film that the director is known for. He was not a popular film maker because of the themes dealt with in Le Corbeau(1943). He is an underrated movie maker and is worthy of a retroprospective series from some film theater because he deserves it. The Wages of Fear(1953) would have a big impact on the making of films like Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969) and John Woo's A Better Tomorrow(1986).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most tense films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one element that keeps this film going it's tension. After we are introduced to the characters in the setting of the small South American village, the film turns into one of the most gripping adventure stories ever. There's a scene where the characters have to get a rock out of the road in front of them that is so tense I was literally white-knuckled. This film will inevitably be compared to the remake by William Friedkin, Sorceror. That is an inferior film, if only because it has a very clunky sets of character introductions and relies too much on the physical mechanics of the journey and not the characters. The Wages of Fear is all about the characters and the situations that arise due to their greed and hubris. Perhaps the most chilling scene of all is a decision Yves Montand's character has to make while driving across an oily pond. It's scene like that one that make the film great. This is Clouzot's best film in my opinion, just edging out Diabolique. Find it and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Forum des Images in Paris in addition to the regular screenings and irregular previews, lectures, etc the movie buff can also enter a room containing about two dozen monitors, each supplied with its own keyboard and armchair with built-in speakers. Here the buff can choose to view one of the more than 6,500 titles available. There is, however, one proviso; every title, be it silent or sound, black and white or color, documentary of feature is either set in or has a strong connection with Paris. Selection is up to the individual, theoretically it can be alphabetical if one had the time to scan 6,500 titles. The usual method is to key in the name of an actor, director, writer and/or a genre. When one keys in Yves Montand and qualifies further by adding 'fiction' there is a choice of around ten titles and these include Le Salaire de la puer, which by now everyone knows takes place in South America despite being shot in the South of France. When I brought this to the attention of a staffer it was explained to me that Mario - the character played by Montand - carries around a ticket for the Paris metro. Viewers of this classic tend to carry around for years afterward a mental phial of nitro, such is the impact it has on initial screening. It is impossible to praise too highly the taut script and direction, the just-right acting of slow-starter Montand (after a few brief appearances mostly as himself in pot-boilers he took a beating in his first starring role and concentrated on filling Domestic and International stages with his singing. Even after this triumph it was almost a further decade before he really got into his acting stride via Compartiment tuer. In their wisdom both video and DVD distributors often pair this with the same director's equally definitive 'Les Diaboliques featuring Mrs Montand, Simone Signoret (and again the director's other half, Vera Clouzot). This is an unbeatable parlay and should be snapped up by anyone with even a peripheral interest in what makes good movies. As for this. Magnifique! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has supposedly won the 1953 Grand Prize at Cannes. The plot is revolving around a group of men who are penniless at a place (supposedly some South American Country) and accept a dangerous job of transporting some explosive chemicals through the rugged country. I was not quite sure of the setting of the movie, whether they were trying to name the title on poverty under which the men were or the adventure comparing with the risk of losing their life. Either ways the movie is full of nice scenes of camaraderie. The outdoor sets for this movie is extensive, and the depiction of the 1950's South America isn't that easy. All the places give us a very nice and nostalgic view on how beautiful the place was. The European task force consisting Messrs Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel act important roles in the movie. The movie is about the conflicts of the actors needing money for different reason as for the emotions they go though in course of their journey to the land of no return. Really a master piece and even though many claim Sorcerer is a better movie than this (it is the 1971 remake of this movie) I personally feel this is a better movie. I rate this one 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The audience is inalterable once beginning this long, drawn out story of agonizing suspense. The script takes its time with detailed exposition that fixates us with its genuine drive and predilection for its characters, misogynist, oppressive, brawny men with indistinctly sympathetic sides. Once the turning point of the story takes place, the suspense of every moment during the scenes where they are driving the trucks loaded with nitro is like your life flashing before your eyes. You cringe and wince for these guys and almost involuntarily vocalize your anguish.The reason the film is so effective is because of Henri-Georges Clouzot's grand ability to be fixed, to anchor certain scenes with long closeups, continuous sounds of growling truck engines, and an intensely realized pace. The Wages of Fear is first-class suspense, sharing a window seat next to Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful study in suspense despite flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wages of Fear tells the story of a group of men that live in a Brazilian village immersed in poverty. Many of them are foreigners who want to flee the country but can not because they don't have the money. Getting a job is not an easy task and when one rises, few doubt the chance of taking it especially because it pays an extremely high sum of money. But the job is a risky one. It involves transporting a truck loaded with nitroglycerin, a dangerous explosive on the rough roads of the rural Brazilian land ? the slightest concussion can result in tragedy. The nitroglycerin is needed to work as an explosive to suffocate some burning oil wells ? although this detail is hardly necessary because this is a film about the suspense and fear on the journey, not the result. Four men get the job and two of each will drive the two tracks. There is Mario (Yves Montand), a french guy who has taken the job without the consent of his girlfriend. There is M. Jo (Charles Vanel), also a French who just arrived at the village, has become friends with his compatriot Mario, and has learned the bad economic situation that the people in the village face. The two will drive one of the tracks. Then there is Bimba (Peter van Eyck) and Luigi (Folco Lulli) who will drive the second track. It's clear that these men have been employed for the job not only because of there driving skills but also because they don't have insurance: if they die, nobody can denounce the employers for giving them a job that faces soo many risks.From this plot, french director H.G. Clouzot was able to create a taut, suspenseful, and often frightening film of the highest order whilst also revealing a human story beneath all the action. It is precisely the human story that is the film's most flawed element. The scenes before the men finally drive the tracks to there destinies are necessary to create an atmosphere and introduce that characters and indeed, it has some wonderful moments where we understand the characters and there motivations. But quite a bit of the film's first segment is unnecessary and doesn't really take us anywhere. It's not that I urgently wanted to get to the main action but I found a lot of the things that went on to be, well, futile. Moreover Linda (played by the director's wife Vera Clouzot) who is supposed to provide the film's love element is unsuccessfully developed: she is too much of a distraction, her performance far too melodramatic even for a rural girl with little education. We feel nothing but indifference when Mario abandons her and the later consequences.But putting aside these minor flaws that do not affect the overall impact of the story, The Wages of Fear is a brilliant film. The screenplay has more patience in revealing the suspense than most directors would: you always feel that the dangers the characters confront are not the result of the need to please the audience but a natural thing. Clouzot is clever in making the journey a realistic hell for the audience by rarely using music on the journey. We accompany the characters as they have to find there way through barriers of nature that are distressing, tense, and fearful. The conversations between the drivers reveal the depth of the personal wounds, the fears they have, the loneliness they suffer, the tragedies of there stories, and the despair in which they live. We see how dangerous situations reveal the true nature of people. At the beginning of the film, Jo is portrayed as this hard guy with authority but in the journey, we discover that it's really a facade intended to conceal his fearful and selfish self. Marion on the other hand is a man who acts more out of impulse than thought. Clouzot knew the attraction of putting two men with different ways of confronting danger and he wonderfully exploits it. Thus, the combination of the despair of the journey and the troubles of the characters creates a terrible atmosphere of intensity and unimaginable moments of self discovery. The conversations between Bimba and Luigi have less intensity in them but are still memorable.The ending is often condemned as ridiculous. It's despairing "to watch a character die out of carelessness after spending the entire film watching him go through all that danger and survive." This view, like all opinions, is respectable but I think it looks at the film from the wrong angle. The ending ends not as a final climax but as a summing up of a theme dealt with through out. Mario survived because he had balls and nerves but not because of sane judgement. Had he had it, he would have expressed his fear like Jo, and even considered abandoning it but he didn't. Instead, he played with fate and you can only play with fate so much. Ironically it is fear that allowed him to deliver the nitroglycerin and survive its danger. But once he was the only survivor, once he suppressed the fear, he deemed himself as indestructible and resorted to carelessness which in the end lead him to his destruction. Perhaps Clouzot could have found a more subtle way to emphasize Mario's carelessness but in the end, this is an uncommonly involving motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anyone making this film would need to make it in precisely the same way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>one recent reviewer noted that by the second half of the film - when the real adventure begins - we have lost a certain amount of interest in the characters, to the extent that we care for them less than would seem to be appropriate for such dramatic adventure film. i agree with this, and also feel it to be the film's primary error; yet, surprisingly, this is not a reason to avoid the film or even dislike it.there are two reasons for this. first, this detachment from the characters is clearly intended by the director. he set out to tell his story with no compromise to audience expectations - as they were understood at the time - and has succeeded well, over all. this detachment doesn't quite work as intended, because in a longer film, the audience wants to get to know - and to like - some one or other of the characters. clouzot gives us something like a a version of treasure of sierra madre where all the characters are variants of bogart's dobbs; we need at least a walter huston here. still, i think the audience can respect clouzot's decision, even if mistaken, because it is at least made with the integrity of the artist.secondly, the cinematography and editing of the second half of this film - which never call attention to themselves, but seem utterly natural, as though anyone making this film would need to make it in precisely the same way - quietly insist on our watching what happens whether we want to or not - and frequently, we don't - terrible things happen in this film's second half, but we can't take our eyes away from it, we seem to be as condemned as the truck-drivers to live out this brutal mission; so when the film ends, all the 'existential' questions that - intentionally - are left dangling, are dropped right on our shoulders as our burden to bear.a film that insists you watch it, without ever calling attention to itself - now that's great film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out of nowhere, a fearless film of timeless appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can a b/w film in French, by a director never mentioned in the same breath as Truffaut or Godard, Clement or Clair, beguile audiences for nearly half a century? Not through a big budget or special effects but through classical film-making.The setting is nowhere. The characters are from a community of human dregs. Their journey is a chance at redemption.How do you make a highly allegorical film and keep it taut, suspenseful and naturalistic? Great acting is part of it; John Ford once said the most interesting thing in the world is a human face, and Clouzot uses close-ups, particularly of Yves Montand, to great effect. He also keeps a tight rein on the pace, paying cinematographic attention to tiny details. This heightens the suspense while recalling Hemingway's early short stories, in which a man survives the nihilistic world around him by focusing on the details of work. Clouzot suggests tensions among the characters, then expands on them, and we watch them change under pressure - the pressure of the perilous task they face, and the pressure they exert on each other - not unlike his film Les Diaboliques. The power of this unique film lies in its frank study of humanity battling a hostile universe - but its appeal lies in its ability to keep the whole story balanced and rolling along in an exciting, naturalistic style. A film of tight editing that highlights its expansive vision: there aren't many like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie that is hugely suspenseful with great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers Now I know I'm supposed to kiss the ass of director Henri-Georges Clouzot and say this is the most exciting movie ever filmed, and has the best character studies ever written, but I don't feel like it. Now don't get me wrong, it really is a good movie that is hugely suspenseful with great acting and a real good story, but some of the stuff that has been written about it makes me laugh.The plot is about a bunch of out of work European and American expatriates that are more or less stranded in a South American town because they have no money to get out. An oil well about 300 kilometers away has an oil rig go up in flames and the only way to put it out is with a blast of nitroglycerin. The nearest nitro is in the town where our out of work expat's are. It is a suicide mission that the oil company is willing to pay $2000 per man as long as a truck's cargo reaches the oil rig intact. The workers union won't allow any of their workers to embark on so dangerous a task so the local oil rig manager has to recruit four volunteers to drive two trucks without shocks on a bumpy road carrying 100 pounds of nitro each.There are many more volunteers than there are positions so the oil rig manager takes them out to test their driving ability. Four men are picked but one who was left out is a local tough guy called Jo who is wonderfully played by Charles Vanel. He gets the forman to agree that he will be the back up if any of the four men picked don't make the 3 am starting time the following morning. That night Jo takes one of the drivers home and low and behold, that guy doesn't make the 3 am deadline the next morning!This is a somewhat long movie at 148 minutes and at about 1 hour into it the drive with the nitro starts. They crawl along at first, slowly building their speed and their courage. But as it turns out, Jo is not the tough old man he thought he was. The other man in his truck is his friend who he recently met in this forsaken town, Mario (Yves Montand). As Jo breaks down Mario has to take over and is determined to survive the journey and collect his money so he can get out of the town with his sweetheart, Miss Légitimus (Darling Légitimus, who is also director Henri-Georges Clouzot's wife). The other two men in the other truck were sent a half hour after the first truck as a precaution but with Jo's stalling and slow driving they quickly catch up and pass the first truck. They run into obstacles along the way and a lengthy scene were they have to back onto a partially built wooden bridge is extremely nerve racking. I won't give any more away but the end of the movie is simply not one that would have happened if this film would have been made in Hollywood. In fact there was a remake, 1977s Sorcerer. A goofy title but the remake is actually a good movie, directed by William Friedkin and starring Roy Scheider.The dvd itself for Wages of Fear, part of the Criterion Collection, is a great looking transfer (for a 50 year old movie) but there are no extras at all on the disk, not even a trailer. There are several minutes of footage on this cut that were deleted in the original US theatrical release, not for lewdness or graphic violence, but for making a fictional US oil company look like an uncaring and greedy company. Imagine that.If you could buy just one French new wave film with subtitles, this one would certainly be a good choice. But since you are obsessed with this buying dvd's thing like I am, you can buy as many as you can afford. This retails for $30 which is a little on the high side, especially considering the no extras, but if you can get it in the $20 range I would consider adding it to your collection like I did.</fullReview>

Only lately that I realize that it was based on the much acclaimed French movie, The Wages of Fear. I recently saw the restored version of this and even though I enjoyed it I cannot see where it is supposedly better than the Sorcerer. To me the movie is too long to get to the point of having to move the nitro. Also I did not really get the point as to why all these people were there in that city which was nowhere as awful as in the Sorcerer.

		<shortDescription>Good cinema, but unintentionally comical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an example of film with great cinematic and artistic appeal but one that is uproariously funny if you've ever worked a day in your life. I understand these expatriates weren't supposed to be masters of common carriage, but, if not for the life-and-death tragedy, this might have been shortened to an episode of the Howard, Fine, and Howard Delivery Service. "That can of nitroglycerine is for the OTHER wall, you dummy. &lt;slap, slap&gt;"I had to work hard to concentrate on the more profound issues this film addressed, and it did a well-photographed, insightful job of addressing those compelling issue of that post-war era of film making (e.g., personal courage, capitalist colonialism, and, less successfully, gender issues). The hardest job of the film for me, however, was not delivering the nitro, but overlooking the hilariously inept antics in which this zany little troupe of down-and-outers-fallen-on-hard-times got themselves entangled in the physical aspects of the plot. No, a square handkerchief lying in the road has no meaning whatsoever to any truck driver in any country. No, a bumpy road is not smoother at 40 m.p.h. No, you don't stand behind the tailgate of a truck while directing the driver to back over you. No, you can't chip a 30-inch deep hole in a rock with a spare crankshaft. No, porous rock with visible cracks won't hold nitroglycerine like a cocktail glass. No, you can't tie a knot in wire rope. No, you don't suck fluid, especially the highly explosive variety, into a syphon tube with your mouth. No, the explosion of a truckload of nitroglycerine would not leave a pond-size depression, it would remove the entire face of the slope. No, crude oil is not the consistency of cafe au lait. And no, carrying an open jerry can of nitroglycerine precariously for several hundred yards PAST its cover AND the truck it was nested in is not suspenseful, it's frustratingly stupid.If you can get past the unintentional physical slapstick, however, there is an underlying good movie, although implausibly scripted to the point of absurdity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substitute Iraq for South America and you've got a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Hollywood can't get original these days, always seeking for remakes, here's one that's topical as well. What men won't do for oil: "where there is oil, there are Americans", the natives say in this movie that shows what men will do for money.The horrible experiences they go through over this precipitious roads with rotting wood supports and huge pot=holes awaiting them all the way is quite worse than a horror movie, because this is believable. The oil fires could have come out of Gulf War I, and some of the things that happen here in this poverty-stricken land where Americans are hated could well happen to us in Iraq. That war is not over, and won't be so long as we occupy that company, a lesson seemingly unlearned from the British or this movie, for that matter.Yves Montand and the Italian fellow do excellent jobs in portraying toughness and friendship. Yves acts the part of a dumb punk well, quickly turning from one friend to the other when things seem to be more advantageous. His hilarity at the end is foolish. A few things are irrational, as the fact that the only thing left from one explosion is a cigarette holder.....doesn't compute.But the suspense laid down by this director is masterful. I can't imagine why no one has tried making another version since 1953. The acting by all 4 is magnificent, and the poverty of the area is exquisitely portrayed. And yes, the analogy of the bugs trying to escape from their strings is not lost, in fact, stated by one of the guys so desperate to get out of their trap.When you're used to Yves Montand as the suave lover, seeing him as a rough punk, sometimes compassionate, more often brutal, you know what a good actor he was. The love-struck woman was WAYYY out of place, and had the same last name as the director. Actress she wasn't, maybe she was his wife.HIghly unusual film, well worth buying. When my blood pressure comes down, I'll try to watch it again. If you have problems with heights , you might not want to watch it, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was billed as being possibly the most intense, suspenseful film of all time. Even though I came open minded ready to enjoy it, I found it tough to sit through with only a few scenes with short moments of suspense. There are a few explanations that could cause this discrepancy: The difference between seeing it 50 years after it was made, the unlikability of any of the characters, the impossibly long first half with not much of interest, the terrible, almost laughable performance of the oil company operator, the implausible happenings along the way to the fire or the ridiculous ending. In any event, one can only guess at what this might have been like when it first came out. Yes, there were some interesting underlying ideas and some scenes that held your attention, but at this point I would go against my usual feeling and say that there needs to be a remake and since there is one, I will now try to find Sorcerer to see what that's like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, this is not an horrible movie and I did not disliked watching it but I absolute didn't seem to like it as much as most other people seem to do and in my opinion the movie is currently being way overrated.I'll give the movie that it was a bit of an unique one for its time. It actually has a pretty good premise, lots of action movies now days would be jealous off. However it doesn't really make this movie a fantastic or spectacular one to watch, though I'm taking it into account that this movie was from before the period that the action-genre got actually first fully developed. But by saying all this, you shouldn't think that this is an action packed movie with gun fights or anything but it's more a movie that takes an action type of approach with its style and story-telling, of its somewhat adventurous story, that gets brought very tense to the screen.I really had quite some problems with this movie. One is not even it's long running time of two and an half hours but more its set-up of its story and characters. Once you start thinking about it you should wonder of the first 30 minutes, or so, were truly needed for the movie or not. It's unnecessarily slow and it was mostly meant to introduce and set-up its character but they could had done this all a lot quicker really. And the characters aren't even that much good to begin with. Problem with them is that are some lying and cheating bums, who do everything for some money. I just could never fully like any of them, so therefore the movie already fell emotionally flat and became a distant one to watch.But yes, it's definitely true that the movie becomes a much better one to watch in its second half, when finally good and interesting things start to happen. They came up with some pretty good moments for the movie, that often work out real tense. They are being build-up well and executed surprisingly good and also original.But no matter how original the movie gets with some of its moments, the movie remains a very predictable one, or at least to me it was. I was not even surprised or taken away by its not-so-Hollywood-like ending. It got done a bit too obvious, in its build up toward it.Nevertheless this movie still remains a great and also unique achievement, from director Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's a French movie, in which a whole lot of different languages gets spoken by its characters. Besides French we have Italian, Spanish, English and some German, just to name a few languages that get spoken throughout this movie. It's simply a well directed and also good looking movie, aside from its settings that don't really seem to suit the movie its premise.The movie is supposedly set in an unnamed South-American country but the movie looks nothing like a South-American country at all. At first I even thought that the movie was being set in Marocco (also due to the many different languages being spoken in it) or some other northern African country. It's just one of those other little things that prevented me from truly getting in this movie and liking it as much as everybody else seems to do.It's a good movie, especially for its time but there was nothing in this movie that was surprising or truly grabbing me.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intensely gruelling and harrowing film about people one doesn't care about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a huge reputation, larger than it deserves, in fact. First of all, everyone likes and admires Clouzot as a director. Secondly, there has been a lot of affectionate admiration for Yves Montand over the decades. So the reverence shown to this particular film has been tinted with the rosy view of retrospection and skewed in favour of 'good old Clouzot' and 'good old Yves'. But the performance of the young Yves Montand in this film, while good, is not in any way remarkable, and the part could have been played just as well by any fifty other actors. In other words, the reputation of this film has been artificially inflated. In actuality, it is far inferior to many of Clouzot's other films. It is difficult to know why Clouzot even wanted to make such a strange and stressful film. It is extremely painful to watch, for almost every minute of screen time, and it is never enjoyable. Surely we all have enough problems in our lives without having to worry about people being blown up by nitroglycerine which they are driving in large trucks on pot-holed roads in a desert. Yes, the film has various creative shots and sequences: the shot where Montand jumps down onto some loose soil and it sprays all over the camera, the sequence of the waltz scene in the seedy bar near the end, especially as intercut with Montand's joyous driving antics. Those things are all touches of the master. But ? and I repeat, but ? but. WHY?? Once again I raise the question which I raise in numerous reviews of films by many directors who make needlessly unpleasant films: why would the director want to make this film? Surely some more worthwhile subject and project could have been chosen for that year of Clouzot's life. Why do directors time and again, apparently for reasons of vanity or perverted notions, make really disgusting films? Everyone in this film except for the pathetic simple-minded maid in the seedy bar is horrible and disgusting, lacking in any positive qualities of any kind. Not one has an iota of compassion or concern for anyone but himself, and most of them are greedy, selfish, violent, criminal, and utterly revolting. A great subject for a movie, then! The film is set in a kind of 'nowhere', which might be Mexico or might be Venezuela, in any case, a country where the rapacious American oil company called 'Southern Oil Company' drills for oil at the cost of the lives of the locals, many of whom are killed in the most horrible accidents, and no one gives a damn. The setting is so grim and forlorn that it is a real wrist-slasher of an experience just to see it on film. Everybody is starving, everybody is penniless, everybody is exploited, everybody is miserable. What a cheerful experience! There is a very touching scene in the film between Montand and a friend who is dying in his arms, when the dying man suddenly reminisces about Paris. For the entire film, Montand has pathetically saved and frequently shown to his friends the Paris Metro ticket from Pigalle station which he used the last time he left Paris. Now, the friend suddenly starts talking about the Rue Galande, a charming little street near the ancient churches of St. Severin and St. Julien le Pauvre. (Rue Galande is also very near the street where Elliott Paul lived, which he described in his famous novel 'The Last Time I Saw Paris', and its sequel.) Montand says he knows the street very well also, so together they discuss the various shops they knew, and they try to remember whether the fence is still there which had obstructed the view of what was inside. The friend says he never could see what was behind the fence. Montand says there was nothing behind it. The friend is distraught, and, looking into Eternity, says: 'So there is just nothing?' and dies. Certainly the director's attention to detail of the transportation of a volatile explosive in impossible conditions by men desperate for money creates fantastic tension, and is gruelling in the extreme. But I don't see why we should give a damn whether those men are blown up or not, frankly, as none of them is sympathetic, and it is difficult to see what difference it makes to the Greater Scheme of Things whether Peter van Eyck and Yves Montand make it or not in their life of hell in that place of hell. To call this film 'a bit of a downer' is a mammoth understatement. There are better ways to spend a couple of hours than watching this.</fullReview>

We need a "hunk" for the lead and a "waif" for the love interest. If this sounds like a typical RKO "B" flick, you'd be wrong ? it is WAGES OF FEAR. Yves Montand will always be a pleasure to watch. The director's wife, Véra Clouzot, is gorgeous to look at but an actress of very limited range. Charles Vanel's attempt at being a hard-as-nails villain makes George Raft look like Paul Muni.

		<fullReview>For a long time I just believed that France made nothing but tedious movies. I found so-called classics by Truffaut and Godard tedious talk fests that were somewhat pretentious and ultimately pointless. When I saw Wages of Fear years ago it made me realize that there were French directors who actually were capable of making good dramas. A straightforward drama, the movie is engrossing throughout and the second half is absolutely gripping. This is a French movie without people sitting around talking about the meaning of it all like college sophomores, and it combines a grittiness with a sense of humanity that makes it a remarkably intelligent film. I don't consider it a great movie - I gave it a 7 - but it's a very good movie, well worth watching. Now I'm going to complain about the movie's artistically lazy, pretentious last five minutes, so here we need a spoiler alert.**********SPOILERS***************** After avoiding French philosophic pretensions for over two hours, Clouzot caves in at the end. It's not just that Mario dies in a car crash after surviving a harrowing journey - that sort of irony is trite but understandable. It's that weird waltzing-driving thing. It's as if at the end Clouzot said, I'm French, I need to make a statement about how life is ultimately purposeless and we're all blithely waltzing towards death. Give me a break. **********END SPOILERS*************</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the cutting edge of 50s filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to earn $ 2000, four men have to navigate two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin through a grueling terrain. Mistakes mean sudden death by explosion. It almost sounds like a modern reality TV concept, and yes, it's a great premise for a 1953 movie. The location (French Guyana, I suppose, but it could also be Venezuela) is fresh. In many ways, "Le Salaire" is a road and action movie avant la lettre. But someone has to take a stand and say it: this movie is terribly dated.Why is it dated? For one, the pacing is off. The movie drags and is about 40 minutes too long (and then I liked the long intro!). Second, the tension isn't managed up to modern standards. Clouzot is a great and innovative director, but many scenes are lacking in execution - you can often tell from a mile away what is going to happen. Third, it lacks appealing visuals. Many 40s and 50s movies have great black and white photography, but not this one, except some nice images towards the end.Finally, I thought the characters were poorly done. Yes, they are macho, and they are MEN. But we've known for a while that men like this don't really exist, something Humphrey Bogart had already found out in '42. "Le Salaire" is vaguely similar to "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", but while the latter excels in showing the dark side of humanity through evocative dialogue and timeless conflicts, the characters here left me utterly cold. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing here to waste any portion of your life on. The only reason I bothered to get to the end of this muddled mess was, I was putting together a piece of furniture so I had a distraction from this story. The other reason I stuck it out to the end was I was curious how this could get a four star review from Turner Classic Movies. The story line itself makes little sense, and the adventures these men have a ridiculous contrivances. The first forty five minutes of the movie are just there to establish that these are bunch of down and out men who would do anything for money; a lot of the interactions between the characters are silly, and add little or nothing to this story. After that they have a series of adventures that make little or no sense. Things that no one would do, things that are not possible, and things that would be just plain stupid to do. There are just to many things to outline here. I would not recommend watching this film unless you want to see a stunningly poorly written story line. I am at compete loss as to how so many people have given this a good review. The only thing dumber then the story line is the ending of this film; like the rest of the film it makes no sense; no one would do what this guy does. Since this film is bad on so many levels I can't outline them all here. Your going to have to decide if you want to waste nearly two hours of your life, on something this bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't feel there really is a spoiler here, but I didn't want to take the chance on being blacklisted so . . .Usually I have trouble enjoying a film with sub-titles. I want to be able to look at faces when they're talking, not words. I wish they had dubbed English. But I must admit that in this case, I still enjoyed it. Very well character drivin. That is to say, I enjoyed it till the end. The last scene spoiled the whole movie for me. A very dumb, disappointing ending. Ruined the whole movie for me. I actually yelled at the screen and said " You mean you put me through all that for THAT ! Come on ! How dumb !" Yep, I was so angry at the ending, I really yelled out loud, lol. Take my advice, after the truck leaves the oil well, shut it off and end it right there. If it had ended there, I would have liked the movie much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two trucks full of explosives have to be transported. Four fierce men try do the job for the money. This film is highly overrated. None of the actor stick to its character . If you wanna watch this film and you haven't seen it please don't read any further. Here's what I have to say. M. Jo gives away the pistol to his opponent in a brawl and looks heroic but gets scared on his way to deliver the stuff. Why is the brawl scene required? It is suggested that he kills another man so that he can go for the job (he was not selected) but that is not confirmed until the end. You sit for 2.5 hrs to see a truck finally reaching its destination. There are no twists and turns in the film. The only twists director could imagine were a wooden bridge and a big rock. How imaginative. There is a build up of an hour before the film really starts, I thought that one hour was about characterization but thats not true either. Its a waste of two hrs . Acting wise its OK. I have a problem with the depth of characters so no point in discussing that. I am giving 4 points for oil leak scene and actors who did that scene. A very boring and senseless film. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Communist film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting belongs to the French Noir strut and fret school, instead the modern acting as posing and shouting school, with a great deal of sentimental schlock about good labor-management relations, the nobility of labor, and revolution -- e.g., the woman who complains before the crowd about the oil well explosion and the resulting loss of limb and life is the same strikingly noble heroine shot in 3/4 profile from low camera angles that graces post office walls from the 1930's (and college dorm walls in the early 1970's) in the U.S. A classic instance from Ronald Reagan's "Hollywood Communist" agenda, albeit French. Mario is a Eurotrash clown, but muy macho, while Linda (Vera Clouzot), the "half-savage" adoring victim of Mario's apache, is impossible to portray in post-feminist film. Imagine a brunette Paris Hilton sans skank. If you've seen Sorcerer, Wages of Fear looks profoundly silly in places, especially the unsophisticated ending and brotherhood of laboring men ritual. Like Sorceror, the film features nude Yanamamo Indian ridicule of stupid white guys. One of my favorite movies, anthropologically speaking.</fullReview>
