		<shortDescription>James Bond goes to Romper Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of many thirty-somethings that grew up on this movie and later suffered nightmares featuring the Child Catcher. To this day, I still feel an uneasy chill when I hear the words "kiddie-winkies". Bit I still love this film on several levels. I loved it as a child because it's great cinema for children. I love it as a film student because it's a well-crafted, timeless fairytale. And I love it as an adult because it full of suggestive double meanings, much like the Warner Bros cartoons of the 1940s - the type of things that shoot straight over kids' heads and make adults snicker knowingly. With a screenplay penned by Ian Fleming, this should come as no surprise.Dick Van Dyke is Caractacus Potts, a wacky inventor who inexplicably lives in England with his two inexplicably English children. Caractacus Potts...wacky inventor,,,get it? Hoo hah! Potts and his two children (whose pictures may be seen in the dictionary next to the word "moppet") live with the senior Mr. Potts in a windmill/labratory. Caractacus rescues a junked motorcar from rusting in a field and restores it to new - meet Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, named for the sounds the car makes. Soon thereafter in one of those Pipi Longstocking-esque child-arranged dates, Potts and his two children go on a picnic with local richgirl Truly Scrumptious - possibly the best Bond Girl name since Pussy Galore. As the day winds down, Potts tells the children a story, in which the foursome embark on a great adventure in the resplendent Chitty Chitty Bang Bang which Potts as rigged to fly, float, drive itself, and perform other turn-of-the-century Batmobile-like functions.Our heroes end up in a far away kingdom ruled over by the Baron and Baroness Bomburst (Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle), a terribly sad place where children have been outlawed, rounded up, and kept in a dungeon. The gang and Chitty invade the kingdom to rescue Potts' father, who has mistakenly been identified as the inventor of the flying car and kidnapped. There, they befriend a toymaker (played by Benny Hill in one of his stock characters from his TV show) who hides the children while they attempt to spring grandpa Potts. Enter the Child Catcher, who lures the children with free lollipops and takes them away to the dungeon. Potts and the toymaker (who now only makes toys for the child-like king) hatch a plan to infiltrate the castle, rescue the elder Potts and the twin moppets, and free all the other children as well.I have two favorite scenes in this film. One is the musical number in the castle, where Truly and Potts are disguised as huge toys for the Baron's birthday. Truly is a wind-up doll on a music box, and Potts is a marionette who does a dance number that not only convinces you that he really is on strings, but that Dick Van Dyke is one of the most talented performers ever to be caught on film. My other favorite scene, I admit with guilt, is the one where the Baron and Baroness are readying themselves for bedtime, and prancing around the room in nightclothes calling each other by ultra-gooey-cute pet names. However, whenever the Baroness isn't looking, Baron Goldfinger takes a swing at her with an axe. It's the most entertainingly erotic scene in a kiddie flick since Natalie Wood was covered in cream pies while wearing only frilly turn-of-the-century underwear in "The Great Race".This film is a rare treat. It's a film that appeals to kids and keeps adults interested at the same time. Let your kids watch it, watch it with them, or just watch it yourself when you're in the mood for some pure, escapist fun.And try not to think about the Child Catcher when you go to bed afterward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprised folks wouldn't like this delightful film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It surprises me that some people think this is a horrible film. I was 3 when this film was released and for as long as I can remember I've loved it! The songs are fun, especially Hushabye Mountian, Chu-chi Face and Me Ole Bamboo. This movie is both light, cheery as well as dark and creepy, the Child Catcher to this day is one of the scariest villians I know! And know it is a fabulous musical in London! Hopefully someday it will come to Broadway, I'd love to see it on stage!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Comic and Fantasy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was one of those films from my childhood that I never outgrew. Every song, every outrageous comic moment tattooed itself on my memory and my heart. I love this film. It's funny, it's touching and it's beautifully made. True, it's not for the cynical or for those who want realism. For those, however, who seek adventure, comedy, great songs and most of all fun this classic 60's musical delivers it all in great style. A truly fun family film, although very small children may not be able to sit still through the entire movie (even with the Intermission). CCBB will always be at the top of my favourite movie list. Do yourself a favour if you like fun musical comedies and see Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes do some truly scrumptious work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best children's movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My two sons (now 4 and 2) have been obsessed with this movie for over a year now. They sing along to the songs and dance too - when old bamboo comes on, they pick up their sticks and hats and copy the routine. This is like an extended pantomime, with the scariest pantomime baddie in the history of movies. My brother couldn't sleep for a week after first seeing the childcatcher when he was 8. Anyway, this movie has everything - humour, pathos, great acting (and great casting), great songs and a great script (thank you Roald Dahl). I cannot fault this movie apart from the fact that it is a little long and the bit where they go off to vulgaria is a bit overextended. My family has now been to see the stage show twice too, and we are all firm "bang bang" nuts. If your kids have not seen this movie, then they haven't had a proper childhood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a timeless classic that out-Disneys Disney.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plain and simply, this is one of the best family films ever made. The fact that someone other than Disney made the film seems to have blinded some pundits (e.g., Disney scholar and film critic Leonard Maltin) to its many and varied charms. For "Chitty," in fact, originated in the book by James Bond creator Ian Fleming and, horror of horrors, was produced outside Hollywood by Albert Broccoli, the man behind the successful Bond film series. Yet, a closer look at the credits reveals the presence of the same musical composers, the much-heralded Sherman Brothers and Irwin Kostal, who could do no wrong when they wrote for Disney, but somehow left their talent behind when they signed on with Mr. Broccoli. (Note Maltin's comment in his 2007 film guide that the film's score is "forgettable.") The same apparently happened with the choreographers Dee Dee Wood and Marc Breaux, who are universally acclaimed for their work on "Mary Poppins," but ignored, at least by Maltin, for the snappy and often elaborate routines in "Chitty." In fact, the songs, background music and dances here are as good or better than anything in Disney and often actually advance the plot, rather than grinding it to a halt in the more customary way. A case in point is Caractacus' "Old Bamboo" song and dance routine, which provides not only an instantly memorable tune (and dance), but also the financial means to save Chitty from the scrap heap. The cast itself is nothing short of superb, with American comic actor Dick Van Dyke wisely eschewing any attempt at an English accent, something many of us wish he had done a few years earlier in "Poppins." (In a 1998 appearance on the Rosie O'Donnell show, the self-effacing Mr. Van Dyke acknowledged his limitation in the area of English accents.) The actors playing the children are a genuine delight, charming and sincere without being cloying, while the supporting cast is filled with more marvelous British character actors than one can count, not the least of them being Lionel Jeffries (actually six months younger than Van Dyke, whose father he was playing) and comedy legend Benny Hill in a rare straight role. And if that's not enough, there's always the scene in which Goldfinger himself (German actor Gert Frobe) sings and dances! Then there is the simply stunning cinematography by Christopher Challis, the marvelous costumes by Joan Bridge and Elizabeth Haffenden, and the fantastic production design by Oscar-winning designer Ken Adam, whose high ceilings and sloping walls are instantly identifiable from such classics as "Goldfinger" and "Dr. Strangelove." And unlike "Poppins," which is inexplicably praised for its obvious studio recreations of London streets, this film actually goes on location--and then some, showcasing truly magnificent settings in southern England, France and Germany (including the fabulous, fairy-tale Neuschwanstein Castle). Maltin and others have complained about the film's special effects, calling them "the shoddiest ever." What they are talking about is the blue screen traveling matte shots in which the magical car was optically placed in front of separately-shot film of a sky background. And I agree that several of these shots are "obvious" to film students who know how they are achieved. But, again, look at what is overlooked. The car itself, which undergoes several conversions for air and sea travel, is an amazing mechanical special effect designed and built by John Stears. Stears, of course, won an Oscar for the SFX on "Thunderball" and would go on to win another for a little film called "Star Wars." But never mind, what could he know about special effects? Oh, did I mention that the screenplay was co-written by Roal Dahl, someone who just might have known a thing or two about children's stories. But enough. This film is truly scrumptious from the first frame to the last, a timeless delight for anyone but Hollywood film critics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not enough musicals like this anymore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 36 years this movie is still loved by young children who see it. My 8 and 3 year old girls just love this movie and it's songs. Dick Van Dyke has done an absolute wonderful job putting out great quality movies for Disney and others. Sally Ann Howe sounds great and personally I prefer her over Julie Andrews anyway.Anyway, if you have not ever seen this film and even if you don't have kids, it's very entertaining! My favorite part is when Caracus Potts and Truly Scrumptious pretend to be toys for the Baron and do a nice song and dance. The tune is just great! I remember as a kid the Child Catcher scared the crap out of me. Robert Helpmann played this part very well. Who needs Freddy Kruger and all that gore anyway!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now available as "special edition" DVD ... go get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's been 2 years since I last posted a review for this movie... I have just purchased the "Special Edition" version mainly because at last there is a wide-screen DVD version now available! This was one movie that suffered very greatly from a standard T.V format transfer ..... Now in wide-screen,it is possible to see the cinematography as it was intended to be viewed from the original Super Panavision format,even though there is still some "enhanced" format alteration to bring it into line with 16:9 ratio and luckily it was shot in Technicolor,which was easily the best analogue colour system around. Perspectives can now be seen as intended and the beautiful sets and the dance routines look vastly better... you can actually see all the dancers ! Take for instance one scene in Caractacus Potts windmill laboratory,where he shows Truly Scrumptious one of his inventions with which he intends to transmit "pictures and sound".....in the standard format half of the shot is missing so the machine cannot be fully seen and it makes no sense.. however in wide-screen you can see the "picture" and also the whole machine; so now you can enjoy one of Emmet Rolands fantasy machine creations in full. All through the movie the scenery and sets are set up framed with objects in the foreground and back ground which lend to perspective and depth of the image. The sound track seems also to have been worked on .. in previous releases the children's voices seemed to "squeak" but now they sound much more natural. You can see how much we have been missing with previous releases and it is a lot. The Special Edition also has some featurettes on the making of the movie and other related information plus a lovely booklet as well.As to the movie itself .... it has never lost it's magic for me. I see reviews which pan the musical numbers or say it's too long or thatafter seeing it as an adult they were disappointed from what they remember as a child ... but is that not the point ? It is a movie for children and/or those adults who can still view it remembering the child in themselves. It has no coarse language , no mindless violence (except the pantomime variety).. no cynicism ...just fun. In short it is a type of movie that Hollywood can no longer make because they no longer know how ... so it should be treasured more for it. People criticize Dick Van Dykes "American" accent but I find it not intrusive at all ... in fact he would probably have been better off using his normal voice in "Mary Poppins" than attempting the cockney accent which he obviously had some difficulty with.Kids love this movie .. let them be the judges.Thank-you Cubby Broccoli ..we miss you. Thank-you Ian Fleming / Roald Dahl / Richard Maibaum and Ken Hughes. Thank-you Ken Adam ... a genius in design for Chitty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the whole family loves it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had mostly forgotten this movie after 30+ years, but my 2 year old received it as a gift, and is obsessed with it. It's fantastic, really. The locations are stunning, the musical numbers are (mostly) so lively, the physical humor is great! There is such a range of stuff in it, unlike current movies. I even like it for its flaws. It's really beautifully made. The thing I didn't remember, and that disappointed me at first, was that the whole story is a fantasy, a story within the story. I even like that the kids don't sing so well. They seem more real, less like little prodigies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hi, low anywhere we go...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one that has sadly fallen through the cracks of the "classic family musical" floor. My parents were on the ball and raised me on "mary Poppins," "sound of music," and of course, "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," and I have not yet been weaned off them. (Incidently, all three of these movies share a choreographer) The sheer imagination of this film is akin to that of Peter Pan. It is a tremendous celebration of childhood and fantasy. Sadly, this movie is often overlooked. As a college student, few of my friends know about this film. The few that do know of it treasure it. Every child should be so lucky as to be raised with Chitty. The dancing, the songs, the genius and humor showcase the best of musicals and childhood alike. Enjoy and share this unsung classic. We can hope that the new live musical in London will rekindle the public's appreciation for movies like thisP.S the "Old Bamboo" dance looks very much like the "Step in time," from Mary Poppins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning and amusing tale about a flying car and the family owner with a sympathetic Dick Van Dyke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This exciting children musical displays derring-do adventure, romance , thrills and spectacular frames with phenomenal production design . Imagination and fantasy with primitive but effective special effects galore including a mesmerizing photography with wonderful , marvelous landscapes . The flick gets lots of bombastic effects including flying machines , globes , romantic castles and numerous images have you on the edge of your seat . This is the most Fantasmagorical musical entertainment in the history of everything . In the early 20th century England, a weird inventor named Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke who steals the show as likable dancer and splendid player) works in his rare artifacts , he lives along with his equally rare father (Lionel Jeffries) , and his two little boys named Jeremy (Adrian) and Jemima (Heather). When the kiddies beg their daddy to buy for them thhe wished plaything , a broken car sitting at a local junkyard , a garage whose owner is George Coggings (Desmond Llewelyn) . Then eccentric Caractacus does whatever he can to make some money to buy it. One plan to raise money involves the unexpected help of a beautiful girl they have just met named Truly Scrumptious (a pretty young woman well performed by Sally Anne Howes), the daughter of a candy factory wealthy owner (James Robertson Justice) . Using his magic skills, inventive Caractacus turns the piece of junk into a marvelous working machine , an amazing flying car that also navigates which they name Chitty Chitty Bang Bang because of the noise the engine sounds . At a seaside picnic with his children and Truly , Caractacus and Co. spins a fanciful tale of an eccentric inventor, his gorgeous new friend , his two children, and his favorite car named Chitty all in the faraway country of Vulgaria. The nasty Baron Bomburst, the king of Vulgaria, will do whatever he can to get his hands on the magical car. Then the villain Baron Bomburst (Gert Frobe) married to Baroness Bomburst (Anna Quayle) robs the car of ours friends . The baron has made kiddies illegal, being pursued by the sinister child catcher (Robert Helpmann) including the unsuspecting children of a stranger inventor of a fabulous car . Later on ,Caractacus helped by a toymaker (Benny Hill) have to attempt and save the kiddies of Vulgaria.This children motion picture mingles musical numbers , flat jokes , noisy action , flying car pursuits , humor with tongue-in-cheek, rip roaring and lots of amusement . This is an entertaining film loosely based on book by Ian Fleming and well adapted by Roal Dahl , it packs fantasy , musical numbers which both pastiche and subvert adventure and speculative fiction of the period ¨Belle Epoque . The picture incorporates contemporary action film as well as much use of adventure to portray its fanciful elements , furthermore visual effects within the form of the older-style films they have largely superseded . Riveting for its casting , but overall , roller-coaster spectacle . Most of the charm and wit remains from original story in this particular version . It results to be an amusing of somewhat aloof , storytelling of children classic with a magnificent star cast at its best . Stimulating adventures of ours protagonists are complemented by a breathtaking final attraction in the castle scenes . The film is a Dick Van Dyke recital , he sings , dances, stooges, makes acrobatics, tongue twister and pulls faces and grimaces . It's a farce with the master comic pretty amusing and with several choreography and musical numbers . Ideal main cast is completed by phenomenal secondary actors as Lionel Jeffries , James Robertson Justice , Benny Hill and Desmond Llewelin , among others. Atmospheric , lively score by Irwin Kostal , fitting splendidly to adventure and musical numbers , including the classic leitmotif . Colorful and glamorous cinematography by Christopher Challis in Super Panavision 7o with the fantastic château scenes filmed in Neuschwanstein Castle, Hohenschwangau, Schwangau, Bavaria, Germany . The picture is lavishly produced by Albert R Broccoli ,James Bond's producer, and brilliantly directed by Ken Hughes . He's a good writer, producer and director, who achieved big time when made ¨Cromwell¨, ¨Trials of Oscar Wilde¨ , ¨Casino Royale¨ and of course with ¨Chitty , Chitty Bang Bang¨.This is a highly amusing and frequently funny action-adventure romp with a witty script specifically aimed at a kiddies' audience , though excessive songs leave adult spectators a bit seasick . Picture is a vehicle Van Dyke , he's an authentic comic and real Farceur. If you like Dyke's crazy interpretation , you will most definitely enjoy this one . Well worth watching for passable special effects and an enjoyable performances from main cast as the children will like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring Back the Musicals!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote earlier about Willy Wonka being one of the films I watched thin at my grandparents' house. Chitty was the other. I really wish the musicals would come back. So what if they were unrealistic and kitsch and blah blah blah? They were also beautiful and uplifting, unlike all the apocalyptic, chainsaw-slashing trash today. Call me nostalgic, but I miss the innocence and just outright FUN. People sneer at naivety today, but I cannot honestly remember a happier time than that. But I digress....Chitty was a spectacular fantasy about a poor family lead by an insanely inventive patriarch, Caractacus Potts (crackpot- get it? haha). The inventions are really fun to watch, the songs are catchy and well sung (Toot Sweets is my favorite) and I always wanted a car just like Chitty. I thought Sally Anne Howes was lovely as Truly (thought i never got she was truly scrumptious until much later). Dick Van Dyke is a fav., though I was always wierded out since everyone but him had British accents. I guess he got raked too hard for his whole Burt-accent-disaster. The Rat Catcher was great! "And all free today..." what a fabulously creepy guy.Great songs, great acting, beautiful scenery, fancy and fun- what more could you possibly want from a movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Fantasy Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a bias. This film charmed the freckles off me when I was 10. I fell in LOVE with it, a love that continues to this day. When I went to Germany, I visited Neuschwanstein castle, not because of Ludwig II or Richard Wagner--but because of this movie! It's perfectly cast, with brilliant, astounding music, and a design that knocks your socks off. There's only one moment where the magic languishes: when the picnic at the beach is almost over.It's one of those films that, frame by frame, only get better with each subsequent viewing--because it's so rich and deep. Dick Van Dyke was never better. Sally Ann Howe is perfect. Gert Frobe, Sir Robert Helpmann and Anna Quayle are by turns menacing and hilarious, the script by legendary Roald Dahl is mesmerizing and the art direction is breathtaking.However, this film about the love of a magical automobile may appeal more to boys than girls. No wonder they've made a stage musical of this. The only mystery is why it took them so long!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional film that's vastly under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" is a 70mm film; a modern audience can't see it on TV today and truly understand why it was a hit in 1968, and remembered so fondly by us 40-50ish adults. If you saw it on a wide screen in 1968, like I did as an 11-year-old at the Astro Theatre in Omaha, it was delightful and overpowering. The dark theatre, the glow of the screen, the wonderful scenes of the English countryside during the day and as the sun set, the magnificence of the newly-refurbished old car as it is wheeled out of the dark garage accompanied by a swell of the evocative theme music, and the panoramic view of Neuschwanstein Castle, left an impression on me that lingers today. This is a film that cries out for wide screen theatre re-release, and if it were we'd have a whole generation of children who would fall in love with it again. Tiny, box-like megaplexes have stolen a lot of the grandeur from the film-going experience, which is a terrible loss to us, the film-going public.While I usually agree with most of his reviews, I'm going to take violent exception to Leonard Maltin's review of this film (as I do with his inexplicably bad review of the fantastic 1980 film "Popeye"). This film has an outstanding score that I've remembered for 32 years, and excellent special effects that fit very much within the timeframe of the film, which is why they are done the way they are done. The score is by Richard and Robert Sherman, who create songs just as memorable as they did 4 years earlier in "Mary Poppins." The title song and main theme have stayed with me all these years, and I sometimes find myself singing it for no apparent reason. "Posh" is a comic masterpiece and Lionel Jeffries was a perfect choice to sing it. "Hushabye Mountain" is a lovely lullaby, and "Chu-chi Face" is hilarious. "Me Ol' Bamboo" is an wonderful, energetic production number akin to the Chimney Sweep song in Mary Poppins, and "The Roses of Success" has long been a favorite of mine. And the duet between Van Dyke and Howe when they posed as a marionette and music box dancer, respectively, is just about my favorite part of the film.Dick Van Dyke is perfect as the inventor; Sally Anne Howe is a lovely singer and a competent actress, but doesn't have the screen presence Julie Andrews does. That's the only detriment to the major casting of the film. Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle are delightful standouts as the evil and spoiled King and Queen Bomburst; their time on screen is far too short. My only quibble is that the film is a trifle too long, and one of the earlier musical numbers could have been cut. Other than that it's perfect.This is a great film that deserves to be seen by everyone in the way it was intended - on a wide, wide screen in glowing 70mm with stereo sound. If you've never seen it in that fashion, you're missing an essential movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Underrated. Wonderfully sweet and sentimental. Scary too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally I respect the views of critics, if not agree with them. But... I read the reviews of CCBB after seeing the movie about 8 years ago. I was surprised at how scathing the critics were. So I watched it again and I am convinced that the critics totally blew this one. Yes, I know it's not "Trainspotting" or "Adaptation". Yes, yes, it's not "Fargo" or "Pulp Fiction." But it's not supposed to be!!! Here's a secret apparently the critics missed: It's meant for families. This is a sweet, sweet movie. This movie is unique in that it puts me in the most sentimental, loving mood. It puts me in the best mood. I love songs like "Truly Scrumptious." Perhaps you're past feeling if you hate this movie. And the scary child catcher is perfect. I still remember him from when I saw the movie decades ago as a kid. I unabashedly love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantasmagorical !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel written by James Bond creator Ian Flemming, this delightful fantasy charts the journey into the mysteriously childless world of Vulgaria by Caractacus Potts, his two children, Truly Scrumptious and super car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.I think the main thing that makes this film work so well is that it has a little of everything to make a successful family movie. Catchy tunes at every turn, a fairy tale kingdom awash with colour, bonkers technology, and a little slice of wickedness involving class distinction. Split very much into two halves, Chitty at its core is really about forming a complete family. We are introduced to Caracatus {Dick Van Dyke} who is a single father, who is doing his best to raise his two children with moral fortitude. It's thru the children's love of an old rusty car that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is born, and after pretty lady Truly Scrumptious {a gorgeous Sally Ann Howes} comes into their lives, all four of them enter the second half of the movie after having firmly capturing the audience's attention with a firming promise of a family in waiting.The second half of the picture then whisks us far away into fantasy territory. Vulagaria is ruled by crackers toy obsessive Baron Bomburst {Gert Fröbe in wonderful bacon sandwich mode}, he has banned children, and naturally he has his sights set firmly on the magnificence that is Chitty Chitty. Bomburst sends out his child snatcher to nab Caracatus's kids in the hope of bargaining for the special car. The child snatcher played by Robert Helpman is as iconic as he is terrifying, wonky hat and pointy nose he lures children in with promises of sweets and treacle tarts, he thus became the invader of many a child's poor nightmares for sure.But this is a family film after all, and sure enough this splendid ride speeds to a joyous finale that is cloaked in colour and feel good eccentricity, yep, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang still works on repeat viewings. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ian Fleming Wrote Books for Children ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I dedicate this piece of writing to Ian Fleming (1908-1964), the ingenious creator of 007 James Bond and also to all those defectors from the East that made the world beautiful today - cf., "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (1968). Since I don't want to miss an opportunity with each of 23 individual Movies from the Bond's series, I decided to place my reference for Ian Fleming in the paragraph with his less popular hero Caractacus Potts and his flying automobile. So putting it bluntly "Hollywood can no longer make movies like that because they no longer know how ... (cited from another reviewer). True or false, Movies for Children with fantastic element in it hadn't been so many in circulation for the mentioned period in the 1960s and 1970s (when I was a growing kid) - here I could point out "Wonderful World of Brothers Grimm" (1962), "Mary Poppins" (1964), "Doctor Dolittle" (1967), "Pippi Longstocking" (1969) with sequels, and maybe some other that I don't remember.Opinion research on Ian Fleming and his hero James Bond is something else. Fleming, who worked for Reuters as journalist, was recruited by British Foreign Service to do some coverage for espionage trials - particularly, when after 1947 it became highly popular for government officials from the Eastern Bloc to desert West with some classified information. In the country where I live, Bulgaria, "show trials" were made for Traicho Kostov and Nikola Petkov both sentenced to death. This was the beginning of Cold War, per se. Leakage happened from West-to-East also, when Rosenberg family divulged secret for A-bomb to the Russians. The World was never going to be same as before. Conventional war started and Combat battle on front-line was history. Can you believe this, some 3000 years after the Trojan War!Now get on grounds and pay tribute to Ian Fleming, the Colossus of espionage novel. He didn't have pretensions to have invented sullenly his hero James Bond. In fact, the 14 novels that were written for Agent 007 (i.e., "license to kill in the line of duty") took Fleming only 10 years and ruined respectively his health. He was heavy drinker and smoker; he died age 56. That was not bad age to die after making millions and also the phenomenon "compression of mortality" was not yet known.I want to complement at end few words on the prototype Spy that Fleming used for his novels. Firstly comes Sidney Reilly (1873-1925) - viz., a notorious adventurer (born as Solomon Rosenblum) in tsarist Russia, who worked for London at least 20 years before executed by the Bolsheviks. The second prototype Spy whom I didn't see mentioned is Oleg Penkovsky (1919-1963). Fleming shouldn't have missed his dossier if he was involved with Foreign Service coverage. Oleg Penkovsky, a colonel with Soviet Military Intelligence, defected to London in the 1950s. He and his contact person Greville Wynne (from MI5) were caught in 1963 and put to trial, where Penkovsky was sentenced to death and Greville Wynne to 8 years in prison (as foreign subject, he was released in 1965 for exchange to another double agent Sgt. Jack Dunlap, an American who spied for U.S.S.R.) Whatever, it is evident from "Penkovskiy Papers: The Russian Who Spied for the West, New York, 1966" that he leaked top secret for at least 5 years before dying. So, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy could be traced directly to this defective line. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over long?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have noticed several comments concerning this movie that condemn it for being "over long". It's very interesting to me that just about any film that dares extend past the two hour mark is thought to be too long. Yet, Americans can watch a three, four, or sometimes even five hour sporting event and think nothing of it. It's nothing to sit in front of the TV or the computer for hours on end. Even stage productions that run close to three hours are not considered too long. Our attention span is just fine for lots of other things, why are movies so different? Anyway, now that I've gotten down from my soap box, on to the movie. "Chitty" is a wonderful film for young and old alike. The cast is right on. The songs are very tuneful and memorable, especially the title tune. The film keeps a good pace and stays interesting. Personally, I can watch the whole thing from beginning to end without it losing my attention. (Oops! Back on that soap box again! Get down from there!) About the only minor regret that I have is not seeing Julie Andrews cast as Truly. She would have been Scrumptious. Not to disparage Sally Ann Howes, who was wonderful.All in all, a wonderful film that everyone should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in 1974 and grew up watching this movie whenever it came on TV. For the era of special effects this movie was done as well as good be for it's time. I was so happy it was released on DVD. I also own the soundtrack. To me the movie will forever be a part of my childhood that I will remember fondly. The child catcher kinda scared me, but I truly love all the songs. I'm sometimes catching myself humming one of the songs. Personally this movie to me surpasses MARY POPPINS. As a child growing up in the 70's and 80's there are just those movies that you can never get tired of watching. I seem to fast forward to only one part and that's when Truly is singing about Mr. Potts. (lovely lonely man?) that part just bores me. Dick Van Dyke is also amazing as all the others who were in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not at all chitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a little trepidation I saw this after many years and was surprised how enjoyable it still was. The critics seemed to hate it especially the songs but having just watched "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers" which the critics all love, I'll take "Chitty's" songs every time. It must be a generation thing. For a two and a half hour film I wasn't bored for a second, although the scenes with the baron's two spies were a mistake and seemed to belong to a different film. At least half the songs are classics that every "kid" of my age know instantly. Some of the humour is quite dark and the child catcher is still rather frightning. It's a children's classic that has been treated very unfairly over the years. (I've just found out that Lionel Jeffries is actually 6 months younger than his son!!) (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really - How Can You Not Like This?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A delightful fantasy for the whole family to watch. There really is something for everyone here. A cartoonish story with "comic book characters" like the "Child Catcher" (Robert Helpmann) and "Baron Bomburst" (Gert Frobe) that the kids will love, and some marvelous song and dance routines from Sally Ann Howe as "Truly Scrumptious" and Dick Van Dyke as the inventor "Caractacus Potts" that the grown ups will marvel at. I never realized until I watched this movie as an adult what a marvelously talented man Van Dyke is, but his dance scenes are absolutely amazing (particularly "The Old Bamboo" performance at the carnival.)The story is imaginative. A flying car whisks Truly and Caractacus, along with the two Potts children Jeremy and Jemima (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley respectively) off to the fictional kingdom of "Vulgaria" (where children are forbidden) to rescue eccentric Grandpa Potts (played absolutely perfectly by Lionel Jeffries), who has been kidnapped by Bomburst in the mistaken belief that he's the inventor of the car. This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and you have to think like a child to watch it and appreciate it as an adult. Until today I had never actually seen the movie unedited, and I found it just a delight.It's true that there are weaknesses. Although Dick Van Dyke put on a marvellous performance, he ironically seems totally out of place with his American accent. I truly can't figure out how Caractacus' father can have a British accent, and Caractacus' children can have British accents, but Caractacus himself has an American accent? It's something you wouldn't notice as a kid, but as an adult I found it somewhat distracting. Also, Hall and Ripley didn't blow me away (I know - give them a break; they were just kids. Still, I've seen better performances from children that age.)But why nitpick. Suspend disbelief, think like a kid, sit back and enjoy the ride.8/10.</fullReview>

The songs are fantastic and you will just find yourself singing along to them without realising. The dances are excellent and all of the characters bring so much to the movie. would recommend this film to anybody. Grandpa Potts brings lots of laughter and many of the characters in the film you could relate to. The London theatre production of chitty chitty bang bang is also brilliant and makes you want to just sing along, there is extra songs in the theatre production and all of these fit in and are also brilliant as are the songs in the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly For Little Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the beginning of this film with a neat old-time auto race. Then the main characters in the movie were introduced and they were all likable and nice. The kids were cute and Dick Van Dyke's inventions were fun to view. (So is Van Dyke's name in here: "Caractacus Potts.")About halfway into the film - maybe this was just me - but those high-pitched whiny-type voices on the kids ("Daddy this, Daddy that" constantly) got to me. By then, I also had the general flavor of the songs, which I did not find particularly good.The special-effects with the flying car might have been passable in 1968 but they look really dated now. The humor, too, was too juvenile especially with the villains who weren't funny, just stupid.However, I am writing this criticisms as an older adult and I am sure little kids would still like this movie, as they did 40 years ago, except even they are bound to get fidgety sitting through 144 minutes of this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, meet Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one would ever make a movie like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in current day - and more's the pity. For a film so iconic, it draws from a curious fusion of influences. Yes, it's an oddity already by being adapted from the only children's work penned by Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond (even if only whiffs of Fleming's aristocratic preoccupations remain in the film's class disparity subtext). There's also the unmistakable lyrically acrobatic musical chirpiness of the Sherman brothers, which is vintage Mary Poppins caliber. The whimsical weirdness of screenwriter Roald Dahl's is embraced at full tilt, and there's even a strong Monty Python vibe in its surreal, heightened goofiness. But somewhere in the centre of the maelstrom of zaniness lies something fundamentally Chitty: adorably sweet and earnest amidst its heartfelt wackiness. And it's this that helps the film hold up much better than you'd expect - still a delight for children young and old even nearly forty years on. Attempting to summarize the film's increasingly off-the-rails plot reads like the story was written by one of its target audience ("and then the flying car and spies follow the sky-pirates to an evil Baron's kingdom full of toys!"), but it's clear that cohesion is far from the point. If anything, the film's halfhearted attempt to rationalize its fantasy interlude as a story-within-the-story feels both clumsy and disingenuous to its enjoyable whimsy. Still, there's too much fun being had to dwell on technicalities. And while Dahl cutting loose with silly abandon in his adventure for the ages is grandiose enjoyment, it's actually just as pleasant to hang out with Van Dyke's kooky inventory and his impressively adorable-but-not-annoying children (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley), as he gets up to scientific mischief or simply sings about how he loves their family. But just when the proceedings of reconciling the heteronormative family unit skirt becoming too winsome, Dahl's wackiness comes crashing in to keep things breezy and bizarre. It helps, of course, that the film looks wonderful: Chitty herself is a gorgeous vehicle (even if the rear projection sequences of her driving or flying show their age). Fellow 007 veteran Ken Adam conjures spectacular sets grandiose enough for Goldfinger himself - Van Dyke's laboratory in particular is a labyrinth of contorted Seussian cogs and pipes. The sumptuous song and dance numbers complete the package, adding a stacked roster of perfectly heartwarming and hugely infections tunes to keep a smile on even the most curmudgeonly of faces. Still, it's the cast of characters that really keep the film afloat. Apart from the peerless, rubber-limbed, disarmingly grinning Dick Van Dyke at his most irresistibly charming, Sally Ann Howes' Truly Scrumptious (Dahl's poke at Fleming's goofy misogyny in naming female leads) showcases some impressive belting, as well as a welcome sweet side as her initial fussiness melts away. Supporting them are the most memorably zany crew of comedic relief this side of Python. Lionel Jeffries' prissy posturing as Van Dyke's garrulous grandfather is a dead ringer for Graham Chapman at his most side-splitting, particularly when scoffing an ode to British posh composure while being repeatedly dunked in the ocean swinging from a helicopter. Similarly, the delightful Gert Fröbe lampoons his Goldfinger villainy with stupendously silly gumption as the infantile Baron Bomburst; he even manages to sell his repeated attempts to casually murder his wife play as hilarious slapstick rather than as dubious as they'd sound. Alexander Doré and Bernard Spear's Spies punctuate scene transitions with sublime throwaway slapstick, while Robert Helpmann's leering Child Catcher is a vintage Dahl nightmare, verging on excessively creepy for his intended audience. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang may sputter throughout its jubilant refrains, with its 'kitchen sink' comedy and awkwardly motivated fantasy interjection toeing the limit of indulgent silliness. But in the same way that engine sputter has become one of the most iconic sound effects in cinema history, so has its eponymous car charmed its way into the hearts of generations - ramshackle but not rusty. So, whether reminiscing fondly through rosy nostalgia glasses or a new recruit, come and fly away with Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. As Van Dyke affirms, it's simply the pragmatic course of action. -8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless 60s musical starring Dick Van Dyke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen this movie in years as I seen it on TV as a little girl. Today I got it on DVD and watched it. The film is about an eccentric inventor(played by Van Dyke)who is a widower with two children. His two children spots an old banger that was set for sale by another man so his two children meet a woman named Truly(played by Sally Ann Howes) who offers them a ride home as they were suppose to go to school.Meanwhile their father ends up getting the car instead of the other man who wanted to buy it but didn't after so he builds it out of the new again and it turns from being a Grand Prix car into a magical flying car that flies and enters a whole new world by using their imaginations. For example Mr Potts imagines Pirates near a beach that they visit and other magical creations that they imagine.Overall packed with great songs including the title song Chitty Chitty Bang Bang from the same composers that gave us Mary Poppins and starring a great set of actors this is one feel good musical that we don't normally get anymore in cinema history. If I had any complaints about this film its gotta be the running time which is a whooping 2 hours and 45 minutes long. Also the songs to their credit are good but they are sometimes in one ear and out the other. But having said that its a timeless classic that everyone must watch or own on DVD to add to their film collection. Sally Anne Howes reminds me of Julie Andrews as sometimes I thought it was her as she has the same accent and mannerisms as her. Dick Van Dyke was great as the over the top inventor Mr Potts who has to mind his two children on his own and befriends Truly later on in the film who joins him and his children in his new invention with the old banger. Keep an eye out for Barbara Windsor who was in Eastenders as Peggy Mitchell and also in some of the Carry On films.My overall rating is a 9/10. Classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charming, but incredibly unfocused. Starts very sweetly and promisingly. However, from a point it takes one bizarre random turn after another. Still very sweet and innocent, but devoid of a plot (surprising, considering the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, based on an Ian Fleming book). The random scenes needn't have been so irritating if director Ken Hughes had just kept them to a minimum, as the remainder of the movie is great. However, the fairy tale sequence goes on for an eternity.Good performances by Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes in the lead roles. The kids, Heather Ripley and Adrian Hall, are great too. Good support from James Robertson Justice. Interesting to see Benny Hill in the fairy tale sequence - one of the few highlights of that part.Music is so-so. Some songs were downright cringeworthy.Overall, the charm and innocence more than make up for the random plot, and it would be very difficult to dislike the movie. Kids will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family classic somewhere between "Mary Poppins" and "Willy Wonka", from the people who brought you James Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that I was exposed to CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG (1968), at least to some degree, as a child. There were certain things I remembered. The flying car, of course. The creepy child catcher. The mechanical doll sequence. But I'm not sure I ever sat through the entire movie, as I had no real recollection of the story. So my recent viewing was practically like seeing the film for the first time.At nearly two and a half hours long, CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG is an epic of a family film, and it covers a lot of ground. The first forty minutes or so are a bit slow, as we spend time getting to know the main players. Dick Van Dyke is a penniless Rube Goldberg-type inventor raising two children. Lionel Jeffries is the eccentric father/grandfather, late of the British army. Sally Ann Howes is the well-bred daughter of a candy tycoon. We get to see some of Van Dyke's kooky inventions and there are extended sequences at a candy factory and a carnival. This early portion of the film is underwhelming.The movie really "starts" once the fantasy story kicks in. Van Dyke fixes up an old racing car and takes the kids out for a picnic. After a pleasant day at the beach, Van Dyke spins a tale that then becomes the narrative of the film. Fantasy and reality are blurred as Van Dyke and his kids (and Sally Ann Howes, and Lionel Jeffries) are pursued by those who covet the fancy new car of the film's title. In this fantasy, the car can both float on water and fly through the air, thanks to Van Dyke's genius. The adventure takes our heroes to a small kingdom ruled by Gert Fröbe (GOLDFINGER - 1964) where children are forbidden.The film really picks up with the switch to fantasy. It's a delightful adventure with some fun comedic bits and slapstick antics. And the songs are great, including "Posh!", "Chu-Chi Face", "Doll On a Music Box", "Truly Scrumptious", and of course the triumphant theme "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang".The story is full of imaginative spark. Flying motorcars. Zeppelins toting shacks across the ocean. Villainous barons who ride over-sized toy horses. It's a fairy tale land. Something out of a dream. The two bumbling Vulgarian spies are a riot. They first appear disguised as cowl vents on a ship deck. Their comedy is almost cartoony in style.Lionel Jeffries, often cast older than his true age, gives a spirited performance. It is his best-known role. Sally Ann Howes is lovely and has a great singing voice. Dick Van Dyke shows off his talent for physical comedy in a marionette routine. Fröbe's Baron is a blustery Bavarian buffoon, humorously inclined to wife-icide. Robert Helpmann's sinister "Child Catcher" is unforgettable and has been known to induce nightmares.CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG has an interesting pedigree. The script was co-written by children's author Roald Dahl ("Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"). The movie is based on a novel by James Bond scribe Ian Fleming, and was produced by Albert Broccoli of the 007 films. Regular Bond collaborator Ken Adam was in charge of production design, and the cast also features Bond veterans Gert Fröbe ("Auric Goldfinger") and Desmond Llewelyn ("Q"). Songwriting brothers Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman were hired to duplicate their success with Disney's MARY POPPINS (1964), which also starred Dick Van Dyke. (In fact, a couple musical numbers in CHITTY recall Van Dyke's powerhouse "Step in Time" number in POPPINS.)All this background makes CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG a peculiar film. A family classic somewhere between MARY POPPINS and WILLY WONKA, from the people who brought you James Bond.While good family fun, CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG does not reach the distilled perfection of MARY POPPINS. That earlier film had garnered all sorts of Academy Award recognition, winning five Oscars out of thirteen nominations. But CHITTY is beloved by generations of moviegoers. The direction seems weak or messy at times, and the story and performances didn't do much for me out of the gate. But once the adventure starts, the movie settles into place. The songs of the Sherman Brothers are memorable and certain characters and scenes leave an impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Turn of the Century Bond for the Whole Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember when I first saw this movie, but I caught it recently on Netflix. As most of you may know, this was an adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel produced by Cubby Broccoli, and with parts filmed at Pinewood Studios in England, if it all sounds a little familiar this the same people that have done the early Bond movies. Desmond Llewelyn (The original and best Q from the Bond films) makes an appearance as 1920's version of his Q character. Like most Broccoli films this is a pure fantasy done for a child's eye. There are lots of musical numbers, my favorite being the "Roses of Success" number. That's one we can all take with us. I don't think anyone has delved very deeply into the character of Chitty herself. A great racer, her racing days are cut short when she is forced to take a fatal dive off the track to avoid striking a child and her dog, thus not only losing the race but relegating herself to scrap heap where she is befriend by two children. When Mr Coggins agrees to sell her to a junk man to be melted down, the children come to her rescue. Once rescued, Chitty is brought back to life by their inventor father. They hit the road with Chitty and she becomes fiercely loyal and displays super powers to get the family and lovely Truly Scrumptious out of danger. I can appreciate this now more than I could as a child. This movie reminds me a lot of the Herbie the Love Bug movies which were coming out about the same time. Chitty is much more visually spectacular than the Herbie movies, and her part is much more low key with no actual interaction with the other characters. If you've ever fixed up an old vehicle or rescue one from going to a scrap yard, you can understand the bond that appears to develop between the owners and the vehicle. Anyway enough of my rambling. It runs a little long in spots, if this were in a theater today,I doubt most kids could sit through with out being medicated but then again maybe not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They don't make them like that anymore. A real double feature with intermission music and exit music, the first part ending in some catastrophe and the second part starting with the same catastrophe that turns upside down into a miracle. But it is a lot more than that.This musical is for children and it has all the characteristics that were considered normal in those days, I mean some forty years ago or so. Music of course, nice songs of course, but also the myth of the car, paid for the Ford Corporation or company, and the perfect family with a boy, a girl and a dog, with a grandfather and an unmarried father and of course a beautiful young lady near by.But the story goes far beyond and during a trip to the beach, the father starts telling a fantastic story that unveils itself as if it were true in the main story. It will be called a dream, it will be called some kind of a tale, fairy tale maybe, and that sounds a lot better than the "mise en abyme" of the Hollywood effete snobs. And it is a lot better for children who love stories within stories within stories, and in this case there are probably four or five, one inside the other, that come out like Jacks in the box and open up like Russian dollies, some Matryoshka full of surprise and the whole Bulgarian situation to which the children are captured, the grandfather is deported and the father and his young lady friend are baited and attracted is such a Russian dolly with the village and then the castle and in between several layers of prisons, dungeons and underground inescapable labyrinths.At each corner of these tunnels and corridors you have more dangers and dangerous soldiers or wardens than you may even count. It is a country where children are forbidden and when there is one or more, they are captured and deported to some concentration camp where they grow away from the sun and adults till they die. So from pirates we jump to a barbarous king who is a child who has never matured and only wants toys to play with and real soldiers to play war as if they were some tin soldiers. Then the main objective becomes the liberation of the children, of the village and the getting rid of this immature king who should have been institutionalized a long time ago. But in a way, in his own perverse way, he is funny and the tale will catch him up and send him back to real life under the identity of some Wall Street entrepreneur or speculator. We even forget the whole thing is a love story with the two children choosing their future mother and manipulating their father into marrying her. But do they know what they are doing? They seem to live on what was a norm in those days that a son and a daughter could not grow up if they did not have a father and a mother, without forgetting a dog and a house with a garden. And I forgot: they have to be poor at first and become rich in the end. It is definitely a precursor or pioneer of both Indian Jones and Back to the Future, though watching it in our modern world is like going back to the past when the dream was a real dream and the fun of the cinema was not competing with the humdrum never ending fun of TV and of course the even worse virtual bath in which we are soaking if not drowning all the time, the Internet and the Cloud. As for flying in the clouds, this car is sure good, as good at least as the car of the Crazy mad scientist of Back to the Future.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the greatest musicals of all time. The flow and movement of the story and interweaving of the gorgeous music is something I never get tired of. I remember viewing this film as a child and reading (and being much surprised that the author was none other than "oo7" himself, Ian Fleming!). The expansion of Mr. Fleming's novel is simply Scrumptious. Dick Van Dykes' portrayal of the eccentric inventor is just wonderful. Ilove it when he dances with the troupe at the carnival, stealing the show along with the fantastic dancers/singers who accompany him. The lullaby he sings to the children is one of my all-time favorite songs...it is so poignant and brilliantly written. Susan Ann Howes' role as Truly Scrumptious was delightful and when she is a music box ballerina she just melts my heart....There is so much I could say about "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" but my recommendation is just to sit back with a bag of Spicy Nacho popcorn (My personal favorite) and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: enormous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is one of those movies I grew up on. I've seen it so many times that no matter how long I wait, I remember everything that happens. In all honesty, I HATE some of the musical numbers the theme song is repeated way too much and the film really could have gone without "Truly Scrumptious" and "Lovely Lonely Man". But I do have a soft spot for "Roses of Success". But that's not why I like this film. I like it because it's enormous. It takes the viewer so many places and does so many things, all within two and a half hours. Sure, a big slice of the film is a giant detour of a daydream, but that's not a disadvantage when there's so much to see. It's the ride that counts after all, and this one is rife with fantasy, music, humor, tender moments and visual flair. This is a classic that deserves to be one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i loved this movie as a kid and always preferred it to mary poppins, when i was about 13 i decided to watch it again and i fell in love with it for a 2nd time and haven't stopped watching it since. its a nice story for everyone with an imagination. clearly because it's fantasy you know everything will turn out OK in the end but either way i love it and will recommend it to anyone of any ages. the stage production is unmissable too. the soundtrack to this movie is enjoyable and no one can hate it, sing-along or simply listen your choice. the car in real life is fantastic to look at too. for a 1968 film with not a lot of special FX like we have now the film is a masterpiece and will be forever more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I in a way grew up with this film. It's just so cool, and I know all the words to the songs. Dick Van Dyke was awesome in his role, as he always is, and the other actors were great as well. It always reminds me of Mary Poppins in a way, especially the "Me Old Bamboo" part. Considering Dick Van Dyke isn't a dancer, he sure looks like one in this film. If this movie didn't win an award, it should have. It's awesome! The car is one of my favorite things, and my favorite singing-dancing part is the doll part. Sally Ann Howes is awesome in this movie! She has an amazing voice. The children were also good. The grandfather, oh, how funny he was. He's such an eccentric in this film, and I always laugh at him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wondrous tale for kids, but a little frightening for little kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie growing up, and I must have seen it over a dozen times. It never fails to amaze me at the breadth of situations. It is truly epic.I've always loved the movie, and with kids of my own, just bought it.The story is great and there's a lot to it, but there is a character that hates little kids (and can 'sniff' them out with his huge proboscis). He is scary. You should be with your kids during the last 1/3 of the film when he is around. However, the entire film is a delightful flight of fantasy, starting with no particular goal and then drawing the (child) viewer in by becoming more and more engrossing.Can you imagine the people who made the bond films making a child's film? They did it, and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is it. Ian Fleming wrote, Albert Broccoli produced, but wait, Roald Dahl also wrote!!! It's a kid's film of gigantic proportions. (They squeezed this in between 'You only live twice' and 'her majesty's secret service')It needs to be seen to be appreciated.Caveat - if you hate musicals like I do, there is a bunch of singing. I grew up with this one, so the music doesn't bug me, but it might drive you crazy, a la Disney films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Blast from my past!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the first films I remember seeing in the theater,away back in 1968--I would've been five or six. The friends I wentwith afterwards named their new poodle "Truly Scrumptious!" Well,some 30+ years later and it has not lost any of its charm--a funmovie "for the entire family", as it were. In retrospect, it is quite adark tale, which may be explained by Roald Dahl's name as one ofthe scriptwriters. Robert Helpmann's wonderfully oily turn as theChild Catcher is still creepy and Benny Hill is, well, Benny Hill! Gert Frobe is silly and malevolent as the Ruler of Vulgaria, and hisnumber with Anna Quayle is a sadistic treat. Funny, I did noticethat when I was five...The songs by the unstoppable ShermanBros. and the kinetic energy of Dick Van Dyke make this a realtreat. SADLY, the DVD has only been released in a PAN &amp; SCANformat, utterly destroying some of the nicest widescreencompositions ever. If you can find it, grab the MGM/UA Laserdisc!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw CHITTY as a 5 year old in the summer of '69 in the theater. Ever since, this movie has been like an old friend and has tremendous sentimental value for me. At first, as a child, I was mainly intrigued by the car and its many magical talents. As I got older and became active in musical theater, I came to deeply appreciate the choreography and music. Check out that "Old Bamboo" number! I think that the Sherman Brothers score for this film is indeed up there with MARY POPPINS, despite some critical opinions. The film is beautifully photographed in England, France, and Germany, and the costumes are lovely to look at.True - it's strange that Mr. Van Dyke makes no attempt at a British accent, but this is minor. His star performance and his singing/dancing/comic abilities more than carry the film. He has a great moment where he chokes up in the middle of a song, while he is trying to console a gathering of captive children in a dungeon. Sally Ann Howes is an charming leading lady - her big solo moment, "Lovely Lonely Man" is filmed with Ms Howes whirling around the sun-drenched garden of an English manor, enraptured by her at-long-last discovery of true love. The gorgeous orchestration of the song and its staging never fails to affect me no matter how many times I see it, and it's one of my favorite moments in musical films. The kids are cute without being child-star precocious. Lionel Jeffries as the dotty Grandpa, Gert Frobe as the hateful Baron Bomburst, and Anna Quayle as the delightfully campy, vain Baroness are all first rate in their roles. Robert Helpmann as the Child-Catcher may genuinely frighten smaller children, sort of like a male version of the Witch of the West.All in all - there's not a thing wrong with this film. It's a happy, fun-filled, colorful movie that the whole family can enjoy - and we could use more of these. The fact that it is still highly viewed today (it's one of MGM/UA's best selling home videos), and was just turned into a wildly successful stage version in London attests to its staying power. Just enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching the movie tonight with my family, I told my nine year old daughter that this was my favourite movie when I was a little boy. And I still love it. When Professor Potts wheels out the newly restored and improved CCBB out of the garage, a little tear welled up in my eye.As others have mentioned here, Dick Van Dyke's lack of attempt at an accent is a bit puzzling. Especially when you consider that he tried an accent, with moderate success, four years earlier in Mary Poppins. However, this movie is a fantasy and silly little details like that do not diminish it. Dick Van Dyke is of course excellent. The rest of the cast are also very good.While the movie is long compared to today's children's movies which rarely seem to last longer than an hour and fifteen minutes; I thought it didn't drag. I thought that the inclusion of "The Intermission" on the tape was kind of funny. We used this time to stop the tape, bathe the kids and make some popcorn.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My fav movie as a kid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film I most enjoyed as a kid. I first got the books by Ian Fleming out of the school library. And while the film doesn't follow the books very closely (the script is a virtually new rewrite by famed author Roald Dahl); this fun, dynamic whimsical story by the makers of MARY POPPINS and the Bond films completely captivated me.I have heard of people still frightened by the Child-Catcher character (played by Australian ballet dancer Robert Helpmann); and considering the worst thing you see him do is lock children in cages, it's quite an impressive achievement. (Of course, it is implied that he kills children.) And when you see the scene where the Baron sings a corny love song to the Baroness while secretly trying to kill her, you realize that this works on more levels than just a cute kiddie's story.I still rank the Toots Sweet number as one of the best staging in cinema musicals, rivaling Busby Berkley. And the recreation of silent movie gags with the two spies and Lord Scrumptious adds to the delight. There's also the subtle pun of Grandpa going to his "laboratory/lavatory" (geddit?); and a host of other sly references.All in all, still a top class family entertainment story. By the way; I think there may be room for a remake that ties more closely to the original story about British-French gunrunners. Perhaps as a tele-movie?</fullReview>

What could be better than a song extravaganza centered around a good natured wacky inventor. This movie is for people who enjoy life, creativity and a catchy tune. I've found the second half a little slower than the first, but the Child Catcher kicks in to reveal one of the most haunting, scary, sinister characters ever devised without the use of blood, gore or profanity.Don't miss the connection between Grandpa Pott's trips to the outhouse and his worldwide travels...Enjoy it - safe for kids too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating Tale of an Inventor, His Kids, and a Magic Car.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[MAY BE SPOILERS!] Caracticus Potts is an inventor. He invents all kinds of interesting inventions. Unfortunately, none of them work. Then one afternoon, his kids tell him of a car in a junkyard that they really like. The junkman plans to buy it and put it in the clapper and the firey furnace. The Potts family has not a motor car. The kids, Jeremy and Jemimah were nearly run over by one, with a beautiful woman, Truly Scrumptious, behind the wheel. When she explains that perdicament to Caracticus, he is quite rude to her. That night, he discovers something about his sweet making machine. His long canes of candy had holes in them. You play them like flutes. Caracticus was sure they would make him rich, so they take them to a candy factory the next day. It was run by Lord Scrumptious, Truly's father. Everyone there liked the sweetsuntil it was overrun by dogs! Caracticus takes his hair-cutting machine to the county fair, but something went wrong when giving a chap a hair cut. To hide, he sung in a musical act, "Me Old Bamboo" and was a hit. He bought the car, which was a wreck. In several weeks, he'srigged up the car into a shiny masterpiece. Caracticus and the kids go on a picnic and run into Truly. (Almost literally!) So she joins them. They drive to the beach, where they goof around and Caracticus tells the kids a story about pirates that come from Vulgaria and are lead by the evil Baron Bomburst. He wants the car! He sends two bumbling spies to retrieve it. The spies instead take Grandpa Potts to be Caracticus and kidnap him. Caracticus and the gang also discover the car can fly!So they fly after the villains. To Vulgaria! Baron Bomburst commissions Grandpa to make a car float. The good guys arrive. Also, the Baroness detests children so they send the child catcher out. A toy maker (Benny Hill) offers his assistance when the children are kidnapped. Caracticus and Truly discover lot's of children living under the castle. Also, Baron's men have kidnapped the car. Caracticus has a plan. Tomorrow is Baron Bomburst's birthday and they'll give him one he'll never forget. Everything goes according to plan. They put the evil away, then rescue the children and Grandpa and fly back to England. This is a good movie. An alive car movie before "Love Bug".A good family movie. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just bought a copy of this wonderful film on DVD, after toying with the idea for a LONG time. The embarrassment factor alone was the main thing that caused me to wait so long - after all, what's a 35 year old man doing buying THIS kind of movie when he doesn't have any kids???Simple - it's a classic movie, for ALL ages, and pure nostalgia!Superb songs, especially the title track, and the unforgettable "The Old Bamboo", "The Roses of Success" and "Hushabye Mountain". Many, many times over the years I've been "caught" humming or even singing the title song, and it still comes back to haunt me when I least expect it! Actually, after one particularly nerve-grinding blind date experience a few years back, I was singing "Roses of Success" under my breath on the bus back home - without even realising it!!Great acting too, with Sally Ann Howes and Dick Van Dyke pairing off well together onscreen, and excellent support in the likes of Benny Hill, Gert Frobe and Lionel Jeffries and James Robertson Justice.Yep, good clean fun all round, and what guy in their right MIND wouldn't want to own a car like Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang now???It's an outstanding DVD - in Dolby 5.1 stereo (mono when it was released at the cinema!), and the only complaint I would have is that it wasn't released in widescreen format DVD, for those of us lucky enough to have big TV's!I can't praise this movie enough, or the fact that it's longevity continues unabated. It's a MUST see for us all, and for generations of kids to come (and their parents!).So go buy it - and don't feel ashamed to buy the soundtrack album after seeing the film - it's great for singing along to in the shower!!!"From the ashes of disaster grow the Roses of Success..."!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful if a little uneven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another movie which suffers when viewed on a small screen since many of the shots were set up for the cinema big screen. The films content attempts to entertain both adults and children alike ( made at a time when parents actually took their children to see movies ). This results in some of the films content being beyond children's understanding and sometimes too childish for adults. What the film demands is that you can let the child within you re-surface and for you to let the fantasy envelop you.If you cannot do this then the movie will not work for you. If you can then sit back and enjoy a fun ride with flying cars and baddie Barons, often beautiful cinematography and great dance routines. A little uneven perhaps ( particularly two thirds of the way through ). Often criticized for being too long but it was originally intended to be seen in two parts (an intermission came as the car sailed over the cliff ) which gave the audience a breather ( and time to get goodies like ice-cream). The music was lighter weight than other Sherman efforts but complemented the movie well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie as a kid, and I remember being utterly scared by the Child Catcher in Vulgaria. I think it was his nose (plus the fact that Marilyn Manson used a quote from the movie as an album title). I thought the Nazi themes were very interesting, and it gives you some insight on how it might have felt to be a "undesirable" child in Nazi Germany. I always identified with the kids and felt that if the Child Catcher got to the kids, he'd get me right along with them. The rest of the movie is good, and the visual effects are pretty good with large sets and great location shots. There's not much to complain about, except maybe wishing for a little more story and less dancing and singing in the pre-Vulgaria story. Also, the lullaby is a great song. I thought the car was awesome, and for a movie made almost 40 years ago, the noises the car makes remind me of some kind of electronic rap beats. There's a few cheap SFX shots of the car doing zany things, but as a whole the movie looks great. So if you want to watch a nice old-timey Disney movie with some funny moments and frights as well, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the worst movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read this book as a child in the 60s. While it was a story of fantasy, it did not talk down to the reader and was full of wit and subtlety. When the movie came out, I was very excited to see the wonderful tale of imagination come to the screen. What resulted was so insulting to my intelligence that it horrified me. Dick van Dyke's moronic mugging, the idiotic songs, the over the top portrayal of the title character, and general treacly smarm and cheese completely destroyed an amazing book. You think I'm being harsh? Read the book. Skip this movie. If it isn't the worst movie ever made, it is without a doubt the worst adaptation of a book ever perpetrated. It destroyed my faith in humanity and my opinion has not changed as this movie has not improved with age, whereas the book retains all its integrity and charm. Roald Dahl should have known better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only criticism is that at 2 and a quarter hours it is probably too long, I personally could have done without the spies, whose antics were rather silly rather than funny. Mind it is only two minutes longer than Mary Poppins, which I also love. Films like Mary Poppins, Wizard of Oz and this were my childhood favourites, and if you want some entertainment in a musical, look no further than this. It has a witty script, anything the Grandfather says is enough to crack anybody up and Gert Frobe as the Vulgarian king is hilarious. The songs are unforgettable, and beautifully staged, the car looks glorious and the performances are first-rate. Dick Van Dyke is brilliant here. Personally I think he was better than he was in Mary Poppins. Sally-Ann Howes is beautiful as Truly, and she has a beautiful voice(apparently she has perfect pitch) Unlike some people, I thought " Lovely Lonely Man" was lovely, and the imagery was as if you were in a fairytale. Lionel Jeffries is really entertaining as the Grandfather, I couldn't believe he was younger than Dick Van Dyke. The children can't sing, but they can act and are cute. Finally, Robert Helpmann's child catcher, competes with Tim Curry's Pennywise in It as the scariest character on film, and I genuinely mean that. This film is beautiful with fabulous costumes- Howes never looked lovely than in her stunning white dress in "Lovely Lonely Man" and sets(especially the castle and Truly's garden), a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elephantine, ersatz-Disney family film with musical interludes has kooky inventor Dick Van Dyke, his two moppet kids and new lady-love outwitting the rulers of an evil fantasy world with help from their airborne automobile. Director Ken Hughes, who also co-adapted Ian Fleming's novel with none other than Roald Dahl, can't manage to work up any life within this not-too-fantastic scenario; it's an adventure story involving a flying car which never lifts off. The sugary songs aside, this loosely-hinged and slowly-paced picture doesn't even look good. The special effects are bland and chintzy (even for 1968). As to the performances, Van Dyke has always been an acquired taste, but Sally Ann Howes is certainly no Julie Andrews (though Ken Hughes fashions her role accordingly). Songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman work with the very best of intentions here (and the title song is catchy, as is "Truly Scrumptious"), but the Shermans are still doing what they did back in the early-'60s: winking and nudging at us with nursery ditties, almost all of which suffer from a fatal case of the cutes. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Mr. Coggins is looking to sell it for scrap. They live with Grandpa Potts, their widowed wacky inventor father Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke) and their dog Edison. They meet wealthy Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes) driving her own car. She tries to tell Caractacus about his kids' truancy but he's unconcerned. They don't get along. One of his invention produces sweets with holes in them. He discovers that they toot and tries to sell them to Truly's confectionery manufacturer father Lord Scrumptious. He gets thrown out when the whistle brings dogs to overrun the factory. He eventually earns some money at the carnival and buys the car. The kids name it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the noise from the engine and the Bangs coming from the exhaust. They go to the beach for a picnic and Truly joins them. Caractacus tells them a story about the ruler of Vulgaria Baron Bomburst who wants to steal Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.This is from a children book written by Ian Fleming. Roald Dahl who wrote 'Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory' also helps to write the screenplay. This is an unabashed children's movie. There are some disturbing aspects of the movie like the Child Catcher which I like. It doesn't all work. I don't particularly like the broad comedy coming from the two spies. Sally Ann Howes may be a great stage actress but she doesn't have the great presence as someone like Julie Andrews. Her chemistry with Dick Van Dyke is limited. There are a couple of fun songs. This doesn't quite measure up to 'Mary Poppins' but it tries to be in the same class. Also some of the magic seems to disappear when the movie goes to the castle. It's like the castle is too real and overwhelms any effort to give it a sense of fantasy. But you gotta love the car.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . haunts the childhood of folks my mom's age, primarily because of its namesake flick's long-nosed "child catcher." The nobility of Vulgaria (the dream sequence country in which the final two-thirds of CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG is set) have inexplicably outlawed children. After screenwriter Roald Dahl pens an early Willie Wonka rehearsal with a candy factory sequence substituting dogs for Oompah Loopahs, he gets a lot more perverse in Vulgaria than merely expanding Blueberry Girls. From infantile pirate barons to S&amp;M duchesses to outhouse hijackings to rolling, iron-barred cages for "stray" kids to "skulls stuffed with sauerkraut," nowhere and no one is safe. The two young home-schooled kids find their parents turned into automatons twice, and their flying boat-car lacks seat belts and passenger air bags. The songs here are so weird you have to wonder what the Shermans were smoking as they wrote them. But CHITTY may have saved mom from diabetes, since she confused the ice cream man when he came to her neighborhood with the kid catcher from this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the all time greatest movies. Haven't viewed this in awhile till last night. I totally forgot how great this movie is. The musical score ranks up with the all time greats. I still find myself singing allot of these tunes this morning. Movie was shot very well. Classic views of England and Germany. None of that fake cgi you get would more modern movies. Surprised that this isn't at least in the top 250 IMDb movies. But I guess today people have a very short attention span and are into all that Transformer, slam - bam loud special affects type movies. For me, brings back childhood memories of other classics like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Wizard of Oz. Hard to believe this movie is over 40 years old. Still holds up very well...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A first half crazy and fun enough to make you forget the second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the intermission, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is the most refreshingly bizarre, unpredictable family movie I think I've ever seen. It refuses to settle on a plot: first it's a race car story, then it's a candy factory story, then it's a fantastical pirate adventure... the songs are infectious, Dick van Dyke is doing his shtick, and all the actors looks like they're really enjoying themselves. Everything is also deeply English, from the rolling pastoral backgrounds to the grandfather in a pith helmet who thinks he's in India having tea with the Maharaja. Unfortunately, after the cliff-hanging intermission there are a lot fewer surprises and the plot becomes a more conventional kid-power narrative of the type that infects so many contemporary G-rated features. The gleeful energy of the first part never fully returns, but high-quality special effects and earnest acting make this a fun though overlong watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently skipped through a past Leonard Maltin Film Review 'bible' and was almost disgusted to see the he (or one of his hacks) gave the movie in question 1 1/2 stars! It claims the Music delivers no memorable song, and that the Special Effects stink. I saw this movie back in 1971 in an Austrian Cinema. It was dubbed. The song went "...Hei! Ho! Shitty Shitty Bank bank..." (sic)but still... It was a memorable experience. Since, I have seen the film countless times now, with my two kids and we all adore it, and sing along to its MANY great songs. The 'special' effects are charming, and appeal to children, as their 'collage' quality arouses a suspension of disbelief... which is more POWERFUL.. and just what children want! Anyone who enjoyed Mary Poppins, will find many similarities between the two films, as, much of the cast and crew were shared, as well as more than a couple of Dance routines. The Songs were penned by the same songwriters, too... And James Bond fans will be interested to now that Albert 'cubby' Broccoli produced 'Chitty...' after 'Thunderball' (or was it 'You Only Live Twice'?) and utilized the submarine base set for baron Bomburst's hidden Dungeons where children are kept in dreadful conditions. But more due must go to Roald Dahl's quirky, somewhat perverse imagination when it comes to the 'darker side' of the movie , than to Ian Fleming, as another 'commenter' claims. The film is long, but has many highlights and very few pitfalls. So HOORRAY for courageous Producers,Directors, Art Directors, Actors and Scriptwriters. To Musicians and Directors of Photography... in short to ALL who have the VISION to leave us with real pearls which stand the test of time! Viva Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, this film is not perfect. There are obvious faults and flaws but despite that there is a lot of fun in watching it and seeing the wonderful Dick Van Dyke who was a big star in England as well as in America and is still very much an icon in Hollywood standards today. The film is based on Ian Fleming's story. The same man who created James Bond also had fun in writing this story about a widowed father played by Van Dyke who does a marvelous job on his own as the star of this film. He reminds you of Bert from Mary Poppins only he has center stage. It's also great to see the lovely Barbara Windsor too who said that she would have paid them to work with Dick. There is of course, the wonderful Lionel Jeffries in a supporting role, Benny Hill as the toymaker, and Sir Robert Helpmann in a supporting role. The film has it's moments with the flying car, the special effects, the costumes, and art direction. It's fun family oriented film that can be appreciated by most people especially Dick Van Dyke fans. You think when they pay tribute to him at the Kennedy Center Honors that they will dance to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! I can only hope that they don't forget his wonderful contributions to film, television, and theater.</fullReview>

Maybe for that reason alone I get misty about Chitty but I like to think that even without those memories I would consider it a great movie. My grand-daughter can sing (she's 4 ) all the songs from Chitty and I take great delight watching my friends groan when the music box song comes on in my truck :-) All I am saying is that any bad memories from my childhood certainly weren't caused from Chitty.I ramble...I leave the floor to my more eloquent breather.Sean</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was in it's first theatrical release, I was seven,the age it was aimed at. I didn't see it on the big screen, but on TV in the 1970'sI'd describe this as one of the last of the really big, old school musical movies. Lots of big musical numbers, large cast, big set. But that style of movie was losing steam, and a more spare and gritty style of movie was coming. However, give me "Chitty" over ANY Disney live action movie of the same period. I remember reading the book when I was young, so when CCBB popped up on TV, I looked forward to seeing it.(Remember those days long before VCR's DVD's, and cable TV, when you got to watch something once, and hope you didn't miss it, or have to wait forever, perhaps, to see it again) The book and the movie do have some differences.++Spoilers of a Minor Kind++I watched CCBB not long ago with my young daughters, and was surprised at how long this movie was. I'll bet when it was shown on TV, back in the old days, it either went over two nights or was heavily edited for time. A few of the songs could have been ditched, as I think they are filler. Dick Van Dyke, IS, however the best part of this movie. All his numbers are a delight to watch, and I'll not waste space saying what most earlier posters like about his part, as I agree!It's fun seeing two Bond characters turn up, in totally "un-Bond" roles. Would have been even better if somehow, more of the 007 regular characters would have had cameo roles, or bit parts. Maybe "M" or Miss Moneypenny popping in. Ah well.... It took us two nights to take in the whole movie, as "the yawn factor" came into play at about the halfway point of the movie, and two sleepy eyed young ladies asked me to "let us watch the rest tomorrow, daddy".A great movie for a slow, rainy, indoor day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extension of the James Bond magic for the child in us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of us grew up on the James Bond movies, based on Ian Fleming's books. The books were trashy compared to the movies. Yet Fleming married science fiction with satire--science that was limited to gadgetry and bizarre warmongery. "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" is an extension of the Bond magic for the child in us. Starting with producer of the Bond films, we even have 'Q' of the Bond movies the late Desmond Llewelyn. The only difference: 'Q' here (Coggins) is destructive not creative while the Bond equivalent (the Dick van Dyke character Caractacus Potts) is creative and not destructive like his cousin James. This film is really a toast to the imaginative mind of Fleming.Roald Dahl is the other genius who made what the film is today. Dahl is one of the finest children's storyteller and "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is a sterling example of his genius. Dahl embellished Fleming's novel and gave us the lovely sidelights (bringing up kids who play truant, a car that gasps at the thought of being melted into liquid) that makes the film lovable 35 years after it was made. The human toy dance sequence (choreographed by Marc Breaux) is absolutely delectable.While the film may not be the finest children's musical it is brilliant in parts such as the toy dance sequence, some imaginative casting (Lionel Jefferies and James Robertson Justice, who make you recall their roles in the delectable Miss Marple movies) and finally the endearing presence of Dick Van Dyke, who acts half his age on screen.Van Dyke thought this movie would out-Disney the Disney movies and if you sift through the scenes, you will indeed see the adult world of Bond and Fleming, cleverly packaged as a children's musical film. Director Ken Hughes may not be a major director but he does achieve partial success with his casting (the adorable kids, the Child catcher, and, of course, Van Dyke) and some lovely music (Hushabye Mountain).</fullReview>

It seems much less horrifying to me now when I see it through his eyes, and lets face it, it's a lot more wholesome than most TV aimed at kids nowadays.It's kind of sad to watch for me as it was made at a time when the world was a much less worrying place to live (and also it was made the year I was born so I feel so old now). We have a whole collection of these movies on DVD - Mary Poppins, Willy Wonka, Wizard of Oz etc. and I definitely think there is still room for them even now.Maybe as parents we should try to engage our kids with this type of TV input rather than Pokemon etc. and perhaps then they wouldn't end up smoking crack at age 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a child, and I can still remember how the audience in the movie theatre clapped in time to the title song at the end of the movie. It had all my favorite things in a movie -- comedy, romance, suspense and a bit of magic. Also the music. I've grown up on the music of the Sherman Brothers, and the songs in this movie are among my top favorites, along with the songs from Mary Poppins. My special favorite has always been Hushabye Mountain -- a wonderful lullabye. The performances were all terrific. Dick Van Dyke has always been a favorite performer. Sally Ann Howes has a beautiful singing voice. Lionel Jeffries was a true eccentric. Robert Helpmann, as the Child Catcher, was appropriately terrifying.It's interesting to note that this movie has gotten a new lease on life in the form of a stage musical currently playing to a full house every night in the West End of London. It features all but one of the original songs and several new, wonderful songs. With any luck the show will "fly" to Broadway next.Movie musical or stage musical -- this is something that should not be missed! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is definitely a children's movie. The first half is terrific and held my interest, the wonderful character played by Dick Van Dyke and particularly the crazy grandfather played by Lionel Jeffries really engage the interest and laughter. I found the fantasy second half (the movie within the movie) a little trying and some parts not suitable for children - the Baron always attempting to kill his Baroness for example. The special effects are also a little porous, the blue edging sparkling for attention in a lot of the shots. A scene where Sally Ann and Dick play dolls is riveting and really showcases the multiple talents of these actors. The child in my life has watched it a total of seven times now and rates it a 10 out of 10. I rate it 7 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that this surpasses Mary Poppins for imagination, story, songs, choreography and sheer enjoyability. It's chock full of colourful characters; Caractacus Potts, Grandpa Potts, Baron and Baroness Bomburst, the nightmarish Child Catcher (still high up on voting poles as the most terrifying baddie in films... ever!) and great locations.Dick Van Dyke shows just how good an all round entertainer he is; the Old Bamboo dance sequence is extraordinary as is his dancing in the castle as the clown; one of my fave rave bits; when Truly moves her hand away just as he is about to kiss it is quite touching.Mention has been made as to why Van Dyke didn't attempt an English accent. This seems to come from those on the west shores of the Atlantic. Let me tell you, in England, we're glad of it; it's widely accepted that his Cockney accent in Mary Poppins was utterly awful ("Shtep in Toime!"... ugh!). It doesn't matter he's got an American accent with English kids, just let it go, enjoy the film.Every tune is memorable; CCBB, Hushabye Mountain, Old Bamboo, Toot Sweets (great staging), Lonely Man, 'Turning around on a music box', Chu-chi face (dark humour there!), Roses of Success... it's just faultless.I loved when I saw it at the pics when I was 10 and my own kids love it now.

		<fullReview>Isn't it strange how movies critics hate are always loved by audiences ? I guess all of us who send in reviews to IMDB are actually critics but most reviews seen here from people who have seen it mention how they love this film - perhaps if for sentimental reasons. Maybe this is why Hollywood finds itself in troublesome times. Who is it that actually 'decides' what we want to see ? Ian Flemings imaginative story of a magical car is just that - magical. Perhaps the magic has left the minds of those who create volumes of B grade violent and uninspired offerings these days. Of course not all people will like this film but there are many who do. Maybe it is a bit long - but many films were during this era before such emphasis was placed on the 90 minute audience rotation factor. The longer format allows much more freedom to the director. How many films made today will still be remembered or commented on 30-40 years after their release ? This film was shot for a darkened theatre and a big screen for maximum viewing pleasure so it suffers from a small screen view. This film is as fresh today as at it's first screening.

		<shortDescription>Classic film for children of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I encountered the soundtrack recording before I ever saw the film, and it's a testament to the quality of the Sherman brothers' score that all of the songs have stayed with me for almost thirty years, and I can whistle, hum, or even sing them at the drop of a hat: the wonderfully comic 'P.O.S.H. Posh', the haunting 'Hushabye Mountain', the energetic 'Me Old Bamboo', and of course the infectiously cheery title song. When I caught up with the film it was as good as, if not better than, I'd anticipated, and it remains a favourite to this day. Great songs, wonderful locations, several performers at the top of their game (Dick Van Dyke showing what a great talent he was, Sally Ann Howes as a luminous heroine, the wonderful Lionel Jeffries, Gert Frobe several light years away from Auric Goldfinger, Benny Hill before he got smutty and tiresome, and ballet great Robert Helpmann as the truly chilling Child Catcher). I know many critics dismiss the film as a sub-MARY POPPINS effort, but the score and script are, in my view, every bit as good, and if anything it has fewer dull spots. My four-year-old recently watched POPPINS for the first time, and had a hard time staying interested; today we watched CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, and he was enthralled. He's already humming the title song . . . By the way, Sally Ann Howes may never have had the film career she deserved, but anyone who's interested in seeing her in her younger days should check out two supernatural films made by Ealing Studios during the War: THE HALFWAY HOUSE (1944) and its more famous ghostly counterpart, the classic 1945 film DEAD OF NIGHT. Howes, then only a teenager, has prominent roles in both, and shows off her singing voice in the latter film. She's also the heroine, Kate Nickleby, in Ealing's film version of Dickens's NICHOLAS NICKLEBY (1947).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great crowd pleaser that continues to entertain children young and old for thirty years. I get a kick out of professional critics who just don't get it. The irony is that this film pokes fun at just those types of nay-sayers. The first half of the film is pure magic, though when the story drifts into the fantasy-within-the story it tends to lose that magic. This lack of story consistency compares more to Willy Wonka than Mary Poppins. Of course, Mary Poppins was an almost perfect movie and the cream of the crop of 60's children movies. Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, and Lionel Jefferies are at the top of their game here. (Note: When Julie Andrews turned down the role of Truly Scrumptous--perhaps because the part was secondary to the male lead--Julie's Broadway replacement in My Fair Lady, Sally Ann Howes, took the role. Julie had left Broadway's My Fair Lady for Mary Poppins when the film version was offered to Audrey Hepburn.) Too bad that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang didn't do for Howes what Mary Poppins did for Andrews. Her role just wasn't meaty enough, though her talents and beauty really shine, especially in the classic music box scene. I would have loved to see more of her in other films. Dick Van Dyke's role in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was much larger and more developed than in Mary Poppins so it is much more of a personal triumph for his talents. For pure entertainment, there is enough color, music, comedy, adventure, and magic to fill an afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long. Dense. Cloying. Dated. Uneven. Underrated. Wonderful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie suffers from a number of things, not the least of which is comparison to the "practically perfect Mary Poppins", which this movie hearkens back to--particularly with the songs "Hushabye Mountain" and "The Old Bamboo", not to mention the whole turn-of-the-century England millieu.And, boy, is it dense. Two-and-a-half-hours (more or less, depending on the cut, I believe) of singing and dancing and musical overtures, without a lot of dead-time between numbers.At the same time, it's somewhat unfocussed with regard to its audience. The humor will be too broad for some older children, while some of the songs will bore younger children. (Sally Anne Howe gives a beautiful performance of "Lovely, Lonely Man" but the song itself seems somewhat out of place.)And then there's the camerawork. Exacerbated by pan-and-scan format (and MGM has apparently opted not to release the widescreen version, even on DVD), the movie features pans and cuts that were stylish in the '60s but look a little silly now.The story itself sprawls, with the middle portion of the movie being taken up by a story-within-the-story which is somewhat confusing when we exit it wondering how much of what we just saw is supposed to carry over into the outer story.But ultimately, these flaws seem minor. The movie is charming, well-done and so good-natured, it's hard not to like. The Sherman Brothers were at their peak, not to mention Dick Van Dyke. He and Ms. Howe seem to have a genuine chemistry. When the movie shines, it really shines, enough to make you forget the tarnish on the other parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful scenery, fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good fun. Looks like it was filmed in Devon or Dorset, England, and of course at the famous Neuschweitzen(sp?) Castle in Germany - gorgeous scenery. Some songs are better than others. Thumbs up to "Hushabye Mountain" (which sounds similar to Mary Poppins' "Feed the Birds"), "Toot Sweets" &amp; "Truly Scrumptious". Dick van Dyke's "The Old Bamboo" sounds too close to Mary Poppins' "Step in Time". Of course both movies had their songs written &amp; composed by the Sherman Brothers. Quite interesting to see the usually nasty Bond villain Gert Frobe play a very dimwitted villain here, or the dirty-minded Benny Hill play the nerdy Toymaker. Sally Ann Howes looks &amp; sounds lovely, yet she did very few movies. The 2 kids, while cute &amp; pretty good actors, have a tendency to screech &amp; sound like mice when they yell for help. I plan to buy the video &amp; bring back memories of catching it on TV when I was a kid, perhaps buy the soundtrack too, now on cd for the first time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the Knight Industries Two Thousand there was Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I remember watching it back in the Philippines when I was a kid. We used to hang out with my cousins on lazy Saturday afternoons, put on the T.V. and there it was. We'd sing along with the songs, laugh at the Baron and Baroness as he tried to kill her with no success, tremble at the sight of the child-collector, and cheer the children on as they over-ran the Baron's castle.Of course now that I'm a lot older and have watched it again I noticed a lot of funny things in it that I didn't notice back then. Like the Toymaker was played by the late Benny Hill, or that since it was written by Ian Fleming, the name of the girl that Dick Van Dyke's character fell in love with was 'Truly Scrumptious'.Definitely, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang will always be one of the fonder memories I'll have of my childhood.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbelievable MUSICAL without the MUSICAL Cliché</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of musicals EVER! There are a couple exceptions and this MOVIE is my #1 on that short list.My hero in this movie is Dick Van Dyke... The guy sings and dances "AT THE SAME TIME" without clever editing that is carefully diced and scrutinized used today to hide sub-par performances by 'Less Talented'.So if you like "REAL TALENT" across acting, music, and dancing... you must give this thing one viewing. I also love the fact that this movie has a intermission... LOVED IT...This movie was a staple for my children growing up and being that i didn't see this movie until the age of 26 or 27 it reshaped my thoughts around this genre. I'm 39 now and have seen it at least 4 to 6 times with my kids.It has everything in it... comedy, action, "The Child Catcher" ...The other performers were also amazing in the show and no slight to them, but i can watch Dick Van Dyke take on the "Old Bamboo" and still be amazed by the singing, dancing and amazing performances.Dick Van Dyke is just one of those guys I can't imagine really getting old... i mean sure he will age... but i could never imagine him mentally slowing down... or losing his charisma regardless of age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thinking James Bond? Not here! Ian Fleming seems to have a flair for family as well. In "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", this movie opened up for extraordinary cars on the line. Here you have an eccentric inventor who seems to have trouble making it. Years before, there was once a racing car that wins a lot until one wreck curtailed its career. Two kids find this car and decide to give it a second chance. With their father's help, their wishes came true. Not only did the car was given new life, It did things others cars didn't do. Like fly, or become the first hovercraft in it's time. Unfortunately they come across a king who lived in Vulgaria. That country banned children. The evil king not only wanted the car, he wanted the inventor himself. However, the get the wrong person; his father! With the help of a toymaker(Benny Hill), the day is saved. Vulgaria with not put up with the king's tyranny anymore. Music is magic in this movie. Dick Van Dyke performance in this movie is excellent, even prior to "The Dick Van Dyke Show" He's smooth as silk. Great for the family, and safe, it's perfect. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will always have a fondness for this film as it was the first movie I was ever taken to see as a child. The film is quite clever and has some fantastic performances. Even at my advanced age of 38, Robert Helpman as the Child Catcher still scares the you know what out of me. This film was certainly well cast.As per usual with every Sherman Brothers' score though there are typically a couple of great songs and then a few that are forgetable. It is a shame that "Hushabye Mountain" isn't included in the DVD Sing-a-long as it is probably the best song in the whole movie, even above the title track. While I didn't enjoy this film as much as "Mary Poppins" or "Willy Wonka", I have to say that it is worth seeing and keeping in the children's movie library</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw This Movie in Half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 1909 British Grand Prix, a formerly winning automobile crashes and is sent to the junkyard. The car is purchased by clumsy inventor Dick Van Dyke (as Caractacus Potts). A widower with a windmill and two chirpy, chirpy pre-teen children, Mr. Van Dyke meets pretty Sally Ann Howes (as Truly Scrumptious) when she gives the kids a lift home. She's not only pretty, but also rich and motherly. Van Dyke lives with his motherless children, a shaggy dog and lovably eccentric Lionel Jeffries (as Grandpa). If you're thinking, "This group must somehow form a family," you'd be correct. The main attraction is the automobile, which Van Dyke restores. Named "Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang" due to the sound it makes, the car turns magical...The audience for this awkward, long musical will begin to drop off for viewers over the age of ten. Incredibly, this is from producer Albert R. Broccoli and the team responsible for turning Ian Fleming's spy novels into the visually dazzling "James Bond" film series. Checking on the original novel's plot shows significant differences. Most obviously, Ms. Howes seems to be a stand-in for Julie Andrews; still one of the world's biggest box office stars, Ms. Andrews would not have accepted this clearly less substantial role. Some of the character roles work, especially Robert Helpmann as the "child catcher," and the title song is serviceable. The car is magical, but has no real personality of its own. If the car had more magic powers, it would cut this movie in half.**** Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (12/16/68) Ken Hughes ~ Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, Lionel Jeffries, Robert Helpmann</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time that I've seen this children's classic since I was a child, and I suppose that I'd hoped that it would live up to its reputation. In all fairness though, I din't like it that much when I was a child, if I'm honest and my children, though some DO like it, others seemed to have mixed feelings. At best, it's likable but never lovable and at worst, it just isn't liked at all.So, as an adult I watched this loose adaptation of James Bond's, Ian Flemming's novel, with every good intention, but in the end was left disappointed. Firstly, at 2 hours and 20 minutes long, it feels like an epic, and a completely unnecessary one at that. Its intermission is turned into a Batfink or Adam West's Batman styled cliffhanger rather than a thematic or narrative break that it traditionally should have been, even going so far as to recap the action in the second act!The songs weren't great either, generally bordering on tedium rather than holding my interest. The story seems to be a little off kilter too, with a seemingly fatal crash destroying the eponymous car before its eventual restoration by Dick van Dyke. This was the culmination of a five-minute title sequence showcasing the early Grand Prix's of 1907 and '08 which for a family film seemed to drag somewhat.But after an hour of songs and character development, we finally take off in the flying car to the fantasy land of Vulgaria, only for the whole experience to be a fantastical story told by Van Dyke's, Caractacus Potts! All in all, this was a strange film, but not in an entertaining way like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, the connection being Roald Dahl's involvement with the screenplay, but in a rather boring way, with events just seeing to happen without any really cause or need. One hour of story, then another one of fantasy. How many other films can boast this kind narrative twist and get away with it. It just seemed to be indulgent and plodding.It would defiantly have been improved if the car was actually magical and did actually take them on this adventure rather than suggesting that it is perfectly okay to sing and dance around the real world but it's a stretch too far to have a flying car! It should have been a fantasy through and through rather than six of one and half a dozen of the other.Ultimately, Overrated in my opinion and since the view of FOUR children, boys and girls ranging from 7 ? 15, is that it's watchable rather than fully enjoyable, I suspect that this film is being viewed through rose tinted glasses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is probably the best Julie Andrews film that did not star Julie Andrews. Though with Dick Van Dyke in the male lead and the songs by the team of Sherman and Sherman, you've got to wonder whether the folks at United Artists did in fact consider Ms. Andrews originally.If they did, she turned it down because she wasn't the lead. The focus here is on Van Dyke an eccentric inventor in Edwardian Great Britain raising two small children with their grandfather, Lionel Jeffries who's a bit of an eccentric himself.I have to confess I do wonder what happened to mother. It's a family film so we assume Van Dyke's a widower. It's also never spelled out whether Jeffries is the paternal or maternal grandfather.Anyway when lovely Sally Ann Howes nearly runs over the children in her spanking new automobile, she feels bad and offers them a lift home and that's how the lady known as Truly Scrumptious comes into their lives.The kids have a mission, an old car that they play inside is about to be sold to the junkman for scrap and they want dad to buy it save it for them. The first part of the film is Van Dyke's quest for the money to buy the car. The second is their adventure in that magical car which Van Dyke transforms into an aerodynamical flivver. Of course some very nasty villains headed by Gert Frobe want the car.Gert Frobe is apparently the meeting point where Mary Poppins meets James Bond. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang originally was children's book written by James Bond author Ian Fleming for his son. Of course Frobe's best known role is in the title role in Goldfinger. It's also where Chitty Chitty Bang Bang goes into satire. Fleming was in British Intelligence during World War II and after the war some of Hitler's schemes which were already in practice about children being taken from parents and raised by the state became known. Frobe's kingdom is where the monarch decreed that children are forbidden and towards that end the sinister Child Catcher, played with aplomb by Robert Helpmann is used. Of course Van Dyke's foreign children are a prime target when they all arrive chasing a dirigible in which kidnappers have taken Lionel Jeffries thinking he's the inventor.Though Chitty Chitty Bang Bang gets silly at times it still remains a fine family film. And who could possibly resist a character named Truly Scrumptious which Sally Ann Howes is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The subtext is fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I?ll add my voice to the praise! I first saw this movie as a 6-year old at a big movie theatre in Chicago. It was absolutely thrilling. We bought the record and the piano song book, and I used to dance around the house pretending I was Truly Scrumptious. What a great movie, and it totally holds up to time.Our 3 ? year old is obsessed with the movie now, and my husband and I end up seeing it several times a week. The holocaust and Nazi Germany imagery is pretty hard to miss. I read a review of the recent CCBB show on London?s West End, and it said that at the time the screenplay was written (1966? 1967?), the holocaust themes were still completely undigested by the general public. It?s true. But, with the benefit of 35 years history, the allegory is pretty clear.Where?s the evidence of this? All over the movie. As Dick Van Dyke and crew enter the town in Vulgaria, everyone stares at them. They?re ostracized. ?What are they are staring at? he asks. There are no children in the town. They run for cover, and the toymaker wants to hide the children in the cellar. When the childcatcher arrives with his Hitleresque shiny black hair, he says that children are ?like cockroaches and hide in the cracks?. The soldiers break down the doors and windows with the butts of their guns, searching for children. And when Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes, and Benny Hill row the boat to the place where the children are, they all look grim, starved and their spirits are broken. They look like survivors. Benny Hill says ?five years they?ve been hiding down here?. Hmmm. . . interesting: that?s the length of WWII.An interesting sidebar we noticed in the opening scenes of the movie: Coggins tells Jeremy and Jeremia that he?s going to take the car and burn it in a fiery furnace. ?But that would be murder!? yell the kids.And of course, there are all the red and black banners hanging from the buildings in Vulgaria. They don?t have swastikas exactly, but they have black crosses and very similar images. The German accents for everyone in Vulgaria top it all off.I find it so fascinating. And wonderful, really. And to stretch the analogy to its breaking point, I would suggest that when Baron Bomburst (whom we?d have to compare to Hindenburg, not Hitler) is deposed, it?s no coincidence that he loses his crown. The Baroness says ?it?s OK my little dumpling!? He?s lost his crown, his government . . . it?s a revolution.Other really fun details include Dick Van Dyke?s character?s name: Caracatus Potts. Crackpot, right?! And when Grandpa?s hut arrives in Vulgaria, the airline walkway that they wheel in, says ?Vulg-Air?. Great! And check out the Baronness right before she drops down through the trap door in the Chu-Chi Face scene. She?s ditched her black high heels for flats (to cushion her fall, presumably.)It?s a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and on more than level. Two thumbs up from our house!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An imaginative musical brought down by a seriously mediocre second half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, an imaginative musical based on Ian Fleming's novel, stars Dick Van Dyke as a widowed inventor known as Caractacus Potts who tries to give him and his two children a better living through inventions, including a reworked motorcar called Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, mirroring the car's unusual noises. After Potts meets the beautiful Truly Scrumptious (Howes), a tyrannical foreign ruler named Baron Bomburst (Fröbe), who despises children, concocts a plan to steal the car for himself. The first half of this film is a genuinely excellent stretch of charm and music. It isn't difficult to sympathize for Potts, an inventor who gives it his all to put his family in better financial standing, although he sacrifices his attention for his children's whereabouts, as they are truant for school quite often. Potts's children are ecstatic over a wrecked motorcar at the junkyard and encourage him to buy it; so during several humorous attempts at collecting some extra dough, including an amazing musical scene at the Scrumptious candy factory featuring "Toot Sweets" as well as a hilarious incident at the fair featuring "Me 'Ol Bamboo", the film has the makings of a pure classic. As the car is bought and remade to a stunning piece of work, its theme song is introduced, marking the most catchy tune of the film. But, alas, as soon the evil Baron Bomburst takes the screen, the film's overall tone begins to erode into unfunny and forgettable territory. Ken Hughes's lighthearted execution on Chitty Chitty is clear throughout, but it's when that same mind hits the scenes in Vulgaria when the rest of the film, no matter how frightening with the inclusion of the Child Catcher, becomes more for little kids than a family film. Even the grown-ups won't find much to savor in this stretch of slapstick sequences, dimwitted characters, and mediocre songs which include "Lovely Lonely Man", "The Roses of Success", and "Chu-Chi Face". However badly the second half comes up to be, it is saved by some remarkable performances and state-of-the-art visual design. Ann Howes is dramatically terrific but shows off her comedic side in her amazing music box scene. Fröbe only comes off as mildly humorous since he's stuck in over-the-top and repetitive direction. Helpmann keeps the ridiculous land of Vulgaria terrifying as the Child Catcher, calling the children he catches "rats", with that fact being visualized remarkably further into the film. Ken Hughes could've worked wonders with a sincerely imaginative premise, but he gets a little too full of himself in the second half, creating a toddlers' playfest rather than a completely fun-for-all musical. Either way, Chitty's long moments of honest creativity manage to somewhat shadow this problem. It's a solid family film with a musical soul and heart, and that's all that matters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny fairytale for kids of all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an older "kid," I can still enjoy the fun of "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." This is one of those early movies made for children with a little bit of adult humor. By that, I don't mean R-rated or toilet humor. I mean stuff written above the heads of most kids' understanding. There weren't as many such films back then, but there were some. It's a precursor to the modern-day group of films ? mostly animated, that seem to be written as much for adults as for the young crowd. I enjoy some of these films myself ("Ice Age," "Madagascar," "Shrek"). The modern film adult humor is usually in dialog that accompanies visuals. In "Chitty Chitty" and other early movies for kids, the adult reach most often is in the dialog that can stand by itself. The kids are watching a funny scene while we older viewers are chuckling at what we just heard while watching the same scene. It's still humorous to me that this movie was based on a book by Ian Fleming. But, when I think about some of the gimmicks that the M15 spy group comes up with for James Bond, I can see a connection. Dick Van Dyke's character in this film, Caractacus Potts, is an inventor and tinker who has some strange and funny inventions. This movie resembles a fairytale in two ways ? the fantasy portion itself, and that part as a story within a story. The cast are all very good. This is mostly Van Dyke's show, though, with his inventions and dance scenes. The candy factory song and dance routine is an excellent job of choreography. I watched a bonus video with my DVD in which Van Dyke says he pulled a muscle doing the whirling kitchen cart number. Sally Ann Howes adds a nice voice to song and is a good romantic match for Van Dyke. Gert Frobe is especially good as Baron Bomburst. The movie did receive an Oscar nomination for the title song. But unlike other films they composed and wrote lyrics for, the Sherman Brothers (Richard and Robert) didn't score any hits or memorable songs in this movie. Still, it's a fun movie to watch with youngsters, who will enjoy it most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The guilty pleasure of all guilty pleasures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so much to attack but so much to love (begrugingly) in this movie version of Ian Fleming's novel. Yes, indeed, the author of the Bond series wrote a musical about a magical car that floats, flies and bang bang bangs. It's also a lifesaver for the eccentric inventor Cattaragus Potts (Dick Van Dyke), his two precocious children (Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley), and a beautiful socialite (Sally Anne Howes) who is at the crossroads of her life and determined to get past the pretensions of being the daughter of a wealthy sweets manufacturer, Lord Scrumptious (a wonderfully imperious James Robertson Justice) who has nothing but her money to claim as her own. The widowed Potts and the lovely Truly don't hit it off at first (like many couples paired together in a movie musical), but her instant love for his children draws them closer, as does an adventure where they head off to a weird land of child-hating rulers and underground canyons where everybody under the age of 18 lives in fear.The Sherman Brothers achieve another hit in their musical catalog with the musical score, an obvious follow-up to "Mary Poppins", yet not released by Walt Disney. Van Dyke is the obvious choice for Potts, and with Julie Andrews unable to take on the role of the heroine, British musical diva Sally Anne Howes had her one American film role as Truly. "Lovely, Lonely Man" shows her as a gorgeous soprano, and it is sad for American audiences that she didn't get the chance to be seen in more films. Only some lucky audiences on Broadway got the chance to see her, mainly as a replacement in "My Fair Lady" for Andrews on Broadway.Hall and Ripley are delightful as the children, looking more real than the kids from "Mary Poppins" and delightfully coy in their attitudes towards life. Lionel Jeffries gives a glorious performance as their flustered grandfather, an eccentric world traveler who pretends to go around the world in his little shack which really appears to be an out-house. There's gloriously campy performances from Gert Frobe and Anna Quayle as the Baron and Baroness Bomburst who perform "Choochy Face" with the attitudes of teenagers in a seemingly perfect lovefest, but its obvious that the Baron can't stand her, leading to some hilarious innuendos of him obviously trying to snuff her out. "Choochy Face" is followed up by the hysterical visual of the dried-up court of prunes who surround them socially, giving this a cartoon feel in its live action presentation.Then, there's Robert Helpmann as the sinister looking Child Catcher, one of the most horrifying villains ever on screen, and one who probably gave a lot of children nightmares. He actually looks like he could be a distant relative of the Wicked Witch of the West, an escapee from Oz who was obviously banished by the little people who lived in that land. Even "Willy Wonka" with its darkness didn't have a character like this. Musically and choreographically, "Chitty" is phenomenal with several lavish production numbers, some extremely touching moments, and a fantasy element that is almost as magical as "The Wizard of Oz". A Broadway version proved to be even more elephantine than the movie, overly cute and missing the adult touches that made the movie as appealing to grown-ups as it was to children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wrecked car is renovated by Van Dyke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Political satire by someone who did not rate the sixties? Plus a fuller description of the sixties? * When this first came out I assumed it to be a high status musical that was only suitable for the very young. Now that I that have finally seen it I assume that the child catcher might have scared me at an early age. The first viewing anyhow. I much prefer Sound Of Music, even more Yellow Submarine if the Blue Meanies were fought in a nurturing way. Could be that YS and CCBB are two faces of the same thing. I am getting to appreciate SOM much more, healthier for dogs. I rated Dick Van Dyke a lot, way back then, but now assume that he was given this role for all the wrong reasons. Youth politics. Car purchase via toute de suite just attracted dogs, a haircut was no go, it was the old bamboo that paid for the car. Bulgaria is liberated too, right at the end. Piracy, sweeties for dogs, children in chains. In some ways this is classic Ian Fleming, but the novel itself was written before the sixties proper started. A story with many of its features having a lot of polish, truly scrumptious. A musical with the music mostly truly un-scrumptious for me at my first viewing. The next viewing some of it improved, for me, but at first I was not sure that this should be considered as a musical. The two adult leads also felt flat, to me, and still do, as if they are trying to act down to children and that is not how I remember Van Dyke. * The sixties was all sorts of things, depending on who you were. If my current interpretation has a reality then I would have preferred this feature to have been a bit more open about this aspect, way back then. It could have made an interesting contribution to those times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute movie but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was young I absolutely LOVED Ian Fleming's original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang book! It was so full of suspense and action. I know I must have watched the movie as a child and I remember having a soundtrack of the movie as well (in the form of a record) but the movie must have bored me (unlike Wizard of Oz which was a favorite of mine back then). Now watching it with my kids I am sorely distressed that they steal the name of my beloved book and put it on this movie. I much prefer the loving Potts family of the book and the exciting adventures they go through..and the successful whistling sweets (rather than the movie's version of them turning into doggy candy).However I'll give it 7 stars only because my kids like it and its a fairly good film. The songs are cute although I agree with others that the "Lovely Lonely Man" song is awfully long and kind of stupid actually for this movie. Also the first few times my kids watched it, the child catcher and the two "bad guys" near the beginning of the story kind of freaked them out and we had to stop it several times and try again when they got a bit older.I love Dick Van Dyke and he has a few good scenes in this movie but I much prefer him with Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins. I think Mary Poppins is a much more timeless production, but Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is great compared with a lot of the stuff they come up with today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no MARY POPPINS, but it's still a childhood favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG was a splashy and lushly mounted musical, based on a children's book by Ian Fleming (!)which the producers were hoping would strike the same gold as MARY POPPINS but wasn't nearly as good. Dick Van Dyke, four years after MARY POPPINS, stars as Caractacus Potts, an eccentric inventor with two small children, who buys and restores an old car and through story he tells his children, becomes a magical car that can float on water and fly in the air. Just as he was in MARY POPPINS, Van Dyke is the only American actor among an all-English cast (though he wisely doesn't attempt an accent this time) in this fluffy children's musical that children can still get pleasure from; however, for most of us who grew up on it, has not aged too well. The lackluster songs are by Richard M.and Robert B. Sherman who also wrote the songs for MARY POPPINS and the dances are choreographed by POPPINS choreographers Marc Breaux and DeeDee Wood. Sally Ann Howes is a lovely leading lady with a Bond-girl-type character name, Truly Scrumptious. James Robertson Justice plays her father, a candy manufacturer, Benny Hill is a toymaker, Gerte Frobe(GOLDFINGER) plays an evil baron who loves to play with toys and Anna Quayle plays his children-hating baroness. There's also a delightful turn by Lionel Jeffries as Van Dyke's equally eccentric grandfather. A little too sappy for grown-ups now, but it might still keep unruly children still for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic (if it were 45 minutes shorter)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original story was written by Ian Fleming, the same guy who created James Bond, so it was only right when it came time to make the movie, Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli (who produced all of the Bond movies up to License To Kill) would be handed the production. Lots of Cubby's James Bond associates helped on this movie, including Richard Maibaum (additional writing), Ken Adam (production design), Peter Lamont (art director), Vic Armstrong (stunts) and many others. This was not a Disney production, in fact Dick Van Dyke was quoted as saying, "this film will out-Disney Disney". For this he was banished from future Disney productions. Even Desmond Llewelyn (James Bond's "Q" for many years) has a role. This movie still holds up well... It was filmed in 70mm Super Panavision, with a 2.20:1 aspect ratio, and the Technicolor is fabulous. The plot does drag along at times and it does have too many musical numbers. Although the music was written by the Sherman brothers (who wrote music and lyrics to Mary Poppins), many times the music doesn't move the story along, thus it comes to a grinding halt. At 2 hours and 24 minutes, it's tough to get the kiddies to stay interested (I say kill about 45 minutes of the unnecessary music), but this movie is still magical. If it was judged on it's own merits, rather than being constantly compared to Mary Poppins, it would fare much better. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is the story of a single father, his kids, a lady and a magical car. Based on the beautiful photography and production value, I give this a score of 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Reason to Love Chitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loving movies inevitably positions yourself (in this particular case, myself) in a vicious circle. One of my greatest regrets was seeing classics like Alien when I was so very young and understood so very little of it. I won't say it ruined my second, third and fourth viewings, but I'd have given anything for a Lacuna Inc. treatment at that time.All my thoughts on Chitty blossomed while watching it again. I thoroughly enjoyed the silliness of the script, the quirky characters and the occasionally terrible failures in putting some decent images together. It was as though I was reliving this wonderful time of my childhood - my early childhood, if I may say so - because I saw and "resaw" Chitty loads of times when I was about six or seven. As every amazing story, mine has its own twist: at some point in my private history, someone recorded I don't know what ^*&amp;#%@! wedding exactly over the middle of the movie. Ever since, I felt this strange urge of reminding myself what I was missing.I'm sure this film doesn't appeal to everyone. It's a bit childish of me to react as delighted after viewing it again as it's way too personal to be objective. But maybe a film that makes one feel these things has a value of its own. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is definitely overlong and I can't imagine anyone making me sit through it now, had I not seen it before. But with generally sweet songs and a delightfully innocent story it is, ultimately, a nice sit.The Chitty tune is the one I never truly forgot. I've been mumbling it for years...does that even make any sense?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a teenage boy who thought this film sucked when i was a little kid. for some reason, i didn't really get it. but of course, this kind of stuff never caught my interest.the story is this. a car that gets trashed in a race goes to this inventor who builds something weird out of it. then one day, he and his kids, and a beautiful rich girl, go down to the beach. the dad starts telling the story of chitty chitty bang bang, the magical car. and the story just goes on from there.now, in my experience of old movies, i can't accurately tell who the movie was aimed at. i mean, my dad likes fixing cars up, and i like running in sand. and also, who could forget Benny hill's role as the toymaker. the guys who created the film did the right thing hiring him. the only thing that makes this movie like eating soap flakes is the intermission halfway through. although i think the people who made the DVD fixed that. i'm gonna have to go watch chitty chitty bang bang on DVD at my cousins house. i'll come to update this when i know for sure.also, who could forget Dick van Dyke? he's the master of dancing + Fantasy. and , he was lucky as well. if he can end up with a rich girl, man, i wish i was him.overall, this deserves a 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a model of the car ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... but never saw the film as a child. Our little car did have flip-out wings though so I kind of guessed part of this car's 'super' features. Not that super when it is up against James Bond's gadgets and KITT in Knight Rider, but impressive enough for kids.Anyway, I recently saw the film for the first time. I've seen the stage show but the film is very different - the songs though survive, including the title tune, Truly Scrumptious, Hushaby Mountain, and the others. Dick van Dyke as the inventor has some great dance routines, while Sally Ann Howes as Truly isn't that different than Julie Andrews would have been, had she played the role - their voices are very similar. Lionel Jeffries is good value as grandad and has a bouncy musical number with some old and hairy inventors in Bulgaria. Gert Frobe is there too as the Baron, while creepy Robert Helpmann has a brief but memorable role as the Childcatcher. James Robertson Justice and Benny Hill are also in there.There aren't many musicals I haven't liked, and this one is no exception. I think it probably still will appeal to kids (I saw 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' as a child and it reminded me of that somehow) and, although it loses pace once the story gets more and more improbable, it is mostly very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes bumpy, but always magical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy movies are always a tricky sell to audiences- especially modern-day cynics, and that will probably never cease. But there are green-lights to be mentioned in CCBB. I never read the book (which I imagine literary purists will hang me for), but what I found in the film was very satisfying. I never thought it was too long. (Perhaps I thought that once, but I was probably eight at the time.) On the other hand I was captivated with its story-within-a-story narrative. It's really two plots- the first, more 'serious' one showing how the family retrieves and restores the car lasts a little over the first hour of the movie. But after presenting the burlesque delight 'Old Bamboo,' the Berkeleyesque extravaganza 'Toot Sweets,' and the breathtaking lullaby 'Hushabye Mountain,' the film blurs reality with fantasy- a'la "The Wizard of Oz-" and dives into a completely spontaneous fairytale, with Nazi party overtones, and peaking with the title song and Act 1 finale of Sally Ann Howes' "Lovely, Lonely Man." I think it's a scream that so many people post to collectively hate this number for no apparent reason- when it further showcases the brilliant plot staging halfway through the film. (Is this part of the movie or the story being told at the picnic?) Other musical pluses are "Music Box," "The Roses of Success," and "P-O-S-H."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of my favorites!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it may not be equal to Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang will always hold a special place in my heart and will probably always be my favorite live-action children's film.For one thing, it was one of the first two films I saw in the theater. (The first was The Love Bug.). Perhaps, too, there is something a tad more appealing to boys about Chitty than Mary Poppins. The toys that accompanied the production of the movie (definitely NOT a 1990s phenomenon) also helped. I well remember snapping together the 2- or 3-piece Chitty in a box of Honeycomb at my neighbor's house. I also had a Hot Wheels version, with retractable wings.More than these things, though, it was simply a magical movie and remains a very good family film. I watched it in its entirety for the first time in many years tonight and was still charmed by it. Dick Van Dyke may well be the greatest physical comic of the sound era and he is truly in his element in Chitty. He also has a fine cast with him, including Sally Ann Howes as the hilariously-named Truly Scrumptious, and Lionel Jeffries as his eccentric father. Child actors Heather Ripley and Adrian Hall also turn in stellar work.SPOILERSAlthough the movie lacks the dark, gritty side of the Ian Flemming children's book that makes it just as enjoyable a read for adults, the story is put onto celluloid well enough. Flemming based his Chitty on the racing car of English Count Zborowski, built in 1920 and wrecked in 1922 after a brief but spectacular racing career.Like its inspiration, Chitty is seen in the opening sequences, roaring to victory after victory, before a tragic accident leaves her a burned-out wreck. The scene then switches to a later time (Unlike the book, clearly set in the early 1960s, with a 40-year-old wreck, we never really get an idea of the time period we are in, or how long the wreck had collected dust.), with Jeremy and Jerimiah Potts (Hall and Ripley) playing in the old car. They beg their father, crackpot inventor Caracatus Potts (Van Dyke), to buy the old wreck before a junk dealer can melt it for scrap.Meanwhile, Potts tries to sell his latest invention, `Toot Sweets' to stuffy English candy baron Lord Scrumptious (James Robertson Justice). He almost succeeds, with the help of Lord Scrumptious' daughter Truly (Howes), only to cause the candy factory to be overrun by dogs.Later, a pleasant afternoon at the beach leads to a story by Potts, regaling the children with a tale of an evil ruler, Baron Bomburst (played by great German character actor Burt Frobe) intent on stealing their car, which they discover can not only float, but also fly.Two incompetent Bulgarian spies kidnap Potts' father in his outhouse and the would-be family flies to his rescue. Once in Bulgaria, they discover that children have long ago been outlawed by the mean Baroness Bomburst (Anne Quayle) and that an evil Child Catcher (Robert Helpmann) stalks the streets in search of any stragglers or new arrivals.Of course the Potts rescue Grandpa, as well as Jeremy and Jeremiah, who are captured by the long-snouted Child Catcher. They also free the hundreds of Bulgarian children, being hidden in caves by the kindhearted toymaker (Benny Hill) and other adults.Although some of the musical numbers could be a bit shorter, the movie has aged well and still has strong appeal. The aerial scenes of Chitty flying are breathtaking and most of the songs are catchy. Van Dyke and Howes have interesting chemistry together and both interact well with the children. The scene with Howes portraying a wind-up doll and Van Dyke as a puppet on strings is a classic.This is a classic 1960s children's film. Of course I'm a classic 1960s child, so what can you expect! Seriously, though, this is a fine film and is certainly in the same ballpark as Van Dyke's more-praised Mary Poppins. Don't hesitate to rent or buy it. And when they're a couple of years older, be sure and read the book to the kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many flaws, but good stuff, too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, there's the bad stuff. Of course, it can't even begin to touch "Mary Poppins" as a musical, as a film, or as whatever else. And there are all sorts of other litle problems, from the logic of Dick Van Dyke having English kids and an English FATHER but talking in an American accent to the clumsy transistion into the fantasy sequence (Much better handled in "Poppins" and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks") to the overlength to the many irrelevant songs ("Me Ol' Bamboo," "Chu-Chi Face," and the just plain stupid "Posh!").But still, the film is likeable and enjoyable escapism. Van Dyke has a few more attempts to display his talents at slapstick and physical comedy than he did in "Poppins," and he also proves a fine singer and a decent actor. He recieves great support from the lovely (In looks and voice) Sally Ann Howes, and such British-film veterans as Benny Hill, Gert Frobe, Anna Quayle and Robert Helpmann. The story is delightfully quirky. (Of course; it was based on books by the guy who came up with James Bond, and Roald Dahl collaborated on the screenplay!) As with all the Sherman brothers' post-"Poppins" scores, the songs are not particularly memorable but still pleasent, and there is the irresistably catchy title tune and a couple other charming numbers ("Truly Scrumptious," the lovely 'Hushabye Mountain," and "Lovely Lonely Man," and I actually enjoyed "Me Ol' Bamboo," or "Step In Time II"). And even though the "story-within-the-story" bogs the film down and is clumsily handled, if you want to search for something deep, you can find a parallel between the Vulgarian anti-children prejudices and the Holocuast. Think about it-this madman (The Baron--Hitler) hates a group of people simply because of their "race" and will stop at nothing to exterminate them. He sends out a henchman (The Child-Catcher--Nazis) to capture them and imprison them in an isolated area where they are malnourished and badly treated (The palace dungeon--concentration camps). A few kind souls (The Toymaker, and his real-life counterparts) hide some of these people in "secret annexes" (Remember Anne Frank?) at the risk of their lives if they are caught. This goes on for many years until a group of people (Potts and company--the Allies) "liberate" the children/Jews and overthrow the madman. Interesting parallel, isn't it? But that's probably getting just a little too analytical for such a lighthearted, delightful children's fantasy film. The kids will probably love it and won't (and shouldn't) have to make those kinds of comparisons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this years ago, as an adult, though I remember seeing commercials for it as a child. I know this is based upon a book written by Ian Fleming for his young son, and does not much follow it, just as Disney's "Pinocchio" didn't much follow Collodi's original. I rented it out of curiosity; how good was this movie? This movie has gotten mixed reviews here, which is no surprise to me. On the one hand, the car looks delightful and the scenery, if not the special effects, are good. The villains who kidnap the car and its owners are scary, especially when our heroes are in Vulgaria and note that there are no children around, and we are relieved when they get their comeuppance. The part where the Baron's henchmen fall into the sea and have to swim to their country-only to have to swim away when they reach it, is hilarious. On the other hand, Dick Van Dyke is supposed to be English and he sounds American, none of the songs are memorable, and the movie is overlong.Overall, it's probably not the first thing you want to take your children to see. I haven't seen the book, but it's probably more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is on my A list of best family flicks. After reading some of the user comments, I naturally felt prompted to reply to some of them.This is a fantasy and NOT a comedy. There are many things to laugh or smile at including all the mildly slapstick moments. All the while, the dialog is delivered more or less straight. While on the subject of dialog, I turned on subtitles to find out what the Prime Minister was saying. His lines are bit goofy but mildly funny.If you don't like musicals, perhaps you shouldn't watch this movie. Let your kids watch it! My family loves musicals and we lament the fact that there are not many produced any more. Please note that the music for this movie was scored by Sherman and Sherman, who also scored Mary Poppins.If you think 144 minutes is too long for a movie, please note that there's an intermission in the middle. You also have the pause or stop button at your command. The movie only drags for me when Sally Ann Howes sings "Lonely Man". It's a wonderful song, but it doesn't seem to belong in the movie. If you take notice of where they put this scene, it especially seems not to belong. On the bright side, it does highlight Ms. Howes' wonderful voice.It's a wonderful movie. Grab the movie and enough popcorn for the duration and see it with your loved ones. Parents of young children may want to watch the child catcher scene prior to letting their kids watch it. Although Robert Helpmann's treatment of the child catcher is mild compared to the Wicked Witch of the West from the Wizard of Oz, some users commented that as children, he frightened them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang strings to-gether every gimmick, routine, plot line and cliche that's been used for the last fifty years. It's a thinly disguised clone of the hugely successful Mary Poppins, obviously designed to milk the same market with the same (or very similar) routines yet again. But despite its unoriginality, it works and works well. Cute kids with lovable British accents. A beautiful heroine. A blissfully incompetent hero. A laughable villain. A fairy tale kingdom in the thrall of a despotic bufoon. A setting in the supposedly more gracious era of pre 1914 Europe. (Forget the industrial slums, the gin mills, the gaols and the gallows.) A lot of fun and fantasy. You could start out wanting to hate this movie for all these reasons but you would end by enjoying it despite yourself. Theres a bit of Charlie Chaplain and Laurel and Hardy, a lot of Mary Poppins and Walt Disney. And it is in the classic format pioneered by Disney; a story that entrances the kids while entertaining their parents, done in a such a way that it can be trotted out for a new generation every few years. And of course, they all live happily ever after. A hard movie not to like despite its weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The car is not the star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" in 1968 when I was 3-years-old, so I didn't really have any memory of it, except for the car flying around. Seeing it on TV in 2003, 35 years later, this film is entertaining, but it hasn't aged well. The main problem is that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is hardly in the film at all, maybe for 15 minutes total. The rest of the movie is this lame plot involving Caractacus Potts (Dick Van Dyke) trying to win the heart of Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes). Chitty doesn't appear until well into the movie, and the long, drawn-out sub-plot involving the Baron (with a great appearance by Benny Hill as the Toymaker) is mostly boring and predictable. Still, it's just a fantasy story, so there's no need to be hard on it, and it is fun at times, but nothing to recommend. 6 out of 10.So why 6 out of 10 after knocking this not-that-good movie? Well, the theme song did stay in my head for years, and most kids I knew growing up in the 1970's at least knew the words to the chorus, though they would change "Chitty Chitty" to, well, you know.So we all knew this part:Oh! You! Pretty Chitty Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you! And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, loves us too! High! low! anywhere we go On Chitty Chitty we dependBang bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Our fine four-fendered friend Bang bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Our fine four-fendered friend!So seeing it on TV years later, I hoped that the car would be the star, that it would do lots of things, but no, it's mostly a star vehicle for Dick Van Dyke, but hey, it's just a fantasy movie. Maybe if I was a kid I'd like it? Naw, too many lame musical numbers, and not enough Chitty. Sorry Chitty...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Magical as Mary Poppins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can see the similarities between this movie written by Ian Fleming and his James Bond series: a hero with a special car overthrows a powerful despot who has become too powerful. Dick Van Dyke shines as the whimsical inventor who becomes a children's James Bond. The children are cute and adorable if not precocious and saccharine-covered at times and Sally Anne Howes is beautiful and captivatingly prim as the Lady Scrumptious ( what a name !). In fact all the actors put the most into their characters especially Robert Helpmann as the Child-Catcher. Anna Von Quayle is also particularly alluring as the vain queen who attempts to stop aging by removing all the children from the story book kingdom. Benny Hill is out of his true element in this family movie, but he still pulls off a wonderful role as the toymaker and finally sticks it to all those critics who blasted his talents on his show. To me, this movie is a great combination of two great comedians, Van Dyke and Hill, and deserves to be counted among the best children's movies along with "The Wizard of Oz," "Mary Poppins," and "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Increasingly sickly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To audiences young and old who grew up watching it, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang surely holds a warm, nostalgic place in their hearts. At the age of 29, this was my first viewing. I somehow knew all of the songs, knew everything that happens in the plot, and was certainly familiar with the notoriously creepy Child Catcher (Robert Helpmann). For me, watching the film was like eating a huge slice of cake. The first few bites are delicious and barely touch the sides, mid-way through you start to waver but you just can't seem to stop, but by the end your stomach is turning and you wish you'd never eaten the damn thing.The brain-child of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, the movie was only loosely adapted from his novel by children's author Roald Dahl and director Ken Hughes. Chocked full of sweets and machinery, most of the film will have children eating out of it's sugar-coated palm. When skipping school one day, two mop-headed children come across Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), a pretty but strict lady who takes the children straight to their father to report their truancy. The father, eccentric inventor Caractacus Potts (Dick van Dyke), supports their free-spiritedness, much to the horror of Truly.While observing Potts' warehouse of barmy inventions, Truly comes across a sweet that can play like a flute. They takes it to Truly's father, Lord Scrumptious (James Robertson Justice), a successful confectionery manufacturer, who eventually throws Potts out when the place is overrun by dogs responding to the flute sweet. Eventually he saves up enough money to buy an old banger loved by his children and manages to fix it up, dubbing it 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' due to the clunking noise it makes. While off on a picnic one day, Potts and Truly start to fall for each other, and Potts tells his children the story of an evil pirate baron (Gert Frobe) who wants to steal the car for himself.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is carried along by some gorgeous Technicolor cinematography by Christopher Challis and an energetic performance from van Dyke, who puts in a highly physical one-man show and remains effortlessly likable throughout. At two and a half hours, the film far outstays it's welcome. The majority of the songs are wonderful, but the film is slowed by mushy scenes, drab love songs and unnecessary sub-plots. It struggles with settling on a tone and ends up becomes a bloated mash-up. The first half of the movie I enjoyed as much as I did with the great's of the genre, until Grandpa Potts (the magnificent Lionel Jeffries) is whisked off to Vulgaria and it all becomes increasingly sickly.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great children's film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agree with a lot of the comments above. It is,indeed, an ionic children's film from the sixties, building on Mary Poppins, and almost as good. The storyline tails off a little bit but the scenery, songs and enthusiasm of everyone involved make it wonderful entertainment for little ones for two hours - not to mention adults too! Some of the songs are very memorable - like the title song, me ole bamboo (great dance scene at the funfair) and, of course, (Sally Anne Howe as) Truly Scrumptious, filmed on a summer's day near St. Tropez. I saw this when it first came out and have seen it several times since. My children used to love it. Anything with cars fascinates boys and the romantic link appeals to the girls. I know it's been panned by critics but it's good, clean fun. A really enjoyable family film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's little to dislike about CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, a fun and colourful musical written by Ian Fleming, no less; it's packed with memorable music, has colourful cinematography, an imaginative script and a decent cast. Of the principal actors, it's fair to say that Dick Van Dyke puts memories of MARY POPPINS and dodgy accents behind him in his enthusiastic turn as madcap inventor Caractacus Potts.It's rare to find a film which boasts decent performances from the child actors, but they're good here, as are the likes of Benny Hill and Lionel Jeffries in support. The songs are a lot of fun, particularly the titular one, of course.My only complaint, which isn't too much of one, really, is that it grows more and more fantastic as it goes on, and the last third is more like a silly fantasy sequence; there's Roald Dahl to blame for that, I think. At least the writers saw this and put in an explanation of it being all a dream sequence so that it kind of makes sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment,But Not a Total One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really looked forward to seeing this film when it was released,being a big fan of Dick Van Dyke's.After I saw it,I was let down,although I never understood why.One reason might have been I was getting too old for films like this,being 10 going on 11 at the time.However,it still had its moments.My favorite sequence was where Van Dyke sang "Me Old Bamboo",which sounded like an old English vaudeville tune.If Sally Ann Howes' actual voice was used,she had a very good singing voice.The windup doll sequence she &amp; Van Dyke did was another highlight.Other than that,the film to me was silly &amp; overdone in many ways.Many others must have felt that way,it got tepid reviews &amp; did not do well at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this thinking it was a Disney film. And indeed, to a point it seems like one. I am sure that more people besides me confounded this with Disney stuff and I can see why would it be confounded with Disney material. The first half of the movie and even about 1/4 of the second half follows the Disney formula, being generally fun and charming in an old-fashioned Disney-like way. Besides, the songs are by the famous Sherman Brothers, the movie stars Dick Van Dyke , Sally Ann Howes even looks like Julie Andrews and the idea of the flying vintage car comes from a previous Disney film named 'The Absent-Minded Professor' (which I never saw).But there comes a time when the Disney similarities end and it becomes dull and of bad taste. Doesn't combine with the light-hearted nature of the rest of the thing. All those barons and clown-like villains and such in Vulgaria. The Child Catcher... argh, what a grotesque and horrible man! Poor of those children who are his prisoners! Vulgaria is nothing less than Bavaria (in Germany) and its magnificent Neuschwanstein Castle. Which means absolutely gorgeous cinematography, also filmed in spectacular angles of sight. What a shame the rest of the story doesn't combine with the wonderful beauty of this scenario! I think the movie is only good until the sequence of the picnic on the beach with the Potts family and Truly. Well, not until that part, but until shortly after that, even though there are a few things of bad taste earlier in the film.The reason of the movie's title is because that's how the magical vintage car is named. And the reason why the car is named so is because of the sounds its engine makes: that's what "she" really sounds like: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! I love the song 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', it's very cute and charming.I mentioned before that Sally Ann Howes looks like Julie Andrews. Actually, Julie Andrews was the actress originally chosen to play the part of Truly but she turned down the part.Here, Dick Van Dyke doesn't seem to have the cockney accent he has in 'Mary Poppins', however he's got an awesome name on this one: Caractacus Potts! :) It's one of those names that make me grin instantly, it sounds so amusing and hilarious! :D Dick Van Dyke is great. The two kids are pretty good and they're cute. The little boy even looks like Sean Marshall (Pete from "Pete's Dragon"). Truly... LOL! What kind of name is Truly? I hope no one named their daughters Truly after this, LOL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Helpman steals the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess I did not think much of this movie when I first saw it years ago. I recently saw it again and have changed my mind. Maybe I was too cynical back then, maybe we all were. The songs apart from the title number are not that memorable, in fact a couple are pretty awful but they are delivered with great gusto by the cast that you quite enjoy it. I think the effects are absolutely satisfactory, more remarkable when you remember that this was all pre computer days. I loved the car. The cast is great and Sally Ann Howes is a revelation, what a perfectly delicious performance. Van Dyke as always is delightful. The kids are a bit annoying but you get over that once the brilliant Robert Helpman as the child catcher comes on. Helpman steals the film. Its a graceful astonishingly scary performance. Its a great way to scare off annoying brats. I loved revisiting Chitty chitty bang bang. Nice to see the great Benny Hill and Gert Frobe and Lionel Williams again. A magical delight and if you have not seen it in years you will enjoy it. It was given a very hard time by critics but the public adored it. Its a fun film and like the original Doctor Doolittle with Rex Harrison is a film that deserves more respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40 years without an oil change, but "chitty" still runs like a kitty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahh....the days of family musicals where no one dropped their pants, cursed their heads off or was chopped in half, carved to pieces,mutilated or sexually molested.I saw this at a drive-in on Route 46 in New Jesrey in 1969, and have considered it a childhood favorite ever since. I also owned the soundtrack album and remember my cousin had a stuffed Dick Van Dyke "Mr.Potts" pull-string talking plush toy as well.This film can be alternately described as JAMES BOND MEETS MARY POPPINS, as it takes it's strengths from both of those Hollywood franchises, creating something unique and in many ways better (certainly than Disney live-action fodder of the era, a' la THE GNOMEMOBILE, another Mary Poppins wannabee).Dick van Dyke should have gotten an award for his performance in this film--hands down. He is at the peak of his considerable talents here. The musical number ME OL' BAMBOO is one of the most spectacularly choreographed and executed routines I've ever seen in any musical. Most people outside the immediate CHITTY CHITTY fan base , have never even heard of it! If there are any shortcomings, (outside of the surprisingly poor blue-screen special effects) it might be the casting of Sally Ann Howes, for me.I was just never razy about the Truly Scruptious persona she delivers. But she is certainly a credible actress and does have moments where she shines.The Grandfather (Lionel Jefferies) is a hoot! and all his scenes are amusing and fun,particularly the musical number POSH, probably the second or third best scene from the score. The songs are MOSTLY good, but I wouldn't consider them TRULY scrumptious.This film IS excellent entertainment for children and still holds up well decades later for "kids" like myself who have since (assumingly) "grown up". Unless you're a cynical smart-ass who would rather look at something like SAW II or FACES OF DEATH III,perhaps even you can find something to enjoy here.By the way,you MUST see this film in WIDESCREEN, or else you are getting just the CHITTY CHITTY and missing all the BANG BANG!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly superb movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the local drive-in when I was about 9. Since then it has been one of my all-time favourite movies. We bought a copy for our son 5 years ago, and he still watches it. In particular, I offer the following observations: 1. Great story, with a terrific balance of fantasy, colour, fun, humour, and the good guys winning! Also great balance of drama - who can forget the scene where Chitty charges over the cliff, and then we have intermission! We had to wait 20 minutes to see Chitty spread her wings! 2. Lots of colour, light, and sunshine. It's a very happy, optimistic movie, with a positive view of children and human nature in general. Far too many children's' movies these days are very dark, or try to give us philosophy lessons. There's none of that in CCBB - just a focus on a good story with a happy outcome. And some great footage of the delightful English countryside.3. Great casting! From Dick van Dyke as the inventor, Lionel Jeffries as the eccentric dad; to the Baron and his wife; great cameo roles from Sir Robert Helpmann as the child-catcher; Benny Hill as the Toymaker, and the two blundering dolts who were the Baron's spies. Oh, and Sally-Anne Howe was superb as Truly Scrumptious (far superior to anything Julie Andrews could have done) 4. Great positive, energetic and uplifting music! Often the music can make or break a movie. In CCBB, the music fits the moods of each scene perfectly, whether its comedy, fantasy, romance, or driving Chitty! A few entries mention Mary Poppins. One entry describes CCBB as a "thinly disguised clone of the hugely successful Mary Poppins." I cannot agree with this. CCBB is very different, and, in my opinion, far superior to Mary Poppins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's 007 for Kids. No, It's a Post-WW2 Oz. No, Wait, It's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all get older, and maybe media saturation has sapped peoples' tolerance for anything but fast-paced bang-pow entertainment. But I just saw CCBB again on the big screen, after an interval of 35 years, and I was shocked at how glacially it plodded along... how vague and flimsy the plot is... and how little it is about a magical car, really. It's mostly about massive production design -- and indulging its stars and producers instead of the audience.It's a big machine of a movie, put on by the James Bond production team with Dick Van Dyke in the 007 slot. Ian Fleming wrote the original book. Cubby Broccoli produced the movie. Ken Adam, the definitive Bond production designer of the '60s and '70s, designed CCBB. Roald Dahl, who was working on the screenplay of "You Only Live Twice" around the same time, wrote the script. Gert "Goldfinger" Frobe mugs around in it. Desmond Llewelyn (Q) has a bit part. A supercar that rescues the heroes figures prominently. And so on.But CCBB is a weird, uncomfortable mix. It's only about one-quarter Bond film -- the Scrumptious Sweets factory set, or the Vulgarian castle interior, are kiddie versions of the Fort Knox interior in "Goldfinger" or the sub-swallowing tanker in the later "The Spy Who Loved Me." It's also one-quarter "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines" (1965), another sprawling English special-effects comedy set in a halcyon English country dreamscape dotted with honking antique cars. TMMITFS preceded CCBB by three years, and CCBB rips it off shamelessly, dipping Lionel Jeffries into the English Channel instead of Gert Frobe, and again employing Benny Hill and other English music-hall/vaudeville stalwarts.It's one-quarter "The Wizard of Oz," with musical numbers, the same riot of color and the abrupt relocation of the narrative to a bizarre fantasy.And it's one-quarter "The Diary of Anne Frank," with Vulgaria standing in for Germany in a scary, unsubtle Nazi/concentration camp allegory. In this movie the Bondian elements of gadgetry, fantasy women and a solitary superman are deployed not against the Soviet bloc or SPECTRE, but Germanic fascism. (WWII had ended only 22 years previously and was obviously yet fresh in the minds of English moviemakers.) Robert Helpmann's Child Catcher is a more-or-less Mengele. But Van Dyke's Potts organizes a liberating army of Vulgarian children to storm the castle (exactly the way Sean Connery's 007 leads US astronauts to storm Blofeld's volcano in "You Only Live Twice") and the last sequence in Vulgaria, with mobs of dirty, underfed kids flooding out the front gates, suggests the liberation of Dachau.But stitching all these genres together, then also giving each featured player at least one big song, makes for a long, confused, jumbled movie. Children get restless during the interminable tunes -- Sally Ann Howes' ballad to "That Lovely, Lonely Man" stops the film in its tracks, almost irrecoverably, and "Hushabye Mountain" gets reprised at a tense dramatic moment in the bowels of the Vulgarian castle, again wrecking the pacing. (Unlike in "Oz," the songs don't advance the CCBB plot. They either comment on it from outside or are shoehorned in, disrupting the narrative.) Yet the slapstick spies X and Bacon are lowbrow, kids-only fare, and the Potts moppets will aggravate anyone over 13.Chitty Chitty Bang Bang herself doesn't show up until 50 minutes into the movie. (Today, by this point, most children's movies are climaxing.) By the time the central confrontation looms you're nearly at the two-hour mark. And the car's role is oddly sublimated. It's out of sight for most of the film. Its sole tricks are flying and becoming a hovercraft. (Bond's Aston Martin did more tricks than that in less screen time.) And the script doesn't make clear whether Potts designed them or is surprised by them -- they could be technological or supernatural. The car may or may not have a soul. In Fleming's book, which is better and more coherent, it definitely does. The car's license plate is GEN 11, or "genie," in both the book and the movie, but the movie never makes anything of it.By the way, while the Ken Adams sets are fabulous, the rear projection effects are terrible, save for one night flying shot where darkness obscures their cheapness.With its bloated pastiche of themes and agendas the movie runs a numbing two and a half hours (it had an intermission in its theatrical release) and even I can see how to cut it down to 110 minutes. Yet for all that it is missing reams of plot. There's no explaining why an American is raising English kids alone with an English dad in the English countryside (Van Dyke wears a prominent wedding band). There's no resolution between Potts and the Toymaker who helps him assault the castle (Benny Hill's best film work) -- Potts and company just drive off. And there's not nearly enough car.I love Dick Van Dyke -- he's probably the most underrated, adept physical comedian of the last 50 years, and his dancing is wonderful, especially the "Me Old Bamboo" number and his marionette turn before the Vulgarian royal court. But you can love his stuff and still itch for CCBB to move along. I wish the movie were shorter, I wish it were more attuned to its youth audience than the swashbuckling fantasies of its middle-aged makers, and I wish there were more Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Add me to the list of people who saw this as a kid, loved it, rented it for my own kid to watch, and was disappointed. It hasn't aged well.There are great performances in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but the musical numbers are so dreadful that you have to feel for Van Dyke and Howes. How did she ever get through "Lonely Man"? And the bamboo song--what in the world was that supposed to be? "Posh" would be good if it wasn't so shamelessly contrived to sound like "A Little Bit of Luck" from "My Fair Lady". Jefferies does a fine job, but the material--ugh. It's a wonder they didn't put him in a top hat and shabby tails to complete the rip-off.Howes in particular deserves credit for a great effort on her numbers; it must have been quite a challenge to learn and perform material so lacking in focus and so utterly unmoving. I dare anyone to do a good job with "Lonely Man"--it's an awful song.The one unqualified success is Robert Helpmann as the Child Catcher. My son--a jaded product of modern media excess--was as scared as I'd been all those years ago. We had to show him IMDb's photo of Helpmann in street dress to get him to sleep that night.But, sadly, as another has commented: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang provides a great view of Hollywood hopelessly lost from generational confusion.Sorry to slam the happy memories, but this mostly stinks. Great acting but really, really, horrible music.</fullReview>

It's quite possible that he was sober during the shooting of this movie.At just under two and a half hours, this movie is too long by at least an hour. How long do you think a child wants to watch this unfortunate effort?The first half is mostly tolerable, but the second half reeks of desperation and padding. Scenes that could have been 30 seconds long are five or six minutes. The best thing in the movie is Sally Ann Howes, who manages to project an innocent sincerity that Van Dyke is not capable of.Plus I hate the songs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plenty of love from other people for this massive and entertaining 1968 musical fantasy, and most of it deservedly so. CCBB seems to build on the MARY POPPINS affection of 1964 and certainly is almost a sort of sequel. What I do love about CCBB is the spectacular qualities in the sets costumes art direction and glorious photography. The opening credit sequences with the numerous car races in various years and locations are a triumph of spending and film making without restraint. These 5 car races which establish CCBB's speed car history are massive and expensive vignettes simply to show back story and allow for the credits to appear. They are as big and elaborate as all of THE GREAT RACE. Once the film gets underway there are several terrific dance numbers, the most perfectly and abstract in design is the lolly factory and the Toot Sweet number. Great Caligari windows and stairs etc. However, after that the film becomes an afternoon nap fantasy to get the flying and chasing and Bavarian scenes underway. The film remains in some sort of storybook until the end. I found all this really odd when it really could simply have been a fantastic narrative anyway. It is as if there is no story so they invent a story about 30 minutes in. Whilst it is all gorgeous and funny and spectacular (esp. the castle interiors and Gert Frobe is hilarious) for me the film is at odds with itself. Yes it is for kids and families to enjoy together and yes I love that too; I guess what irritates me is that the bulk of the film's story is just made up by one character during the running time. For 3 - 12 year olds who love MARY POPPINS this is an excellent follow up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, this was one of my favorite movies when I was little (even though it wasn't as popular in the '90s when I was born), and it still is. So right now, I'm sitting here watching the movie I loved as a child and probably always will while I write this. I was very gullible as a child. For the longest time I even thought that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang really could fly, just as I thought that Kansas was colored black and white and as I thought Dorothy really did go to Oz (from "The Wizard of Oz"). Honestly, I think I enjoyed this movie just a tad bit more when I actually thought the car could fly, because it made the movie that much more special. But it's still the same good 'ol movie I love. Although "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" is a happy-go-lucky movie with singing and fatherly love in it, the Child Catcher scared the crap out of me and probably still would (I guess I'll just have to watch the rest of the movie)! Because of this movie I didn't need "stranger Danger" lessons; I learned not to talk to strangers from watching the evil Child Catcher in action. So you could say this movie taught me a lot. And it did. So that being said, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you too!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when it was released in 1968; I was seven at the time. My mum had read the original Ian Fleming book to me and it is a great story: a racing car, adventure, magic, gangsters, explosions, an underground arms cache; everything a young lad could want. The film was made in a village near my house, I saw them film bits of it.So why did the film makers ruin it so completely? The two children, their father and the car are the only things that the book and the film have in common; the story lines are completely different.Where does one start about the film? A woefully weak story, silly slapstick comedy, Dick van Dyke, the list goes on. I guess if they hadn't called it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang it would be simply a very bad film but pretending that is has anything to do with the fine book is criminal.Try reading the book to your kids; mine loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't very popular at the cinema, I would of thought it would be. The makers of Mary Poppins and James Bond teamed together to create this musical based on Ian Fleming's great story about a fantastic invention. Knowing how fun and funny he was in Mary Poppins (apart from the accent), I really wanted to see what Dick Van Dyke would be like. He plays Caractacus Potts, an inventor, who recently created the great Toot Sweets for Truly Scrumptious (Sally Ann Howes), daughter of a candy factory owner. Anyway, the best invention that he created was the fantastic "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" car, or "Chitty" for short. It can go really fast, float on water, and of course fly. Also starring Lionel Jeffries as Grandpa Potts, Gert Fröbe (Goldfinger) as Baron Bomburst, Benny Hill as Toymaker, James Robertson Justice as Lord Scrumptious, Robert Helpmann as the scary Child Catcher, Heather Ripley as Jemima, Adrian Hall as Jeremy, Barbara Windsor as Blonde and Desmond Llewelyn (Bond's Q) as Mr. Coggins. It may have been slightly long, and cheesy moments, but it is still a fun film for all the family. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song, "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" (could have won either), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments for The Child Catcher, it was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Good!</fullReview>

It seems there are about three thousand songs in this never-ending musical and just about every one of them is god awful. It may have been enjoyable for pre-teen kids if not for the boring musical numbers. Van Dyke tries hard to be funny and lovable but the script is devoid of any humor. Howes does an impersonation of Julie Andrews. Benny Hill makes an appearance but is given little to do. The direction is incompetent and the special effects are cheesy.

		<shortDescription>Fun but hard to sit through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly is scrumptious and Dick is dorky but lovable. So why do I rate this only 5 out of 10? The general annoyance factor is very high for this movie. The songs aren't bad, especially the "posh, posh traveling life," and there are several little jokes, like "X, as in X and bacon." But the songs, although memorable, aren't songs I necessarily want to remember, and the kids running around blowing whistle candies while stampeding dogs ruin a factory is just annoying. The king who outlaws children and continually tries to kill his wife is also annoying. I wish Benny Hill would just bop him on the head and be done with it. If you can stand misbehaving children romping around for two hours, then it's a real cute film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly awful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julie Andrews, realising the movie would be terrible, rightly turned it down and so Sally Ann Howes was cast instead. Howes looked very nice and younger than her 37 years, but unfortunately she couldn't act at all. In fact, her "acting" made Dick Van Dyke look like Laurence Olivier. Van Dyke wisely only accepted the lead role of an eccentric inventor on the basis that he would not have to attempt an English accent, following all the criticism of his God-awful "Cockney" accent in Mary Poppins. Van Dyke is likable enough here but he couldn't sing - unsurprisingly since he was an alcoholic at the time and smoked 60 cigarettes a day. James Robertson Justice, the poor man's Peter Ustinov, wisely doesn't take it seriously. The whole movie goes on for far too long and most of the songs are completely forgettable. The song by the two annoying children should have been cut, since neither of them could sing. The "Lovely Lonely Man" number should have been cut as well because it completely slows down the film. Perhaps worst of all though, the flying sequences are very poor (especially by today's standards) so the audience never gets transported at all. Lionel Jeffries comes off best as the grandfather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As I Remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fondly remembered musical from the 1960s . The producers are the same people who brought us the Bond films from the 1960s ( Many of the production team also worked on the Bond movies - And lets not forget who wrote the source novel ) and with the critical acclaim and fincial acclaim of MARY POPPINS still being felt what could be better than casting Dick Van Dyke as an Englishman ? So we`ve got a connection with James Bond and a connection with MARY POPPINS so what can go wrong ?Unfortunately no one took the passage of time into account but why should they ? After all no producer is able to do anything about that , but this is where the film falls down when watching it in 2004 - It`s not nearly as good as I remembered . Yeah the theme tune is good as is the " Me Old Bamboo " song and dance sequence but few of the other songs made any impression with me , and come to think of it most of them seem superflous especially when the story proper moves to the foreign country where children are banned . Amazingly the story doesn`t change location until well past halfway through the running time . Like a James Bond movie from the Roger Moore era CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG seems obssesed by incident rather than narrative drive and is too long by at least half an hour .It might have been good at the time and I`m convinced it was but seems far less good now in 2004 . I should also confess that I watched THEATRE OF BLOOD another much loved film from my childhood later the same night and was even more disappointed after watching it . I guess I must be getting old and cynical</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Childhood Memory -- Dashed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the video last night with my 3 and 6 year old girls. First time in perhaps 30 years I'd seen this movie, though many of the scenes and feelings came right back -- like the absolute terror of the "Child Catcher"! What was I thinking letting my little ones watch (I covered their eyes on request)? Worse, as an adult I was blown away by this movie's unmitigated misogyny, best represented by the gratuitous efforts of the "Baron" to off his wife....the inappropriateness for kids (and I'm not a prude, mind you) of the "Choochie Face" number, with the Baroness in a teddy....that horrid "Lonely Man" number....and on and on.I'd say much more. The whole thing struck me as an attempt to outdo Disney and recapture some of the Van Dyke magic of Poppins. So I was interested to read on IMDb that Van Dyke was quoted as saying this would "out-Disney Disney" -- and that Julie Andrews was the original choice for Truly. Well they missed out on her -- and they misfired, big-time! I can't believe this was ever a "mega-hit." I seem to remember liking the book as a kid. Now I want to go back and read it again. Or maybe I shouldn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The theatre production is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is another typical and original Disney story encompassing the magic and music that was so common in its films. One of the best aspects of this film has got to be the music. The tunes are catchy and memorable. Although the film is pretty good, it isn't the best Disney film. And, the theatre production is much better. (Unfortunately, they have stopped showing this in London now, but the theatre production brought the story to life much more than the film ever did and ever could.) Overall, not a bad film, but I wouldn't recommend it over some of Disney's other films. However, I have and would continue to recommend the play in London had they not stopped showing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as Mary Poppins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an OK movie for kids, but the story is clumsy (the car doesn't even appear until the movie is nearly half over) and the songs are absolutely horrible, especially when compared to Dick Van Dyke's masterpiece of a few years earlier, "Mary Poppins." I never could figure out why the studios of the '60s thought he could sing-clearly he's well suited to play parts like this but his voice is awful!! Sally Ann Howes-did I ever see her do anything else?-is serviceable if wooden in the Barbie doll character of a the local rich girl who falls in love with the pauper and becomes a mother figure for his two porcelain children. It isn't great but it's fun for the kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slowed too much by the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is almost two movies, one good, the other awful. The main story - the car, the attempt to kidnap the inventor, and the rescue is actually quite good, but it is almost entirely ruined by a series of songs that add nothing to the story and are not even much good as songs. In particularly the long sequences where Dick van Dyke attempts to raise enough money to purchase the carcass of the car were dreadful - long, slow, boring "spectacles" that felt entirely out of place.Get it on video or DVD and skip the musical sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what happens when Musicals are on Crack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will be honest, only see this film if you're crazy intoxicated.Sadly, I didn't. My parents D-R-A-G-G-E-D me to this one when I was a child. You see, they were under the impression that this was a musical every child should like. Well, this child adored "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music", my parents, thought, "Gee, she'd like this." No, she did not.It was silly. It was stupid. These were two sentences I used in describing it. The musical numbers were terrible. The songs were un-memorable, except for the lead song. I didn't care if the guy made a broken down car that could fly and have other attachments. I am of the James Bond era of cars so this car to me was definately "chitty".The only saving grace to me watching this film is that my best friend got to see it with me and she had a speech impediment. She could not pronounce her "c's", "s's", "f's" and "d's" properly. So the other best memory I have of this mess was her subsituting the "CH" should for "SH".Kinda summed up the entire movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always wanted to see this as a kid, but whenever it was on my dad would start grousing about twenty minutes into it. It must have taken three viewings to see the whole thing (in pieces). I loved the car, the music box sequence and the kid-catcher scared the cr*p out of me.Now that I'm an adult (and just attempted to view this) I offer my sympathies to my dad. This movie is just terrible. I could only get ten minutes into it; with shrill and wearying child actors, god-awful songs and hackneyed plot points as far as the eye can see. At any moment the writers and director are working to shoehorn more cornball into the frame. Utterly pointless musical production numbers show up regularly(toot sweets, me old bamboo, you two, etc.) and bring things to a complete standstill. Only about ten minutes into things, when the kids shriek a precious greeting to their dog "Edison," (ughh...) I reached my limit, and began an exhausting fast-forward workout. No matter where I stopped I couldn't bear more than a minute or so. It is unmercifully long. How could Rhoald Dahl have authored such a completely inept script? Dick van Dyke is at his gratingly wholesome peak. Since he never learned what real charm is, he just amplifies his "Dick van Dyke" mannerisms into a sort of phony charm. Long before Barney, van Dyke was at least as saccharine.The car is still stylish. Of all the burdens one has to bear as a parent, I'd be ready for all of them except sitting through movies like this with or without the grousing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a normal situation, there really is no point for anyone to make a comment on something they really hate. Me, I don't like movies where everybody suddenly start throwing mops or umbrellas to each other and sing stupid songs, dance stupid dances and everybody in the street joining in on the refrain while they should just continue eating banana or whatever they where doing. Unless of course threes a Elvis Presley involved (Thou shalt have no King but Elvis, and RCA is his prophet). But there's no King in this piece of chitty. I just have to scream it out. Breaking my own rule, this is a serious stinker. 144 minutes? Must be some kind of specially MADE minutes, the only special effect worth a donkeys droppings in the whole movie, it feels like 144 hours. And its all done with the horrible musical numbers, the rest of the movie can be tolerated, some cute kids, a pretty woman, a man to win the woman's heart blah blah make a new mother to his children, seen it before, will see it again (hey, its a Oscar plot after all) but why do they sing all this horrible songs? And why must these horrible songs be sooo loooong? And sooo boooring? I've seen a thing called Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, where the Ch's was Sh's. Not good. Not good at all. But... I don't know. If I am forced to watch one of them again or die, Ill probably call my local cemetery and make a request right away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know: you're going to call me a curmudgeon for what I'm going to say about "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang". But really folks, it's one of the hokiest movies imaginable. Maybe it's just that I don't like musicals - and this one seems to be almost a repeat of the equally hokey "Mary Poppins" - or maybe it seems like they're dissing Bulgaria, but I am not about to get enthralled by a movie like this. At least this time, Dick Van Dyke doesn't make a lousy attempt at an English accent.What I did while watching "CCBB" was what I often do while watching these sorts of movies: I heckled it, as Mike, Servo and Crow do to the crummy movies sent to them by Dr. Forrester on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". For example: "You're not a very good father." Hey, lady, give the guy a break; he tripped over an ottoman before this movie."Bang, bang, chitty, chitty..." Ever noticed what it spells if you change the "c" to "s"? "This nose never fails." Yeah, but when it belonged to Nixon, it didn't smell his resignation coming.Probably what surprises me most about this movie is that Ian Fleming wrote it. How could it be that the man who wrote about a hunky super-spy bedding the world's hottest babes also wrote about a flying car? And Gert "Goldfinger" Frobe even stars! Speaking of which, when they first said Vulgaria, I thought that they said Bulgaria. I would assume that it was a Cold War thing, with Bulgaria in the Eastern Bloc and all. And why does the bad guy have to be a German baron ruling a non-free country? The whole movie comes across as propaganda in that sense.Oh well, at least it gives one an opportunity to make "MST3K"-style jokes. As for the very fact that Dick Van Dyke starred in this, I read that in the late '60s and early '70s, he had a drinking problem; maybe to that we can attribute his decision to star in this. OK, I admit that that's probably not the reason that he starred in this. But any movie featuring a character named Jemima...well, doesn't that name have a reputation like the name Adolf? So that's my take on this.Still, it was neat to see Neuschwanstein Castle. I once put together a 6,000-piece puzzle showing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can't I give this a 0 out of 10? What utter drivel. This is one of those films they play to prisoners to sap their spirits and keep their morality low, isn't it?What made musicals like Mary Poppins, Bedknobs and Broomsticks and the like so good was that they had a wonderful family feel and could be enjoyed by anybody of any age - the whole family could gather round the TV to watch them at Christmas.But this abomination is only suitable for undemanding kids. The ideas and characters are twee, idiotic and unfunny, the whole thing is devoid of charm, the 'humour' is quite painful and the songs will have you reaching for the nearest paper bag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now has my vote as the least enjoyable bad film ever (as opposed to theenjoyable bad films, like Robot Monster). Who thought it would be a goodidea for Van Dyke to reprise his 'nearly but not quite entirely unlikeCockney' accent? The songs are rubbish, the direction clumsy, and greatperformers like Robert Helpmann are embarrassed. If you were sorry thatthe British film industry ran out of money, watch this again and beglad. No other country, surely, could produce something this twee andsquirm-inducing.Why oh why do they put it on TV every other year? Are kids this easilypleased? God</fullReview>
