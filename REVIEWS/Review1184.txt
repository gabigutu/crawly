		<shortDescription>Nothing from our era seems to compare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 40s and 50s produced many alluring performances from beautiful and sexy actresses and Rita Hayworth's in Gilda is one of the most provocative of all. The film is good and quite deep, the male leads are better, but Hayworth's performance is simply stunning and unforgettable. She may not have been the most beautiful 40s actress (Gene Tierney and Veronica Lake were more classic beauties imo), but if you look closely her ability to show the sweet, the vulnerable, and especially the wanton, in women has not been bettered. Somehow her character gets under the male viewer's skin in the same way as it does to the male characters in the film.Modern film femme fatales are a pale shadow by comparison, for example Linda Fiorentino or Sharon Stone. I'm not sure why. It could be either that nowadays allure is too much equated with sex or nudity (less tantalising than several dashes of suggestion) or maybe it's that present day equivalents are portrayed as hard as nails without the necessary mix of sadness and vulnerability.Whatever, if you've never appreciated what the appeal of 40s noir is, this is definitely one to try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And to think there used to be movies without graphic sex scenes that still got the point across, and how. The sexual tension between Ford and Hayworth in this movie is enough to make you run for the cold showers.Hayworth is gorgeous and so is Ford. They are so good together and in this movie they are positively great. When great screen lovers are mentioned, I've often wondered why Ford and Hayworth aren't among them.This is one of my absolute favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rita Hayworth Was THE Movie Star of the 1940's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could not have come up with a better title for this seductive thriller. GILDA is what this film is all about and Rita Hayworth is so engrossing and beautiful, you sometimes forget what is going on and just stare. "Put the Blame on Mame" is one of film history's more memorable singing sequences and we get to see it twice. Look out for the famous "hair-toss" scene the prisoners in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION cheer at. There is a film to talk about here but the alluring Ms. Hayworth is always on the tip of your tongue.Glenn Ford is the anti-hero of this excellent Noir portrait of double-crosses, jealousy, and forbidden love. He has many flaws, not the least being his infatuation of Gilda. Director Charles Vidor looked as though he was trying to capture a CASABLANCA-esque feel with the casino in Buenos Aires and people of all walks of life toiling within. There are even some familiar head nods at a roulette table. This is no CASABLANCA, but the end of WWII is somewhere in the backdrop and the stoic "Ballin Mundson", played by George Macready (PATHS OF GLORY), seems to have some foreign matters happening on the side, like "Victor Lazlo". The crisp black and white cinematography is effective, especially in the casino where 2/3 of the film takes place.GILDA is all Hayworth and, whether you are a male or female viewer, you see a good performance. She is great to look at, but her dramatic scenes are equally great to see. GILDA is an all-time classic that ranks with MALTESE FALCON and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Throughout the picture, the blame is put on Rita for most of the plot's turning points. There may just be someone as sweet as her flowing red hair inside waiting to come out. Glenn Fords' Johnny Farrel (perfect name for Noir character) cannot look past her deceiving flirtation and realize that the bad guy is right in front of him. Another triumphant film of the 1940's that works every time, GILDA is Rita Hayworth's claim to fame and sent her into the stratosphere as a star. She was more than just a pin-up.RATING: 9 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fusion of sexual heat, jealousy, fear and hatred - terrific stuff!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny is a small time, but talented, hustler who finds himself at the wrong end of a gun on the dark back streets of Buenos Aires. He is rescued by a mysterious and controlling stranger, Ballin Mundson, who ends up being the owner of a club/casino that operates under the radar of the law. Johnny and Ballin form a close partnership with Johnny being the "man who runs the joint" and Ballin the Master. When Ballin takes a short leave and comes back married to the gorgeous Gilda, a threesome develops that puts a strain on the partnership. There is a burning mutual dislike between Johnny and Gilda. When Gilda feigns ignorance over not remembering his name, she coyly replies, "Johnny. So hard to remember . . . and so easy to forget." Of course there's much more to their acquaintance than they are willing to acknowledge, and a fusion of sexual heat, jealousy, fear and hatred keep the tension tightly wound which fuels the film. And of course there is Rita Hayworth up front and center. All the accolades that have been showered on her sexy "striptease" interpretation of "Put the Blame on Mame" are true! And still this film has much more to offer; an economical but effective story line; a tight witty script loaded with innuendo; and superb acting all around, especially the overlooked icy performance of George Macready as Ballin Mundson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uniqueness descending into the ordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favourite films, much watched with all its faults. Even the best things can't be faultless but any faults can be more easily overlooked.There is no golden age film I've seen quite like Gilda, full of strange people with highly-charged emotions saying and doing odd thought-provoking things in semi-comical ways - if you include violence and swearing you could say that's 90% of modern movies though! The subject of hate = love has been explored better since Gilda, but with me the first cut is always the deepest - I first saw this when I was a more impressionable youngster. What we have is a scintillating four way love/hate relationship between Ballin, Johnny, Ballin &amp; Johnny's little friend with no name, &amp; Gilda that ultimately becomes the "usual" tawdry tangle, resolved by their nightclub's toilet-attendant. Huh? When you're in the middle of this fantasy world you can swallow all of this and more.Probably the second best B picture ever made it only starts to feel like one during the last 30 minutes down to the metaphorical walking into the sunset ending. There's so many good bits: The inventive and relentlessly snappy dialogue between the main characters throughout the film; Johnny quoting statistically that there are more insects in the world than women; Johnny waking up at 5am to the sound of Gilda singing to Pio the toilet-attendant; Pio's reaction after the midget industrialist killed himself in the toilets; Ballin describing his little friend's attributes to Johnny who claims he's just as good; Ballin asking Gilda if she was decent when she was; Johnny telling Ballin categorically that he taught Gilda ALL she knew; Gilda's little striptease - what creeps there were in that club - and fancy stopping her!Not quite as good as, but a worthy bookend for Casablanca, THE best B picture ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steaming Up the Argentine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth made five films together, but when they are talked of as a screen team, it's only Gilda that people are really talking about. Their first film was before World War II, The Lady in Question where both are young Columbia contract players who were in the same film and no effort was made to bill them as a team. The Loves of Carmen which was made after Gilda was a disaster for Glenn Ford, though Rita was at her sexiest. Affair in Trinidad was a good effort to recapture the magic of Gilda after Rita's storm marriage to Aly Khan and the last film The Money Trap was a Glenn Ford film where Rita has a brief role as an old girl friend. She was the best thing in that film by far.Do you remember in Cabaret how both the Liza Minnelli and Michael York characters find out they are sex partners to the same German bi-sexual man? That's essentially what happens in Gilda though with the Code firmly in place it's not something we talk about. George MacReady, a man of many interests rescues Glenn Ford from the docks of Buenos Aires after he's won some money from sailors in a crap game. They hit it off and Ford becomes his right hand man in running the casino MacReady operates.Then MacReady brings home a wife and lo and behold it turns out to be an old girl friend of Ford's, Rita Hayworth. Add to that some Nazi refugees have some business with MacReady over some tungsten mines. The real emphasis in this film is sex and personified by the best embodiment of sex ever on the silver screen. This film raked in a lot of dollars for Harry Cohn and Columbia Pictures. Hayworth, voice dubbed as usual, had a big number here in Put the Blame on Mame. It became a signature tune for her the rest of her life. One thing did disappoint me about Gilda. For a story that took place in Buenos Aires who many say is the most beautiful city in the world, it would have been nice to see some location shots, even if it was just some newsreels to establish the time and place. The film might as well have been in Albuquerque. But when you've got Rita to look at, it could be at the South Pole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charles Vidor's "Gilda" opens to a noir world of gambling, shifting uncertainties with a crooked crapshooter whose self-made luck is about to change at the close of World War II.Leaving with his winnings, Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is rescued by a nasty scar- faced casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) with a dagger-cane? The handsome gambler offers himself up as a croupier-manager to run Ballin's illegal joint? Promising to be faithful, Johnny is immediately accepted? Unfortunately this included Ballin's dazzling new bride Gilda (Rita Hayworth), who happens to be Farrell's ex- girlfriend? Thus begins one of the most tortuous and hard to follow of noir's many twists and turns? Rita captured everything about Gilda's character? She is extremely beautiful, malicious, provocative, greedy, vengeful, and awfully superstitious? And she makes it sound! There is a heat that one could feel in Gilda and Johnny and its intensity is pretty high? The movie shifts into a tremendous struggle between temptation and loyalty, challenge and envy, suspicion and mistrust, passion and desire? This noirish thriller reunited a two legendary stars in a magical moment that reflected strongly a forbidden love?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Hot Rita in Complex Film Noir Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth positively sizzles as Gilda in this film-noir classic. From her initial hair-tossing scene to her near striptease while she sings "Put the Blame on Mame," Hayworth is captivating and more than convincing as the object of every man's desires. However, beyond the overtly heterosexual lures of Ms. Hayworth lurks a complex and ambiguous romantic triangle that provides more intrigue than the surface plot, which involves a gambling casino that is a front for shady operations that originated in a recently defeated, Fascist country.Hayworth may either be the intruding wedge that comes between Glenn Ford and George Macready or the object of both men's romantic interests. From the initial meeting between Ford as two-bit gambler Johnny Farrell and Macready as Ballin Mundson the casino owner, an ambiguous, possibly homo-erotic, attraction is established between the two men. The lingering looks that they exchange can be read in several ways, but Bogie never looked into Cagney's eyes like Ford looks into Macready's. After Ford begins to work for Macready, his devoted care and slavish attention to his boss's needs exceed the bounds of employee and employer. When Hayworth moves into Macready's home as his new wife, Ford returns the key to the house as though he were a jilted lover. Ford's increasing jealousy becomes apparent after Hayworth's arrival on the scene, but it is unclear of whom he is jealous, Hayworth or Macready or possibly both. Perhaps Ford's character is as unsure of his own feelings as is the viewer, which makes the ambiguity even more intriguing. Macready's jealousy also grows as the heat between Ford and Hayworth intensifies, but, again, it is ambiguous of whom he is jealous.With a dazzling performance by Hayworth, excellent black-and-white photography by Rudoph Mate, fine direction by Charles Vidor, and layers of psychological possibilities to ponder, "Gilda" is as golden as its title suggests.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You gotta give this movie its due for style and sex appeal!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a great example of a very good film whose style and sense of sex appeal actually surpasses the plot. Now this isn't to say that the film has a bad plot--no, it's good enough. It's just that the wonderfully Noir-like dialog and Rita Hayworth's incredible sex appeal are what you are left with when the film is over--not the plot! Despite being a Rita Hayworth starring vehicle, she actually doesn't take up the lion's share of the screen. In fact, she doesn't even make an appearance until about 20 minutes into the film! This task of anchoring the film is given to a young and very effective Glenn Ford--who does a fine job as a street-wise but smart young punk wanting to make it to "the big leagues" and stop hustling for small change. When Ford meets up with George Macready, it's an incredibly memorable Noir moment. The crackling dialog between them and Ford's not even bothering to thank Macready for saving his life is so stylish and made the Film Noir lover within me happy! Later, in another great scene, Ford has just been worked over by a bouncer from a high class casino when he finds out this is Macready's business! Instead of being angry, both strike up a working arrangement--and Ford dispatches the bouncer is a brutal manner! Only later, after Ford has been Macready's right-hand man for some time does Hayworth enter the film. The reaction to her arrival indicates that there is SOME unfinished business between the two--but now Rita is Macready's new wife! Now this brings me to one problem about the film. It isn't an insurmountable problem, but supposedly Rita and Glenn had been lovers some time before and their meeting now was by pure chance. However, considering that they were in love in New York and the film takes place in Argentina, you are left wondering "what are the odds?". Despite this, you aren't left wondering for long because of the sparkling dialog and chemistry between Rita and Glenn. In other words, because of all the steamy moments on the screen, you tend to forget the occasional inconsistency of the plot. And, speaking of steam, there is a lot. Despite apparently being pregnant during the shoot, Miss Hayworth managed to create the sexiest portrayal on film from the era...period. Her languid singing, her amazing dresses that looked like they were glued on and the dialog between her and Ford all created an amazing atmosphere that just can't be equaled. Sure, the plot was fine, but the mood--that's what makes this an exceptional film.By the way, it is rather fascinating to see that in many ways this film mirrored the real-life antics of Rita--especially in regard to how she had a devil of a time picking men! Both Gilda and Rita both seemed to have a lot of sex destructiveness within them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Tungsten Cartel Caper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Macready is playing the role that most people remember him for - Balin Munson, nightclub millionaire in Argentina, and a man with pure ice in his veins. He has two friends...Johnny (Glenn Ford), who Balin rescues from some toughs, and a slick, sharp little chum hidden in his walking stick - ever ready to cut up people that Balin doesn't like. He also has bigger plans. Men like Balin are not satisfied with successful nightclub/gambling casinos (however successfully they are run). During the Second World War several German and axis industrialists found Balin a comfortable man to do business with. It seems they were not sure if Der Fuhrer would win after all, so they transferred various papers concerning their international holdings in tungsten manufacturing to Balin for him to watch. Big mistake, for Balin realizes that the documents actually put these interests into his fully capable hands. And since he has managed to bribe a local tungsten manufacturer to sell out his plant in Argentina, if Balin can leave without police interference he can put together a cartel that will control the manufacture of such things as light bulb filaments. Sounds preposterous, but that is Balin's goal. He only has two problems: Johnny and Balin's beautiful wife Gilda (Rita Hayworth) apparently know each other and can't stand each other - but he has to leave them in charge of his nightclub while he's away. The other problem is Detective Maurice Obregon (Joseph Calleia) of the Argentine Police Department. Obregon suspects Balin's involvement in this illegal cartel scheme, and is watching him like a hawk."Gilda" is the film that made Rita Hayworth a star, and (with "Paths of Glory") gave Macready his justifiable claims to being one of Hollywood's best villains. Ironically many people don't think of Macready as anything but a villain in movies. It is true that in films like "Lady Without a Passport" and "The Big Clock" he was a villain, but he also could play decent people. He tries to help Spencer Tracy escape recapture and execution in "The Seventh Cross", and he is the wise minister and reformer who helps thwart Ray Milland (a.k.a. the Devil) in "Alias Nick Beal". But his Balin is pure, malevolent ice. There has been some suggestion that Balin's relationship with Johnny is actually a homosexual one (the business with the knife in the cane possibly being a metaphor for a male sex organ). Perhaps, but it is a weird friendship of two cynics who (briefly) enjoy each other's cynicism.Curiously enough the business of the tungsten cartel is rarely discussed in going over the film. Like "Notorious" which came out about the same time, "Gilda" reminded American audiences of the large numbers of Nazis and collaborators who fled to South America in this period. In "Notorious" it was Brazil, and the gang (led by Alex Sebastian - Claude Rains) was fooling around with uranium. Here the idea of such people controlling a useful metal's manufacturing was not probed as much, probably because Balin was set to double cross them. But it is worrying to think of them coming so close to it.In a discussion of the Warner Baxter film, "Such Men Are Dangerous" I mentioned that (like that film) there is a hint here of the 1928 mysterious death of millionaire Alfred Loewenstein, who managed to fall out of his private airplane over the English Channel. Here, to evade both the Nazis and Calleia, Balin arranges his plane to explode over the ocean (although the audience and Calleia see a figure parachute before it does so). Not quite the same problem as the Loewenstein mystery, but one can see the seed of the idea was there.I would say this was certainly one of the better film noirs. It even was somewhat thought provoking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less noir, more a star vehicle for Rita Hayworth's talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilda is very much a star vehicle for Rita Hayworth's provocative sexiness and, in truth, she comes across, esp in the finale, as a vulnerable minx rather than an acid hearted femme fatale (Barbara Stanwyck in 'Double Indemnity).The plot's noir elements initially hold your interest - the downbeat narrator, the love triangle, Mundsen's shadowy dealings with Germans/Nazis, double-crossing - and the dialogue fizzes brilliantly at times especially when Gilda &amp; Johnny, her former paramour, encounter one another again (the talk on hate as an emotion).Yet one gets the feeling that plot &amp; character development are secondary elements and I found my attention wondering now &amp; again due to the uneven pace of the plot.I did like the idea of Farrell (Glenn Ford) becoming insanely jealous of Gilda - like Mundsen before him - after their marriage. She looks at a portrait of her supposedly dead husband and Farrell suddenly remembers her apparent faithlessness. Their love quickly turns again into mutual antagonism.The ending is underpowered and appears tacked on. We've been waiting for Mundsen's return to settle an outstanding matter. This just highlights how far removed from standard noir films Gilda really is.Some critics have read a gay subtext in the relationship between Johnny and Mundsen, but I think whatever nuances, if any, are quickly subsumed by the film's attention on Hayworth &amp; her charms. Besides the character of Mundsen is simply not developed enough to cater for such emotional complexity.Later generations like mine are perhaps not so aware of Hayworth's allure, so, in some ways, the film's mystique has diminished over time. Still, I can imagine the film's attraction especially for those returning from the grim battlefields of WW2. It is easy to understand how so many found this film captivating. I read somewhere that the film's chereographer actually based Hayworth's dance to 'Blame It On Mame' on a professional stripper he knew. Little wonder then that she became a pin-up on the first A-bomb dropped in peacetime. But it would be wrong just to class Hayworth as merely a pin-up. Her Gilda is also a vulnerable figure, hurt in the past, and on the rebound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hayworth Hot, Film Not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Casablanca," this film involves a saloon keeper in a love triangle, but that's about all this lackluster film has in common with that classic. Hayworth looks fabulous, especially when putting the blame on Mame, and she puts her considerable assets on display, but acting talent is not among them. Ford is the angry young man, although his anger towards Hayworth is never clearly explained. One would expect a flashback to their earlier relationship, but it never comes. Although it is a good-looking production, the script is anemic, with nothing interesting happening for at least the first half, and then some poorly contrived situations are presented.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals and characters but lacking in plot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth is GILDA, the mysterious sex-bomb who slinks into the life of casino owner Ballin Mundson (George MacReady) and his right-hand man Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford). It's pretty evident that Gilda and Johnny share a turbulent past, and their love-hate relationship (there has probably never been a screen relationship since that so perfectly encapsulated both sides of that equation) traps them both in a web of mutual brinkmanship... both trying to prove they 'hate' the other more. There is the complication of Gilda's marriage to Mundson, of course, as Johnny tries angrily to keep her faithful to Ballin, and the plot twists that unfold, leading Gilda to marry Johnny after Ballin's 'suicide' and his subsequent psychological tormenting of her. All in all, GILDA is a film-noir whose plot is almost an open book--the foreshadowing that goes on here is hardly what one would call subtle. You're hit on the head with the plot twists to come and know what to expect. It's the psychological creations of Gilda and Johnny that are interesting, with Gilda especially being an intriguing character.Rita Hayworth is without a doubt the best thing about the film: she's sexy, gorgeous, and sizzles whenever she's onscreen, from her guitar-strumming rendition of 'Put The Blame On Mame' through to that famous reprisal in the black dress and elbow gloves. (Her not-quite-striptease is hotter than most sex scenes in films these days!) It's not just about the looks though--her dramatic moments are a treasure to watch as well, particularly when she discovers that she has been tricked into returning to Buenos Aires. The moment when she breaks and slaps and scratches and screams at Johnny before sliding down to his feet, defeated, is an amazing emotional display. (Given more impact by her immediate reappearance onstage in the casino's club.)An interesting film for the characters (though Mundson turned out to be too one-note to be anything other than a caricature), and an excellent performance from Hayworth. You might want to look elsewhere for a better plotline though!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic version of Strawberry fields, where nothing is real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>J.D. Salinger's famous protagonist, Holden Caufield, from Catcher in the Rye, would have hated this movie and for good reason; it is replete with tawdry phoniness. You might as well classify "Gilda" as science fiction rather than film noir since none of it has any resemblance to reality.The characters are fake, the South American locale is fake, and the casino where most of the action takes place looks like something the Wizard of Oz's interior decorator came up with. And wait until you get a load of Macready's make up job; whoo, brother! Ballin Munson? What kind of ridiculous name is that? (Maybe to suggest Ballin' Munson?).Welcome to Gilda's alternative universe, my friend, one which succeeds on an anthropological plane of investigation; helping we poor mortals of the 21st century determine what kind of escapist entertainment our ancestors found amusing.In sum, "Gilda" is just a vehicle for Rita Hayworth to strut and dance around inher glittering designer gowns, waving her gorgeous locks of hair, and uttering lines of dialogue she would never be clever enough to come upwith on her own. And her guitar playing? Ha! Hayworth doesn't even bother trying to fake it, merely putting all four fingers over the strings and sliding them up and down like a spastic paralytic. You may as well throw your suspension of disbelief out the window if you have any hope of getting through this overrated piece of schlock. Film noir? The only black thing about this movie is that so many reviewers here on IMDb.com are fooled by its utter submission to Hollywood studio period narrative conventions.I can't help musing what John Garfield or Humphrey Bogart would have done with this "Johnny Farrel" character. Then again, THOSE leading men would never consent to playing a pussy-whipped simp as Ford does. Yessiree, ol' Glenn knows who the REAL star is in THIS picture; that's why he GOT this part. No mere man or mortal is going to upstage the bankable queen bee Rita Hayworth.But by all means, "turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream" if you could care less about having an engaging story to sink your teeth into and just want an injection of dazzling, but ultimately vacuous, Hollywood glitz. It's well-produced for what it is, so I'll be generous and give it five stars; let's be charitable as well, and say it probably looked fantastic on the big screen. And for those of you who think I'm being a pedantic snob, I will be the first to cheer that "Gilda" is magnificent compared to the hyper-sexualized tripe being produced for the silver screen these days. One final note: the copy I viewed from a torrent site had been been restored by the UCLA Film Archive, and it appears they put quite a bit of effort into their work. Such a pity they wasted their time and money on the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most amazing thing about this film is the number of excellent reviews. Granted its fun to watch Rita do a few numbers, and there are some nice noir touches. But the dialog is so incredibly lame, with Gilda mouthing Freudian nonsense and the threesome repeating ad nauseam that they hate one another, but love one another, then hate....The plot is imbecilic, the acting absurd, the love triangle preposterous, and the editing almost non existent. One could list these missteps but to what avail? If its film noir, you expect a lost of this B type stuff. But lets call a dame a dame, and not make more of her than she's worth. Its possible the film could have been redeemed somewhat if the ending had gone the way the film was heading, but I'm sure the Hollywood moguls stepped in to give it a happy ending, which finished off whatever merit the film had up to then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two jealous guys and one ditsy lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Johnny' Farrell is a small-time gambler/card cheat who finds himself being robbed at gunpoint just after leaving a game of dice with some soldiers in Buenos Aires. A weird guy with a German accent, Ballin Mundson, just happens to be strolling along down by the docks and saves Johnny by whipping out a sharp knife hidden inside his cane. Thus begins the very strange and not all that entertaining pseudo-noir, 'Gilda'. Mundson hands Johnny his card and invites him to play at his casino. Before you know it, Mundson hires Johnny as the manager after Johnny convinces him that he can use his skills as a crooked gambler to ferret out customers bent on cheating the house. Mundson introduces Johnny to his wife, Gilda, played by Rita Hayworth. Gilda can't stand Mundson but obviously married him for his money. The only thing that is truly understandable in this movie is Gilda's disdain for Mundson who is continually trying to suck up to her acting like a besotted 16 year old wuss. Mundson's jealousy knows no bounds and it's this jealousy that defines his character?so much so that the character becomes totally one-note. There is so much of Mundson's jealousy we can take before saying, 'enough already'. Fortunately for the film-goer, Mundson disappears halfway through the movie, only to return at the end.Meanwhile, without providing any back story, Johnny and Gilda knew each other before. When they meet again they have a thorough disdain for one another. Johnny tells Gilda, "I hate you", Gilda tells Johnny, "I hate you" and one of them (or maybe both, I can't remember) slaps the other in the face. Like Mundson's jealousy, the disdain is unrelenting but at a certain point they declare their love for one another, end up in a passionate embrace and before you know it, get married. Finally, closet nice-guy Johnny starts morphing into Mundson (after Johnny takes over the casino following Mundson's apparent suicide, nose-diving his single pilot aircraft into the ocean)and becomes jealous of Gilda's new singles life. Gilda tells Johnny that dating other men is just an act for Johnny to pay more attention to her but Johnny won't buy it. He becomes so jealous that he has one of his henchmen at the casino physically remove every new date from Gilda's proximity causing her to flee to Montevideo where she meets a new man, a lawyer who convinces her to return home and get an annulment. When she returns, she finds out that her new boyfriend, the lawyer, was paid by Johnny to get her to return. Gilda is shattered when Johnny tells her that annulments are not legally valid in Buenos Aires (unfortunately Gilda is not a law school graduate!).Just like Mundson, Johnny's jealousy toward Gilda becomes tiresome. But unlike Mundson, Johnny's 'true feelings' toward Gilda cannot be kept down. He somehow realizes that he's been the biggest heel all along and once again falls for Gilda (please don't ask me what motivates these sudden reversals in the characters' behavior). Just as Johnny changes his mind about Gilda (again) Mundson returns and in a jealous rage attempts to murder both Johnny and Gilda. Mundson is struck down by the kindly bathroom attendant who presciently has referred to Johnny as a 'peasant' from the beginning of the film. The police inspector does his Captain Renault imitation from Casablanca by stepping in and hinting that Johnny and Gilda will not be charged for Mundson's death, that the official cause of death is still a suicide and not to matter anyway, it was a justifiable homicide. There is also a subplot in 'Gilda' that is just as confusing as the love triangle. Mundson has cornered the Tungsten market and double-crossed two Germans he knew during the War who show up at the Casino claiming they are the rightful leaders of a cartel. We never find out anything about the Germans except that Mundson ends up killing one of them and that's why he has to flee (oh there's another weird guy, a businessman who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel. The weird guy is unable to kill Mundson so he ends up shooting himself). As one poster aptly put it here, Gilda is a 'poor man's Casablanca'. In some ways, Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversals?the odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled. Gilda is a story where the characters don't earn our respect?they're locked in a pointless battle simply designed to titillate the masses of people soon to become addicted to daytime soap operas on television in the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half A Good Film Plus Rita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films I never think is all that good, but I keep going back to it every four or five years. Perhaps it's just to get another look at Rita Hayworth while she was still THE glamor woman of the period (1940 to about 1948). At times, she is just jaw-dropping stunning. Glenn Ford provides some narration and does his normally-competent job as the lead actor but I really liked George Macready's performance more. He is really good as the rich husband, just fascinating to watch.This film would have been so much better had it been cut about 20 minutes. It bogs down a little over halfway through (but recovers). The dialog is what makes this story interesting for the most part, particularly in the first half of the film which is far better than the second half, and that includes the cinematography. The second half is a lot more melodrama than film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With our very first glimpse of the ever-elegant Rita Hayworth in Gilda it's so easy to understand why this beautiful woman was voted, time and again, one of Hollywood's #1 Pin-Up Girls of the 40's. Rita Hayworth is absolutely radiant in this flick. At the age of 28 Rita never looked sexier, or more alluring than this. Just her, alone, in this picture makes it well-worth viewing.The location for Gilda was Buenos Aires, Argentina. Gilda was a picture that was, unfortunately, shot almost entirely indoors. The usual setting for Gilda was either the interior of a large, grand, and always over-crowded, casino, or, the interior of a large, pseudo-elegant, and very tacky, mansion. Because of all this indoor shooting we, the viewer, never really get any feel for actually being anywhere near South America, at all.Rita Hayworth plays the title character, Gilda, in this rather screwy (weren't they all?) Romantic/Comedy from 1946. Gilda is the mega-pampered, American wife of a mysterious, Argentinian-born, casino owner named Mundson. (Now, how's that for a real, authentic-sounding, Latin-American name?) It's hard to imagine that Gilda is actually a comedy, but it is!! I must say that I found it to be pretty lame when it came to the chuckle and laugh department. But Gilda was entertaining. And, of course, Rita Hayworth never failed to be anything but a stunning eyeful.The big highlight in Gilda is watching Rita Hayworth do her sensational 'Put The Blame On Mame' number.*Special Note* - Rita Hayworth was married, in real-life, to director/actor Orson Welles at the time of Gilda's production. Welles was a jealous and possessive bugger when it came to Rita. If you look closely, amongst the crowd at the casino, during Rita's big 'Mame' number, you'll catch a super-brief glimpse of Welles sitting at one of the ring-side tables, smoking one of his mega-stinky, trademark cigars. Hayworth divorced Welles one year after the release of Gilda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated Drama banking mainly on Hayworth's Sex-Appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth never photographed better than in this dated love-triangle, set in the sultry post WWII Argentines. Clearly in a marriage of convenience with a much older, sophisticated and powerful casino owner, Hayworth runs into her old flame, Glenn Ford, who has grown loyal to her husband, who also is Ford's employer.There are a few twists to this story, while the highlight will always be the stage appearances of "Gilda", singing the legendary "Put The Blame On Mame" number better than Marilyn Monroe could have ever done it. For fans of 1940s film noire, the youth and sex appeal of the leads may not be enough. "Gilda" is no match for other films in the genre, clearly barely average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thin line between love and hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gilda" may very well be one of the most unusual Hollywood films ever made. What exactly is the relationship among the three lead characters, Gilda, Johnny, and Ballin? How is Uncle Pio a key figure in the story? If you can unravel the threads to discover the answers to these two questions, then you're on your way to understanding this extremely complex, intriguing, yet highly entertaining cinematic gem.The three leads, Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, and George Macready turn in what should have been award-winning performances. Rita is at her most seductiveness. She danced in a natural way that left little to the imagination. She understood her every movement and made every twist and turn tell a story. One of the most enchanting scenes in the entire film is when she strums the guitar and sings "Put The Blame on Mame" to a hypnotized Uncle Pio. The camera work under the direction of Rudolph Maté, dazzling throughout, is particularly noteworthy in this scene with just the right zooms and angles to capture the essence of the magic moment.Glenn Ford as the sexually frustrated Johnny delivers one of his best acting jobs ever. Most viewers have experienced relationships that began with doubt and ambivalence but led to love. Johnny perceives Gilda at first as a dangerous rival and as a threat to his position of power and prestige provided him by Gilda's new husband, Ballin. Johnny was nothing but a two-bit hustler, a small time gambler, before Ballin saved him with his "Little Friend" from being robbed and maybe killed outside a gambling dive in Buenos Aires. Made his casino manager and possible successor, Ballin takes Johnny into his confidence, even giving him the combination to the safe in his office. Johnny sees Gilda as an interloper. Gilda views Johnny in much the same way, a threat to her new found wealth with her sugar daddy.Ballin Mundson is arrogant and ambitious, seeking to actually rule the world through a business cartel involving the Germans. Set up during World War II, it is not quite clear if Ballin was in collusion with the Nazi's or if it was all just a business deal. Since he is now hiding out in South America, collaboration with the Nazi's is a possibility. Though he uses Gilda for decoration and exploitation, he obviously loves her to the point of obsession. She is his possession, not to be touched without his consent.When it seems that Ballin has committed suicide, Johnny takes both the casino and Gilda. What seems to be mutual hate contaminates Gilda and Johnny's relationship to the point that Gilda becomes his prisoner. The viewer cannot imagine a happy ending for all this, but one does take place.This cinema classic invites repeated viewings to unravel the motives and intentions of the three leading characters. At one point, Gilda hisses, "Hate is a very exciting emotion." But then so is love. While trying to understand exactly what is going on, savor the sensuous, titillating movements of a true screen goddess, Rita Hayworth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) hires bum Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) to help run his casino because they share a total lack of scruples. However things become complicated when Mundson marries gorgeous Gilda (Rita Hayworth)...I didn't really like this but it does have a few interesting points. Macready and Ford's relationship has a STRONG gay subtext. For instance one of Ford's first lines to Macready is "You must lead a gay life". Also they're constantly looking at each other and smiling like they share some secret. And Macready does have a cane which shoots out a spike (I don't think I have to explain that one). When Macready brings Hayworth home Ford acts like a jilted lover. Whether on not it was written in there I don't know--but it's there.That aside this is not a good movie. It's slow, confusing and far too long. It looks good but that can't help the plodding pace. This film would be totally forgotten if it weren't for Rita Hayworth. She's just great--sexy, beautiful and one hell of an actress. Her insults to Ford are just dripping with venom. Unfortunately Ford and Macready are not too good. Macready plays his role WAY too low-key and Ford is very good-looking--but stiff and unlikable. Again--Rita is the whole show here. Her singing and dancing to "Put the Blame on Mame" is a classic.I can truthfully only give this film a 6--and that's just for Rita.</fullReview>

The plot made little sense, nor did I understand the motivations of the characters. It was pleasing to look at film noir, but I never connected with it emotionally, unlike many other films of that genre. For example, a few people remarked on the ending. It took me a while to even remember it. The cinematography was great, the famous dance number was sizzling, and the actors, even the bit parts, filled out their roles well. But I never really cared what anyone was actually up to, nor did their fate matter to me.Great for film buffs, so so for regular audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Buenos Aires, Argentina, the smalltime crook and dice gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) has just cheated American sailors and wins a great amount of money. Soon a thief tries to steal his money but he is saved by the stranger Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal casino and Johnny cheats at the blackjack table and is forced to go to an office where he finds that Mundson is the owner of the casino. Johnny starts working for Mundson as his right-man in the casino. Their relationship changes when Mundson returns from a trip bringing his new wife Gilda (Rita Hayworth) that has a past with Johnny. When Mundson is presumed dead in a plane crash, the hatred of Johnny and Gilda grows with the behavior of the easy Gilda that is always dating different men."Gilda" is a movie with wonderful cinematography, good performances and a story with romance, murder, double-cross and jealousy and would be a great film-noir like many others from the 40's. But the splendorous, gorgeous, wonderful, marvelous, sensuous, beautiful, sexy and lovely Rita Hayworth that makes the difference. The sentence "There never was a woman like Gilda!" is perfect to describe this actress in the role of the femme-fatal Gilda. Last time I saw Gilda was on 22 Jul 2003 and today (17 February 2014) I have just seen it again maybe for the fifth or sixth time and I never get tired of "Gilda". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Gilda"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect vehicle for Hayworth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic film noir is a very entertaining film and the casting is good although I do think Glenn Ford could have been played by any of a number of leading men. Ford was always a solid actor but opposite the incredibly sexy Rita Hayworth the audience is forced to some degree to forget logic and common sense. Great use of shadows that you come to expect in this genre and they photographed Hayworth beautifully. How can you forget the first time Hayworth pops up with her beautiful red hair flowing? There are several great profile shots of her throughout the film. And that great shot of her leg pointed up! The script is entertaining although I do believe its a notch below "Double Indemnity" and "Laura". The last half hour I thought was a little tiresome and the ending really surprises no one. I know others think this is one of the all time classics but I do not. I understand the mass appeal and it is a well made drama but like I said, its a notch below others in this genre. Also, Hayworth was pregnant during filming and in certain shots you can notice it. And her singing voice during the big number is dubbed. Good cinematography and shadowy characters make up for the shortcomings in the last part of the script. Fun film.</fullReview>

Things go well at first, until Mr. Mundson returns from a trip with a wife named Gilda(played by Rita Hayworth) whom Johnny happens to have a history with. They hate each other at first, but the old flame is rekindled, endangering both of their lives, especially when Mundson disappears... Rita Hayworth is most appealing here, and the acting is fine, but film ultimately disappoints because the story resolution is so weak. Mostly remembered for the famous introductory scene of Gilda, the film's highlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triangle with Six Sides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Odd that a movie with such an unusual homo-erotic subtext would be remembered for its glamour girl. Well, not so surprising since those adoring close-ups reveal a stunningly beautiful Rita Hayworth. Good thing she got a hairline lift since her bit-part days as Rita Cansino in such B-movie epics as Charlie Chan in Egypt (1935). It's all part of the star-making process, I guess. True, she may not be much of an actress, but as a face she could go nose-to-nose with the young Elizabeth Taylor any day. Those first few scenes between her, Ford and Macready crackle with scarcely veiled innuendo, and I could just see the three of them retiring warily to the bedroom together. I'm just wondering what the Code enforcement folks had to say. My guess is the censors traded those early scenes for later ones dissolving the threesome into a more conventional triangle of hetero-jealousy. Anyway, the movie soon flattens into a rather confusing, but well photographed, narrative highlighted by Rita's sexy tussle with a shoulder-length pile of hair. I suspect the poorly integrated screenplay results from passing through the hands of three different writers headed in three different directions, with not enough supervision. In my little book, whichever scribbler did the lines for the toilet attendant should have been in charge. The movie itself may fall well short of the hoopla, but it does have its moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't deny that Rita Hayworth is stunningly beautiful and Glenn Ford is a sexy, smoldering dude.But I don't get all the fuss about this film.Gilda Mundson and Johnny Farrell once had a thing for each other. And the sexual chemistry does remain. However, lately she's been saying she hates him and he says he hates her right back. Ten times at least! Along the way we learn that Johnny is a crooked gambler thoroughly lacking in self-contempt. ("You've no idea how faithful and obedient I can be...for a nice salary," he tells the slimy Ballin Mundson).And Hayworth does keep one guessing for a while.("You don't love him," Johnny hisses. "You married him for his money!" "That happened to come with it!" she says.) Throw in a cute little foreigner unafraid to speak his mind (Steven Geray), a couple of sinister, German cartel members, and various smitten, would-be Gilda suitors...and...yawn you likely will. The black-and-white cinematography can be good and Hayworth's "Put the Blame on Me" song is indubitably charming but I found this movie ultimately to be drawn-out and tedious.And what a facile ending. Couldn't they dream up anything better than guy gets girl? I can see them squabbling off into the sunset. Can't say I'm sorry I saw this, but it did leave me feeling gypped.Coda: Perhaps the greatest thing I got from this film was confirmation that "all that glitters isn't gold," age-old wisdom from yore.

		<fullReview>Gilda (1946)You know from the first few minutes that this movie will look great and move fast. By twelve minutes in you have a swirling shifting plot line and two memorable lead players. And that's before Rita Hayworth has even appeared (as the title character).Glenn Ford is young and almost baby-faced here, but a mature presence, great to see in this demanding role, at least for a film noir. And yes this is a noir, a great one, with all the archetypes--the lead male floating anchor-less through a sinister world, a femme fatale, and a complex plot with a backstory that matters. It's filmed in fluid moving camera black and white, with lots of night stuff. And it's over the top dramatic.Ford is Hayworth's favorite leading male, and you might sense why here. They are very evenly matched, and the scenes with the two of them (often with others, too) are great. But then, all of it is pretty terrific. There is a true Hitchcock style McGuffin involved --tungsten, this time--and it really doesn't matter. You do have to pay attention to every look and remark to fully follow the deceptions, and to be let in on the secrets as they come out. And it's worth it.Part of the joy here is the new film noir mood fully blossomed, complete with the snappy dialog of short pithy quips, and with a contrasty filming style. This is a great one, set in Argentina in those years when the Nazi refugees were roaming South America. Don't miss it. Highly recommend seeing "Notorious" by Hitchcock at the same time, because they both travel through similar external circumstances. But the differences in feel and style are clear as day. Both are great, and both are moving in different post-War directions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone remembers Rita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Rita Hayworth in probably her most memorable role. Her portrayal of Gilda is rightly remembered as a classic performance. But Gilda the character is much better than Gilda the movie. Hayworth may be a sensation but everything around her in this movie is not quite up to her standard. Not a bad movie by any means but no all-time classic either. It's one of those movies where a performance is remembered so fondly that perhaps people remember the movie as being somewhat better than it actually is. As good as Hayworth is she's not enough to hide the movie's flaws.Our story unfolds in Buenos Aires. Which as you watch the movie is easy to forget because there is absolutely no South American flavor to the proceedings. The story might as well be set in Milwaukee. Anyhow small-time gambler and successful cheater Johnny Farrell somehow finds himself running a high-class casino after the casino's owner, Ballin Mundson, takes a liking to him. Everything is going swimmingly until one day, completely out of the blue, Ballin returns home from a trip with a beautiful new wife in tow. This woman is going to cause all kinds of complications. This woman of course is Gilda and right from the start, from her first memorable moment on the screen, Hayworth takes hold of the movie. Gilda's a fascinating character with so much lurking under the surface. And what's on the surface ain't so bad either. Not for nothing was Hayworth the era's most popular pinup girl. A shame then that the movie can't take full advantage of the allure and talents of its star.Hayworth is vibrant, exciting, bursting with life. The movie is not. In playing Johnny Farrell, the character we unfortunately spend more time with than we do with Gilda, Glenn Ford comes across as being somewhat dull. And his character is rather unlikable. The story contains some elements which fall flat. There's something about a tungsten cartel which involves some angry Germans. This of course has nothing to do with Gilda. Can we just get back to Gilda? Please? Somewhere along the way the story really gets bogged down and not even Hayworth can fully rescue it. Everyone will remember Hayworth's big moments. She makes quite the impression with her famous singing and dancing. Well dancing anyway as the singing voice isn't hers. But nevertheless that famous number, "Put the Blame on Mame", is quite the spectacle. Now who to put the blame on for surrounding the fabulous Hayworth with an otherwise very ordinary movie? You'll love Rita. Love the movie? That's a stretch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in 1946 or 1947 on the weather deck of a submarine, tied up at a pier down in Panama. The west bank. It left the crew mesmerized and it still has some of that effect on me. It is all Rita. Those were the years immediately after WW11 when Rita was at the height of her well deserved popularity. When she did the famous clothed strip tease "Put The Blame On Mame" the crew went wild. But Rita Hayworth did much more than "Gilda" and the DVD shows bits of her wonderful dancing ability with such stars as Fred Astair. As has been noted by other users the ending is contrived, but the film will remain one of my favorites, if for no other reason than the scene when "Ballin" asks, "are you decent"? Rita flips her hair and replies "me?........Sure, I'm decent". It still curls my toes. She was the most glamorous and sexiest of all stars and deserved the title of "Sex Goddess". This movie is really all hers. Glenn Ford was perfect in his role and their friendship shows through in this film. They were neighbors in real life and were really great lifelong friends. I will rate it 10/10 and put it in my DVD player and watch it once more....for old times sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that people say about Rita Hayworth is true. She's wonderfully sexy and seductive throughout the movie. She has the best dialogue and has about half a dozen wonderful scenes, including two nice musical numbers.The problem is the 60% of the movie that she is not in. The plot is dull, the other characters unlikable, and the production values mediocre.The movie isn't quite film noir, isn't quite, gangster, isn't quite, romantic action. It is really a hodge-podge mess.Perhaps the biggest problem is Glenn Ford's "Johnny" character. There is nothing sympathetic about him. He is not witty or cool, but morose, with a nasty streak. The movie really needed a hero to save Gilda from him, but he plays the hero and the villain in a confused, uptight manner.Besides Rita, George McCready gives a nice menacing performance as casino owner/crime boss Ballan. Unfortunately, his character fakes his own death halfway through the movie and he only appears again for three minutes in a final scene.So ten stars for Rita and four stars for the rest of the movie balances out to a seven star movie.</fullReview>

Talk about improbable coincidences! We are given no info about the backgrounds of Mundson nor Gilda. Mundson clearly doesn't seem like a native Argentinian, and is involved with an illegal scheme involving a tungsten manufacturing cartel, in cooperation with some Nazis, as well as his nightclub business. As revealed later in the film, Gilda presumably has a background as a nightclub entertainer. Johnny has been making a living as a crooked gambler. Thus, neither stiff cold fish Mundson nor the parasitic Johnny, who later reveals himself to be a sicko, after marrying Gilda, make a likable partner for the ravishing, but apparently troubled, Gilda. That is one big problem with the screen play. Perhaps, we can understand Gilda's reason for marrying the unlikable Mundson(financial security and a chance to perform at his nightclub). But it's not apparent why she developed any interest in drifter Johnny, nor is it clear why he keeps saying he hates her. Thus, the audience has to guess at the past personal histories of these 3 to try to understand their present interactions with each other.At one point, Mundson says "Gambling and women don't mix". Why? A little while later, he appears with Gilda. When Johnny points out the inconsistency, Mundson says "Gilda does not fall under the category of 'a woman'"!? Why? Is he hinting that she has lesbian tendencies? Is she mostly a 'trophy wife', with little interest by Mundson in her as a sexual partner?(Something that actress Heddy Lamarr experienced in real life, for a time). In the end, Mundson, after staging his apparent suicide, in order to foil the Argentine police, eventually returns to seek revenge on the love/hate couple of Johnny and Gilda. But, it is he who dies in this confrontation, leaving Johnny and Gilda as an apparently reunited couple. Love eventually triumphs over hate, is the apparent message. Yes, the screen play is riddled with plausibility and likability problems. We have no clue why Gilda chose to flee from NYC to Argentina, specifically, after her breakup with Johnny. Little effort is made to convince the audience that the story actually takes place in Argentina, or briefly, Montevideo(The filming did not). After Mundson's staged suicide, Johnny takes on Mundson's controlling behavior regarding Gilda, refusing to sleep with her after they are married, supposedly as punishment for supposedly being unfaithful to Mundson. Given all the ups and downs of their relationship, the audience should see that the apparently happy ending is probably just one the ups in a continuing dysfunctional relationship. Although Gilda is sometimes described as a femme fatale, I don't see it that way, not like the true femme fatale Rita had previously played in "Blood and Sand". Without knowing the details of her relationship with Johnny in the US, Gilda just seems to be trying to even the score with Johnny for breaking up with her in the US.There has been much prior speculation about the possible homosexual tendencies of Mundson and Farrell. Unfortunately, with the censorship rules in effect at this time,any overt hint of such would be censored out. Behind the scenes, we may well have been dealing with not only two bisexual men, but a bisexual Gilda! I wouldn't be surprised, but we'll never know for sure.Rita's periodic song/dance performances are the saving grace of this film. Unfortunately, she lacks a Fred Astaire to sometimes complement her, as she had in her favorite film role, in "You Were Never Lovelier". Interestingly, that story also supposedly took place in Argentina, again, for no apparent reason, and also with minimal attempt to convince that it actually took place there(again, it didn't).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Troubled Threesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gilda" provided Rita Hayworth with the role for which she is best known, as a pleasure seeking female in a very unconventional menage a trois. Her performance is full of style, spirit and humour as she sings, dances, flirts and delivers some great lines. On one occasion, she says "If I'd been a ranch, they would've named me the Bar Nothing" and on another, when she believes that she's been criticised unfairly says, "that wouldn't be the big pot calling the little kettle black now, would it?" The screenplay is excellent throughout and Glenn Ford's performance in his rather unusual role is particularly good.Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) is a young gambler who "likes to make his own luck" and when one night he's held up in a dark alley by a gunman, becomes very grateful for the timely intervention of a suave, affluent looking, older man who rescues him. The man in question is Ballin Mundson (George Macready) and the unusual weapon he brandishes is a cane with a retractable blade. This meeting leads to Johnny becoming an employee at Ballin's Buenos Aires casino and a strong relationship developing between them as they mutually agree that "women and gambling don't mix". Johnny quickly makes good progress in his job and when Ballin tells him that he's going on a trip, Johnny is appointed as Casino Manager for the duration of Ballin's absence.Ballin returns some weeks later and shocks Johnny by introducing him to his new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth). Ballin doesn't realise that Johnny and Gilda had previously been lovers but the rather tense and uncomfortable dialogue between them gradually leads him to suspect that they may have known each other previously. Further tension develops when Ballin makes Johnny Gilda's watchdog and she responds by taunting him by being flirtatious with whoever's available. Johnny loyally protects Ballin from knowing about Gilda's behaviour but at the same time feels betrayed by Ballin who had previously agreed that "gambling and women don't mix". He is also similarly ambivalent about his relationship with Gilda as he hates her vehemently but also feels strangely jealous when he sees her with other men.One night at Ballin's house, when they believe that they're alone, Gilda and Johnny dance together but a noise interrupts them. Johnny sees Ballin running out of the house and into his car. Johnny follows in another vehicle to a spot near a beach where he sees his employer getting into a small plane and taking off. Shortly after, the plane explodes and crashes into the sea.As well as owning the casino, Ballin had also controlled a cartel which was involved in the production and marketing of tungsten and on Ballin's death, Gilda became the sole beneficiary of his entire estate. Johnny and Gilda get married but Johnny chooses to live separately and appoints two of his men to guard Gilda night and day. She remains a virtual prisoner under his control until an unlikely turn of events brings matters to an extremely improbable conclusion."Gilda" is a story of quickly changing allegiances, strong but conflicting emotions and the abuse of power.The allegiances of the parties within the threesome all changed with each other and similarly when Ballin and later Johnny were in control of the tungsten business, both sought to extricate them selves from their longstanding relationship with the Germans.When the trust within Johnny and Ballin's relationship was broken, Johnny felt betrayed but nevertheless remained loyal to Ballin. Johnny and Gilda's feelings for each other were often expressed passionately, predominantly as hatred, but in reality, constituted a mixture of love and hate.Ballin was a control freak. He picked up and bought both Johnny and Gilda and when it suited him, cynically set them against each other for his own perverse amusement. Gilda's life with him was made miserable by the strong control he exerted over her and when she eventually married Johnny, she found herself subjected to the same level of abuse all over again. In their business dealings with the tungsten cartel Ballin and Johnny both tried to breach the anti-trust laws in order to gain an illegal level of power over the market for their particular commodity.The movie's more humorous moments and Rita Hayworth's entertaining rendition of "Put The Blame On Mame" are thoroughly enjoyable and together provide an effective counterpoint to the story's darker themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about image vs. reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: Spoilers &amp; Theoretical Analysis :-)"There NEVER was a woman like Gilda!" literally means that Gilda didn't exist. The tag line didn't say "There never was ANOTHER women like Gilda!" which would have been different.I stress this difference because I came to "Gilda" via David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr.", where a poster of "Gilda" gives an amnesiac woman a name: Rita.Other reviewers here have noted some awkward elements in this movie. I'd contend that artificiality, coincidence, exaggeration, etc. abounds from beginning to end--and in fact is a GOOD THING. Ballin notes the coincidence that both Johnny &amp; Gilda claim they were born the moment they meant Ballin. In a sense, movie characters are "born" the moment the film is released. Captain Delgado floats over the scene and steps in from beginning to end as well noting the spot on the mirror to giving counsel and setting aside legal punishment.Another notable artificiality is that of sound. Upstairs at the casino, there are buttons to listen to different sectors either 100% on or totally silent. Similarly, before the masked ball, opening the window allows street sounds or shuts it out completely.During the 5 AM scene between Johnny and Gilda (with Uncle Pio watching after hearing 6 verses of "Blame it on Mame"), one can see another kind of awkwardness: that of the film-making process. Specifically, we see Rita Hayworth (the actress) reacting as Glen Ford speaks off camera, but we sense that something is out of whack. Both them are giving a reacting to each other, but it's not filmed with 2 cameras. Instead each actor says their dialog separately.IMHO, there's a strong homosexual overtone between Johnny &amp; Ballin. The strongest clue is the house-key that Johnny has &amp; then gives up when Gilda arrives.In its own way this movie is breath-taking because of Rita Hayworth--specifically becoming "Gilda". But as the tag-line says, "There NEVER was a woman like Gilda" including Rita Hayworth. But it's still a thrill to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Love Triangle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As WWII comes to a close, we find Johnny, an ex-pat American drifter (Glenn Ford), cheating sailors at dice on the Buenos Aires waterfront. A mysterious stranger, Balinn Mundsen (George McReady), breaks up a robbery about to go very bad for Johnny and saves his life. Balinn owns an illegal casino and is the front man for a Nazi-run tungsten cartel. In gratitude, Johnny becomes Balinn's right-hand man (and probably his lover). Then, during a trip, Balinn marries Gilda (Rita Hayworth), who also happens to be an ex-lover of Johnny. You talk about a love-triangle! All the actors, especially Hayworth, are on the top of their games. And the dialogue, it just doesn't get much better, rarely matched in contemporary films. Grab this off the cable or rent it at your local video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A passionate film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie since I saw a short scene of it in The Shawshank Redemption - a most memorable scene - and I have not been disappointed. Gilda is an excellent film. The story is in some ways comparable to Casablanca, since it is also about a love triangle with a back story but Gilda deals with darker and stronger emotions and the movie is a lot sexier. The love story is also the real story since, again just as in Casablanca, the plot is a little on the weak side - but that doesn't matter at all. The chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford is extremely volatile: love and hate, passion and pain mixed with loyalty, greed and the need to make a living, even if it's not a very reputable living. And it is that chemistry which makes the film so excellent - and Rita Hayworth makes the film explode.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gilda is mostly remembered for the glorious Rita - that first sight of her Gilda rising before us as if surprised in the bath or the bed; her sluttishly boozy dance and its seductive glove; her mocking laugh hiding her vulnerability... but what raises Gilda the movie above many others of its era is the daring, edgy perversity of its dialogue, and the submissive role of the (underrated these days) Glenn Ford throughout. He`s like a whining, irascible puppy trailing after either Gilda or his new boss, Gild`s husband (George Macready). Ford is terrific as a dogged, flawed male (he`s just as fine in The Blackboard Jungle, among such different actors as Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier) with one massive chip on his shoulder. But oh, the dialogue! One example: Macready says to Ford, `I saved your life - I owe you a favour`. Huh? The whole movie`s like that - skewed, awry, perverse. Like a hangover. Or a Casablanca for cynics... until the end. `Take me...` pleads Ford to Gilda, in yet one more reversal of expectations. In those days filmmakers took real risks (listen again to Bogart &amp; Bacall`s ` depends who`s in the saddle` barroom dialogue for the utmost in clothed eroticism, for example) and here - with a director not noted for surprises - Hollywood chemistry brewed up a potent mix of the erotic, the romantic, the bizarre - and Nazis thrown in for good measure. A disgustingly great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "Gilda" is a wonderful film. It's a black and white classic beauty. You can't resist the photography. You let yourself be guided in this love/ hate story, even though it may be a little silly when you think of it. A man - Johnny Farrell - (Glenn Ford) meets a woman, who had already been his, but who now belongs to another man, his best friend. Of course this friendship isn't really real. It's just a way Farrell finds to resist the charms of Gilda as long as he can. This film has changed my way of regarding movies. I saw it for the first time when I was about 12 and ever since I've seen films in a different way. It's really a very good film, almost magic. It isn't the kind of magic you find in "Casablanca" (which is, in my opinion, the perfect example of what cinema is all about). It's something a bit mysterious. The scene of Gilda singing "Put the Blame on Mame" is a perfect climax and one of the best I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Menage a trois as Hayworth sizzles in erotic drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Farrell is a crafty goon hired by casino boss Ballin Mundson to use his muscle around the place to keep it in ship shape, but then his duties move on to another level when Mundson takes a bride in the form of the gorgeous Gilda. Trouble is, Gilda &amp; Johnny have a history that is sure to rear its ugly head, and thus a steady pot boiling menage a trois is formed.It's an odd sort of film because its core fabric is cloaked in sado-masochism and latent homosexuality, a pretty daring combination in the prissy production code time of 1946. Reviews at the time were very divisive, and it took many by surprise when the film became a hit, which was mainly down to servicemen who had lusted for Hayworth during the war. Viewing it today brings about many feelings, but chiefly it's the feeling of hate being as powerful a weapon on the emotional front as love is, and it's that heartbeat that drives the film to its delightful finale.The film boasts a great turn from Rita Hayworth as Gilda, her performance is what holds the film together, whilst Glenn Ford as Farrell is perfectly rugged without overstating the character. The songs and dances fit perfectly to the tone of the film, and director Charles Vidor knows exactly what it takes to steer this film onto safe waters. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gilda" is a story of passion, jealousy, and anger that takes place in Argentina shortly after World War II. It stars Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, and George Maccready. There isn't much to the plot except a lot of heat generated by Hayworth and Ford. "Gilda" seems to be so much window dressing to showcase one of the most electrifying stars of the golden era - and of all time.Without Rita Hayworth in the lead, "Gilda" would be a footnote in film history. With her, it's a classic. She's sexy and gorgeous, with her beautiful face, vixenish smile, luxuriant red hair, magnificent figure, soft voice - and she dances too. Like a dream.Gilda and Ford's character, Johnny, have known each other, loved each other, and hurt each other before Johnny's boss, George Macready, brings her home as his wife. Macready realizes immediately that the two were once involved - it's hard to miss. He runs a casino and has another nefarious scheme going, which unfolds as the film goes along. There are some sinister-looking Germans after him, too. It's all a big mcguffin. Viewers are more concerned with Rita's next outfit, next number, and are she and Ford going to give in to their passion and end up together? Rita's big number is "Put the Blame on Mame," during which she sensually removes her gloves, and announces after the song, "I'm not good with zippers. Maybe if I had some help..." Throughout the movie, she has a habit of tossing her hair back - she's absolutely glorious. A documentary on fashion stated that her "Mame" gown was designed in a certain way because Hayworth had just had a baby. It is strange that in her bare midriff outfit, her tight gown, and her suit that cinched at the waist, there was NO sign of any post-baby bloat.There's no graphic sex or nudity in this but it's hotter than "Basic Instinct" or any one of a dozen films could ever be. Ford and Hayworth, teamed together five times, make a beautiful couple and have a lot of sexual tension. Ford is very handsome and a dependable actor, and "Gilda" made him a star. Hard to believe that he'll be 90 in May 2006.Hollywood had several goddesses in the golden era. Few had both the incredible beauty and raw sex appeal radiated by Hayworth. Ava Gardner comes to mind, possibly Lana Turner. In a brilliant firmament, Hayworth was a blazing star. Although "Gilda" was her greatest film, it ruined her personal life. As she said, "Men fell in love with Gilda and woke up with me."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense Drama With A Striking Performance By Rita Hayworth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the movie as a whole is a good, tense drama with some interesting psychological angles, there's little question that it is Rita Hayworth's striking performance that grabs your eyes and your imagination. As "Gilda", she plays one of the most memorable of all femme fatale roles in cinema. That's nothing against Glenn Ford, George Macready, or the production as a whole, which are all pretty good, just a little overshadowed most of the time.Hayworth's first appearance is that much more effective for being delayed for a time by a careful preliminary development of Ford's and Macready's characters. When Gilda enters their lives, it makes the changes and tensions that much more effective for being able to compare the situations before and after her arrival. The characters are drawn well psychologically, and the casino setting makes a convincing and very appropriate backdrop to their personal dramas.Although in recent years it has become the norm for terms like 'dazzling' and 'sizzling' to be used for even routine performances by attractive actresses, it's been a good while since there's been anything equal to Hayworth's performance here, which combines her physical allure with a character portrayal that has depth and interest in its own right. She is able to create a powerful effect, without anything explicit, simply through the power of suggestiveness. And Gilda's tempting cruelty and alluring coldness also mask a lot more that is going on underneath the surface.Ford is effective as Johnny, making his character disreputable yet interesting, and he works very well with Hayworth. Macready is well cast as the casino owner. Most of the time, the story makes very good use of all of the possibilities, and only a couple of missed opportunities towards the end keep it a notch below the very best films-noir.</fullReview>

There is definately something about Rita Hayworth in this movie. I can't quite put my finger on it..I suppose it's screen presense?

		<fullReview>Film noir with a nasty edge to it is what 'Gilda' is all about. Beneath the sinister dialog and double entendre remarks are some mesmerizing performances by Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford and George McReady, each perfectly in tune to the other's performance. It's the kind of ensemble work that made noirs like 'Casablanca' so memorable. Everyone in the cast seems to know instinctively how to perform this kind of material and it all moves briskly to a stunning climax. Hayworth is at the peak of her pulchritude as a Love Goddess and tosses her hair as casually and easily as the flip dialogue, looking every inch the temptress. Probably her most enjoyable-to-watch role since she played the flirtatious and unobtainable Virginia Brush in 'Strawberry Blonde'. Glenn Ford has to carry much of the film with his sullen, hard-bitten role as her former lover and does it well. Still, it's the kind of role that would have been more exciting if played by someone like Humphrey Bogart. I believe Bogey was offered the part but believed the woman's role was too dominant. Anyway, fans of film noir will be grateful for this one. Rita was never more suited to a voluptuous role than she is here. Her 'Put the Blame on Mame' nightclub routine will always be one of the film's most memorable moments. If you're a Hayworth fan, you may be interested in my article on RITA HAYWORTH that is featured in the March 2002 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES, Issue #319 called RITA HAYWORTH: QUEEN OF COLUMBIA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very strange film noir, with all of the characteristics of that genre; rain slicked alleys, perpetual nightime, and shadows. Gilda is played by Rita Hayworth, and she is beautiful, nasty, and dangerous. As a matter of fact much of this movie has a nasty edge to it that made it a little notorious when it was released.Glenn Ford is an American in Buenos Aires near the end of World War II. Why he is not in uniform, and why he is in Buenos Aires is never addressed. Suffice it to say, he is down on his luck and in the opening sequence we see him gambling at night in a waterfront alley. He scoops up his winnings and is shortly accosted on the wharf by a robber. Mysteriously, George Macready appears, and saves the day with a wicked little walking stick that has a hidden blade that juts out of the end when prompted.This begins a rather strange relationship between Ford and Macready, who happens to own a casino outside of town. Ford goes to work for him and learns the gambling business from the ground up. All is well with the world until Macready shows up after a business trip with the naughty Rita Hayworth as his wife. One soon grasps that she and Ford had a prior, torrid relationship. This now becomes a sort of 3-way relationship and struggle.There is a famous scene when Hayworth belts out "Put the Blame on Mame". She is clad in a clingy, slinky black dress, with black gloves that go up to her elbows. She does a psuedo striptease and it's VERY effective. In actuality all that is removed is one glove..... but wow. "I've never been any good at zippers! but if I had some help!"Glenn Ford spends most of the film sulking. His job is to "look after Gilda" for his boss. In one scene Gilda is dancing with some latin Romeo. At a table sit Macready and Ford..... Macready to Ford: "Go get her" Ford: She's not my w.... she's your wife! Macready: "That's exactly the point. A man always looks a bit ridiculous, don't you think, grabbing his wife from another man's arms" Ford: "Alright".The real treat in this movie is the portrayal by George Macready as the aloof, aristocratic, and mysterious Ballin Mundson. He is very much a shadow, a poised, elegant, and sinister shadow. To Hayworth in a particularly sultry scene as she sprawls across the end of bed, "Hate is a very exciting emotion. I felt it, didn't you? It warmed me.......hate is the only thing that has ever warmed me."This movie is absorbing and rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this Picture (Gilda) in the theater when I was about 14 yrs. old. My uncle was a projectionist and worked all 3 theaters in town. The movie fascinated me. I thought Rita Hayworth was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I never forgot the scene where Glenn Ford slapped her, it looked like really hard. Of all of the black and white pictures I was fortunate to view, this was my favorite. I was saddened by her death of Alzheimers several years ago. It was reported that Glenn Ford lived close to her and helped to take care of her in her last days.It was also reported that they were friends for many years. I have also liked Glenn Ford and felt that his work was always excellent. They were giants in an era of a multitude of wonderful actors!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amado Mio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth is absolutely stunning in this film's three musical performances. I especially liked her Montevideo nightclub routine. Although her voice is dubbed, Hayworth's on-stage presence is spectacular. In a glamorous Jean Louis gown, she dances, and sings "Amado Mio", a number that perfectly matches her flirtatious, sultry personality.Hayworth is the main attraction in this film, which also features some really nice B&amp;W lighting. But that's about it. I found little else of interest in this sordid and dreary post-WWII tale of hate, passion, and betrayal, set mostly in Buenos Aires. Some think of this film as film noir. I don't. Gilda is less femme fatale than tragic prima donna.The story is contrived, and includes a wildly improbable coincidence in the first Act. None of the main characters are really likable. And the film's opening mocks the viewer. If you are going to title a movie with a character's name, have the courtesy to construct that character into the first few minutes of the plot. In "Gilda", Gilda is absent without leave the first eighteen minutes of the film. For me, that kind of manipulation does not build anticipation. It merely irritates and teases.Although I enjoyed Hayworth's musical performances in "Gilda", I much prefer the story and plot of a more recent, but less well-known, Hayworth film: "Miss Sadie Thompson" (1953), wherein she sings, and dances up a storm with Aldo Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put the blame on Rita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It does not seem to matter how many times one sees "Gilda", the beauty of Rita Hayworth in this, clearly up there with her best films, is quite spectacular. It proves inconclusively that she did not need the lush Technicolor process to show her at her very best. Probably this movie could really be classed as a B originally as it was an early feature of Columbia which in 1946 was on the 2nd line of Major Studios, but it turned out to be a huge success, and really got the career of Glenn Ford going. Classed as Film-Noir, it certainly was intriguing and the ominous presence of George MacReady as the villain added a great deal to the suspense. Rita miming "Put the Blame on Mame" is certainly a highlight of the movie, and almost worth the admission price alone. Later teamings of Hayworth and Ford did not work out nearly as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Love With Gilda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth said that, every man she ever met fell in love with Gilda .. Watch this movie, and it's not hard to understand why. Ms. Hayworth can add one more to a long list of admirers. Gilda is a tremendously complex character, unlike Farrell and Mundson, who are transparent. We're never really told why Farrell walked out on Gilda. Given his later behavior, we might believe he thought she was unfaithful. The list of Gilda's not-so-admirable qualities is quite long. She is an ingenuous flirt, either not knowing, or not caring the effect her flirtations have on men. See above regarding why Johnny might have walked out.She is not a woman you want to cross, because she is determined to get even. She's a big tease, spending large portions of this movie trying to make Farrell .. and by extension, the audience ..jealous. These are the best parts of this movie, in my opinion. She can be heartlessly cruel. The entire scene where she echoes to Farrell what Mundson told her about the power of hatred is achingly poignant. Johnny Farrell is a small, bad-tempered, cynical, mean-spirited low life, who has in some inexplicable fashion captured Gilda's heart. But, knowing that, you feel for him in this moment. Gilda's words cut like a razor. Yet, for all that, she elicits our sympathy. She is really just a girl in love, who doesn't understand .. anymore than we do .. why her lover is so cruel to her. She's a victim of circumstances and other people's bad judgments. She understands her relationships with Farrell and Mundson very differently than they do, and her understanding is the one that is ultimately determined to be closer to the truth. The allure of Rita Hayworth has been better commented upon by others, but I have to say just a word. Gilda is a film that paradoxically makes the viewer yearn for a standards and practices division. Think about how sexually charged the ambience of this movie is in every scene where Hayworth appears .. and she did it all with .. a hair flip, those pouty, kissable lips, and a "demure" striptease, as some have called it. Not the word I would have chosen. Marilyn Monroe has given us onscreen moments like this. There are strong similiarities between Gilda and her character in the Seven Year Itch, but no other actress of the last fifty years has come close to the captivating, artless, sincerity and appeal of Gilda. We know in a moment why Farrell fell for her; what we never understand is what she sees in him. This film would be a better representative of film noir with a different ending. I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the picture. I'll just say their sudden epiphany doesn't ring true. I would have preferred seeing Gilda walk slowly away from Johnny, as Obregon puts the cuffs on him, but .. no-o-o. I've heard film noir defined as bad people doing bad things to each other in the city, in the dark, in the rain. This movie fits that description almost perfectly.. until the last ten minutes. A closing word on Rita. They say her career and popularity were downhill after this film, although she worked scrupulously .. with timeout for an ill-fated marriage to Aly Khan .. at trying to recapture them. Like former spouse, Orson Welles, she'd given her best performance before she was thirty, and yet lived almost four decades looking back to that moment. She might have felt sad and frustrated at that circumstance. But, what a moment! Few rise to such heights, and fewer still rise higher. Who can be disappointed finally by such a legacy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorching - As In Hot!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film I ever saw starring Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, this 40s noir gem is just too hot and steamy for words!! Sure, the Production Code at the time prohibited any graphic or blatant sexual references, but the performances and innuendo more than make up for it.The rich black and white cinematography, wonderfully constructed sets, and Rita's dance numbers, as if that's not enough to take one's breath away. The strong, sensual heat generated between Hayworth and Ford is guaranteed to make you very hot beneath your collar. Was there ever a better portrayal of a sizzling love/hate entanglement?There is a hinted homosexual undertone in the relationship between sinister casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) and his right-hand, Johnny Farrell (Ford), but as soon as Ballin's provocative new wife, Gilda (Hayworth) arrives on the scene, that pretty much goes out the window. The priceless expression on Johnny's face when he discovers that Mundson's bride and his ex-lover are one and the same (amid the famous hair-toss), is a moment that just cannot be beat. Ballin becomes all the more evil and controlling, at first only to Gilda (sensing that she and Johnny knew each other before), but then his bizarre business dealings and plans begin to unravel, leading to a great plot-twist.Gilda succeeds in arousing Johnny's jealousy through her flirtations with other men, while he tries to keep her supposedly "indecent" behavior from the boss. As much as he claims to despise her, it is obvious that neither one have gotten over the hurt of their "past association". When Johnny has the opportunity to punish her for what he believes to be her sinful behavior, the sparks between them go up another notch. Those slaps that they inflict on each other (love hurts!), and of course, Hayworth's famous "Put The Blame On Mame" mock striptease (dubbed by Anita Ellis) - that one will linger in your head for a long, long time. And that silky black dress - I think I speak for all of the viewing females when I say, I want that dress!!!With its subtly suggestive dialogue, magnificent performances and the gorgeous stars (who were close lifelong confidantes), "Gilda" is definitely deserving of its place in cinematic history.It would be nice to see "Affair In Trinidad" (1952) and "The Lady In Question" (1940), both of which paired Hayworth and Ford to have DVD releases. There's just not enough of their powerful chemistry to go around!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth exudes it all in eye-popping dresses and a strip-tease removing a pair of gloves that has to be seen to be believed. The story is wonderful in the first 3/4 of the movie, full of innuendo -i.e. did the Johnny character played by Glenn Ford have an intimate relationship with Ballin played by George Macready? It certainly appears that way so macho-male star Glenn Ford playing a bisexual is one for the books."Gilda" is a suggestive and enthralling melodrama with riveting Rita performing "Put the Blame on Mame, boys" worth the price of admission alone. The final 1/4 of the movie leaves a lot to be desired, it seems to run out of all that sex and steam and morphs into an incredibly hokey Hollywood ending. Very disappointing so I only gave it a 7 out of 10. But Rita and Glenn are soooooooo damn watchable and make current supposedly sexy films look decidedly limp by comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Got me on my knees, Gilda'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my absolute favourite films ever, 'Gilda' is scorchingly hot. That description can be applied to the title character played by the divine Rita Hayworth, who turns in a great acting performance. Her chemistry and love-hate relationship with Glenn Ford is at the centrepiece of this multilayered, entertaining film-noir.Ford's drifter character Johnny Farrell provides the voice-over to the film, and it is through his eyes that we view the action. Johnny is a gambler by trade, but down on his luck at the moment. The crippled Buenos Aires casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready)saves Johnny's life in a dark alleyway with his ever-present cane that hides a lethal dagger ('a most faithful, obedient friend'). The homosexual subtext of Gilda is introduced in Jonny's first fateful encounter with Mundson. The sexual tension between the two is obvious, as Johnny talks his way into being hired at Ballin's casino. He rises through the ranks quickly and becomes Mundson's right-hand man and confidante. Life is happy for the 'three of them' (the third friend being the ever-present cane)until Ballin takes a business trip and comes back with a wife. Gilda.We first meet Gilda in Ballin's bedroom suite. The strains of 'Put The Blame On Mame' are heard on the phonograph, as Hayworth makes one of the most memorable entrances in film history. The seductive, flirtatious yet ultimately lovable Gilda is a figure from Johnny's past that he is trying desperately to forget. Their connection and attraction is revealed later in the film. Boy, do Hayworth and Ford turn the heat up in this film! The love-hate relationship between Gilda and Johnny is a flame-filled fiasco, heightened by Johnny's loyalty to his boss and Gilda's husband Mundson. Gilda's antics with other men are all show to make Johnny jealous, but the 'cock-eyed' Farrell can only see that Gilda may hurt Ballin (the homosexual element is again paramount here) so his solution is to hurt her. Mundson is secretly involved in a complicated tungsten plot, and he fakes his own suicide half-way through the film. Johnny marries Gilda to punish her for her assumed betrayals of Mundson, and puts this glittering, bejewelled exotic bird in a cage. Gilda loves Johnny, yet he is an unresponsive husband filled with jealous rage towards his free-willed, sexually uninhibited wife. The misogynistic element of the film is pronounced in Johnny's treatment of Gilda and women in general. Gilda tires of her trapped situation soon enough and rebels by taking out various men. Again, it's just show but Johnny doesn't know that and is too stubborn to care. Instead he hires a man to keep Gilda on a leash. She breaks free and runs off to Montevideo and starts divorce proceedings, meeting a new man who happens to be another one of Johnny's 'hired help'. In one of the cruelest acts possible, Gilda is tricked into going back to Buenos Aires and back to Johnny. Hayworth's screams and cries to Johnny to 'let her go' are fruitless and she reacts the only way she knows how. She sings THAT song in THAT dress. 'Put The Blame On Mame'.It's the most memorable scene from the film, and Gilda's cry for help and/or sympathy is highlighted in the lyrics of 'Mame', about a woman who is often unfairly blamed by men. Gilda's life story, so it seems. The bawdy, sexual striptease (not really a striptease, as Rita only removes her long black gloves!) provoked outrage from the censors in the 40's, and it provokes outrage from Ford, too. It is the only way Gilda can react, and she wants to publicly embarrass and shame Johnny. It is too late for Johnny to realise how blind he has been and for Gilda to clean up her act for this obsessed pair to be together? Wait and see.Rita's sultry performance is often remarked upon because of THAT song and her stunning looks. However, her acting is excellent in this film. She definitely deserved an Oscar nomination (Why oh why did she not get one?)for her role, along with Ford. The heat these two generate is awesome in it's power, and the love scenes are strikingly modern in contrast to many contemporary films. These two adored each other in real-life, so it must have been hard for them both when the script called for Rita to hit Glenn and vice versa. Rita was nothing like Gilda in real-life, she was a very shy, unassuming woman so it is testament to Rita's talent as an actress that she could create such a character as Gilda. Gilda is seductive yet sympathetic; women should really hate her, but can we really blame this girl who is so unfairly treated by men? For these reasons, I believe Gilda is NOT a femme fatale. Macready is very, very good as the crippled villain this noir has to have. He has a creepy presence, adding to the dark atmosphere of 'Gilda'. The whole film is foreboding, tense and thrilling! The final 10 minutes had me chewing my fingernails with expectation. Most of all, you'll remember Hayworth and Ford and that juicy dialogue:Gilda: Didn't you hear about me, Gabe? If I'd been a ranch, they would've named me the Bar Nothing. Gilda: do hate me, don't you, Johnny? Johnny: I don't think you have any idea how much. Gilda: Hate is a very exciting emotion. Haven't you noticed? Very exciting. I hate you too, Johnny. I hate you so much, I think I'm gonna die from it. Darling. I think I'm gonna die from it.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once she enters, the plotting goes downhill...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While cleaning up on the docks of Buenos Aires, crooked American gambler Glenn Ford is spotted by an imposingly cool casino owner and is eventually brought aboard as his co-manager. Story of the high roller and the low roller begins with great promise, and the tactful yet touchy relationship between the men is intriguing, yet when the casino czar's lady enters--tossing her hair around like an overheated wildcat--the narrative loses its drive and becomes a drudge, with Ford playing bodyguard, lover, and eventually rebuffed husband. The most curious thing about this popular melodrama is that Rita Hayworth herself considered the character of Gilda Mundson her most iconic role--odd since Gilda is little more than a brittle tease, trivial to men and used as a prop. Gilda is the most shallow aspect of the film itself, and when she spoils the closeness between the two men, one can almost feel everything on-screen dissipate. Too bad...the ingredients were here for a tough little crime flick, though perhaps the film was too far ahead of its time and had to be cleaned up for the sake of 1940s morality. The final results are pure soap. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Modern Tarantinos strive to pile up all sorts of historical film-world mechanisms on their films. But nothing beats going back to some of the dumptruck films of the past and reveling in the real thing.Here, we have a story that - except for the oddly imposed ending - is a dark as they come: and not pleasantly so. Everything is played straight, no irony colors this amazing depressing visit to the dark side. And it is not just the dark jealousy, it reaches all the way into the guilt many Americans felt after the war. A few were heros, but many were opportunists or slackers and that survivor guilt was pretty strong for a while. That opening shot of us rising from the depths in response to a dice roll is classic.Quite independent of that, we have corners of this film that are reserved for star-making episodes for Ms Hayworth. This is my best example of beauty created by lighting and motion. Look closely and you will see a plain face and a dumpy torso. With this raw material, she and her mentor were able to create film glamour made rich by the fantasies of remote servicemen.This woman has a remarkable control over her body and sets some new film motions to dramatically indicate poise, now widely used as if they were there all along. All this is focused on her forehead. Most actors act with only one part of their body and in this case it is that extended forehead. During this period, she was married to Orson Welles, probably the one man in the world who knew the most about this sort of thing. He coached her on this, and it shows. Watch what he had her do next in `Lady from Shanghai.'And finally we get the guild part: the machinery that turned out B-movies. This wasn't really a B-movie, but it had all the same sensibilities. In this case, much of what we see is a result of that engine just doing its thing. There are a couple very subtle lighting effects in unlikely places, for example the slats on her dress as she visits Ford at the casino after they were married.The whole thing gives the impression of a studio system and all its gears and pulleys a little out of control. That metaphor of casino and monopoly is pretty apt.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put the blame on Mame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Farrell, a New York gambler, is seen as the opening of the film playing on the waterfront in Buenos Aires with some shady characters. He is a lucky man who makes the mistake of stopping to count his money, something that if he had listened to that song, "The Gambler", he never would have done. When someone appears with a gun to mug him, he is saved by the eerily handsome Ballin Mundson, a man who sees possibilities in the younger man.Johnny, who has been invited to visit Mundson's casino, pays a visit and again, he is lucky playing blackjack, but the boss suspects the gambler is cheating. After calling him to the office, Mundson agrees to employ Johnny, who will be working for him in protecting his interests. Johnny notices a few odd things that don't sit well with him. When he questions Mundson about it, the explanation doesn't satisfy him, but he plays along. It has been hinted about a homosexual context between Mundson and Johnny. Mundson gives the impression that he likes Johnny a bit too much and Johnny, in appearing grateful for his employment at the casino, also rises the question about an under current between them.When Mundson returns with a new wife, surprising Johnny, it turns out he had known, and perhaps loved, Gilda in New York. Gilda has a mean disposition toward Johnny and does everything possible to get him in trouble. Their repartee gives the film an edge because it's clear that whatever they had is still going on. Gilda wants to have fun at whatever expense, but Johnny is always a step ahead of her in foiling whatever attempts she makes with every new man to enjoy herself.After a tragic air accident where Mundson dies, Gilda marries Johnny, but they grow apart. She flees to Montevideo where she embarks in a career as a singer and dancer. We see her doing two numbers that are show stoppers, "Amado Mio", and "Put the Blame on Mame". She is tricked back to Buenos Aires where Johnny is awaiting for her, but fate has it that the Buenos Aires experience has been bad for both of them and the next best thing is to go back home, as a couple.Charles Vidor directed with sure hand a story that, at times, doesn't make much sense. The story was adapted for the screen by Jo Eisinger. The plot, also, reminds us about "Casablanca" in that both Johnny and Gilda are in a foreign land far from their native turf and are at the mercy of a man who is rich and powerful to make them pay for their betrayal. Supposedly, Humphrey Bogart was the choice for playing Johnny, but it would have been a different film altogether than the one that Charles Vidor made.Rita Hayworth is billed over the title. She was at the height of her career in Hollywood. She was a beautiful woman with such magnetism to get any man's attention by just being there. Ms. Hayworth is helped enormously by Jean Louis' wardrobe. Especially effective the gown she wears to sing "Put the Blame on Mame". That number will remain the hallmark of her work. Glenn Ford, on the other hand, is a bit unsure in some key moments, especially during the masked ball. George McCready is perfect as the villainous Ballin Mundson. Steven Geray also makes a valuable contribution as the bathroom attendant who calls Johnny a peasant.The copy of "Gilda" we watched on TCM recently has been lovingly restored to a crisp black and white originally shot by Rudolph Mate, its cinematographer. Doris Fisher's songs are perfect and serve as a delightful distraction for showing a playful Rita Hayworth doing justice to both numbers. King Vidor's direction elevated the film to a higher status. This movie, even sixty years later, still has a great look and it's a joy to watch after a few prior viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GILDA is a film about an elusive, mysterious and provocative characters who by their actions at the end confusing every spectator. A well conceived story definitely has drawbacks, responsible acting and great atmosphere are certainly positive elements of the film. Of course, most attention attracted the main female character. The lady, who suddenly appears in the form of beautiful Rita Hayworth and becomes a woman of strict casino owner. The first associate of her husband is her ex-boyfriend. On the relationship between the two of them do not know almost nothing, and he is thematically the most processed. I stop right there.The relationship between the two people in everyday life used to be does not need and do not need to explain. The film is something else entirely.I am told that story well conceived. However, a strange love story at the casino, which is a front Nazi cartel, do not believe that someone would swallow at first.Rita Hayworth as Gilda Mundson Farrell, perhaps the first time in a serious role. Not bad. Her beauty, sex appeal and versatility come to the fore. She is glamorous and talented woman who is not that good an actress. Being strict and somewhat stuck (in the lead actress of course, at first glance) critic is not desirable. I'm kidding, of course.Glenn Ford as Johnny Farrell is durable, stable and standoffish character. The scenario at the end of the film damaged his role. Acting is more than competent. Chemistry between the two main actors, is difficult to explain. Emotion is present and strong. In Rita's character is seen and desired changes. Finally they were not seen at the same level.The film is not bad, occasionally stirring. Characterization and story have drawbacks. Interactively merge strange love-hate. I hate that I love you. I love you and hate you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth simply sizzles as Gilda, a role apparently written especially for her. She simply dominates every scene she's in and sparks fly with every word she utters. It's the role that came to define her in a way that she reputedly hated; as referred to by Julia Roberts in Notting Hill.It's a shame that otherwise the film is overwrought and unbelievable. Gilda's relationship with Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) exceeds plausibility. Ford is burdened with the task of trying to make the behaviour of his character believable, and it's too tall an order. Blame the script, not the actor. It's a shame that Rita Hayworth's magnificent turn isn't matched by the rest of the film.If it's sizzle and sparks you want, you'll enjoy it. If it's believability, wait until you're in a different mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of the movie, one main thought struck to the mind among many others; the power of jealousy which makes Johnny hate Gilda and Gilda hate Johnny even though they share immense love.Gilda seems like a strong woman with an overwhelming charm showing everyone that she does not have much emotions and she has married a man she does not love for his wealth. We in fact discover that she has a weakness when she is confronted to her feelings for Johnny, her ex-partner.Johnny at the start of the movie captivates the spectator with his smartness and sharpness in the way he acts and talks.But is puzzled and his facial expression is changed at the arrival of Gilda, he is separated between his loyalty for Ballin who has made him his partner and the revival of his feelings for Gilda.A great addition to my favorite black and white movies,I will give score this movie an 8 not higher than that maybe because the previous one was "Grapes of wrath". :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought "Gilda" was fascinating, and I'm glad I finally caught it. I like Film Noir and this was a good one, but I had some reservations. The plot was good and centers on the three principals in as tense a menage a trois as you will find on the screen. They tread a fine line between mutual jealousy and hatred and almost all of it centered around Rita Hayworth, who is breathtakingly beautiful in this movie. Having said that...I thought the three principals were presented as neurotic bordering on psychopathic as they try to one-up each other in incivility, glowering at one another and hurling veiled insults. The script fairly crackles with nearly-overdone noir dialogue, as snappy repartee and epigrammatic one-liners abound giving several scenes an artificial feel. The storyline reveals itself as the movie goes along, giving a little away at intervals until by the end of the picture it all comes together, which I thought was very effective storytelling. Some reviewers objected to the ending, which I didn't mind so much given all that had taken place up to that point. I just thought it added another surreal touch, in a movie that may be as far from reality as a movie can get.Still, if you are a noir fan or just a movie fan, "Gilda" is not to be missed. It is not in a class with "Out Of The Past", perhaps the best of the noir genre, but is an example of what studio heads would consider superior noir. But studio heads are not earthbound like the rest of us.</fullReview>

GILDA seems to have set the standards at that time for a very high level of unspoken sexuality that the movie censors overlooked. From the first time we see Rita as GILDA, we fall, and we fall hard. We never make it out until the final moment of the movie.The scene where Rita Hayworth in getting dressed for a Carnival (long "L")celebration in her room, with her maid, could make any person with a pulse get quite...well...ruffled. The scene fade/dissolves into a shot of her shoeless foot, straight in the air, sheer black stockings being tightened against her foot. She prances around the room like only RITA HAYWORTH could do...and her sheer top, expertly lit from all sides, fully shows her perfectly shaped breasts. Scary. Makes me freak out on all levels...photographically, sensually /sexually, giving me a new appreciation for white, sheer crinoline fabric. Me? A VOYEUR? Pervert?Maybe, but I didn't make the film. See "intention" under AUTEUR. lol.Then the scene with Johnny, they are in HIS bedroom, ( not good: she is married to his boss) she is wearing a somewhat Fuzzy Teddy,a full body jumper with one big zipper down the front, just one zipper tooth away from a naked RITA HAYWORTH. OUCH.The entire film is centered on her FEMME FATALE being, of course, the darkened and dangerous woman, all twisted up inside, hell bent on taking everyone down the boo hoo path with her. Her body, her hair, her face...everything perfect. Except for the mind. Her Johnny, played by Glen Ford, eventually makes good, in a big way. (See the movie.)Oh yes, the lip-sync singing and guitar playing...we DO believe...we WANT to believe that she sings and plays those songs. SHE DOES EVERYTHING ELSE in the film with serious artistic success...so, we want to believe that RITA is singing directly to us, individually. Swooning alert. The camera and the lighting and the mise-en-scene in this foundational (is that a word?) film noir movie all LOVE our RITA, our Rita Hayworth.I can only imagine how millions of repressed teenagers and soldiers overseas reacted to RITA HAYWORTH upon first glance, say, in GILDA. When she is brushing her hair and lifts her head to reveal a most beautiful face and figure...Like the men in her films, the public, her now eternal audience, is magnetized, drawn in. We're taken for a ride by GILDA, a dark ride, in the back of a cab, in a gilded cage, in the shadowed back corners of our minds, but it's worth it. Being bad is good... and every silver lining has a dark cloud. And thankfully, vice-verse.The film noir classic GILDA shines like well-cut, stolen diamonds. Diamonds mined from other people's misfortune, but very shiny and pretty, none the less. RITA HAYWORTH glistens like no other, and forms a solid cinema icon in the perfect direction and cinematography, and of course, by RITA's perfectly executed role of GILDA. ee ithaca ny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An iconic film with an intrinsic beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoping not to get banned from further reviews by IMDb for advising any reviewer of this film to first have a tall stiff drink.I have imagined a dozen scenarios where, in typical Hollywood fashion, the studio heads are contemplating what to follow Cover Girl with, knowing that every woman in America now hates Ms. Hayworth, with the men gone overseas and her picture as a Pin-Up girl on every bombardier. Perhaps a call from Orson Welles with a timely B script using a hot young stud to draw in a female heavy public? And it wouldn't make him a bit jealous. If there are some actresses who were born to be in front of a camera, Ms. Hayworth made the camera to be born in front of her. I can only imagine the sweat pouring down its sides, and Rudolph Maté wiping it down with a cool rag; for the camera clearly adored her, her exquisite beauty, her sexuality, her sarcasm. She was ethereal, riveting; she could blow a kiss and it would float out of the film into the air. Troubled, no doubt drinking heavily, uppers, contribute to her biting undertone; it's as if she's screaming to escape from her own skin. But such a beautiful skin!I think today we can see better the homo-eroticism, the sadism and masochism, the degrading of women, then could be seen at the time. Much of this smells like Welles to me, since the producer was a champion of women's rights, who could hardly be expected to condone the treatment of this woman.I say that there has never been, before or since, a more intrinsically beautiful, pornographic (in the Joyce sense) portrait of a woman than Rita Hayworth in this film, except perhaps a Moreau or Bergman. And the off-the shoulder, but down to the ankles gowns only add to that remark. She seems so confident and happy singing Mame, yet a bit sad and bitter doing Amado Mio. I find it hard to believe this was what the film demanded, I believe it was real. The opening scene where Glenn Ford is walking down a dark alley to be confronted by a thug, and is rescued by a strikingly erudite gentleman pointing a walking stick, when a blade pops out on its end, only sets the tone for the menage-a-trois to follow. I find it highly suggestive and unusual for the time.All in all it is a film icon, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GILDA was a nice yarn about a love triangle set in Argentina. Rita Hayworth (Margarita Cansino) as Gilda along with Glenn Ford as Johnny Farrell gave a lot of life to this picture. George Macready was also excellent as Ballin Mundson. This was a movie that held my interest throughout, I did not once check to see how much time was left, even when Gilda was off-screen. Without getting into spoilers, I'll just say that Rita Hayworth might just be the quintessential Hollywood bombshell, and she was so honored as 'Gilda' was scrawled on the hull of a test A-Bomb in 1946. Just check out her entrance about 17 minutes into the movie, and you may want to put on a flame retardant suit first just so she doesn't melt you at first sight. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>522nd Review: 75 Years On - Still One Of The Greatest Movies Of Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilda is simply sensational - for this reviewer there are few films that are worth viewing every couple of years that will hold the attention every time - Gilda does. Hayworth has always been one of my favourite actresses - not just the smoulder, which everyone thinks of, but the versatility from light comedy in Cover Girl with Gene Kelly or Tonight and Every Night with Fred Astaire to those darker roles in Salome etc; she really was simply one the great stars.Gilda was the film that shot her from comedienne and great hoofer to sex symbol. Compared to the other women in her stratosphere she brings something different: a calm vulnerability mixed with ice-cold passion that is both intriguing to watch for its lack of melodrama and even when the genre of Film Noir demands either pathos or worse bathos, she aims instead to give us something more meaningful - and a lot more subtle.Gilda's plot is classic film noir - gambling, forlorn love, dark and dangerous, all in the exotic location of Buenos Ares and the great juxtaposition of villains who talk very lightly but carry big sticks. On top of this is a beautiful script by E A Ellington with real acting chops from Glenn Ford, George McCready the rest of the cast. On top of all that and in no small way the whole film is bought together by superb direction by Charles Vidor - it is simply one of the most beautiful B &amp; W films.Everyone remembers Hayworth's dances in this; but for this reviewer it's the total film that makes this work. Simply, excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rita Hayworth at her best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one talks about "hot," as in pure sexual, then one must be referring to Rita Hayworth's performance in this movie. She is HOT! This entire movie revolves around her and her character. Even Glenn Ford cannot match Ms. Hayworth's presence on the screen. As a leading lady, she is the total package. And in addition, she can act. Nothing about this movie is corny, hokey or dated. The dialogue is snappy, the plot engrossing and the cinematography catches the mood of the story. There chemistry between Ms. Hayworth and Glenn Ford is intense and immediately apparent. The supporting cast is wonderful and all deliver outstanding performances, especially George Macready whose performance should have earned him accolades. Yet, the success of this movie boils down to the presence of Rita Hayworth. The final scenes showing her in the Jean Louis dress are sensational. This is a great movie and is certainly well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They go to bed with Gilda; they wake up with me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most American films noirs are set in American cities, often Los Angeles, but film-makers occasionally plumped for somewhere more exotic, as in "Macao", set in the city of that name or Hitchcock's "Notorious", set in Brazil. "Gilda" is another example; although the three main characters are all American, the action takes place in Buenos Aires. Ostensibly, at least. In reality the film was shot in a Hollywood studio; in the forties travel to foreign locations was a luxury the film industry could rarely afford, and even if the studio could have afforded it, political considerations would have made location shooting inadvisable. (The revolution of October 1945 which brought Juan Peron to power occurred while filming was taking place, and I doubt if an Argentine government of any complexion would have welcomed the picture painted of their country as a corrupt haven for Nazi fugitives).As is common in film noir, the plot is a complicated one, but it centres upon the relationships between Ballin Mundson, the owner of a casino (illegal under Argentine law, but tolerated by the authorities), his assistant and confidant Johnny Farrell and Mundson's beautiful young wife Gilda. (Opera buffs with memories of "Rigoletto" should be aware that here the name is pronounced with a hard "G"). It becomes apparent that Johnny and Gilda already know one another and that at some time in the past they were lovers. We also learn that the casino is only part of Mundson's activities and that his main source of income is his involvement with a tungsten cartel (also illegal) set up by pro-Nazi German businessmen.The best films noirs were generally more than just crime dramas. Many were also psychological case studies, although not many of them were quite as psychologically complex as "Gilda". The relationship between Mundson, Johnny and Gilda is not so much a love triangle as a love-hate triangle. There are no flashbacks and we never learn the full details of the affair between Gilda and Johnny, but it is quite clear that their relationship ended badly and that each blames the other for their break-up. Yet although they often treat each other spitefully or contemptuously, it is also clear that, on a subconscious level at least, they are still attracted to one another.While Gilda does not hate Mundson in the way she hates Johnny, there is also no great warmth in their relationship, and he suspects her of infidelity. The strangest side of the triangle, however, is the relationship between Mundson (by far the older of the two) and Johnny, a relationship which seems to go beyond mere friendship and to stray into the territory of love. In 1946, of course, the Production Code was still in force, and any direct reference to homosexuality would have been forbidden, but "Gilda" strikes me as being one of a number of films from the forties and fifties with a hidden gay subtext. (Other examples include Max Ophuls's "Caught" and some of Hitchcock's films, including "Rope" and "Strangers on a Train").Was Rita Hayworth the most beautiful actress of the forties? Possibly not- there was a lot of competition for that particular title, and had a "Miss Hollywood" beauty contest ever been held Rita would have had to compete with the likes of Gene Tierney, Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner and Ingrid Bergman. Prior to "Gilda" she had often played innocent, girl-next-door types in films like "Cover Girl" (also directed by Charles Vidor), but here she shows another side to her talents, revealing herself probably the most seductive femme fatale of the period, particularly in the dance numbers. Modern actresses might equate seductiveness with nudity, but Rita was able to generate an erotic charge without ever taking her clothes off. It is not merely a sexy performance, moreover, but also a technically accomplished one in a role which demands a great emotional range. More than any of her other films, this is the one which most defined her career. (It was also to prove something of a mixed blessing; it brought her fame, but also brought her an unwanted reputation as a sultry temptress. Commenting on her own rather tangled private life, she is alleged to have said "They go to bed with Gilda; they wake up with me".) The two male leads, Glenn Ford and George Macready, are also very good. Johnny is the sort of role which Ford excelled in playing- the ordinary man who, though a twist of fate, finds himself in an extraordinary situation. Macready's Mundson is in many ways the villain of the film, but his performance hints that there is perhaps more to his character than mere villainy, something also indicated by his ability to inspire loyalty in others such as Johnny. Another important contribution comes from Steven Geray as the washroom attendant Uncle Pio. At first Pio seems like mere comic relief, but he will play an important part in the story's denouement.Unusually for film noir, this is one which ends relatively happily, at least for Gilda and Johnny, but it shares may of the genre's other characteristics, such as striking black-and-white photography and a brooding sense of moral corruption. There is probably not space in this review to do justice to all its complexities- it is one of those films which definitely repays watching more than once- but I would rank it as one of the greatest of all films noirs. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Never Was A Woman Like Gilda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I learned of the film,Gilda when I saw The Shawshank Redemption.I finally checked the movie out and I was completely impressed.No wonder it was the favorite movie of the prisoners at Shawshank and Andy Dufresne would request a poster of her in his prison cell.Gilda is a film noir directed by Charles Vidor.It stars Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth in her signature role as the ultimate femme fatale.Of course,who could forget Rita Hayworth's glorious entrance when she shook her head with her black hair going through the air then walks with her cigarette and says,"So this is Johnny Farrell?I have heard a lot about you,Johnny".It was simply magical and appealing.It makes her the ultimate sex symbol of the 1940's.Indeed,when the character Red says to Andy,"This is the part I really like is when she does that sh*t with her hair." - you better believe it. The film's plot is continually narrated by Johnny Farrell(Glenn Ford),a small-time American gambler newly arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina.When wealthy Ballin Mundson rescues down at his heels Johnny Farrell and invites him to the Buenos Aires casino he owns, both men get more than they wagered on. Farrell convinces Mundson to hire him as casino manager, but is shocked when Mundson introduces his new bride, and Farrell's old flame, Gilda.Though Farrell is unwavering in his loyalty to his employer, and he and Gilda treat each other with contempt, Mundson realizes that the torch never died for either of the former lovers. Ordered to guard Gilda, Farrell tries to convince himself that he's protecting Mundson's interests, but Gilda sees through his self-deception. Meanwhile,Mundson reveals to Farrell that his primary business is control of an international tungsten cartel that he plans to use to further his fascist ends. With the police closing in on the cartel, Mundson fakes his death, apparently leaving Gilda and Farrell free to marry. They do so: Gilda for love, but Farrell to punish her for being unfaithful to Mundson.When Mundson returns to kill them, it is he who dies, thereby freeing the lovers to apologize to each other and return to the U.S. Gilda was such a great and classic film and too modern for the 40's.Charles Vidor engages the viewer in a complex web of sado- masochistic triangles.I think that the movie laid foundation to the complex film noirs in Hollywood in the years to come. The performances of the cast were great.Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford have shown excellent chemistry as lovers on screen. (Weren't they lovers off screen as well?)Ford became a movie star.As for Hayworth,there is no doubt that her appeal and sexy portrayal of Gilda is one hell of a guilty pleasure not only in the 40's but up to the present. As they say,"There never was a woman like Gilda!" - a woman portrayed by Rita Hayworth who made man drooled over her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The real lowdown"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First rate entertainment superbly directed by Charles Vidor. If you really want to be critical then you can break it down quite easily. This is, after all, a film whose entire premise rests on the coincidence that a criminal casino boss saves a stranger from being mugged and takes him on board as a junior partner... only to find the stranger once had a relationship with his new wife. It's an event that's almost as improbable as the amount of times the word "Johnny" appears in this movie.In terms of tone then it's often uneven... a noirish voice-over by the stranger (Glenn Ford's Johnny Farrell) comes and goes, disappearing almost entirely for the middle section where the sharp dialogue suddenly becomes so multi-entendre'd it's like watching a Carry On movie through a prism. There are nefarious goings on and some slightly underdeveloped support characters in a film that always has a faint whiff of "wanting to be Casablanca". Sometimes it's an intriguing and layered exploration between two men... then it becomes an extreme love-hate romance movie with song and dance numbers. In many senses this last description is Gilda all over... a film that wants to be all things to all audiences. And, in the final analysis, just about manages it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick is quite fun, even with the intentionally stilted acting of the film noir of the time.A question: The delightfully decadent voice of Gilda -- was that Rita doing her own singing, or was the voice someone else's? If the latter, whose? A comment: The dance moves of Rita Hayworth were well choreographed, but it would seem that either she or the dresses were not that flexible. I do see in her bio that dancing was a first art of hers.A suggestion: If you like the sultry 'Amado Mio' (aka Amando Mio) and other such Cuban/South American fusion music, it is performed extraordinarily well these days by China Forbes with sparkling accompaniment in the Pink Martini group of Portland Oregon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story follows Johnny Farrel (Glenn Ford) as he works his way up to manager of Ballin Mundson's (George Macready) illegal gambling club. One day Munsden returns from a trip with a wife - Gilda (Rita Hayworth) - and Johnny is given the job of keeping an eye on her. What Ballin does not realize is that Johnny and Gilda already know each other. They have been lovers in the past and Gilda's permissive behaviour caused Johnny to leave her. She flaunts herself with other men infront of Johnny who takes it upon himself to ensure that Ballin never finds out about her philanderings. God knows why. However, she is doing this on purpose to get back at Johnny. Ballin discovers that they have feelings for each other and he doesn't like it.....The main focus of the film plays out as a story about relationships.....yet there is a plot that involves a business Cartel and Nazis. We don't focus too much on this aspect and so the viewer has to work out what is happening which can be confusing and at times, you are left thinking "what is this film actually about and where is it going?" The cast are good and there are some memorable parts to the film, eg, the mugging sequence, Gilda's first entrance, Ballin and his cane that turns into a knife, Gilda performing "Put the Blame on Mame" twice, etc. The film also has great sets and one of Gilda's jackets has excellent sparkle value. Against this, though, we have an overlong film which can come across as complicated and directionless at various points. It also contains some stupid names - Gilda and Ballin - what on earth is that about? It would also be useful to know if Gilda deliberately plotted to re-unite herself with Johnny. If the meeting is by chance, then it's all rather unbelievable. I also expected a certain character to die - it didn't happen - a very convenient ending. It's an enjoyable film about Gilda and men - the plot is there incidentally. It's not too complicated to follow but the main focus of this film is Rita Hayworth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If she had been a ranch, her name would have been the "Bar Nothing."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently bought my copy of the 5 DVD set featuring Kim Novak, and one of the movies is "Pal Joey." A key character in that movie is played by Rita Hayworth. She was popular during the time right before and right after I was born, the 1940s and early 1950s, so I never has seen any of her movies until now. I know she was a big star so I am now viewing several of her movies to experience what it was all about.Also, one of my favorite movies is "Notting Hill" and in a scene in that movie Julia Roberts makes a reference to a quote attributed to Hayworth, that "all the men go to bed with Gilda but wake up with me." So seeing her in this movie, "Gilda", was logical.Glenn Ford was almost 30 here. He is Johnny Farrell and also the Narrator. We first see him in Argentina as a petty gambler, making a few bucks with his loaded dice then scrambling away. But he is followed into an alley to be robbed, only to be saved by George Macready as the secretive German Ballin Mundson, who happens to own a night club and gambling casino. Mundson next finds Johnny in the casino, winning big in Black Jack, by cheating. When he tells Johnny that he had better go away while he can, and never come back, the hustler Johnny convinces Mundson that he is better off hiring Johnny to watch over the casino. Which he does.At one point Mundson leaves for a time and when he returns has a lady with him, Rita Hayworth as Gilda. And, he announces that he met her one day and married her the next. Right away we see there must be some "history" between Gilda and Johnny, and of course there was.The other key character is Joseph Calleia as Det. Maurice Obregon. He is on Mundson's trail because in addition to the casino, he is the head of an illegal Tungsten cartel and the detective wants to bust the other players.Hayworth (Margarita Cansino) was a trained dancer and the movie showcases this a couple of times. She also appears to sing but in reality songs in her various movies are dubbed for her. It is easy to see why she was such a star and a sex symbol.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Gilda,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be a classic, but it's not a great classic. Nevertheless, there is a reason why Gilda has aged just as well as some of its contemporary classics like the films of Hitchcock, Ford, and Welles. Scholars treat Gilda as a prime example of the kind of 'peeping tom' effect of cinema.Gilda sells one thing, and one thing only; Rita Hayworth. Director King Vidor is so obsessed with showing her off, that he neglects to do anything else with the movie. The story is not so impressive. It is contrived, cold, overlong, and with a rushed ending. Here is a movie that puts distance between the viewer and the characters. Our gaze is not aligned with Gilda it is directed at her. With all this in mind however, I don't want to mislead you. Gilda is not a bad film, it is watchable and sometimes likable, it's just not a great movie.The movie tries to find a balance between film noir and romance, and it doesn't turn out very effectively. Despite numerous chilling/seductive/erotic moments, There is no real chemistry between Rita Hayworth and her co star Glenn Ford. Even Kris Steward and Robert Pattinson (a.k.a Bella &amp; Edward) were a more romantic screen couple (only in Twilight though). These two are just cold to one another. Then again, Gilda is also a film noir, ergo, it cannot be too heart warming a story. All I know is that if were in charge, I would make the love story more credible or involving.Other than seeing Rita Hayworth, the thing which keeps us in our seat is the mere desire to know what is gonna happen next. There are times in Gilda when we do know where it's going, but we are curious about how it will get there. The climactic act however, is not one of these times. It is here where Gilda feels most lame. It gets convoluted and messy, and it presents a couple of overlong dance numbers, which serve no purpose in the story. Here, we continue to watch just to see how and when, this craziness will end. It's not like Gilda gets any sexier, lets not forget that back in these days, Hollywood was too sissy to enter the red zone. In the last five minutes, Gilda takes an easy way out of the conflict, because the makers are clearly intent on having a happy ending. So with all this to keep in mind, Is Gilda worth watching? I don't think it needs to be seen, but then again it's not exactly a film you forget.</fullReview>

Maurice Obregon.Steven Geray is magnificent as Uncle Pio.Also great work by people like Joe Sawyer (Casey) and Saul Martell (Little man).There's a great atmosphere in this movie.Like when Johnny and Gilda are alone in the house, or when Mundson talks about hate to her.It's a thrilling moment when the little man starts shooting in the casino.The dialogue of the film is top-notch.And the narration by Glenn Ford works brilliantly.The movie also contains some great use of music.Put the Blame on Mame is a classic, and Amado Mio is most memorable.A must-see for classic lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more memorable femme fatale's makes this a great sexual-tensed genre movie to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the overall story for "Gilda" isn't anything too compelling, the movie is still a great one to watch, which is mostly due to it's main character Gilda, played by Rita Hayworth."Gilda" perhaps isn't exactly a good textbook example of a film-noir, it still has it's most classic ingredient present in it; the femme fatale. Rita Hayworth was perfect for her role and her looks and acting certainly provided the movie with a certain sexual based tension. For 1947 this movie surely features some sensual moments, making this movie also a bit controversial at its time.While the actual plot of the movie is quite good the movie itself is still quite messy with its story, that is being told needlessly complicated at times, which takes away some of the movie its good writing. I think you can blame director Charles Vidor for this, who just didn't know how to use and handle its material to its full potential. Nevertheless the movie always remains a good one to watch, despite of it all.The movie has a sort of "Casablanca" like style, atmosphere, story and characters and the movie got obviously inspired by the 1942 classic. Perhaps this is also why the movie doesn't work out to its full potential. It doesn't really rely enough on its own strength (its story) and more tries to imitate "Casablanca" and other similar successful genre movies, with its look and feel.Not really the best example of an '40's-era film-noir and also not the best constructed movie you'll ever see but its story and main characters still make this a more than great one.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not just another screen romance about three twisted people in hate, Gilda stars the flannel-voiced, scar-faced George Macready as a corrupt casino kingpin; a weirdly jumpy Glen Ford as the sleazy antihero; and, most of all, the incomparable, the breath-taking, Rita Hayworth as Gilda herself - lethal weapon of mass male destruction.Ford is an American expatriate down-and-outer (actually, "bum" is a good word) in Argentina who's unlucky enough to have his life saved by Macready, whose character spends most of the film racking up points in hell till he can "rule the world" all by himself: his stated goal. Ford winds up working as Macready's floor-manager/stooge in the casino. Then Macready, whose "one friend" is his bayonet-cane, gets unlucky enough to meet and marry Hayworth, whose place in the history of life on earth is assured by her performance as a flame-haired blast-furnace of sultry...Jezebellitude, I guess! If you doubt me, just consider: Hayworth's famous "strip-tease" is so fantastically volcanic that your brain won't believe what your eyes are telling it - namely that all she removes is a single %@#^&amp;&amp;! glove! But let's get serious. It's a talky movie. Yet the talk, for those who can still appreciate such things, is amazing. It contains two of the noirest lines in the cinema of all the cosmos. Sneers the all-too-knowing Ford as he watches Rita giving Macready the treatment, "Statistics show there are more women in the world than anything else. Except insects!" And as the two-, three-, and multi-timing Gilda slithers into the arms of another victim, she breathes, "If I was a ranch, they'd call me the Bar-Nothing." And you know what *that* means.The plot isn't quite as twisty as The Maltese Falcon. In other words, you can follow it, but, trust me, it matches the three worthless losers that it's about kink for kink. There's even a wacked-out masquerade ball that symbolizes the double-crossing fabric of reality itself, at least in this movie, with Rita dressed up as a pirate of the Caribbean, only better looking.Till you've seen Gilda, you ain't seen noir. In fact, my friend, you ain't seen nuthin'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilda is The ULTIMATE Femme Fatale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Vidor's "Gilda" (1946) is one of the most typical Film Noirs, but in a way, it's not. Of course, it has all the usual ingredients, like dark photography, dangerous women, hard-boiled men, and tough direction. And yet, there is something more, something different from other Film Noirs. For a start, it has a strange fixation on Femme Fatale. Even the title is named after the Famme Fatale in the picture. Also Gilda (Rita Hayworth) seems to be the star of the film rather that Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) or Ballin Mundson (George Macready). The plot, unlike other Noirs, isn't really convoluted. It is actually easier to follow it than, say "Dead Reckoning". So, in a strange way, it's less of a film Noir than "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Gilda the Lily</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita sizzles! And then sizzles again! And again! This classic film noir is all about Rita Hayworth driving men crazy. She did that for real, she did that on screen, what a wildcat! (A pity we cannot see the true shade of red of her hair in black and white movies, then we might understand all of this so much better.) So here we have Rita driving Glenn Ford crazy and Glenn Ford driving Rita crazy, and Rita driving George Macready her husband crazy, and George, ? well, you get the idea, everybody's crazy. George Macready probably never had a more stunning role, or played one with more convincing menace, style and panache. His old facial scar which in real life he got from a road accident even came in handy here because it suggests a sabre scar, just the right sort of thing for the face of a man who is mysteriously living in Argentina and is in league with escaped Nazis just after the War, running a secret international tungsten cartel and using Nazi patents. Alas, all too convincing, from what we know nowadays about all the Nazis who really made it to Argentina, technology in hand, and were welcomed with wide open swastika-shaped arms by Juan and Eva Peron, who made a lot of money out of them. This whole film is set in Buenos Aires, on a Hollywood set, that is. But there are lots of people speaking Spanish to give local colour, and others speaking English with heavy German accents, and I don't know why, but some of these people keep calling Rita Hayworth 'Little One', despite the fact that there was rarely any femme fatale who was less deserving of such an appellation (the blood of men recently devoured oozes constantly from her luscious lips). Glenn Ford is just the right sort of sturdy, resolute, easily-driven-crazy kind of guy for his role. He quietly suffers, quietly serves, quietly takes his hideous revenge, and both Rita and Macready say ecstatically in different scenes, with shining eyes: 'Hate can be such an exciting emotion, so exciting!' The plot is rather far-fetched, and the whole thing is a bit sick to say the least, but it is all deeply engrossing and you can't take your eyes off it. Charles Vidor, another of those Hungarian refugees, apparently no relation to King Vidor, but the second husband of Evelyn Keyes (!!), did a superb job of directing this shocking noir tale of twisted love, twisted hate, twisted revenge, and twisted celluloid. Gerald Mohr is a superb sardonic police inspector, investigating and observing the crazed antics of the principals with bemused detachment. We get lots of song and dance numbers from Rita, who knew how to sing and how to dance, and then some, and this makes the film rather long, but the studio bosses weren't about to cut any of that, since the more Rita swings her hips, the more men go into cardiac arrest and women get worried about their own comparative lack of allure as judged against that of this siren. Salivating men and worried women makes for good noir box office. All the sexual aspects of Rita's wild behaviour are glossed over with syrupy hypocrisy, and we are asked to believe that Rita was really a genuinely innocent 'Little One' who was simply misunderstood. Oh, come on! But I've seen this strange movie three or four times over the years, and despite its obvious logical flaws and over the top plot, it never loses its fascination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rita Hayworth dominates the film as Gilda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Farrell makes a living cheating in the illegal casinos of Buenos Aires until he meets Ballin Mundson the owner of one such casino. The two become friends and in a case of poacher turned gamekeeper he is managing Mundson's casino. All goes well until Mundson returns from overseas with his new wife, the eponymous Gilda. It is clear that she and Farrell have history and now they hate each other. It isn't long before she is causing trouble; flirting with other men while Farrell tries to protect his employer by covering for her. She isn't the only danger in the film; Mundson is involved in a tungsten cartel which others wish to break up. When Mundson is apparently killed in a plane crash Farrell takes over his businesses and soon marries Gilda; there is still no love though and he proceeds to make her life unpleasant.This film noir is considered a classic largely due to Rita Hayworth's portrayal as Gilda; a character who oozes sexuality and never attempts to be likable. From the moment we see her it is clear that she is trouble although there is a degree of fragility which means she isn't totally unsympathetic. Glenn Ford puts in a fine performance as Johnny a character who starts off likable but as his treatment of Gilda gets worse he becomes the villain of the story; at least for a while. George Macready is good as Mundsen and Steven Geray does a fine job as 'Uncle Pio'; the film's most likable character. While there is little on screen violence there is a sense that things could end badly which remains until the end of film. The Buenos Aires setting could have been better used? or used at all; the film could have been set almost anywhere as we see nothing of the city not even a few archive establishing shots. That is a small quibble though; this is a fine film with a fine cast delivering some great lines during an interesting story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Argentina, wealthy casino owner Ballin Mundson (George Macready) saves drifting gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) from a hold-up man and, later, gives him a job. Johnny quickly earns his trust and becomes his right-hand man. But the situation becomes strained when Mundson brings home a sexy new wife named Gilda (Rita Hayworth) who Johnny used to be in love with but now hates.Sultry and riveting film noir. Glenn Ford is terrific but it's pretty much Rita Hayworth's show the whole way. This is her best film with her most iconic moments. She's simply amazing. Her sizzling chemistry with Ford is palpable. George Macready is hella creepy in this. Steven Geray and Joseph Calleia are great support. Snappy, fast-paced dialogue is some of the best from any film noir. Just a very entertaining picture that should be on everybody's must-see list.</fullReview>

Ballin is the unscrupulous owner of an illegal casino. At first, Johnny cheats at cards and then joins Ballin to become his right hand man. The war in Europe ends. Ballin introduces his new wife Gilda Mundson (Rita Hayworth) to Johnny. Johnny and the flirtatious Gilda don't get along.Rita Hayworth does a big hair flip in her intro and she never looks back. She is absolutely magnetic. The movie has some of the noir elements. Then there is Rita singing. She doesn't really sing as much as becomes sex herself. She is simply a sex goddess on film. The plot has some deficiencies. Glenn Ford is fine as the edgy male lead. He can play both sides which fits this character. All of that is secondary because this is Rita Hayworth's movie pure and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Newman, When we needed him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilda was on TCM last night, more than 60 years since I'd seen it the first time. I suppose that the first time, I must have been taken with the beauty of Rita Hayworth and never thought of the film in a critical fashion. But last night, I was taken not by her beauty and good performance, but how Glenn Ford kept the movie from being an interesting and entertaining picture. Mr. Ford's performance was wooden, unimaginative, and contributed nothing to a flawed script, but a beautifully filmed motion picture. I think how Paul Newman would have handled the role of the Ford character. He would have created a chemistry with Rita Hayworth that would be explosive and believable, something the baby-faced, and miscast Mr. Ford was unable to do. I found it hard to believe how she could have felt the passion she showed for the character as played by Mr. Ford. I realize reviews are not for the purpose of wishful casting, but I can't avoid mentioning what Mr. Newman would have brought to this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I hated her so I couldn't get her out of my mind for a minute"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first glimpse of 'Gilda (1946)' was the scene featured in Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994),' as Rita Hayworth, in one of the great female screen entrances, playfully throws back her hair and doesn't answer whether or not she is, in fact, "decent." This film, like 'Laura (1944)' and Gene Tierney, well-and-truly belongs to its female star, who is so utterly entrancing that one is reluctant to even follow the storyline. Fireworks like this can't happen by accident; many a beautiful actress has been thrust before a camera, with less than entrancing results (and, indeed, Tierney and Hayworth rarely if ever equalled their signature roles, even when re-teamed their respective directors or co-stars). In this film, Hayworth performs a night-club strip-tease that is one of the most erotic musical performances in cinema history, and yet the only item of clothing she removes from her body is a single black glove. Why do we find Gilda so bewitching?Gilda affects the audience just like she affects the characters. Glenn Ford's Johnny, at first an independent gambling opportunist, is reduced to an obsessive, sadistic misogynist by his consuming love/hate for Gilda. This love/hate is the key, I think. We are drawn to Gilda by her sex appeal, which she knowingly flaunts in our faces via a series of extra-marital dalliances, made in plain view, designed to evoke our jealousy. Johnny watches these flings from the same viewpoint as ourselves, and he despises her immoralities, at the same time lusting for them. "Hate is an exciting emotion," muses Ballin (George Macready), an ice-cold casino-owner who wields a bladed cane like a phallus (like Waldo Lydecker in 'Laura,' Ballin's interest in the titular femme may be his attempt to live vicariously as a woman; certainly, his interactions with Johnny seem more sexually-charged than those with Gilda). 'Gilda' falters somewhat in its final act when it attempts to absolve its two main characters (using a curious "cancelling-out" logic), but otherwise proves a magnificently moody melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the award for "Most Dysfunctional Couple" goes to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, seriously. Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth have some issues going on here. As onlooker Joseph Calleia points out, "It's the most curious love-hate pattern I've ever had the privilege of witnessing."It's curious all right. Johnny (Ford), a scruffy grifter on the streets of Buenos Aires, is on the brink of being killed when he is saved (picked up?) by a well-dressed stranger named Ballin (George Macready). Ballin hires Johnny to oversee his illegal casino, and the two form a quick bond of trust and loyalty. This relationship's a puzzler too; when Ballin reverses his dictum that "women and gambling don't mix," and announces there's a lady in the picture, Ford's expression reads less like a concerned business partner than a jilted suitor.Quicker than you can say "so what's that about?" we meet Gilda (Hayworth), and... it's no mystery why this remains Hayworth's most famous role. From that first dazzling shot of her tossing her hair back -- even her hair is erotic -- with shoulders bared, she simply glitters with sex. Was this really 1946? Onstage at the casino, she flirts with the audience: "I can never get a zipper to close. Maybe that stands for something, what do you think?" Oh, I think it probably does.The plot is frankly odd, hinging on lust, murder, and for some reason tungsten. Rudolph Mate's photography is gorgeous. The dialogue is consistently entertaining. Ford, often saddled with bland roles, does fine here as a ne'er-do-well with a conscience, and Steven Geray is quite amusing as the owlishly cynical Uncle Pio.But it's Hayworth you'll remember, wriggling in her black dress or raising her stockinged leg like a banner of temptation. "Hate is a very exciting emotion," she tells Johnny, pressing up close. "I hate you so much I think I'm going to die from it." Hayworth's lips melt and transmute the word "hate" until it means "want." She murmurs again, "I think I'm going to die from it." What a way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Just Ain't So</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I get to the main point of my comment let me first say that Gilda is without doubt one of Hollywood's greats, this due in no small measure to Hayworth, Ford and Macready who give the performances of their lives.I note that some have claimed here that a homosexual relationship exists between Johnny (Ford) and Ballin (Macready), even so far as to include Ballin's sword-cane in the relationship. (Dr. Freud, please take note.) However, I maintain this premise to be totally false. While these claims may just be a misunderstanding by those who make them, nevertheless I do have to wonder: could it be instead that those who make the claims have an agenda of their own to promote?Timewise, as late as the 1946 Gilda at least, loyalty was alive and well and still considered a virtue by a majority of Americans. Alas, in today's world loyalty no longer seems to be held in such high regard; instead, in my estimation anyhow, examples of loyalty seem to be viewed with skepticism along with unfounded suspicions that ulterior motives are in play.The relationship between these two is in fact a strong bond of friendship and loyalty; nothing more, nothing less. In spite of the obviously false attempts to read something else into Johnny and Ballin's relationship, I am sorry -- homosexuality is just not there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of several well-known movies that for one reason or another I never got round to seeing and having nothing more substantial to go on I tended to dismiss it as a ho-hum meller that owed its fame more to a sultry song performed by Rita Hayworth than to any other factor. Boy, did I get a wrong number, unlike Rita because it turns out to be quite a nasty semi-noir with a high feminine input from the uncredited lion's share of the screenplay by Virginia Van Up to the celebrated song, Put The e Blame On Mame co-written by Doris Fisher. Plot-wise we've been here before as the drifter befriended by someone more affluent is the very stuff of noir with the clincher being the woman who comes between them. George MacReady, Glen Ford and Rita Hayworth handle these to a fare-thee-well and when you add crackling dialogue we're talking close to classic.</fullReview>

No wonder it was a main part of the later movie. I recommend anyone see it first though and then watch Shawshank Redemption. The best part of Gilda is figuring out what happened before the story even started. Why she and Johnny had this strange love-hate relationship. It is never explained and only needs some addition at the ending instead of the way everything just fades out. Still a great movie, and says a lot about how people behaved and thought in its time..</fullReview>

Gilda mmarries into Macready's casino, disturbing Ford and Macready's close "friendship." Macready is also the head of a tungsten combine; he fakes his death and Haywroth and Ford marry. Ford abandons her to desolation, controlling all aspects of her life but never consummating the marriage (I've noticed this is an aspect of most gothic melodramas, for example Chaney's "Shadows"). Death, danger, and innumerable unforgettable sequences. Hayworth does her famous "put the blame on Mame" striptease. An artificial film that glorifies artificiality (or gaudiness as a way of life, you might say). Who can forget George Macready tapping his cane and holding it erect, calling it his "little friend"?Who can forget Rita tossing her hair back and smiling as her vanquished lover enters the room?A classic film for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Were it not for Lovely Rita ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gilda is not really an enduring noir classic. Because the only steady noir elements are in the scenery. A scenery to show in a flattering light (special thanks to Rudolph Maté) the breathtaking beauty of Rita Hayworth. Left and right of Goddess Gilda Glenn Ford and George Macready only act as foils. They warm up the audience for when Rita's not around. Glenn Ford is a not too serious noir hero and his fellow Macready is a dead-serious villain. But neither has an interesting and strong developed character to play. Does that mean Gilda is a better written part? Yes and no. Yes because the movie is about Gilda to have fun and Gilda to be loved. No because reel in, reel out the business 'mcguffin' plot involving the male supporting actors takes too much footage.Failing to reach the level of Casablanca or Notorious (Ben Hecht was here), Gilda would have been a much better movie on the whole as a comedy. Other possibility: to redefine a storyline sharply focused on the noir hero as in Casablanca (narrator v.o. is not sufficient) or on the women at stake as in Notorious.Inspired by (possible spoilers) Casablanca: the hero-with-a-love-ache. That love comes around again...married to a rival. But the hero has to help the husband. The casino with its usual bets and unusual bargains. The chief of the police showing he knows a lot but just waits to see what happens. The go-between: Sam/Uncle Pio. The German villains. Noisy end of business for Peter Lore/the Roulette gambler (both linked to a key factor). Notorious (because Ben Hecht worked on both scripts in 1945): the hero who's in love but won't tell it. Because business stands through the way. The woman he loves married a villain in love with her. The villain will not hesitate to kill her when he finds out he's been fooled. The villain is the key character concerning German interests in South America during and after WWII. His German fellows could kill him if he betrays them. The scene where Ford and Hayworth dance during Carnival resembles the scene where drunk Alicia (Ingrid Bergman) speaks alone with Devlin (Cary Grant): Gilda is leading, Alicia is driving. The moral is: men find it difficult to walk past former loves and step ahead (that's why they lie "we have no pasts, just futures"). Extenuating circumstances: the woman is too gorgeous and they want to stay decent when they should behave as Tex Avery's wolf meeting Red Hot Riding Hood.</fullReview>

We soon learn that Johnny and Gilda (Rita Hayworth), Mundson's provocative wife, were lovers before she married Mundson....As Gilda's possessive husband, Macready's Mundson thrives on hate. "Hate can be an exciting emotion," he tells Gilda. "Hate is the only thing that warms me." The other characters, too, thrive almost as much on hate as Mundon does. "I hated her so much," Johnny says, "I couldn't get her out of my mind." Later Gilda blasts Johnny: "I hate you so much I would destroy myself to take you down with me." Later she echoes Mundson's words, telling Johnny that "hate is a very exciting emotion."...But be careful about all that hate talk when it's between Gilda and Johnny. Watch them instead--because one of the film's most memorable qualities is the dichotomy between what is heard and seen....Set in South America, GILDA's storyline is contrived and the ending a cop out. But who cares? Rita Hayworth is the main reason to see GILDA. She sings. She dances. She drives Farrell, Mundson, and the other males into a tizzy. Rita was never better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It always makes the person look like a moron when he claims Hollywood has always had good guy heroes. Even in the forties, few heroes were "good guys", and "good guys" rarely won.Glen Ford plays the creep hero, a man who makes his own luck, or in other words has had the love of other human monsters who taught him the tricks of cheating. Today, such people run almost all businesses, including all casinos. There is no "fair play", because too much respect has been given to creeps like this.There is nothing likable about the characters, which makes the romance even less interesting. We don't care about the characters, so a rational person doesn't like it when these punks claims they can romance like we can. They can't. The relationship of the story fails because no rational person can identify with them, nor empathize with them. And it's insulting when these monsters pretend to be in situations we have found ourselves in.The problem with movies like this is they try to claim Ford is an "anti-hero", when he is nothing of the sort here. He is classic Greek hero, the thug who has the love of the gods. The anti-hero is one who has to cheat the cheaters, the one who has to play against accepted social rules. The thugs like Ford plays here are the "socially accepted norm".That's what's wrong with these movies. Otherwise, we could care about the story, because the romance itself is well done. It's just that people who grew up in hoods know better than to be conned by human monsters who try to make us think monsters are people.</fullReview>

Johnny still as crooked as can be ends up almost having his legs broken by Ballin's hoods when he goes to his casino and does there what he does best cheat at the gambling tables.Having a soft spot for Johnny Ballin gives him the job as manager that puts Johnny on the floor to spot and throw out cheats, like himself, where he later runs into Ballin's wife gorgeous Gilda who just happens to be an old flame of Johnny's. Tension mounts between the two, Johnny &amp; Ballin, as Gilda plays a number of minds games with them. Gilda gets on both their nerves by making herself look like a cheap tramp and getting drunk and picking up every man at the casino for a night of fun and pleasure. Unknown to both Johnny &amp; Ballin that's about as far as she goes with them with her clothes on and honor still in tact.It later turns out that Ballin made a deal with the Nazis during the war to act as care-taker of the German Governments secret plan of corralling the tungsten market. With Ballin about to leave Argentina fearing that the Nazi's sent secret agents into the country to assassinate him, because he kept their secret tungsten patents hidden from them, and planning to take Gilda along with him he suddenly changes his mind leaving Gilda out in the cold. Ballin had found out that she was in love with his second-in-command, at the casino, Johnny. Ballin then fakes his death in a staged plane crash off the Atlantic Coast where his body was never recovered. Ballin was also fleeing from the Buenos Aires police after murdering one of the Nazi agents using the annual Buenos Aires costume party parade as a cover for the hit-job he did on him.Now free to marry Gilda and take over the "late" Ballin's gambling operation Johnny leaves her on their wedding night in revenge for Gilda, the woman that every man on earth would want to spend the night with, leaving him for Ballin not bothering to even consummate their marriage! you just can't get any weirder then that! Hurt and humiliated by Johnny's actions Gilda again attempts to have affairs with every man who would as much as make a pass at her, which is practically the entire male population of Argintina, but is prevented from even going out on a date by Johnny's goons. The goons are given orders by Johnny to beat and rough up any man that she's seen trying to go out with. The film ends with Ballin miraculously coming back from the dead to absolutely no surprise at all to anyone watching the movie, since it was already shown earlier that he actually faked it. Pulling out a handgun as Balling sleeplessly,it looked as if the salty and cold ocean water softened up his brain, tried to do both Gilda and Johnny in he's suddenly stabbed from behind and out of camera range, with his own switchblade-like cane. The person who did Ballin in tuned out to be casinos mens-room attendant the all knowledgeable and former philosophy professor Uncle Pio, Steven Geray. With police detective Maurice Obrego, Joseph Calleia, on the scene he declares Ballin's demise as being a case of justifiable homicide. With the other Nazi agent arrested for crimes against Argentina's international trade agreements everyone at the scene of Ballin's death Johnny Gilda and Uncle Pio don't ever have to worry about spending time behind bars.Not much of a story but the hot and sexy Rita Hayworth as Gilda with the subconscious sexual innuendos involving her two lovers, Johnny Ferrell and husband Ballin Mundson, has you wondering if in fact their really more attracted to each other then to her. You get the impression that Johnny and Ballin are only using poor frustrated and beautiful Gilda as a beard, a sexual cover, to hid from the people, in the movie and those watching it, their real sexual feelings which would have never been allowed on the screen or to see the light of day in a film coming out of Hollywood back then in 1946.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bisexual Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In film noir, usually the spider-woman (the gorgeous Rita Hayworth) traps the man with her seductive powers, often getting him to kill for her before she herself is killed/punished for her crimes of transgressing in a man's world. This film doesn't quite follow the formula. The movie stars two male protagonists who are clearly more interested in each other than in Gilda, even though Rita Hayworth is by far one of the most beautiful women ever to be filmed.Recently restored for DVD release, the film looks sharp and the graininess is gone from the original. Except for the inconsistent use of shadows, the dark/light style is quite honed. The sound quality is high but the amplitude is low, so you will have to turn your speaker system up to hear the film clearly.I admit that I laughed through much of the film as the heterosexual, homosexual, AND bisexual playfulness of the dialogue is simply a joy to listen to, mostly due to Hayworth's goddess-ness. The film ends on a boring, unbelievable moment, but it's typical Hollywood of the time: Good starts, great middles, dumb endings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A famous movie, nevertheless a little bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A famous movie, that finally I had the opportunity to watch in 2002, better now than never! But a little bit disappointing. Yes the dialogs are brilliant and the actors are really excellent. Really in those days, no need for special effects, surround sounds etc... , a solid story and solid play is enough to make a great movie. Well, 2 reasons however that makes me think that I will probably not watch again and again this movie: - the unappropriate ending: as far as the film goes, you do not expect a happy end. - the film is too long, the come back of Ballin does not bring anything to the story. Twenty minutes less long and a tragic ending would have make it one of my favorites. But if you like excellent actors play and smart dialogs, it is worth to watch Gilda once. My vote: 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Some of this reminds me of Casablanca (1942) with the "philosopher of the washroom" (Steve Geray) sporting a Peter Lorrie accent and Glenn Ford playing tough like Humphrey Bogart running a night spot in a foreign land, this time Argentina. Rita Hayworth is Gilda, of course, and the forties Marilyn Monroe. I'm sure MM studied this film. The way Monroe does her shoulders and flashes her arm pits as she sings and removes her long-sleeved black gloves in Gentleman Prefer Blondes (1953) is virtually copied from Hayworth's performance here. You could check it out.Ford is your confident, two-fisted bad boy that women love, circa 1945, kind of like an old- fashioned John Travolta from Pulp Fiction (1994). But notice how benign those bad boys used to be. The worst thing he does is cheat at dice. And while he's fast and street wise about most things, he's like a little boy with women. That used to pass for charm. Maybe it still does.The plot is a little too precious in places and Charles Vidor's attention to detail hit and miss, mostly hit; yet there's a nice mysterious forties Hollywood atmosphere created (even though it's supposed to be Buenos Aires).There's a night life, night time feel to the movie with passwords at the door and evening gowns and dark cars caught in street lamps that helps to define the forties. You can see the influence of Gilda in movies coming many years after, Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997) come to mind, the former in the night scenes and the latter because Kim Basinger really looks and behaves more like Rita Hayworth than the Veronica Lake look-alike she portrayed.Memorable is George Macready as the casino owner, he of the pinched face and the long, curved scar on his right cheek, giving him the devil-may-care air of a man who has fought and won many duels. I recall he always played villains and made us believe.I liked the resolution which showed that Gilda was more a tease than anything else and kind of sweet even though she said, "If I had been a ranch, they'd have named me the Bar-Nothing." Quaint and curious is the old Hollywood code which forbade showing her belly button even in a mid-drift and skirt. They tease us with her globes always sheltered and her little belly and the line of her butt just hinted at. She has a mouth as big as Julia Roberts' and sexy eyes. The scene where she really sells it is when her face comes out of shadow and she puckers up to Ford and tells him, "I hate you so much that I think I am going to die for it." She seems to be begging him, if that's what it takes. He holds a light for her cigarette down near his waist (everything had to be subtle in those days), and then some scenes later, she does get down on the floor with her arm around his legs.Hayworth has a sultry and low feminine voice like Laurel Becall (that's the way we liked 'em then!) which is nicely displayed as she sings "Put the Blame on Mame."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems as if every beautiful actress from the 40's who skated by on looks and sex appeal had at least one bid at gaining credibility for herself as a "serious" actress---and "Gilda" was Rita Hayworth's. Don't get me wrong, I think Hayworth is as gorgeous as the next guy, but she's just not a great actress, nor is she an interesting screen presence. Her beauty is of that variety that looks better in stills and movie posters than it does on the screen."Gilda" isn't an especially memorable film. There was much ballyhoo at the time about the chemistry between Hayworth and leading man Glenn Ford, and I believe the film was a tremendous box office success, but it doesn't seem very exceptional now. The most famous scene, and the one invariably selected for excerpts today, is that of Hayworth's big musical number, "Put the Blame on Mame," but what I guess seemed sexy at the time--Hayworth flopping around like she's attached to strings that someone else is pulling--seems awfully limp and silly now.Not a terrible movie, but there's really nothing much to recommend about it either.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bog-standard romance movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GILDA is a film that left me cold, unfortunately. I watched it because I'm a fan of the film noir genre, but despite a few suspense and mystery elements, this film is more of a romance than anything else and I tend to shun the romance genre as a whole if I possibly can. I watch films for escapism, and romance is too ordinary and dull for me to enjoy.This is a film about a youthful Glenn Ford and his complicated feelings for an old flame, played by the alluring Rita Hayworth. The two have lots of torrid scenes together, but aside from this the film never seems to go anywhere. Hints at homo-eroticism are near non-existent thanks to the strict censorship of the era, and hardly anything is made of the Argentinian setting. Hayworth is an undeniably attractive starlet, and the others in the cast do their best, but I'm afraid I was twiddling my thumbs for much of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love film noir, or film in general, Gilda is a quintessential. From start to finish, it is pure cinema gold. The story is probably the least exceptional asset of the film, but it is still well-constructed and entertaining. The cinematography is very impressive, and while low-lit and studio-bound, the production values are also and the costumes are lovely to look at. The music is delightful, Put the Blame on Mame defines the term instant classic.The script is snappy, funny and smart, and Charles Vidor's direction is top notch. I also loved the performances. As terrific and dashing as Glenn Ford is, it is really Rita Hayworth who steals the show. Her first appearance in this movie is a classic star introduction, while she is glamorous, witty and incredibly beautiful. For me the only slight quibble is that the ending is a tad too quick and abrupt. All in all, quintessential classic film noir and worth watching for Hayworth and Put the Blame on Mame alone. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a small time American gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) who arrives in Buenos Aries. Here his wit and luck lands him a job running a casino for a powerful man Ballin Mundson (George Macready) with a lot of secrets. When Munson returns from a trip with his new young American wife Gilda (Rita Hayworth), it soon becomes apparent to both him and the audience that she and Johnny have a history together.From there we have parallel story lines with Munson gradually revealing his other mysterious business interests to Johnny, and Gilda apparently embarking on a self destructive string of affairs. This leaves Johnny torn between a loyalty to Munson (which includes a healthy interest in his finances) and his love/hate relationship with Rita.The story gets a little convoluted at times, somewhat like "The Big Sleep" but it's not incomprehensible. This is also perhaps one of those films where the story is a somewhat less important aspect of the film.The film contains one of the most iconic character introductions of all time with Gilda's head rising from below screen to toss her hair back and turn her face to the audience.The film features what was at the time (at the very least) one of the sultriest performances by a major Hollywood actress. This was highlighted by the musical number "Put the Blame on Mame" which Gilda sings at the casino.While Rita Hayworth's performances of Put the Blame on Mame was remarkable, it was not in fact Hayworth singing but instead an uncredited Anita Ellis who would sing for her in several other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilda's cage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific film noir with Rita Hayworth in her career-defining role as the beautiful Gilda who basically turns the head of every male in the movie as well as turning inside out the heads of the two men in her life, past flame, smalltime operator Johnny Farell (Glenn Ford) and his new boss, altogether much bigger-time operator Ballin Mundsen (George McReady). The three play out a classic love-triangle, with occasional interjections by some of Gilda's toy-boy friends to a backdrop of post-war intrigue in an unofficial gambling den set in Buenos Aires. The plot definitely has shades of "Casablanca" about it, even down to Steven Geray's Dooley Wilson-type role as Ford's conscience from the lower echelons (in this case a bathroom attendant) and whilst Glenn Ford can't match Bogart for world-weariness or George McCready Paul Heinreid's dash and debonair, Rita Hayworth loses nothing in comparison to the great Ingrid Bergman and the Swede certainly couldn't put across a song like "Put the Blame on Mame" the unforgettable way that Rita does! While downgrading Ford above in comparison to Bogart, that said he is utterly convincing as the nobody on the make whose path crosses fortuitously with big-shot Mundsen to his immediate benefit, until the arrival of Gilda, that is.... He acts with total conviction and his scenes with Hayworth emit real heat, totally convincing us of their previous history with each other. Hayworth of course is an absolute knock-out, from one of the best character introductions in any film ever (just by shaking her hair and answering to her name!) she conveys all the conflicting emotions her trapped character is riven by, need for love, need for attention, need to show-off, need to manipulate... the list goes on. McReady is a good foil for both, although his come-back from his apparent death stretches credulity - the film doesn't need the crash-bang histrionics at the end to work and might have worked better with a more enigmatic conclusion... ...Which takes us back to Casablanca, often rated the best film ever in various public and critic's polls, whose ending of course left us all guessing. For me though "Gilda" is right up there with it, a timeless noir-classic, beautifully shot and played, a veritable treat for the eyes and ears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film noir of film noirs, Gilda stands almost alone. If it were not for its pallid climax, it would rival The Lady from Shanghai. Admittedly, like The Lady, our Gilda rates somewhat short on sense, but remarkably high in atmosphere?and atmosphere, after all, is what noir is all about.The casting, like the camera-work, the sets, the music score and everything else, is well-nigh perfect. Seductively costumed by Jean Louis, Gilda is the apotheosis of Hayworth's screen persona, a sultry goddess who can even strike sparks from the likes of seemingly stolid (if hollow) Glenn Ford and thoroughly nasty but well-veneered pieces of work like George Macready.Like the Welles' masterpiece, Gilda also delights connoisseurs by breaking all the rules. Director Vidor uses unusual angles so effectively and so dramatically that audiences receive an emotional kick without realizing how it was done?which is of course the ultimate in movie artistry. Charles Nelson's editing is also a marvel of experimentation that willfully breaks all the pointers taught in film schools?and it works! Much admired and imitated by the French "New Wave", Gilda is a movie that can be enjoyed on many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cherished childhood remembrance: Rita Hayworth singing and dancing "Amado mío"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever seen Rita Hayworth singing and dancing "Amado mío"? No? That's terrible! in that case I must give you some very bad news: You are an incomplete person! go immediately and watch "Gilda": GO, NOW! I saw it last night --I always must watch this vintage movie again every few years-- to confirm that I didn't dream about it, that it really exists. This is a movie that validates that 'Magic of the Movies' saying.Rita Hayworth was a Goddess of the Silver Screen and indeed I believe it to be so. The script of this movie is completely incredible: Gilda --what was the real name of the character?-- becomes Gilda in Southamerica, in a very colorful couple of countries and their capitals: Argentina with Buenos Aires and Uruguay with Montevideo-- unrealistically (Native Mexican type extras as Argentinians and Uruguayans in all these scenes!) but expertly glamorized by Hollywood in a way that these places never were or will ever be, but the Hollywood "Dream Machine" knew what it was doing to perfection, since movies are the stuff dreams are made of. Gilda's first appearance on screen, responding "Who, me?" to her husband (Ballin-Mcready) asking "Gilda, are you decent?", while raising her head on a spectacular close up, with a cascade of curls falling free over her naked shoulders, must be the Entrance to top all entrances of an actress in any movie ever made. The Carnival scene in Buenos Aires and the night club in Montevideo are just pretexts to show off the beauty of Rita in the best possible way, indelibly so in some minds --mine, for example-- and when we look back to reminisce about those images, although we know they are black and white, we remember them in full Technicolor, wide screen and stereo sound. Glenn Ford (Johnny) looks like a naughty boy in this film, while Gilda's husband (George Macready) is Perfecto as the suave, super polished European gentleman --but Evil, oh, sooo Evil!-- ruthless husband and cool --freezing cold-- businessman. He goes around carrying a very sleek cane that thanks to a hidden trigger can instantly become a deadly stiletto --stainless steel-- with which one imagines him going through daily situations doing away with undeserving Southamericans that don't follow the Nazi cause as fervently as he does. He uses it the first time he meets Johnny in some Buenos Aires slum, meeting that looks like a regular homosexual pick-up, that eventually will develop into a full blown love-hate relationship --a lot has been written about their peculiar partnership--, but since in the 40s Hollywood movies couldn't possibly deal into this 'dark' facet of our clean American hero, this side of their relation will forever remain a mystery.Steven Geray (Pio) magnificent as the male toilet attendant at the Casino that Ballin uses as the cover-up for his pro-Nazi dealings in Buenos Aires.When he leaves in a hurry on his private plane at night time --excellent photography-- to cross a river that looks as wide as lake Michigan --and really it is that wide, since the Paraná river opens up fan like when it merges with the Atlantic Ocean (excellent research) when we see that plane quite far away from the Argentinian coast exploding in mid-air over the wide river, we know that it's too soon for the bad guy to die (He doesn't, James Bond like he reappears more evil than ever to avenge Gilda/Johnny's double crossing him, although we know that they knew each other and had a red-hot romance long ago in the USA, but the bad guy doesn't know that, because if he did, the movie would have been totally different). Our Gilda suffers in this film as much as the protagonist on the silent series "The Perils of Pauline", but in Gilda's case, the suffering is psychological and she goes through it gorgeously made up, coiffed to death and dressed to kill.We cannot object to those fabulous gowns and pieces of expensive jewelry because Mr Ballin was vastly rich due to his line of business with the Nazi gestapo in Argentina. We must remember that Gilda's spectacular strip tease --although botched by Johnny's outraged intervention at the very last minute before undressing-- and the scene of Johnny's slapping Gilda where two firsts in the history of movie making (as far as I know) scenes that caused a great deal of excitement, especially among housewives of that time, dreaming of being slapped like that by their husbands. As I said before, the story line of this movie is sheer nonsense, but there may be very few movies as entertaining , mesmerizing and providers of so much eye candy (Rita) as this one.Just enjoy watching it without thinking about its logic. I mentioned that I saw this movie last night, but wrote these lines with the memories of my first vision of "Gilda", when I was six years old --long time ago-- and it branded me forever, with Rita Hayworth singing "Amado mío", "Put the Blame on Mame" (It wasn't her voice singing, but who cares! it must have been the most successful blending of image with voice in the whole history of movie dubbing) and dancing (it was HER dancing all right!) like the Goddess she was, in that dreamlike boite in Montevideo, doing her 'Chee-kee-cheek Boom!' while shaking that glorious mane of hers until my six year old mind exploded in a multicolored firework of pleasure (not to mention yesterday's vision with my adult mind...).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film goddess Rita Hayworth once again teams up with Director Charles Vidor in perhaps her most well known and memorable performance in the the title role of Gilda. They had made The Lady in Question together in 1940 and Covergirl in 1945 and would make one more together in 1948's Loves of Carmen but this is perhaps the best of their four collaborations. This was Hayworth's second opposite Glenn Ford in a Vidor film previously together in Lady in Question and would appear together again in Carmen. This is a love triangle set in a South American Casino with Hayworth, Ford and George Macready as the club owner in the principal roles. Joseph Calleria rounds out the cast. This romantic/mystery is filled with sexual tension and follows a good script although this is not an exceptionally great movie it is a good movie and Hayworth at her erotic best. Rita Hayworth is 28 years old here and although no longer the girlish beauty of her late 30's early 40's films she is probably at the height of her screen beauty in an alluring and sophisticated look of perhaps one of the most beautiful actresses to appear on screen. Besides her beauty very few actresses today can wear a dress like Hayworth. Another actress in this role and it would still be a good movie but Hayworth shows why she is the ultimate screen siren.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>.."noir" or not, Gilda certainly shines..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether of not "noir" applies to this classic-in-every-word movie is not important to me. It's like being "politically correct" - who cares ? Everything works in this film, director Charles Vidor making certain it does. Indeed, Marion Parsonnet's slick script helps. Cinematography is at its best, with mucho lighting-effect's for Ms. Hayworth ("Gilda"). Let's face it: Hawyorth and Ford ("Johnny") were the most gorgeous stars in Hollywood for a short while. Ford's profile and beautiful skin (eyes, too) are a good match for Rita's. The dance sequence showing a close-up of their faces, during the Carnavale Party, certainly attests to that....This viewing, I missed the first part of the movie and was glad to be enlightened by many who wrote of the opening section of "Gilda". If some people see homosexual intent between Ford and "Ballin" (George Macready), it slipped right past me; would make the plot more intense, though. I just thought those characters recognized they could use one another, without having any other reason, having no regrets about discarding one another. TCM's presentation was the first time I'd seen the entire film in a long time.I disagree with all the purists who say the plot drags in places, and I'm glad those love-hate characters got to "go home" in the end. Go back to "Casablanca" if you want to a separation. And, I disagree with everyone that Rita's strip-tease was perfect. It was HOT, indeed, but her movements were awkward. She was a professional dancer, you know? I certainly don't denigrate it, because that's the highlight of the film.AND - I hate to burst your bubble about Hayworth's hair, too. Repeat from another comment I've posted here: she wore many gorgeous wigs made by my good friend, Cleo Rene (drag-queen) who worked for Max Factor. He was a wig-maker before all the cosmetics. Every female impersonator in that era had two-or-three identical wigs (I still have one, someplace). Cleo's wigs had twice the amount of hair other makers use in wigs. The effect is so outstanding; maybe the wigs were a copy of Hayworth's actual hair."Ballian" clearly indicated he would re-appear and "Johnny" said he thought the crash of his plane was intentional. Didn't other people pick-up on that? "Ballian's" intent was to kill "Johnny", because of the heat between he and "Gilda". I'm so glad "Uncle Pio" jabbed "Ballian" with his sword, and also that "Det. Obregon" decided to look the other way.The sets and costumes were lavish, especially those created by Jean-Louis for Hayworth. I don't think anything was sacrificed to make this film dazzle - it still does. It will keep your attention through its full length. Watch it......</fullReview>

That's the first.One of the Rita Haywoth's best-I would like to say the best one, but I like more The Blood and sand, where she's excellently lovely.But that's the second.If you need a recommendation for this film-you won't like it.You just have to see it and you'l get crazy about it.Anyway.Anyhow.See and you'lsee.I used to be bored sometimes, some scenes are too simple for a contemporary audience, maybe.But those dance scenes, which are amazingly seducive, will make you watch that film till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so interested in "Gilda" just for one reason: RITA!!! and her show of "Put the blame on Mame". That was the first scene that i saw of this movie. And there is another interesting thing, i never have see before a Film Noir movie. So i get it.The movie first of all is very fun, but badly situated. As maybe much of us know, the story is develops in Argentina. And, if you saw the film and you know how is Argentina... i mean, you know Argentina not was like that, not now and not in that time. That was maybe a mistake don't so easy of forget.But for other way, the cast is wonderful. Rita is simply marvelous and sexy than ever!!!! Besides i love "Put the blame on Mame". So, if you love the story of cops, mysteries and love this is your movie. So: Put the blame on Gilda Boys!!!!! PD: Uncle Pio is so funny too *Sorry for the mistakes, well if there any</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read all of the numerous comments, so maybe someone has already mentioned this, but this film is not film noir, and "Gilda" is not a femme-fatale. Oh sure, she's dangerous, but not deadly.That said, if you wanna see a great actress delivering sharp dialogue and exhibiting fantastic chemistry with her "romantic opposite" then get this film NOW. If you need a clear, well developed storyline and hope for an equally solid supporting cast, I don't recommend it. I know, I know, Hayworth is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC and makes this a great movie all by herself, she's strong enough to carry the rest of it on her shoulders. If the filmmakers had worked a little harder, this could have been as great as Casablanca, but they stopped short after developing Hayworth and Ford's chapters in the plot line, and left the rest hanging, like a great painting in a rather crappy frame.</fullReview>

When she sings Put the blame on Mame and glides across Johnny Farrell's stage to show him he can't push her around she is like a glittering diamond!The sexual tension between Johnny and Gilda is ever present and after watching this movie a person will never use the word "hate" in the same way ever again.I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar because her performance is perfectly synchronized to her characters motivations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I instantly recognised the film when I saw the clip in The Shawshank Redemption, I then remembered a singing sequence, and then I spotted in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was very interested indeed, from director Charles Vidor (Love Me or Leave Me). Basically drifter, small-time crook and gambler Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford, narrating throughout) has come to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and is saved from a gunman by Ballin Mundson (George Macready), the owner of the local illegal casino. After being caught for cheating at blackjack, Johnny talks himself into being hired by Ballin to become his right hand man, before leaving him to take care of business to go on a trip. When Ballin returns, he has brought back with him his beautiful new wife Gilda (Rita Hayworth), who Johnny instantly recognises as an ex-lover, and unaware Ballin wants him to keep an eye on his wife, causing him a lot of loathing. Ballin one day gets a visit from some two German businessmen who want to take over the casino, which he refuses to let them do, even as backers, and after a visit from government agent Obregon (Joseph Calleia) he goes to shoot and kill the Germans. On the same night Gilda and Johnny are saying that they hate each other, but end up kissing, and Ballin flees in a plane, which Johnny and Obregon witness exploding. With the casino owner presumed dead Gilda inherits his house and fortune, and Johnny quickly marries her, but not for love, his loyalty is to the business, and Gilda fails to try and escape the love-hate relationship. Obregon does tell Johnny that Gilda was never unfaithful, and he forgives anything bad he may have said, and at that moment appears a man with a gun, it is Ballin. The Nazis were after him, so he faked his death, and before he can kill the both of them Uncle Pio (Steven Geray) fatally stabs him in the back, Obregon takes the estate for the government, and Gilda and Johnny leave the country. Also starring Joe Sawyer as Casey, Gerald Mohr as Captain Delgado, Robert Scott as Gabe Evans and Donald Douglas as Tom Langford. Hayworth is gorgeous and has an amazing star making entrance with the flick of her long hair, and she also has that famous striptease while singing "Put the Blame on Mame" (number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Songs) where the only thing she removes is her long sleeved glove, this moment was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. She isn't a money-grabbing Femme Fetale like you normally get in a film like this, but she is certainly lustful to all men, she just steals the show as the title character of this fantastic classic film noir. Rita Hayworth was number 19 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women. Very good!</fullReview>

If I make the effort of imagining the movie only with Rita, it could be an improvement as well. The dress Gilda is using while singing in Montevideo should have made some fuss by the time; at least I hope so. And yes, Put the Blame on Mame has been around my Spotify account since the very beginning, reminding me of a certain angle of women condition. As for the plot, I would certainly prefer she would end up walking out alone, by herself instead of with her yo-yo partner (with not even 1/10 of her glamor).

		<shortDescription>what's the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am puzzled, not to say mystified, by the banquet of praise heaped upon this flick in this space. I put this on my Netflix queue because of the presence of Glenn Ford, an actor I have come to admire, and because I was curious about the supposed "homoerotic" subtext. As far as the latter, it was not in evidence at all. Whether this was because it was diluted so much by the Code at the time, who can say? As far as the former, Ford does what he can with a script that is incoherent, bloated and affected, but his acting can't make it hang together. The relationship between Jimmy Farrel and Gilda is not just opaque, but incomprehensible. Love, hate, love, hate - after a while one's neck hurts from going back and forth. The business with the titanium monopoly is an obscure sideshow. The movie can't seem to decide what it wants to be about, and what it winds up being about - Jimmy and Gilda - is just too unconvincing to work. As far as Rita Hayworth, like Elizabeth Taylor one wonders whether her primary draw is her looks rather than her acting ability. Hayworth's two song numbers are gratuitous, and detract from the few plot threads that we are asked to follow.I was distinctly underwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider it safe to say that you don't totally know sexy until you've seen Charles Vidor's "Gilda". While the plot involves a casino owner's dealings with Nazis in Argentina, the star remains Rita Hayworth. Watching the scenes of her singing and dancing, I'm actually a little surprised that they were allowed to get all that on screen in 1946, what with the thoughts that it would likely provoke.Do I have anything bad to say about the movie? Maybe the one minor problem with the movie is how it focuses on Nazis escaping to South America, but Rita Hayworth's presence makes it hard to think about anything else. But seriously, that's negligible. Hayworth, along with Glenn Ford and George Macready make up the perfect cast in this practically perfect film noir. As the poster affirms: "There never was a woman like Gilda." And there never will be again. No accident that the character in "The Shawshank Redemption" wanted a poster of Rita Hayworth.And yes, Gilda Radner was named after Rita Hayworth's character. I guess that it really is always something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Otherwise a beautiful movie. Gilda herself is as immortal as Marilyn Monroe (both were characters, in essence). Directing was exquisite. It was smart. It was kinky.Absolutely one of my favorites...but that tacked-on, ludicrously lame ending makes me contemplate about eating my own vomit. I can't fathom why it copped out like that. It is tragically "happily ever after." How wretched.And about that commentator who seemed to believe he was revolutionizing the analysis of Gilda by proposing it was "homosexual"....then I severely disagree. Upon my first impression, and then a calculated second look with the "homosexuality" theme in my mind -- both times leave me with no gay insinuation. Nothing. Mundson is a little wimpy, but to automatically assume he is gay because he's a pasty blonde is prejudice and an ill-incepted theology. Johnny isn't gay either. When he first steps into Mundson's casino he whistles heartily at the back of a woman. Gilda is not ripping the two "apart." Actually Mundson is pushing Gilda and Johnny together.Homosexuality in Gilda doesn't hold water. If that's the way you're going, then you could practically apply homosexuality to everything, from Thelma &amp; Louise to The Three Stooges. So the stars are the same sex, does that automatically mean they're having sex? I understand the sentiment and the idea, but there isn't any proof of it.Just because the casino is full of men, doesn't make it a brothel.</fullReview>

You know it's coming. Now days we'd have her in a psych clinic and then getting help for battered insecure women who were probably molested in her early teens. But in the Forties they didn't say such things, we had to put the story together in our imaginations,that's why these films are so GREAT! Eventually all of them gets whats coming to them and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Great film. TCM played it this evening and now I recall why I love Rita Hayworth so much.

		<shortDescription>Sexism and Abuse Glorified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth. The movie Gilda should be the first thing you think of when you hear her name. This is her best-known performance, after all. What may be perceived as a classic piece of film noir, with Rita Hayworth in the role of the typical femme fatale, is, in actuality, a mean-spirited look at sexual issues, surrounded by your average muddled film noir plot. Gilda is about Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), an American gambler newly arrived in Buenos Aires, who finds work when the owner of an illegal casino, Ballin Mundson (George Macready), hires him. Mundson comes home from a trip with a new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth), a woman who shares a history with Johnny. When Johnny is given the task of keeping an eye on her, Gilda purposefully fools about with men at all hours in an effort to enrage Johnny, who becomes more and more abusive towards her. Mundson, who is involved in a cartel, kills a man and, before faking his own death in order to escape, comes home to get Gilda. He finds her and Johnny involved in a hostile confrontation that ends in a passionate kiss. After Mundson's disappearance, Johnny and Gilda marry. Johnny's reason for this marriage soon becomes clear when he arranges for her to be guarded day and night: he wants to imprison her as a means of punishing her and himself for their betrayal of Mundson. Much of this movie does not sit well with me. For one thing, Johnny is a truly unpleasant character: he cheats at gambling and he is abusive towards Gilda, as well as several other people, throughout the film. The concept of an explosive love-hate dynamic is a raw and intriguing concept for a film noir romance. Yet Rita's only real sin is that she apparently cheats on the husband for whom she has no real affection, while Johnny beats up one of her supposed lovers, hurls abuse at her, and is, on the whole, extremely controlling. You never see a tender side to Johnny, which makes it easy to understand why Gilda would hate him, but not why she would love him, unless she was a masochist. We know that this is untrue, however, because the last third of the film involves Gilda attempting to escape from Johnny's manipulation. The film explores the notion of sexual indiscretion as a means of rebellion. We know that Gilda cavorts about with men during her marriage, not because she is actually promiscuous, but because she knows that having flings is the one thing that will enrage Johnny. The famous "clothed striptease" that the film is famous for has Gilda performing the ultimate act of defiance: flaunting her body, the only thing she can freely use, in front of strangers. Her reasoning behind it is troubling, but we never seem to focus on this, especially in a contemporary context: we become the strangers Gilda performs for, the men who look upon Gilda as a sex object. Yet its plain that Gilda feels like Johnny's slave; the "striptease" is a way of flaunting something of Johnny's in front of others in an effort to embarrass him. Even the first performance we see her give when she is working in a nightclub, far away from Johnny and Buenos Aires, is an act of rebellion, even though it is (seemingly) impossible for Johnny to know of it. Distance does not lessen the impact of Johnny's control over her. The film is concerned with making the love-hate dynamic sexy. In the end it makes any sort of potentially empowering meaning or conclusion impossible. Gilda feels as though the only way she can rebel or escape from the control that Johnny has over her is to play the part of the woman of easy virtue. This never changes. We only seen Gilda in the context of her sexuality; we never get the chance to understand who she is apart from her relationship to other men. Her relationship with Johnny is her only motivation, preventing her from really being her own person. As such, she can never separate her identity from her sexuality, just as men are unable to do. Only when Johnny discovers that Gilda has been faithful to Mundson all along does he realize the errors of his ways, "allowing" the prison of his marriage to Gilda give way to real love. His controlling nature is forgiven at once by Gilda. Never mind the fact that this man is a crook. Never mind the fact that this man thought it was okay to "punish" an adult woman for imagined sins as though she were a child. It is presented as was well within Johnny's right to literally imprison a woman for promiscuity, because Gilda accepts him, telling him that there is no need for him to apologize at all. It is well-known that women accept their abusers back into their lives time and time again. Here, however, the idea is glorified. It is presented as a "happy ending." This reinforces the idea that, had Gilda really been sleeping with other men, Johnny would have been justified in literally making a slave out of a promiscuous woman, especially since the film insinuates that Johnny feels guilty on behalf of himself and Gilda for their disloyalty towards Mundson. Does this, however, really make it acceptable for Johnny to force Gilda into feeling guilt and to suffer for it? A love-hate dynamic makes for some excellent lust, but not for a stable relationship. All too often Hollywood makes the dangerous lover seem sexy, appealing, and desirable. Here, in this film, this concept is taken to an alarming extreme. So see it for Rita Hayworth, if anything. But if you are expecting a sexy love story, with a 1940s casino and a case of murder as the backdrop, approach with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gilda" (1946) directed by Charles Vidor was as movie a breviary such as in how to deal with the promotion of a pin-up symbol, when darkness after the war in a night-club at Buenos Aires or the equivalent in other border. It brings up her brightness and luxury, for attracting and simultaneous repulsing men from her silhouette and charming way for the flash. It's a movie very modern, still enough gracious and enigmatic about the rule of a cartel in undercover trade, that aspires to control illegally a given region less developed and by its friction between the main stream of entertainment and the concealed subject, illustrates a mood and a way of acting of such a young character. Apparently lost for their common pleasure in a casino, whose owner - new husband of the just happy and untouched Gilda - gives the place there for the lover of his wife, when as acquaintance singing before in Montevideo or elsewhere. A quest for loving a child woman of such kind with a body that took the moonlight and violence from the jealous underground which held her for destroying rivalries above her own personality. It is supposedly the envision of change in Hispanic bottom of a given country, with a new military influence adverting Peronism just before the time. With her gloves pulled till the elbows on the stage as snaking with the arms above the head as style and glamor, as if it was to her a kind of languid allusion on deep concerning from her own attraction as symbolic gimmick. What does she make different her contribution for the myth of women from this same time as if she was a fake poisonous flower, who wake up carnivore misogyny under the mystery of night ? Maybe how she stays dressy and leans her brains or suddenly smiles for anybody in her circle of friends and admirers from the slums.This movie was by its shape a fiction that brought some willingness about war of sexes as common vulgarity and the main character of a woman for lovers frequenting nocturne life, at the time was also a motivation for a quest about her integrity and snake temperament, as if it was inherent to her own personality and decadence of human nature without succession in her heritage of patterns on the affluent society. The story of tungsten trade undisclosed by the owner of the casino, after Germany surrender in WWII, who fakes his own death, it is here merely an expedient to attract the viewers for the successively twists of the narrative, when the character of Gilda is here fixed as human commodity to swing anybody as a decoy for men, namely her Johnny whose integrity in this affair nonetheless does not resist at his own hate for that lavish young and beautiful woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been said that Rita Hayworth complained that her boyfriends "went to bed with Gilda and woke up with Rita," which I suppose, setting aside the statement about her image and how it affected her relationships, is supposed to imply that the personality of the character Gilda is powerfully sexy and glamorous and attractive. Well, maybe the fact that I was born in 1971 gives me a different set of standards than those men had when this movie came out...but Gilda is not someone I would want to date, or even sleep with, or even spend any time around at all. And Rita Hayworth isn't that good looking, either. And, for this movie to work, you really do need to believe that Rita Hayworth is drop dead gorgeous, and that the cold, openly selfish, unreliable, and manipulative Gilda is somehow intoxicating in her total lack of redeeming qualities. The revelations about her character which are meant to make her more sympathetic do not change the fact that she innately annoying. The character who is obviously meant to be seen as the villain is far and away the most sympathetic character in the film in my view, and I found the ending very unsatisfying. However, the first half of the movie, before the plot starts to get too complicated and the characters hard to watch, is full of witty dialog that fools you into thinking this film is going somewhere more worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After decades of avoiding it, I finally rented this, and was surprised to find myself hooked from the first shot. Then the amazing dialog snapped in. Then Johnny. Then Pio. Wow. Strange, I was scratching my head. No matter, it was still fun. Like a parallel universe version of Casablanca; hysterical lines in the script though, which had me howling. And Casablanca's weird gay subtext is back - times two - here.Quicker than a streetwalker becomes a hostess in Bob Le Flambeur, Johnny is running a casino. Character's motives instantly become bizarre and diffuse. The plot makes no sense. Only 'Rebecca' confounds viewers with nullifying reversals to a similar extent. I'm sure all the questions have been asked before, but here are mine: Why does Johnny immediately transform into a weird, defensive, vindictive best friend? "I hate you and to show how much I hate you I'm going to follow you everywhere, all the time." um, OK ...sure. What would happen if Johnny let Ballin find out Gilda was sleeping around? Since Ballin (eventually) has no respect for Johnny, so what's the fuss about? Even the best of friends wouldn't intercede to this degree. What is Gilda doing in all those hotels if she isn't really a cheap floozy? How does Gilda get Johnny's own club to let her perform an obviously rehearsed musical number? (What is this, the Lucy show?) Why does Johnny make her come back to Argentina if he hates her so much? Why even have Ballin come back for one crappy line and that weak, weak ending? As you watch, hoping against hope that the movie can resolve things imaginatively, you realize it's just never going to recover, and things indeed head south. These characters are demented. This plot is endless. But the first hour is abundant with entertainment. The writers do none of these characters any favors. Ford does a decent job, but he's miscast. Johnny would need to be the dominant, machismo type for these motivations to make sense. His leg-sweeping kick of a flunkie is utterly embarrassing. Instead of firming up his toughness, you just giggle. Hayworth will do for the hotty aspect of Gilda, but I can't believe she was a trained dancer. She's awful on her feet; she isn't given much in the way of choreography. She lumbers around like a quarterback to "Put the Blame on Mame." Throughout it, her posture is hunched over and profoundly unsexy. It's hard to imagine the on-screen audience enjoys these lazy performances. A drunk girl at last call could devise sexier choreography. It's that bad. I found all the numbers but the guitar version of Mame to be gratuitous. Both of the big numbers come quite late, after the movie's quality has started to tank. And please get all that tungsten plot line off the screen; a story thread wouldn't sink to a snooze level this deep, until airheads started blathering about trade federations &amp; blockades in Star Wars.

To turn this creaky vehicle into a menage a trois, Rita Hayworth, stumbles aboard. She shows lanky, coarse, and as much a Susie-one-note as Marilyn Monroe. The best character by far in the flick is a toilet attendant. It is hard to tell which proves more ludicrous... the actors, the pretend hard-boiled dialogue, the sophomoric plot, or the soap-opera ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a song and a movie go together like hand and glove through space and time:Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time, um gimme timeI heard somebody say, oh, "The older the grape, Sweeter the wine, sweeter the wine." Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow, It's growing stronger day by day, yeah, That's the price you've got to pay. Trust in me, baby, give me time, gimme time, please, a little more time. Takes a road runner just a little bit uh-longer, dear, Oh, to make up my mind, I gotta make up my mind. Oh, my love is like a seed, baby, just needs time to grow, It's growing stronger day by day, That's the price that we both got to pay. I gotta know, know that I'm ready, oh ready to settle down, 'Cause I think too much of your loving, baby, Yeah, I don't wanna mess your life around! So if you love me like you tell me that you're doing, dear, You shouldn't mind paying the price, any price, any price.

		<shortDescription>WHO IS GILDA?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is Gilda, when i see this movie i think that is about a girl called Gilda, but this movie for me called Johnny, because Johnny is the star in this movie. Rita is not a pretty woman, she´s ugly and is not a talented actress, but she sing good. Glenn Ford is only good, and the other actors is very weak. This movie is boring and very fool, i do not understand why this movie is a classic, there songs is good AMADO MIO, PUT THE BLAME OF MAMMY BOYS i like this song because i remember for the movie IN OLD CHICAGO star the wonderful Tyrone Power. But Gilda is not a good movie, is a weak movie, and Rita Hayworth is a weak actress, the story, everything is weak. it´s a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't imagine how this film gets such good reviews. Yes, Hayworth is beautiful. But even a beautiful women needs a plot. This film doesn't have one. Well, maybe it does. But not in the first hour I was able to endure before giving up. I don't see how I can write ten lines about this travesty, but I'll try in order to spare others the torment of having to watch it. The characters are totally uninteresting. Something like the Departed though without the violence. But in this case, it might have prevented one from falling asleep. Boy, this site would be a lot more useful if it didn't insist on ten lines. Maybe it's only for the movie mavens who can "appreciate" the pretentiousness of Gilda. Too bad. I need real people's reactions, not critics.</fullReview>
