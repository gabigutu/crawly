		<fullReview>The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars. This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.Saving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way. The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men. The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film. The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened. They don't fight for their country or "democracy" - they fight because they have to. The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades. Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.The characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast. Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie. After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable. In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill. When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: "You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!" To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.' Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal. Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.While the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar. They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles. George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes. You will not see more than two minutes of each.One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war. The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful. The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect. The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.`How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?' The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers. This is definitely not a party movie. There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing. Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having taken the time to read scores of reviews for TTRL (including IMDb ones here), I'm reminded of the movie subscript for this most controversial film: "Every man fights his own war." What a polarization exists amongst its viewers, and a lot of emotion both ways.I was stunned, moved, transfixed and totally absorbed by this film, even more so on subsequent viewings. I was one of the considerable number of people who, as the credits appear, sit quietly till one has to leave -- still stuck in the film's experience. I'm not angry at others who merely fell asleep. It's odd how some of the film's harsher critics seem compelled to vent their anger in disparaging comments against those who loved it -- most of those who liked the film were gentler in commenting on its critics.In contrast to what some have written, "The thin red line" has nothing to do with the British infantry in its imperial past. Jones referred to two related quotes in his excellent book, both having to do with a thin line between sanity and insanity. Whether "justified" or not, necessary or not, there is a lot of insanity in the war experience by anyone's definition of insanity.War exists and seems to recreate itself -- I never got the idea from Malick's film that he was preaching that we should just stop having wars. On the contrary, he takes war as a given in the human part of nature, and shows how individual human beings variously adapted (or mal-adapted!) in order to be able to keep eating, breathing and, yes, killing. The war experience is not primarily about shooting and blowing things up -- as Jones described from his own experience, it's largely about what happens between skirmishes -- strife and comradeship, fear and bravado, homesickness and freedom from past constraints, and waiting to die or to see a buddy die. People came, died, and were replaced -- much as portrayed by the cameo appearances in the film that confused or upset some viewers. Veterans always talk about how hard it is when you have to rely on your buddies (and feel for them) even though odds are most of them will die.What is most important to me (and it doesn't have to be for anyone else, I know that) is how the eternal themes of humanity are affected and expressed in such circumstances. All great works of art have something to do with the themes of beauty, pain, triumph, despair, good and evil. There's nothing wrong with entertainment as a diversion (The Matrix was fine fun); there's room both for film for fun and for film as art. Saving Ryan's Privates was mostly good entertainment (although I found it terribly manipulative and jingoistic), while TTRL explores the themes I mentioned above, never with easy answers. If you found the voice-overs heavy-handed, maybe it's because you're used to Hollywood telling us what to think and feel and thought Malick was doing the same. Watch again and see if he's not just giving us access to various individuals' often conflicting perspectives.As for those who think the film portrays "our soldiers" in a bad light, my family members who fought in WWII described their experiences and their reactions much as those shown in TTRL -- they were ordinary men, decent enough people, not heroes though sometimes unpredictably capable of the heroic, and devastated by their experiences. I'm proud of them for having done all they could to do what they felt was their responsibility, and to keep some humanity intact in spite of the horror. None of them told me they felt "ennobled" by war; they endured it and were badly hurt by it but didn't feel sorry for themselves, either.In TTRL I got to see this portrayed with such compassion I wept. Even the guy (Dale) who ripped gold teeth out of the mouths of dying Japanese soldiers was no stereotypical villain -- he has his moment of grace as do they all. No one's defenses are portrayed as impregnable, not even Witt's. No stereotype himself, we see him kill over a dozen soldiers in battle, while still trying to see God in the midst of the chaos. And what a powerful scene at his life's end, fulfilling his own striving for self-sacrifice, and recognizing in a moment of epiphany where his own immortality lie. Those who couldn't find a plot line in the film must have missed the first ten minutes...Maybe it's because of my own experience in life that I respond to this film so strongly. I endured and survived ten years of intense, inescapable unrelenting abuse as a child. I remember even as a small child trying to make sense of it all -- looking for the good, the reasons, God's plan, my purpose. Others who've survived trauma (in the Holocaust camps, on the cancer wards) often describe how such experiences focussed their attention on things that matter, beyond the physical realities they could not control. Ever since my childhood I've moved through life with a second awareness -- that examination and self-examination while "real time" goes on.That's what Malick portrayed, for me, in this film. Maybe you think that's "sophomoric" or "pretentious". It may not seem so when you're in the midst of a struggle, or on your death bed...DGHP. S. I organized a special screening of this film locally for a few friends -- 400 others paid to come, by word of mouth. Over a hundred sat spell-bound as the credits scrolled by -- hushed and not wanting to leave. Fellow wounded souls, some of them, I'll bet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most influential film of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Thin Red Line" is not an easy film to understand. It uses one of the most complex narrative structures yet produced by cinema to tell three stories (yes, it DOES have a plot): 1) the one the book wanted to tell (the book's title comes from a 19th century allusion to the British Empire's infantry [red uniforms] whose small numbers managed to 'protect' the British ["civilization" from their point of view] from the countless hordes of "savages" which the Empire ruled (this concept is regrettably racist). James Jones used this analogy to tell the story of how young American soldiers with no battlefield experience become bloodied veterans. 2) the fundamental paradox of war: to protect "civilization" (all that we hold dear) we are prepared to send young men to fight in wars. We know that in war they will see and do things that will turn them into the very "savages" that we are trying to prevent from destroying our civilization. If you believe that there are things even worse in the world than war (genocide, rule by the Axis powers) then war is not irrational, but the paradox mentioned above exists. 3) man is not distinct from nature but a part of it. Therefore, nature is both beautiful and cruel. (Like our civilization and war). To tell these stories Terence Malick used symbolic imagery, flashback, voice-overs, passages without dialogue, long close-ups of the actors' faces, changes in tempo and a haunting score. For example, his use of symbolism has been much criticized but everything has a purpose e.g. the crocodile entering the green algae covered water (nature's savagery), the native man who passes the company, after they land on the beach, walking in the opposite direction apparently oblivious of their presence (their shocked and bewildered faces reveal how they are forced to question the relevance of the reasons for which they may shortly die - the defense of civilization), the tree being choked by parasitic vines ('nature is cruel' as Lt. Col. Tall so aptly puts it), the bird being born as a soldier dies (it was not dying as many people thought - "we come from the earth and return to it" as we hear in the voice-overs), dogs eating a human corpse ("dog eat dog" - the soldiers are becoming desensitized to the violence) the same crocodile, now dead, at the end of the film being carried away as a sort of trophy (danger has receded for the moment), the coconut sprouting a palm on the empty beach in the last scene (after death comes birth - the cycle of life). There are, of course, many, many other examples. The use of flashback accompanied by voice-over to convey feelings as opposed to narrate a story must have appeared strange to anyone who never saw Alain Resnais' "Hiroshima Mon Amour". It was used most effectively with Ben Chaplin's character (Pvt. Jack Bell) when he thinks of his wife back home - incidentally he idolizes her in the same way we do our own culture - another metaphor. His disillusionment is profound and shows that what he was prepared to die for was only as pure as any ideal. It is often say that there was no character development. This is also false. For example, in the scene where Sgt. Welsh is speaking to Witt shortly after his arrest for being AWOL , Welsh seems to claim that it is every man for himself when he says that individual sacrifice is worthless, there is no world but this one and that each man must get through the war the best that he can. However, we subsequently see him risking his life to deliver morphine to a MORTALLY wounded man during the frontal assault on the Japanese machine gun nests. Also, Witt can not understand where evil comes from in the midst of the beauty he sees in the Melanesian village, but when he returns there he sees man arguing, enemy skulls, crabs hideously crawling around on an outstretched human hand and a child's back covered with insect bites while those people around it are seemingly uncaring. These images suggest that evil is inherent in man. Malick avoids the usual stereotypes. Although we see heroic acts (such as the taking of the machine gun nests by Capt. John Gaff's [John Cusack] team of volunteers), there are no recognizable heros. It is true that the characters are not sharply defined. When the violence comes it is against all of them i.e. all of US. Are there then any relevant negative criticisms of the movie? I would say that it did not meander as some critics alleged (every scene has a purpose) but it was unnecessarily long. There is a certain irony in this. It is said that Malick edited over 100 hours of material first to 9 hours. Understandably the studio did not accept this. He then reduced it to 6 hours and then to 3. (This helps to explain the lightning appearances by John Travolta and George Clooney, I see no problem, however, with using big name stars in such short roles - Richard Attenborough did it in "A Bridge Too Far"). With so much cherished material available, I suspect that Malick fell into the trap of opting for the maximum length that the studio would allow when more artistically efficient editing would have reduced the film to 2* hours. The balance between the action and meditative passages would have worked better if certain scenes had been cut, such as Witt's passing a wounded soldier on the way back to his company after leaving the Melanesian village the second time and also the conversation that Witt and Welsh have towards the end of the film (Welsh appears a stranger to him, suggesting that he is simply a troublemaker). Even with the exclusion of these scenes Witt would still appear a humanist and Welsh a complex "every man". Most people would agree that the film is visually stunning. As there has been very little even remotely similar in the past, it will be confusing for many people but I am convinced that this will come to be seen as a hugely important work - the most influential of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what many people do not know is that this film, directed by terence malick, is without question the reason that Shakespeare in Love won the best picture oscar over the much favored Saving Private Ryan. why am i saying this? first let's deal with the movie. long? yes. too much? sometimes. but is it good? i can not begin to describe the beauty of this film.about the oscars, i only watched the film after its surprise nomination for best picture. i had seen the competition already, and it was time to check out the fifth nominee. i went to the theatre myself, and came out three hours later, went home, and i cried. not only because i was disturbed, but i loved every single character in the film. i wanted to be there for them, cry with them, fight their battle. many people who have watched the film have said the same thing to me.the Thin Red Line is sometimes painful to watch, but only because of its realistic juxtaposition of humanity, philosophy, and the terror of war. the film does not delve into any historical fact about Guadalcanal, except that the battle itself was terrifying (as is any battle). the characters introduce themselves through voice-over narration, which accompanies much of the action. and speaking of action, there is not much in the film. more images. images of war and the lives these soldiers left behind. this was Terence Malick's intent, of course, and many people were insulted and thought it was his own pretentious self getting the best of him. "boy he's a genius.. must he show it??" sometimes it is a little pretentious, but the film would've been "just another WWII film" if it was out of Malick's hands.i can not understand why Sean Penn is billed as the top actor or the main character of this film. he was there a lot, but the film is carried by Jim Caviezel as the beautiful and ethereal private Witt. words can not describe this performance. with as few lines as he had, Caviezel portrays the symbolic soul of Witt, and by the end of the film he will break your heart. also excellent performances from Nick Nolte and the understated Elias Koteas, who can stretch creepy (Crash) to sympathetic in the blink of an eye.now.. let's consider hollywood. sure they love Spielberg, and sure Private Ryan was a masterpiece (and it really was), but nobody even expected the Thin Red Line to get seven oscar nods, especially for best picture. but Shakespeare in Love was the crowd pleaser, and the other two were epic war films. most hollywood "artsy" people are anti-war.. kind of like the Thin Red Line. Private Ryan seemed to be MUCH more patriotic "pro-america" than the other. so if we've got anti-war on one side, and patriotism on the other... open and shut. the votes were split between the two, and Shakespeare emerged victorious. too bad.anyway... the Thin Red Line was definitely better than Shakespeare, and definitely a completely different film from Spielberg's. John Toll's cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score work together to convey the tone of Malick's lyrical and poetic direction, and both should have won oscars. this film is nothing short of breath-taking, though understandably not for the average american moviegoer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's Heavenly War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is unlikely to be appreciated by audiences reared upon a diet of dumbed-down Hollywood action fare. However, if you're prepared to sit down and watch THE THIN RED LINE with no interruptions and give it the attention it deserves, you'll be rewarded with one of the most intelligent, poetic and stunningly beautiful films you're ever likely to see.Director Terrence Malick's films are alive with a sense of pure cinema with every frame delivering such detail and richness that you could swear you were there. The only other person capable of bringing such an immediate sense of time and place and sheer nuance of film (although in a completely different way) is David Lean, another major league craftsman.Here, again, Malick uses his customary voice-over device although this time as a means of vocalising the abstract thoughts of the various soldiers as they struggle to make some sense of the conflict. It's an interesting approach which allows the audience to identify with the characters in a far less superficial way than in, say, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (the film THE THIN RED LINE is most often and most unfairly compared to). Malick is also not afraid to take time to illustrate the continuing natural backdrop to the carnage. Mother Nature almost seems to be occupying a pivotal supporting role as a detached observer on the sidelines, calmly and inscrutably watching the chaos develop.It's a measure of Malick's complete disinterest with the normal conventions of Hollywood that actors such as Lucas Haas, Vigo Mortensen, Jason Patric, Mickey Rourke, Martin Sheen and Billy Bob Thornton all spent months in Queensland Australia and the Solomon Islands filming roles that ultimately ended up on the cutting room floor. Blink and you'll also miss major marquee players such as John Travolta and George Clooney. The stand-out performances come from Jim Caviezel and, especially, Nick Nolte.Nolte just seems to be getting better and better as he gets older and his portrayal of tyrant Colonel Tall is something to see. I have never seen anyone express such an impotent sense of rage, anger and fury than Nolte does here. It's a fantastic performance from a real pro and it's a mystery to me why he didn't get an Oscar.John Toll's pristine cinematography and Hans Zimmer's wonderfully evocative (Oscar-winning) score are other strong elements. The unusual music and visuals contrast so well that Malick sometimes fades out the noise of the shouting, explosions and guns, an effect that only serves to heighten the emotional power of the experience further.You won't see a more beautiful film about the horrors of war. Movies like this make the task of trawling through the weekly diet of dumb formulaic junk served up by Hollywood almost seem worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting exploration of the meanings of life, death and war through the eyes of a group of disenchanted soldiers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautifully crafted and haunting films that I have ever seen. Not only is the amazing ensemble cast give truly beautiful, effective performances, but the direction and cinematography combines to create a magnificent visual and mental feast. This story about the Guadalcanal campaign during WW2, based on the James Jones novel, weaves the lives of many characters together seemlessly, creating a philosophical/emotional experience of war. It's not just about war. It's about love, faith in yourself and others, friendship, humanity, morality and also works as a startling indictment of man's conflict with nature. The amazing opening sequence, sets up a tranquility as the character Witt, finds peace on a secluded island among the natives, a peace which is shattered by the war. What follows is not a mindless battle-after-battle onslaught of pyrotechnics, smoke, dust and blood, but a thought-provoking, visually and verbally poetic analysis of war and humanity. In my opinion it is the greatest war film since Apocalypse now, which I believe bears more flaws than this. It's not an Us-and-Them war story about the glory of the USA defeating the evil Japs. It sticks close with the characters, as we hear the thoughts, their hopes, their fears, leading to a moving experience. This film was released a few months after Saving Private Ryan and unfortunately did not experience the same attention that the latter film did. Ryan was an excellent film, but to offer a comparison, The Thin Red LIne treads where Ryan didn't dare. Ryan sat in the safe territory of Good vs Evil with a bit of Futility of War and a lot of American Patriotism. It seemed to be more about America at some points than about war. The Thin Red Line is about war, the people involved and the destruction it creates for the mind, the soul and for nature. It does not deviate from this to make simple contrasts and offer easy binary oppositions. In fact, TTRL is not an easy film. Gasp, it even tries to make you think. Though the title is not really explained in the film, I believe it is implied, and could have many meanings - the line between sanity and insanity, morality and immorality, love and hate, companionship and loneliness, nature and man, war and peace. While the characters share their thoughts, deeply poetic as they are, the meaning is not thrown in your face and neither is the answer to the questions raised. In this way it is the most thought-provoking war film I've ever seen and one of the best films of all time in my book. Top ten easily. Now to my whinge. I think TTRL was shunned unmercifully at the 1999 Oscars. Shakespeare in Love beat two brilliant films - TTRL and Elizabeth - to get that oscar, and don't get me started on Gwyneth's award. This is the best film of 1998/9, in line with Elizabeth. It's unfortunate that the two, thoug h greatly revered, did not achieve the success and attention they deserved. Don't be afraid by its length, it's a beautiful journey, full of rich colour, sound and the reward is a deeply moving human experience, unlike any other that the past decade has offered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different, enthralling war film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line has no real hero and no real plot to speak of. Due to its release the same year as Saving Private Ryan it will forever be linked to Spielberg's anti-war opus. Yet, "TRL" deserves to be compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 due to it's style and distance from the audience. The film's only character is the Charlie Company and the conflict is between humankind itself. Director Terrance Malik asks profound questions and unlike "Ryan," doesn't expect them to be answered because they simply can't be answered. Like 2001, the viewer is left with more questions than answers at the end of the film and is told in stunning visual fashion. Some critics have pointed out various flaws in the film; however, these traits are what sets TRL apart form it's peers. The stars like John Travolta and George Clooney have little screen time. They are the officers who command attention and are larger than life to the simple GI's who do the real work (and most of the acting in the film.) The characters are mostly unrecognizable and you know little about them save the main characters like Pvt. Bell. But, the faces are meant to be unrecognizable; to paraphrase the film they are simply flesh and meat made from the earth simply to return back to it. Those who criticise the lack of violence in some scenes while labeling the other scenes intense don't realize the intensity the fight scenes generalize are due to the fact that the soldiers don't know when their next battle will be and when their last breath will take place. The main character, Charlie Company, is fighting to stay alive, the only real driving force of the plot. All of the characters have different views of the war, shown through the use of random spoken narrative. There is no easy conclusion to the war and the film starts off where it began, among the animals of the pacific. Life is one huge circle and one could guess the battle for the bunker on top of the hill could be fought again and there is no possible way to stop it, (At least that is what I was able to muster of the film itself.) For myself the most haunting image was the scene when the Americans stare at their Japanese enemy after capturing the hill. Both sides seem to realize that they could be on the other side of the battle and that in war there really is no good vs. bad scenario, just what nation you're from and who you are trying to kill. Yet the question asked is why war occurs and why we must fight each other. On that note, we still have no answers. The acting and sound are superb. The direction, editing, and score are all Oscar caliber. I don't shrink from saying that TRL is the best film of 1998 and one of the greatest war films of all time; (and contrary to what some are trying to say it is a war film, that is at its core.) TRL is the only film to ever make my knees tremble and haunt me days after I saw it. If you see it, I'm sure your opinions will be just as strong as mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poem of a picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is three hours of movie poetry. "Saving Private Ryan," though brilliantly made, is a jingoistic cartoon by comparison. "Thin Red Line" follows a company of American rifleman brought in to consolidate the Allied grip on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal in 1942 in the face of Japanese invasion, but the place could be just about anywhere where war is fought.The company is not made up of conscripts but regular soldiers. Some of them have been in the Army more than 10 years. Some of them however have never seen real action before and this is a hot and uncomfortable location, despite the lovely tropical scenery. Some crack up, some die, some do heroic deeds. Their leaders are not particularly admirable; one is quite happy to get his men killed if he can come out of the action looking good.Out of sight for most of the film are the Melanesian inhabitants, the Solomon Islanders, who are carrying on living as best they can while the war rages around them. Their serenity is in sharp contrast to the frenetic military activity. Of course, there is nowhere for them to go.There is some action excitingly filmed but as in real wars much of the time is spent preparing and waiting. Personal stories unfold but at the end it is survival that matters.The lighting and photography is quite superb, the lighting in particular fitting the mood perfectly. Filming was not actually on Guadalcanal but near Port Douglas in Northern Queensland where there is similar tropical rainforest and fauna but with much easier logistics. It took ages apparently but seems more than worth the effort.This is probably one of the four or five greatest war films ever made, right up there with "All Quiet on the Western Front, " "Paths of Glory," "Bridge on the River Kwai" and "The Longest Day." Never has a movie better portrayed what it's like to be a frontline soldier.Terrence Malick has the reputation of being an eccentric, difficult director - Kubrick without the fear of flying. Yet this is not a particularly unconventional movie - it's just that everything hangs together - the story, dialogue, performances, photography and settings. On thing is clear - this is a better interpretation of James Jones' novel than the 1964 version. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very sorry I didn't get to see this film in the theatre. It is a beautifully filmed masterpiece with a superb story, excellent acting (esp. Nick Nolte), and a great script. It takes things way deeper than Saving Private Ryan or most other modern war movies dare to go. Very introspective and dreamy at times, with the camera constantly dwelling on faces, animals, and the landscape. Merrick is never in a hurry, and this pace suits the film well.The Thin Red Line asks a lot of good questions about death, war, and the ultimate meaning of life. Now that I have seen it, I'm very surprised that this film did not win picture of the year. Spielberg's film was a gritty, realistic portrayal of war. But it was also highly commercial and had a very contrived plot. In comparison, this film sort of wanders through itself and in the process helps to put you in the boots of the soldiers it portrays.My only criticism is perhaps the film was a bit long, but I never noticed that the second time through. I can't praise this film enough. Excellent work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was about 7, I first saw Rocky on TV and I didn't really understand it. It wasn't until I was 18 that I came to the conclusion, that it was the greatest movie ever made. At 22, that all changed when I first saw On The Waterfront. Fully aware now that Brando was a god. The ultimate male. Never not shocking, bruiting desire. At 24 it was a toss up between Eyes Wide Shut and Casablanca. Cruise controls a certain air and Bogart was the coolest guy to ever live. Now I am at the crossroads of life and The Thin Red Line.This movie just does it for me. The fact that the whole story is told through poetry is quite a unique thing to do. To tell a story through words. And nowadays, by doing so they take a lot of risks. In all fairness this movie sacrifices capturing the general audience, for words that go together so beautifully. I wish more people could understand how great this movie really is and not try to compare it to other classics like Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now. It's a different kind of war movie. This one's on humility's side.Though it took me some time, The Thin Red Line has become my favorite war movie. I've always been a fan of Penn, this movie introduced me to Caviezel. He seems to capture his part with a justful beauty.It's hard for me to pick a favorite scene. The dialog between Penn and Caviezel is powerful. I have to admit that the conversations between him and Penn made the movie for me. They seem to be trying to out act each other. For example, when Caviezel says that he is twice the man that Penn is in one of the opening scenes. Penn gives him this look. I can only describe as a peaceful calm. One of intelligence that comes with age. Instead of overreacting to the comment, he sits back and understands it. I guess that's more of the writer's doing, but it is a beautiful thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Stunning And Philosophically Daring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most visually stunning and philosophically daring war films ever made. In 1978, Terrence Malick made the hit classic 'Days of Heaven', for 20 years after its release, Malick didn't create a single film, that was until the release of 1998's World War II epic 'The Thin Red Line; my God was the wait worth it. 'The Thin Red Line' is a complex and moving depiction of war that happens to act as one of the most realistic portrayals of WWII ever displayed, both visually and psychologically. Literally Malick emerged from hiding to create this gem of a classic that portrays the chaos of war. Despite being the same release year as the much more successful 'Saving Private Ryan', Malick's war flick will go down in Hollywood history as a truly special masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PRETENTIOUS, PRETENTIOUS, PRETENTIOUS, I have seen many 3 hour films, but none has ever dragged as much as this thing. The middle hour was especially excrutiating to endure. Constantly throughout this mess actors dressed as soilders pause and make "ironic" and bloated voiceovers to the images that appear on the screen. There is no real character development, you never feel like your watching real people. You feel like your watching some pompous-ass Juilliard screenwriter give his version of what he thinks combat might be like. I watched the entire movie out of pure shock and awe that such a long-winded wreck could be concieved, filmed and released.Stanley Kubrick once commented that movies had gotten so cliched and routine that he had hoped that someone would someday develop an entire new way to structure a story. Perhaps thats what Terrence Mallick was attempting with "The Thin Red Line". For me though, it was a complete failure and an absolute ordeal to sit through that I hope to never repeat.One of the worst ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is quite simply one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of enduring. With the possible exception of the cinematography, this film has no redeeming qualities. The arrogance of the director and cast that they might actually pass this movie off as "deep" is sickening. Basically, in the three LONG hours of this film, only about twenty minutes of dialogue are spoken: hardly enough to offer any hope of character development for the movie's endless cast leading men. Another third of the movie is occupied by long pauses voiced-over with "poetic" inner monologue which sounds like it was written by an over-ambitous (and overly confident) college film major. (e.g. "The closer you get to Caesar, the more you fear.") And as for the critical praise of the film, I am baffled; I guess Terrence Mallick should be congratulated for his modern-day version of "The Emperor's New Clothes".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THIN RED LINE is the story of Company C, a U.S. Army unit during the World War II battle of Guadalcanal. It must attack a hill occupied by Japanese soldiers. You now know the entire plot of THE THIN RED LINE, and yes, it is every bit as boring as it sounds.THE THIN RED LINE is subject to the same critique as THE PHANTOM MENACE: it's nobody's story. Most of the characters (with two merciful exceptions) are boring and literally interchangeable; more than one reviewer has confused one character with another.The voice-over narration consists of maundering banalities disguised as philosophy. At one point one of the G.I. narrators (who? who knows or cares?) mumbles, "Who's killing us?" The Japanese soldiers are killing you, of course! And you're killing them! What could be more obvious or banal? Another pompously suggests that all humans are part of one universal soul. Are we seriously to believe that two men such as Col. Tall and Cap. Staros, with such different outlooks on life and diametrically opposite reactions to violence, have the same "soul?"Oddly for a movie so obsessed with imagery (particularly of the lush jungle), THE THIN RED LINE consistently tells us what is happening to the characters, rather than showing us. Officers beg for water for their men, lest the poor sods pass out, but we never see a soldier pass out or even gulp the last drip from a canteen. Show us, Malick! Show us the crusted salt dried on the baked skin of a man who has no water left in his body for sweat! Show us the field surgeon losing his ability to care what happens to the men, don't just have him tell us about it! Show us Arnold Schwarzenegger getting blown to pieces while Rick Moranis survives, don't give us a line like, "No matter how strong or well trained you are, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you're going to get it." Show us what's happening to the people, not to the !@#$% papaya tree!The movie is also scandalously inaccurate. Any war veterans in the audience will giggle to see two dozen Japanese voluntarily surrender to Company C alone. In reality, Japanese soldiers were almost never captured alive, and when they were it was usually because they were too badly hurt to resist further. Even worse is the portrayal of the native Solomon Islanders, who are made out as living a serene and peaceful life untouched by the war. In fact, the natives of Guadalcanal were very unhappy about being invaded by the Japanese, and made crucial contributions to the American victory by carrying water, ammunition and other supplies to the troops, rescuing American wounded, and as coastwatchers warning the G.I.'s of attack by air or sea. All of this was at great risk to their lives. The movie's treatment of them as passive flower children is inaccurate, patronizing and downright insulting. Also, the idea of a soldier with multiple AWOL offenses not being court-martialled is absurd. This is World War II, when they shot Private Slovik for desertion.In all fairness, the cinematography is breathtaking. Also, the acting is uniformly high-quality, with Nick Nolte as Col. Tall and Elias Koteas as Cap. Staros providing very strong performances, especially considering the weakness of the script they had to work with. The battle scenes are kinetic, giving you the feeling you are charging alongside the troops, and they manage to convey some pathos despite the film's refusal to let us connect with the characters. Only these elements save THE THIN RED LINE from being a total loss.Bloody but detached, contemplative but witless, visually beautiful but emotionally dead, THE THIN RED LINE is not worth renting. Hard-core film buffs might want to watch it on TV for the acting and for John Toll's flawless cinematographic technique.Rating: ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in the theater when it came out. I just re-watched it on DVD. Anti-war, yes, it is. Artsy, yes. What bothers me the most about this movie is that it is really a Vietnam war movie, characters expressing anti-war and anti-authority sentiments not found in WW2. If these actions and characters were set in Vietnam, I'd rate it higher.But it is not. I've studied WW2 for over 30 yrs and been in the military. Soldiers did not refuse orders back then. They rarely do so now. Yes, soldiers learn of the horrors and waste of war.The Japanese did not surrender in WW2 as depicted in this movie - they killed themselves or made banzai charges, but they died rather than surrender. The battle scenes lacked realism, the explosions looked like something from the 1960's. The terrain doesn't look like Guadecanal. Soldiers were terribly thirsty but back then they 'manned up'. Colonels didn't have friendly chats with Captains to get them to attack. They gave orders and it was done.Anti War and the horrors can be depicted in much tighter, shorter scripts than this. I agree the director was self-indulgent and is vastly overrated as an artist.</fullReview>

Reilly, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, Sean Penn, etc., these guys playing soldiers is about as believable if they had used PeeWee Herman, Judge Joe Brown, Steve-O, Rush Limbaugh, and Clay Aiken...I watched this movie with my grandfather who was actually in Guadalcanal...he actually laughed out loud at some of the scenes and dialog and it wasn't because this movie had any humor, this was a guy who had to turn off Saving Private Ryan after about 10 minutes because the scenes reminded him too much of the war and he wasn't in the German campaign.PROS - excellent cinematography, an unintentional hilarious scene of John Travolta playing a WWII military...uh actually all these half of the cast in military uniforms is funny CONS - almost 3 hours of boredom with endless pseudo-art dream sequences, flashbacks, and similar stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wittgenstein's Red Line of Abstraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met Malick in 68-69 at MIT where I was taking a degree in philosophy. MIT had the decade before gone through a soul-searching re-evaluation of the type of scientist it was producing, and concluded that they could do much better in working toward well-rounded citizens. So by the end of the 60's they had collected - for a few years only - perhaps the strongest collection of newly emergent thinkers in the humanities. And it was quite a rich stew of ideas for a young person, the most exciting place in the world for the humanities for perhaps five years.Malick came in with this pack, concerned with newly emerging ideas about meaning and language. The philosophy establishment was forming a new split (US and Continentals) largely characterized by how to reinvent Wittgenstein's insights but with a more friendly rationale. Chomsky was shaking one world, formal abstraction for computers another. Exciting --- moreso than today. But Malick was not a verbal communicator, nor a logician, nor an academic (all sides of the same thing). So he dove into practical visual semiotics.He is not a brilliant man, merely a journalist. But he does seem to be particularly honest and understands some damned good, solid, human ideas compared to other filmmakers. One can really see this early MIT exposure in 'Red Line.'We can thankfully forget plot -- there is not meant to be any story. In fact, the war is only used here as a canvas of motion, abstractions of 'regular' life, colliding and sometimes adhering to souls, sometimes destroying them. The device is to build the film around the sounds: narrative voiceovers (current and remembered), natural sounds, haunting music. The images are attached to the sounds, which are derived from abstractions. This is exactly the reverse of Spielberg, which is why there cannot be any comparison to 'Private Ryan,' or any other film that is 'about' something. It is why Malick can never 'explain' his films.The execution is hypnotic. I wonder what the six-hour version is like. The editing (and particularly of the sound) is unusual, so transports us beyond the strangeness of tropics, war, history. That editing is much like Van Morrison's music: it establishes the rhythm only as a reference to dance around, peeking in and out. The relationship of the rhythm within the shots to the rhythm of the shots is very bluesy.Having no story opens new possibilities and creates unfamiliar problems. An opportunity is that the film can have many centers: the meditator in the midst of the attack on the camp; the squabble of the villagers; the transport of the ship; the need to look at our own dogtags. The challenge is how to end. When you stick to a formula like Spielberg, you just turn the crank and the climax lifts and comes down, and the story finishes. No story, no formula, so Malick brackets with the transport to and from the island, by the aging of the southern rookie, and by the exit from and re-entry to a world of unfamiliar characters. That they are played by familiar actors (Travolta, Clooney) oddly emphasizes the point.It must have been educational to work on this film, which is why every intelligent actor (or an actor with an intelligent agent) wanted to participate: one can see direct influence in Penn's 'The Pledge' and Cusack's 'High Fidelity,' both highly abstract.Penn knew exactly what he was doing here. He moves in the action, as an actor must. But he places his character offscreen in the abstract voiceovers. That's the 'real' Welsh, and the film's image only an abstraction. He truly understands presenting many dimensions simultaneously. Harrelson doesn't, but that's the point with Keck. I wonder why Depp didn't make the cut?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if I watched the same flick as the others who have had positive things to say about this movie ... I just found this movie to be lacking and dragging. This one isn't for the faint of heart folks.The plot is pretty basic. It could have been better executed by cutting some of the unnecessary elements. As is, it drags the movie out and makes it very difficult to watch. The movie as a whole could have benefitted from cutting a half an hour out of it. As is, it is nearly unwatchable to me. I have no problem with peaks and valleys in a movie, in fact I believe that peaks and valleys are keys to holding the audience through the picture. This film is just one long valley though.I was impressed with the talent associated with this movie. I recognized may names and thought that such a group would surely translate into a great performance overall. As it is, not one of the characters in this movie gave me any reason to care. I just didn't feel any energy from them. They were just too flat and one dimensional.Some of the scenes were above average in this film, particularly the jungle scenes, but after other war films, these scenes also came off as a little flat. Locations were exotic enough. The actual visuals of the movie just didn't hit me. I'm not asking for Matrix special effects, but something. I just didn't get that out of the film.All in all, it is one movie that I just couldn't take. I didn't get a sense of urgency, wrong or anything out of this movie. It just didn't move me intellectually or emotionally. It has to be the movie I've been the most disappointed with in the last 3 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two camps or Where's the Hollywood exec when you need him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes directors get so great everyone is afraid to edit their "masterpieces".Reading the other commentators, I see two camps: I didn't get/how could you not get it.I think I got it. I saw the movie basically as a commentary on the paradox of nature as both beautiful and cruel. Take the Eden-like first scene and the symbolic nature of that one soldier's perfect beautiful "good" wife. Later in the movie, both idealizations of nature turn out to be false. The "good" wife turned bad reminded me of Conrad's one symbolic female character in Heart of Darkness turned on its head.Basically, nature vs. man is a false dichtomyNature as paradise via Theocritus versus nature as wilderness via the Bible, another false dichotomy.In Hegalian terms, what is the synthesis? What is the true view of nature? Can it be expressed with words, or only imagery and poetry? Sorry for the intellectual allusions, but I think this is where the movie was going.What is nature and what is man's place in it? Tough questions, Malick has no answers. Unfortunately he spent three hours on it. Meaningless dialogue and pseudo-intellectual babble use up at least an hour of screen as the movie never ends.Within this quagmire of crap is an astounding battle scene, a brilliant performance by Nick Nolte, amazing cinematography, some half-developed fascinating themes.Like the last 45 minutes of Apocalapse Now, this movie was too ambitious. If the director would have just saved face, cut the hour of crap, the movie would have been just as profound, more entertaining, just as ambigious in a good way, and well, just plain awesome.What a waste of potential. There really was a masterpiece hidden in there. To think, the irony is -- if the film had the discipline of commercialism it would have made better art.</fullReview>

It didn't help that all the TV spots billed it as an action movie and just about all the action scenes were in the 60 second spot (all crammed in). Now I like anti-war films as well as patriotic fares so, I can watch both "All quite on the Western Front" or "Sands of Iwo Jima" and share the same appreciation for both. Or just enjoy a period piece without any action. That said.... "GOD THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!" It was just to much of this one soldier rambling on, and on about what was supposed to be deep poetic crap, something like: "Who are You forest to be mad at me for seeing You" or something. No I wasn't high when I saw this it was just so bad that my brain shut down. Clearly all the money of this bomb went to hiring name brand actors for bit parts. But the story was so lame nd incoherent, in fact it's the only WW2 film ever to make me root for the Axis forces. I was just waiting for the Japanese to shoot the guy, and cheered the Japanese on when they did! And people were actually walking out of the theater and not returning. Something I wish I had the intelligence to do. But I kept on telling myself it would get better. Alas it didn't:( And if Your going to make a WW2 film without a lot of action thats fine, BUT NEVER, EVER, EVER: Bill it as an action film!</fullReview>

If the men in WWII were truly as they were depicted in this film, we could not possibly have won the war. There is no character development, there are irritating poetic/preachy voice-overs, overly long scenes of closeups of actors' faces - just staring at the camera - and on and on and on. There is NO STORY. My companion and I left the theater, as did a dozen other patrons, after 2 hours with no end in sight. One thing I will grant Terrence Mallick, he knows how to use the camera to film beautiful scenes utilizing sunlight and skies. STAY HOME ON THIS ONE!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's tempting sometimes for those who write a movie review to treat it as a math test: count the mistakes to see how good it is.Terrence Malick's sprawling, humanistic The Thin Red Line transcends that. In theory, its flaws are there for all to see. Structurally, it's a mess. It's too long. Pacing in the second half is cumbrous and stammering, the task to squeeze a final cut from all filmed material reportedly herculean. Cameos by celebrities like Clooney or a pencil moustached Travolta in unsubstantial roles feel more a jarring distraction than an asset.And yet... as John Toll's luscious cinematography drives us through atolls and crystal-clear waters, vines and jungles pierced by sun rays, with crocodiles sinking in swamps and bright red snakes slithering on emerald grass, something unique happens. The Thin Red Line goes beyond a war movie about Guadalcanal and becomes richly textured, engrossing epic. Armies clash, and so do different philosophies. Malick plays with time and memory, quotes Proust, Homer and the Gospel, imbues the movie with a mystical quality. The five major players - Caviezel, Koteas, Penn, Chaplin and Nolte - provide deeply felt performances, while Zimmer crafts an haunting score enriched by Melanesian songs of rare beauty.Malick's best, and on the short list of cinema's greatest movies, The Thin Red Line is a breathing, pulsating thing, incomplete and flawed and awe-inspiring as life itself can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some reviews of this movie will try to tell you that this film will only appeal to intelligent people.This insinuates that anyone who hates this film must be unintelligent without any appreciation for art or different ways of cinematically portraying a subject matter.DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE SWAYED BY PEOPLE SUCH AS THIS.This film is drivel of the first order. To this day, it remains the benchmark by which I measure all other films. I call it 'the thin red line factor' i.e. - How many times would I want to watch a given movie (back to back) before having to watch the TRL even ONCE? Eg - Star Wars scores something like a 12. Rambo III scores maybe a 2.Yes, that right - I would rather watch Rambo III twice over than sit through the TRL even once.THIS FILM IS THAT BAD.Do not allow other people to tell you this movie is worthwhile. It isn't. It has no redeeming features.The film studio knew this and had to vastly over-egg the cast line-up just to pull punters in. George Clooney was the headline name in the UK and only appeared at the very end for maybe thirty seconds.I have NEVER before or since been in a film where the audience was leaving in droves. After about an hour, there was a steady stream of people leaving and actually heckling at the screen on their way out.Are you getting the picture yet of just how bad this film is? The plot is there but could be told in half an hour but instead is drawn out over THREE hours with wildlife shots, bad poetry and cut-scenes that have very little bearing on anything.The result is a film that is so mind numbingly slow and pretentious that all you end up doing is resenting the director for force feeding us his so called vision without once thinking about how his audience might be interpreting his inane ramblings.Insecure people who pretended to like this film will tell you how 'real' it makes the horror of war. GARBAGE - If you want reality of war (as much as you can get in a film anyway) then watch SP RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS.I used to put great store in the IMDb rating system until I saw this film rated a 7.2 Do not be fooled. You will never get your three hours back. As someone else has rightly said - it's too late for me but you can still save yourself.</fullReview>

Maybe my vision has been tainted some what by films like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Platoon", but I found this film totally unengaging. Combined with the fact that this film could have been based in the Second World War, Vietnam war or the banana U boat war, because you can`t tell - other than it`s in the pacific.

		<shortDescription>Too many stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline on this movie, "Every man fights his own war" is disturbingly apt. I say it's apt because we get to see the private war of several of these men. Unlike most movies, which focus on one, maybe two main plots (plot and subplot) this movie gets far too carried away with too many stories. Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, Jim Caviezel, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney and others each played a top-billing kind of role. Each of them had a story that we were supposed to care about. But that's too many stories, and in the end the movie comes across as scattergun and ad hoc. Two stories handled well, and I'd have been happy. But that many? Sorry, it's all a bit much.Look at Saving Private Ryan. Two main stories - Tom Hanks' character and his journey, and James Ryan. The rest is important, and valuable. The young communications officer, for one. Tom Sizemore's crusty sergeant. But Hanks' Capt Miller was the man with the real journey, and we care about him, which is why we keep watching.A friend who knows some of the crew from the filming of Thin Red Line (in North Queensland) tells me that much of the cinematography involved wandering through the rainforest filming filler of shrubs and birds and dripping water. And watching the film, I'd believe it. The photography was breathtaking, but in my opinion a movie needs more than pretty pictures to deserve a Best Picture Oscar nomination. A story, for example. A real, human story with characters you care about. I don't think it's too much to ask.</fullReview>

Some people said that this movie was going to be "Saving Private Ryan's" competition. It doesn't even come close, Saving Private Ryan was way better. What the Thin Red Line needed was more action, it also needed to be shorter and not have people narrate it. The Thin Red Line does have good action scenes but not a lot of action, and it also had good acting but that's it it wasn't as sad or entertaining as Saving Private Ryan. 5/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend warned me that this movie was too "deep." He was right. The ridiculous flashbacks were very distracting. The nature scenes were beautiful but out of place. I had heard the author of the book was trying to get across the idea that war is totally against nature. The second to last scene in "Platoon " with the deer walking through the battlefield was much more powerful than any nature scene in this film. I had to keep telling myself that this was a film about WWII and not Vietnam. It tries to be a great war movie, but will probably be quickly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful pretentious tripe, lacking the talent to pull it off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I hate this movie is the same reason I hate Terrence Malick as a director. This movie is slightly better than his truly abysmal Days of Heaven, but only just. He gives us dialog, but it is inconsistent or unintelligible at best. He gives us a plot, but it is weak and disjointed with no continuity. He provides us characters, but never delves into their motivations. He showers us with breathtaking images, but without purpose. My point is this: if you give us these things, flesh them out or don't bother. Just don't do a half-assed job of it!You see, I understand what Malick is trying to accomplish. I hate miserable Hollywood tripe as much as anyone. He wants to emphasize that he need not conform to Hollywood standards of plot, or characters, or dialog. I wholeheartedly agree with this philosophy. I don't need to be spoon-fed like the typical American viewer with a 8 year old's attention span. There have been great films that lack some of these components. Kurosawa was a master of this. Kiarostami still is. When Malick tries to pull this off, he comes off as a two-bit hack. Compare Ran to The Thin Red Line. If you're going to make an art film, make an art film! The compromise that Malick tries to make in his films is not working. Is Malick's imagery spectacular. YES! Does it have anything to do with the story at the time? RARELY! Kurosawa could weave an intricate tale with absolutely nothing but imagery. Malick, on the other hand, just randomly inserts disjointed images with no apparent purpose. The fact that you can capture beautiful imagery is rendered moot when you don't know how to weave it into your story. David Lean's skills were also every bit as good as Malick's, but his were used for a purpose.I don't know why the fans seem so impressed with the "philosophy" of this film. The supposedly profound philosophical narration is straight out of a 9th grade English class (and I don't mean the honors or AP one) with lousy metaphors and childish vocabulary. I also don't understand all the stupid nature metaphors. Nature isn't cruel for the most part. It doesn't have malice. Trying to equate the savagery of human conflict to anything found in nature is idiotic. For instance: "Love. Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us? No war can put it out, conquer it. I was a prisoner. You set me free."WOW! I am overtaken with, um, yeah, this is garbage. Imagine that! Soldiers have sweethearts back home and don't just dream 24/7 about "killing slants." I would expect insight this deep from students struggling through middle school. I'm not kidding here when I say that there is more profound anti-war philosophy uttered by Rambo in First Blood than this so called anti-war masterpiece. If you want to see a good anti-war film, see how masterfully Kubrick helmed Full Metal Jacket. If you want to experience what it's really like to be a soldier in a war zone, I think Black Hawk Down does a better job than this also. Malick comes off as a self-righteous, self-aggrandizing, pretentious two-bit hack when he tries to emulate the true masters of film.I can sum it up thusly: if you are pretentious enough to think you can pull off a film without adhering to standards of plot, continuity, dialog, and character development then you bloody well had better be a good enough director to pull it off. Bergman, Kiarostami, Kurosawa: they were good enough. Terrence Malick is NOT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this movie until long after it actually came out. When I watched the Oscars, I was rooting for Saving Private Ryan to win. I had no idea how much better The Thin Red Line would be. This is one of the most realistic war movies ever, right up there with Full Metal Jacket (which is high praise indeed, as I was a US Marine myself and can vouch for FMJ's authenticity). The cinematography is probably in the top 5 or 10 EVER. Some of the shots in this movie nearly floored me. John Toll is easily one of the very best DP's in the world. Malick did an incredible job writing and directing this masterpiece. And he got an excellent performance out of all his actors, too. Nick Nolte was absolutely incredible. This has to be one of his best performances ever. He should have received an Oscar nomination. Caviezel, Penn (no surprise here), Chaplin, and Koteas were all outstanding. Cusack really did a tremendous job with the small role that he had, too. This movie had probably one of my favorite casts ever. Whoever put this cast together should get an award if they haven't already. The score was also top notch, as was the sound effects and top-notch editing job. If I was in charge of the Oscars, this movie would have swept the Oscars, not that contrived, pretentious, and poorly written Shakespeare in Love. Being a prior service member helps in appreciating how good The Thin Red Line really is; I'm not sure everyone really understands it, as evidenced by the very unrealistic and horribly written Black Hawk Down's (aka Pearl Harbor 2) undeservedly higher IMDB rating. I immediately went out and bought the DVD after watching The Thin Red Line for the first time. The poetry, philosophy, and political messages won't appeal to all, but I thought the movie was near-perfect. I've watched all the great war movies (Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Bridge on the River Kwai, ect.), and am quite particular about realism and quality of movies I watch from this particular genre. And The Thin Red Line is probably my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a movie that had to have required at least one genius to make. (Although, I didn't list it as such, this might be, in a way, a spoiler review.) I have been captivated by several different war movies before. That includes some with great advances in technology at their disposal.. to ones made many years before I was born. This is probably the only one that I have a hard time not watching by myself. I almost always cry during at least one part. It is a deeper movie than some will want, perhaps. But, it is one that everyone on the planet should see. A more philosophical war film than most (only one that I know of that comes close is Apocalypse Now) the Thin Red Line is an experience that can not be taken lightly and should not be taken for granted if there is a shred of humanity in your soul. I, myself, have never been in an actual war battle but respect those that have. I also respect everyone who took part in the creation of this work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot in wide screen Panavision, some made-for-TV movies look better than this pic when it's shown in the TV safe format. To see it in anything but 2.35:1 is to miss half the cinematic effect. But that really is the biggest problem - most of the battle scenes either through lack of resources or the way they were filmed and edited, are unconvincing. They shot the film in tropical Northern Queensland, Australia in the 'dry' season and the bright sun, puffly white clouds and lush verdant landscapes suggest this was war in 'paradise'. On some Pacific islands it was. But Guadalcanal is not paradise. It's equitorial and primarily blindingly overcast when it isn't raining. The climate and terrain in the jungles is so oppressive, like Papua New Guinea, equitorial Africa, the Amazon (or Vietnam) that people go mad just by being there and wander off the trail never to be seen again.Terence Mallick wandered off the trail here, lost the plot and he may never be seen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a powerful ego than a powerful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I would refrain from casting a negative review of a movie, with the belief that I may have just been in a negative mood, or that I've somehow missed the big picture- but this particular film has forced me into a number of firsts for myself- many more than it created for the movie industry. I have never walked out of a movie before in my life, but I felt I had no choice in this instance. I have no idea how much time this movie had left in it when I left- I spent as much time as I could dealing with the imagery, voice overs and the desperate attempt to save this movie with the big name characters.While I could see where Terry was going with this one, I felt this film was far too pretentious and egotistical for my liking- and apparently for many others. It definitely tried to be a powerful movie, but ended up to be a powerful bore- I wish I could have had the choice to bore a hole in my head rather than to have wasted 2+ hours of my life and $7.50.I feel the 'deep' voice-overs and flashbacks that just seems to be misplaced from some other movie and thrown into this one. This movie is an outrage, nothing more- nothing less. It's said by a select handful of movie-goers as the best movie of the 1990's- to each their own. Truthfully, I was bored through the entire movie. No, I did not walk into the theater expecting a big shot-em-up movie- but I did expect a plot, character development and after a couple of hours I was expecting an end to this tragedy, and soon. But as I felt it was never getting there, I was overcome with the urge to get up and walk out (as I had noticed that at least half of the viewers had already done by that point) but I stuck it out- and half an hour later, I thought, "What am I doing here?"Visually, this was a good movie. The nature scenes, although seemingly misplaced as well, were also quite nice- but it couldn't make up for the ego of this movie.I think this film would have not instilled so much rage in me if it had not been nominated for so many awards- expecially best film. Beating out so many other movies that far more deserved such an honor was a crime- and will be an even bigger crime if it is bestowed this grand award. Trying to be so 'un-Hollywood' was a mistake. While I can appreciate this idea, and much of what should have come from this movie, I wish I had never wasted my time. This is definitely not the best film of the year and will be forgotten as quickly as Clooney and Travolta's brief appearances. Too artsy for its own good, too pretentious and TOO long. I wish I had a few more good things to say about this movie, since it is seemingly such a beloved movie of the critics, but I just can't. This movie is nothing more than just a scam to make people believe it's deeper than it really is and is deserving of the 7 or however many Oscars it was wastfully nominated...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man comes to Melanesia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Jones' "The Thin Red Line", one of the finest WW2 novels, was published in 1962. The book was adapted for the screen in 1964. Terrence Malick would release another adaptation in 1998. All three focus on WW2's Guadalcanal Campaign.Malick's version opens on Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), a young man who has deserted the US army and has sought refuge on an idyllic island. Witt's actions are typical of Malick's heroes, who tend to "cut themselves" off from mankind in an attempt to "connect to" or "create" some idyllic or spiritual realm. Malick's heroes seek to create "personal islands" for themselves, "islands" which tend to eventually degenerate into disease, corruption, death or disenchantment. Witt, a young man who has an almost religious faith in mankind, sees his island rot with the approach of others. With this rotting comes a loss of faith, optimism and eventually his own death. Witt, however, turns his death into an affirmation of his own faith in humanity. Even as the world around him reveals itself to be base, violent and barbaric, Witt sacrifices his life and becomes the embodiment of what he calls "the glory".Malick, however, also focuses on a large number of other soldiers. His aesthetic itself seems to recall John Donne's quote, "No man is an island entirely unto himself", or perhaps what Ralph Emerson called "The Oversoul", all Malick's soldiers "living in succession, in division, in parts, in particles" such that "within every man is the soul of the whole".In "The Thin Red Line", Witt is an optimist who sees "the glory" and "the wonder" in everything, firstly because he is absolutely deluded, and, of course, because he is absolute right. In the pantheistic sense, everything literally is God, every morsel a part of an immanent divinity. As the film unfolds, though, Malick will increasingly paint his war as being comprised of little oppositional ideologies. As such, all the men in the film are paired off according to very specific world-views, which they articulate via voice-over narration (like the opposing poles of magnets). Importantly the men don't grow or change. Their philosophies remain the same from beginning to end. And so we have the believer, the atheist, the cynic, the idealist, the loyalist, the lunatic, the romantic, the optimist, the lover, the hater, the pessimist etc etc...all these different character traits, thrown together on an island. Malick mocks all these ideologies, or disagrees with them all, with the exception of 3 pairs. Of those 3 pairs, he identifies with 1 and romanticises the other. The first relationship is between Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall and Elias Koteas' Captain Starros. Both men battle over the question of loyalty. Whether a man is owned by those above, and whether his life is worth sacrificing for some greater "good". Starros believes that every life is precious, Nolte does not. Nolte wins.The second relationship is based on love. It involves one private's "profound connection" with his wife. At the end of the film he receives a letter stating that his wife has left him. Love loses.The third and most important relationship is between Pvt Witt and Sean Penn's Sgt Welsh. Penn becomes a stand in for Malick the philosopher or cynic, and acts as the polar opposite to Witt, who is essentially Malick the Christian. Witt believes that man is innately good, that we all have a "glory" within us and that there is an afterlife. Penn, the character Jones most identified with, is a sceptic. He believes in no afterlife, that everything "is a lie", and that we're in a Kubrickian world of "sh*t". At the end of the film, Pvt Witt dies. The cynic wins.This relationship between Penn and Caviezel is the most important. The film opens and closes with this pair and gives them the most screen time. The film itself is structured as a lazy passage to and from islands, men constantly arriving and departing, seemingly contaminating everything they touch. "They want you dead or in their lie," Penn says, sceptical of yet another batch of arriving officers. "There's only one thing a man can do: find something that is his and make an island for himself." This, of course, is a philosophy which Malick, a Kubrick-like hermit, seems to have embraced. Ultimately, though, Malick's films all portray a war between the Romantic Ideal of "man in harmony with nature" and the Post Enlightenment ideal of "man lording over nature". In this way Malick deals with what German sociologist Max Weber calls "Rationalization's disenchantment of the world", in which post Enlightenment society cherishes "instrumental Rationality" over and above "value rationality" to such an extent that magic/spirituality/religion is slowly eroded and the world is reordered such that everything is subordinated to a "rational" quest for efficiency, control and the pursuit of "mundane materials", often by force.In breaking free of their worlds and retreating to the Romantic Ideal, Malick's "heroes" are thus searching for some mythical wholeness, some non-existent Eden which is unattainable precisely because all pre-enlightenment myths of wholeness have been displaced by the modern discovery of a plurality of worlds. The tensions of Malick's films, however, arise from the fact that the modern world which allows for all, also allows for nothing. As plurality is threatening, the Social Order attempts to reduce this threatening plurality - and the sceptical undermining of knowledge and morality it entails - to one universal world again by means of conquest and domination. And that is the paradox Malick explores: the Post Enlightenment world which preaches multiplicity but seeks to impose its own unity, its own singular Law (imperialism/colonialism/the Big Other), and the Romantic Ideal which promises some spiritual wholeness (or monotheism or pantheism), but delivers only the lawless, malevolence of Nature. 10/10 - One of the most influential films of the 1990s.</fullReview>

This movie encapsulates it's movie title better than any other movie I've watched. Going in I was thinking another war movie, however this movie is not about war so much as it is about the human experience set against that backdrop. The movie show's the viewer what it mean's to live and die all in 3 hours. And at 170 minute's long, my only complaint is that this movie was too short for me, I wanted more of this masterpiece film. Afterwards I watched Day's of Heaven and Badlands which just reaffirmed that Terrence Malick is a master film maker. More than that an inspiration and hero and painter of civilization using the medium of film. After having watched this movie 3 moth's ago I feel like a change man from before I watched it and I largely attribute that change to this movie, this movie changed me if only a little that is still a powerful thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is an artful and epic anti-war film that differs from others, highlighting not the evil from war, but the nature of war itself .The ensemble cast give powerful and contemplative performances throughout, making this one of the only war films to resonant emotionally. The cinematography and score is incredible, poignant and perfectly captures the dissonance of brutal, shaking war with the beauty and stillness of nature - which itself is the statement of the film. The score from Hans Zimmer is sweeping and graceful, exquisitely juxtaposing the bombastic scores we have come to expect. Roger Ebert said that The Thin Red Line was "schizophrenic" as it seemed that the cast was driving for realism as the director was striving for transcendence; I actually believe that this ennobles the film and makes it so unlike and above the standard - surely one to rival Apocalypse Now.</fullReview>

Gordon Tall early in what has to be one of the most innovative war films ever made, and that is truly how the audience feels, as if they are it with the characters. The perfect cinematography and directing create such immersion, that we really feel as though we are one of Charlie company, fighting alongside them. This practically first person view contributes to this being possibly the most visually stimulating war film ever made, and this allows the audience to really picture the horror of combat. When combined with fantastic performances from the likes of Nick Nolte, whose deranged persistence is a highlight of his career, the film is as thought provoking as the best of all war films, Apocalypse Now, and a comparison to that shows how brilliant a film Terrence Malick has created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold, Human War Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line, directed by Terrence Malick, is a film that fictionalizes the Battle of Mount Austen: a violent confrontation between American soldiers and the Imperial Japanese, taking place during World War II. The Thin Red Line has an impressive lineup of stars including Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, George Clooney, just to name a few. Although the film doesn't exactly specify who the main protagonist, Jim Caviezel and Sean Penn share the most screen time, and ultimately steal the show. The one thing that sets The Thin Red Line apart from other contemporary war films is its philosophical viewpoint. All throughout the film there are voice-overs (from Caviezel's and Nick Nolte's characters in particular), that talk about the meaning of life and death, the origin of love, and the capricious violence of nature. These voice-overs soften the blow of the on-screen violence, and accompanied by the gorgeous cinematography of the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, plus Hans Zimmers uniquely beautiful score, the film focuses on the consequences, aftermath and the emotion of the violence we see, rather than the barbarity itself. Some of the philosophical passages may become tiresome, and at times it seems that they're just trying to confuse you with eloquent language and abstract ideas. This is justified by the strong, authentic performances from its stars (Caviezel in particular), and the engaging dialect between the soldiers. This is a visually stunning, decidedly human epic that stops just before it becomes too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other of the two war movie masterpieces in 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with a confess about the director. I couldn't like every Terrence Malick film as a moviegoer. I've seen all of those. Does this make me a fan of the director? I don't know. Let me start with his debut Badlands. I couldn't like that movie, may be my expectations were different or above. I had expected a stunning, devastating film with a powerful social background, but I couldn't find it. I know it may sound too personal for you, but I believe that art itself is subjective. I couldn't like Days of Heaven either unfortunately. I decided to watch that film because of its interesting and original story, but unfortunately it was a style over substance film. The cinematography was beautiful may be yes, the atmosphere, the story telling were poetic, yes, but there was not a powerful story, even a story. The New World is one of my all time favorite adventure movies, because it was different. Tree of Life was the same, I was mesmerized by that movie, it was quintessential cinema, pure art, but with a powerful father and son or family story as the background of the work. I was stunned by the story. As for his last film so far, To The Wonder, I didn't like it unfortunately, because I believed that the master was repeating himself in terms of themes and the way of story telling. Again, there was no story, in addition, this time no emotion, nothing but peace, nothing but beautiful images, nothing but a narrator. Sometimes, it feels like empty. The Thin Red Line is personally Terrence Malick's greatest film by far, it is his masterpiece. Yes, there is a narrator, too in the film, yes the style is the same style, yes, the way of story telling is poetic like the director's other movies, but there is something else in this movie, something magical which I don't know. As a war movie, there is a powerful and importantly dramatic story. The movie doesn't turn war into a pretentious, pseudo intellectual slide show, No, No, it gives us one of the most powerful portrait about war! It was also realistic and deep. The cast is incredible and it was a real joy for me to see those great actors one after another even if their screen time are mostly short. The dramatic structure of the film is not very different from Saving Private Ryan, I mean, there is no style over substance problem in The Thin Red Line. Visually, the movie was mesmerizing, technically it was astonishing. The cinematography, the technical craft were just award worthy. However, the film doesn't show war something beautiful or poetic, it is the way of story telling of the director, two things are different. If the movie looks beautiful, that doesn't mean that the movie says war is an art. Saving Private Ryan was criticized for similar reasons. Saving Private Ryan was real a stylish film, a director's film, also it was a blockbuster, an entertainment film, an action film, but for me both films are masterpieces. Both movies are the zenith of the cinema. I didn't find The Thin Red Line dull as I didn't find Saving Private Ryan too action packed or entertaining in a bad way. Briefly it is like Scarface. De Palma's Scarface was a masterpiece, but that doesn't mean that 1932 Scarface wasn't a masterpiece. The Thin Red Line is also a humanist film which is another good point. If I don't talk about the editing of the film, I will be unfair to it. The editing of the film is genius, brilliant, it was an unique experience for me cinematically and it one more time proves how a genius filmmaker Terrence Malick is. This is not images with a narrator accompany you throughout which I don't like particularly. Thus, The Thin Red Line is a cinematically very powerful film with a powerful story, powerful humanist messages and powerful acting by the dream team-like cast, also a heart-wrenching human drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[WARNING: A movie review cannot be written without "spoilers." You have been warned. As extra comment, IMDB can shove their blacklist.]This film makes the predictable dead end by attempting an artsy war film. War is hell. It has been said that this film depicts war through the eyes of poets and writers. Consider this, would you want to peer at poetry through the eyes of an eighteen year old G.I?The viewer is in trouble from the start, as the film maker attempts to craft, "another world." This world is the idyllic realm of native people who live their care free life while technological nations attempt to blow themselves apart. This cliche is so tired that it amazes me how often it is repeated, with the usual disastrous effects.The "War is Bad" theme is propped up and replayed throughout the entire film. The vehicle is a plodding narrative which produces a sleep like stupor for the viewer. Of course, one can overcome this affect if we take the high moral ground the film attempts to achieve and claim it as our own. Interestingly enough, this tact is risk free and much easier than the difficulties that the subjects of the film are presented with. Nice try, but I'm not biting.Sanctimonious humbug is not my strong suite. The fact is Guadalcanal was beyond nasty. However, there was a reason U.S. forces were there in strength and Japanese troops defended the island so desperately. These reasons did not involve a sadistic attempt to "blow the world up," as the gasbag film makers would have you believe.Despite these flaws which are fatal to the film, Nick Nolte and John Cusack deliver strong performances which are to be commended. However, they are not enough to save the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did not live up to expectations. Good individual performances, but movie lacks any coherent structure. Does not give a graphic enough account of the violence endured, but dwells instead on the emotional turmoil through the use of abstract imagery.At times it appears more like a pop video or nature program.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating and flawed in some regards but generally a beautiful piece that has a poetic flow and a structure that feels you can walk inside it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In World War II, a key piece in the battle to stop Japan's advance into the Pacific area is Guadalcanal, where they have positioned an airfield. Into this battle comes the mostly young `C' company. Each man is different with his own fears and hopes, but as the battle rages, the men become less important as individuals.First of all, let me just state that I shall not be comparing this film to Saving Private Ryan - suffice to say that, out of the two, Thin Red Line is my preference due to it's nature. Too many reviews have compared the two rather than approaching each on their own merits. What we have here is a film with a simple plot - a company of men taking part in one battle. However what Malick does with this is to create a film that is more an experience than a story. It is hard to describe but rather than watching a story unfold I felt that I was able to walk around the film and take or leave whatever I wanted - there are no big scenes, there isn't one guy we're supposed to focus on, but the end result is still mesmerising.It is ironic that some people have complained about the lack of plot and lack of developed characters - claiming that Ryan was stronger cause it had a plot and had a collection of well defined characters. However Thin Red Line uses the men's thoughts to tell us about them and does it very well - I didn't need these men to be ethnic stereotypes or have a back story, all I needed was who they were in the situation, and that the film gave me. It gives a similar courtesy to the Japanese as well - this is not a film to watch if you want to cheer as `our boys' kick `their asses'.It is an overused term about this film, but it is practically a poetic experience and it is easily one of the most moving and meaningful war films I have ever seen. Of course for pretty much the same reasons as it is good, it is frustrating and flawed. The images of nature and the voiceovers occasionally border on the pretentious and if you came to it looking for a solid plot with men shouting `move' and the usual macho stuff like the Dirty Dozen then I imagine that this would just irriate you - however is that the film's fault or your fault for not being open to it being different from your expectations? Yes, it does drag a couple of times in the final hour, but if you have been put in an introspective mood by the previous hour or so then this shouldn't matter. Special mention should go to a Hans Zimmer score that is perfect - it compliments the mood of the film and it adds to the film's beauty; I stayed until the end of the credits just to be able to hear more of it.The cast is again a massive strength and a silly weakness. The weakness comes in the overcastting with big names. It is an impressive list but at times it is it's undoing with people like Travolta and Clooney just wasted and the impact of their characters lost because they are a blink and you'll miss it cameo. However the collection of 10 main actors are all very impressive regardless of their screentime - this is an ensemble film and that is what an ensemble film is about. Nolte is not always given the parts to show it but he is a fine actor - here the hurt and pain in his thoughts can be seen behind his eyes. Likewise Koteas is wonderful. He is a very fine actor and he delivers such a great character here - I wish he had more roles like this but we don't get to see the best of him as often as we should. Caviezel is very good as one of the main characters (main because we see him first), I felt his character was a little too calm but he forms a big part of the film's spiritual reflective side. Further support is strong from Cusack, Harrelson, Leto, Nelson, Reilly, Savage and others. They don't weaken it - it is only the couple of BIG names that appear for seconds as one-offs that annoy as I wondered `why bother?'Overall, this is not a war film in the way many viewers expected it and I think that is why it is not revered in the way I think it should be. This has little plot and does not have a beginning, middle and end structure and if you expect that then this will frustrate you. It is not perfect but this is a wonderful experience where the soul is more important than action. The dialogue just about avoids being arty for arts sake and is thought provoking and haunting. If you come to this with your own expectations then you will likely be frustrated - this is a film that you must come to as a blank canvas and be open to what it tries to do. If you manage that then, for it's flaws, you will be touched and moved by one of the bravest and most beautiful war films that Hollywood has produced. In a time where the we (the UK) are at war again and are told to look at `them' and `us', this film reminds me that there is only an `us'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ooh, he's juxtaposing pretty flowers and the horrors of war! How deep, how original! I've heard many people spout off about the genius of Terrence Malick, but after seeing this film (which, admittedly, is the only one of his I've seen), I'm left wondering what all these people are talking about. The Thin Red Line is full of very beautiful, very hackneyed images, as well as cliched characters and predictable "twists." If the middle hour had been the entirety of the film, maybe it would have been halfway decent, but the film is over three hours and I was threatening to jump off the theater balcony halfway through. This movie never ends. Ever. It just drones on and on and on with pretty images and then ugly images.I wanted to scream every time one of those inane voice-overs began (and there are hundreds of them). Apparently, no matter how gruff, vulgar, and rural a character sounds when they speak, they all think like Renaissance poets. If you really admire those cologne ads where a woman runs along a beach in fuzzy focus while an anonymous man waxes poetic about how the two are one, or how he drinks her in, etc., then you may like this film. If, however, you, like me, enjoy a discernible plot in a movie, bring a pillow and a blanket.I want to make two things clear: (A) I blame none of this on the actors, who for the most part did fine work. (B) I do not dislike art movies. I really enjoy good ones. The Thin Red Line is not good. It was the most excruciating movie-going experience I've had in years. And just to illustrate, here's a completely true fact: There were seventeen people in the theater when the movie started. Seven walked out before the film ended. I wish I'd made it eight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mallick Takes The War Film To The Art House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one reads or hears the term "war movie," it brings with a certain amount of baggage. One perhaps thinks of the British war films of the 1940s and 1950s with stiff upper lips or Hollywood epics such as The Longest Day or Patton or Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Then you get a film that has the apparent look of the genre but is something quite different when viewed closer. The Thin Red Line, Terrence Mallick's 1998 film based on James Jones' 1962 novel set during the US Guadalcanal Campaign against the Japanese during World War II, is just such a film.For one thing, this film is without many of the pretentious things war film clichs and tropes. There's no big speeches about patriotism or glory or the righteousness of the cause being fought for. Not a single one of the characters presented here likely cares or thinks about that. These are ordinary men in extraordinary situations, some in the Army before the war started, others caught up in events that see there fates bringing them to this small Pacific island. As a result, their reactions to the battle are many and varied. They range from bravery to boisterous, brutality to thoughtfulness and a whole sweep of emotions in-between. The choice of voiceovers is intriguing, giving word to the emotions and thought processes taking place in the minds and behind the eyes of many of the soldiers the viewer meets. Indeed much of the film is based on those emotions rather than huge, sweeping battle sequences which is something that is likely to upset some viewers. Yet it may be for the film's betterment.For it's brought to life by a series of strong performances. The film's cast is massive including both name actors in small roles and then unknowns who've gone on to greater fame is some cases all playing soldiers of varying ranks caught up in the incredible campaign. It's hard to argue that the film has any central character though both Jim Caviezel as the thoughtful Private Witt and Sean Penn's pragmatic bordering on cynical Sergeant Welsh come closest to that with their very different reactions to the events taking place around them. The film's massive cast includes Elias Koteas, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly and Woody Harrelson with cameos by Miranda Otto, John Travolta and George Clooney as well. The combination of on screen performances and voice overs present one of the most unique mixes of talent one is ever likely to watch.As well as its strong performances and interesting emphasis on the human cost of war, the film is also a visual feast. Mallick and cinematographer John Toll set The Thin Red Line apart from many "war films" with lush cinematography that contrasts the beauty of the Pacific and Guadalcanal with the horror and violence of the battle being fought there. Sequences such as the film's opening and closing minutes are superb examples of this from both before and after the battle. Plus, for all of its focus on the human cost, the film's battle sequences are each superb examples of well staged and photographed chaos that celebrates not the triumph of victory but the desperation of men trying to stay alive. Backed by a haunting Hans Zimmer score that also incorporates music by John Powell, the result is powerful.At the end of the day, The Thin Red Line is an unlikely mixing of an art house flick and a big budget Hollywood war film. It is a feast for the senses with its combination of striking visuals, superbly staged chaotic battle sequences and a haunting music score. Yet it's more than a typical war film as it examines the effects of war on the men who fight it and the contrast between the beauty of the island with the horror and chaos afflicted upon it. The film remains a unique look at war from one of cinema's most unique directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film once on DVD and really liked it. I came across the Thin Red Line Criterion Collection Blu-ray and swiped it up, instantly. I watched it that night and it, literally, left me speechless. I don't know if it was the remarkable picture &amp; sound quality, understanding what to focus on, or both. Regardless, their was a much deeper human element that struck me hard during my 2nd viewing of Thin Red Line. I think the 1st time I saw the movie, I focused more on the objective of the soldiers rather than what the men, on both sides of the battle, were experiencing both mentally &amp; emotionally. What they accomplished is merely a fraction of the much "bigger picture". It's more about what these band of brothers were forced to endure for the sake of war, against a desperate &amp; well dug-in enemy. Those men fought because their countries said they had to fight, not because the soldiers wanted to. You see the horror that they experienced and the moments that will haunt them for the remainder of their lives. Thin Red Line is an unbelievably touching and emotional film that paints a very accurate &amp; surreal picture of what the men in WWII did for their countries...whether they wanted to or not. The word brave doesn't even scratch the surface when describing what those solders were &amp; did. It's literally beyond my comprehension. Thin Red Line is a masterpiece that is absolutely captivating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece and one of the few best war movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Thin Red Line" (1998) for many years in my mind was in a constant fight for the best war movie title with "Saving Private Ryan" and "Apocalypse Now". For some time i considered "The Thin Red Line" as the best war movie ever. At the moment i think that both previous titles are better war depictions then "The Thin Red Line", but "Line" is a sure number 3 war movie ever on my list and it will probably stay there until my time is done. "The Thin Red Line" is a masterpiece. I say this very rarely, but it is true in this case. It is bold, unfocused (but highly controlled), poetic, brutal (but not overdone) take on the war. I saw this picture ~5 times, and every time i saw something new. Probably it depends on the age of the viewer, but this is not an easy movie to watch. It's narrative is not a typical, pacing can be excruciating, but when it starts, it is impossible to put it down, its like a great novel. Probably the best way to enjoy "The Thin Red Line" is simply to relax and be taken by this movie.Never before i saw nature depicted like in "The Thin Red Line". With the opening shoot of a crocodile to a closing take on the beach with a flower, the great Terrence Malick shows us that nature is unbreakable, no matter what happens in between and between people, nature like this flower will always remain, even if people will catch the crocodile.Big and one of the most impressive cast ensemble off all time creates characters that are not sharply drawn, and sometimes it is not easy to identify with them. I think that was the point. It is easy to identify to my favorite character Pvt. Witt, because he is like an outsider in this situation. At the same time he is a great soldier (experiences and trustworthy in combat), but at the same time he is not a soldier - he does what he is forced to do. The opening scene with him deserted on the island with locals are amazing, they showcase what is essential - love, life, caring for each other - and when the ship comes, we understand that it carries everything opposite to that. I could write about almost every scene in this movie - landing on the beach; soldiers march through landscape with native who walks by without noticing soldiers; a terrific opening battle scene (music, cinematography, acting); tension before it; unforgettable attack on the village, with long unbroken shoot witch is filled with long lasting images; the conversations between Pvt. Witt and Sgt. Edward Welsh (Sean Penn); the great monologues from Nick Nolte's character; torn between duty and humanity Elias Koteas's captain Staros; scene where human dies, and a bird is being born...Overall, "The Thin Red Line" is masterpiece, but not for everyone. There are a lot of people who dislike this picture, and it is not hard to understand why. The sometimes non linear narration, construction of this movie and pacing can be very hard for action orientated mainstream audience, especially if you compare it to more "easier" approach of "Saving Private Ryan" (which i think is a better war movie overall). The best way to admire "The Thin Red Line" is just to be taken by it. This is one of the very best films ever created with war theme and overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit too long and artsy, but has a lot of good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think The Thin Red Line is not as good as it believes itself to be. I feel that it believes it is a war movie to end all war movies. It has a message, action, top actors, orchestral music and more than 2.5 hours worth of screen time. Look at it, sitting all puffed up over there.And you know what, to some degree, by virtue of it aiming really high and being confident, it does achieve some level of quality.For one, it looks good. One of the recurring themes of the movie is the glory of nature's world compared to the smallness of men's world and you get to see some pretty scenery in the pacific, sometimes in slow motion...in high def and wide screen.As already mentioned, it has a good cast too. Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Cusack, Chaplin, Travolta, Cloony. Can't spit without hitting a star. And the stars do what they are good at. No bad performances in this movie that I can think of. In fact, we did not need all these guys to make the movie good. This is where it starts to try too hard.Unfortunately, in its arrogance it gets a little too far up its own behind and becomes boring and pretentious.There is a lot poetic prose being narrated by various soldiers during the slower moments. Now, I know there are going to be people out there praising this narration even though I also know they probably do not understand it.These slower moments of reflection do serve a good cause. They put you into a trance so that when something actually happens, it makes a bigger splash. It is like quieter moments in music to contrast with the louder ones. However, some of them drag on for longer than needed. I found my mind wondering off a few times. And the poetic stuff works sometimes but sometimes comes off as preachy and pretentious.The Thin Red Line is a movie that tries too hard, but that does not stop it from being good. It is just a shame that you could cut an hour of this movie and it would not lose much. After the movie ended I felt sleepy, and it was not because it drained me with its intense action, I can tell you that for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A look at the psychological impact of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the previews to this movie I was intrigued. It reminded me of Saving Private Ryan and I thought that it was going to be Saving Private Ryan in the Pacific. The reason I thought that was because I had recently seen Saving Private Ryan and from the costumes I knew that it was a World War II movie. I was interested in seeing it and I am glad I did.I will constantly be referring back to Saving Private Ryan as both films deal with the same issue and that is the horror of war. The way they go about it however is completely different: Saving Private Ryan relies upon blatant images while Thin Red Line is far more psychological and subtle in its portrayal of the horror. Another difference is that Saving Private Ryan says simply that war is hell, while Thin Red Line argues that war is only the backdrop and that human aggression is the main problem.Even though Thin Red Line relies more on thoughts than on images, there are some in this movie that stick into ones minds. In main focus of these images is on the innocents that are destroyed by the war. The little baby bird trying to struggle away from the fighting clearly shows how the war effects not only the people but the environment. There are other more subtle images as well. One is of the men that are discovered as the troops are moving through the tall grass. They are dead and have been so for a long time. In Saving Private Ryan, we watch people die, but here we see that death is already there and is ever present. Another image that is strong is how pathetic the Japanese look. Even though that are a formidable force, in defeat that look absolutely pathetic. They are starved, hot, and praying to gods that have not helped them.It is not just the battle that the movie focuses on: it extends far beyond that. The battle in Guadalcanal forms the centerpiece of the movie, and one is expecting it to come to an end when they finally capture the bunker, but the movie continues on: and it continues on past the capture of the Japanese base and the sacking of the captain. When one is watching this, it is easily to begin to wonder what the point of all the extra footage, until we realise that Thin Red Line is not an action film, it is a deeply psychological film about the effects of war on one man's life and how he struggles through the horror that he sees.The film opens with him and a friend living in a Micronesian village. They are deserters and are soon found and put back into the war. They have experienced the war and had decided to flee the horror and hide among the natives. This was not going to be the case as the US wanted them back in the fighting. We learn from him that he had left the army previously but he could not escape the draft and threw him straight into the fighting. It was something that he did not want to do, but he had to. This changes though when he kills his first Japanese soldier -- he goes from a quiet, timid person to one who believes he can control destiny. He has murdered his first man and he is proud of it. But this pride changes to horror in the scene in the Japanese base where his is looking at the pathetic visions of the defeated Japanese. Some are meditating while others are demanding that he kill them. He is getting simple pleasure from pulling their teeth out and placing it in a bag, and even then he feels that the bag is bringing a curse on him and throws it away.He claims that the war has changed him, but when he returns he will return the same person. He has something to look forward too: his wife. This is the one thing that keeps him going through the horror. Even then, he fled and hid among the natives and we only hear of his wife when he returns to the war. With the natives he is a simple man with no past but his past is quickly brought back and these images continue to flood his mind as he seeks to remain sane.The movie switches constantly between scenes of absolute violence to absolute serenity. There are two forms of the serenity, one back in the United States, and the jungle. Just before he dies one of the scenes of serenity erupt, and that is him looking into the trees and seeing the bird. At first his escape is to the memories of his wife and the love that existed between them. In the heat of battle he would grasp onto that, and we will be whisked away to a form of heaven which he desires to escape from. But this heaven is not lasting for soon we learn that his wife wants a divorce and his hopes are shattered. He has lost that one hope of peace and love and has thus lost the dreams that keeps him in the war. He tries to hold onto the peacefulness of the Micronesians, but that is not enough.We do get a glimpse of other's thoughts, but it is Wit that the movie focuses mostly on. We get to know him intimately as he tries to come to terms with the war and his experiences here. We watch him change as he clings on to hope only to see that his one hope is destroyed. This movie does not look at what is beyond, it looks deep inside a man and shows us his hopes and then his despair when that hope is taken away from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone Sees Their Own Versions of The Thin Red Line.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year that was dominated by Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic, highly intense &amp; genre-defining cinema called Saving Private Ryan also saw the release of another war film from a notable filmmaker who returned to film directing after 20 years of absence. Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line may not be as graphic a depiction of war &amp; its brutality as Spielberg's masterpiece but the manner in which it approaches its genre is far more philosophical than other films dealing with this subject usually dare to.The Thin Red Line isn't just about war but the fear &amp; moral complications a soldier faces in the battlefield and the film as a whole is a deeper study of war's devastating effects on not only human soul but nature as well. Loosely based on the novel of the same name, it is a fictionalized depiction of the Battle of Mount Austen on Guadalcanal between the American &amp; Japanese soldiers during the Second World War and is told from the viewpoint of five major characters.The direction by Terrence Malick wonderfully contrasts the ugliness of war with the beauty of nature plus the surreal imagery, visual poetry &amp; symbolism it presents is nicely fused into its narrative. The screenplay features less dialogues related to the plot &amp; asks more philosophical questions that aren't easy to answer. Cinematography is absolutely dazzling for there is beauty in every single frame of the film. And Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely heart-warming.Coming to the performances, The Thin Red Line boasts an impressive cast in Jim Cavaziel, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin &amp; many more amongst which Cavaziel impresses the most and is the heart &amp; soul of this film. But what still turned this film into a slight disappointment for me is its confusing plot as it's really not easy to figure out what exactly this film is about &amp; ends up being too high-minded for everyone's taste.On an overall scale, The Thin Red Line is an intricate human drama set in the backdrop of a war which provides Terrence Malick an ideal environment to skilfully explore the themes of fear of death, detachment from reality &amp; search for wisdom that deserves to be seen by admirers of Malick as well as die-hard fans of art-house cinema. Worth a watch? Certainly. It's a Terrence Malick film after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's adaptation of James Jones' autobiographical 1962 novel, focusing on the conflict at Guadalcanal during the second World War, 'The Thin Red Line' is A Movie Marvel. An Outstanding War Film, that boasts a stellar cast &amp; mind-bending direction by the under-rated genius.'The Thin Red Line' is a fictionalized version of the Battle of Mount Austen, which was part of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It portrays soldiers of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. 'The Thin Red Line' is about human-spirit &amp; patriotism. Its also spiritual, meaningful &amp; insightful. The Protagonist, played by Jim Caviezel, is in search for answers. His question is simple: If we can love, why is there war? Why is there injustice? Why is there division? A haunted character leads this masterpiece, with a sense of torment &amp; courage. 'The Thin Red Line' runs for over a 171-minutes, but not for a minute, does the momentum go down. In fact, the pace is perfect, while the story only gets more &amp; more intriguing with each passing scene. Malick also deserves a pat on his back for bringing in an ensemble cast as mammoth as this &amp; more-so, for writing such powerful, emotional characters.Malick is a genius &amp; 'The Thin Red Line' is a shining example of that fact. His Direction here is mind-bending. He handles this heartbreakingly courageous story with flourish. Malick's Adapted Screenplay, on the-hand, is deeply effecting &amp; moving. His work here as a Director &amp; Writer, is simply incredible. John Toll's Cinematography captures each moment magnificently. Editing by Leslie Jones, Saar Klein &amp; Billy Weber is excellent. Music by Hans Zimmer, John Powell &amp; Klaus Badelt is wonderful. War-Sequences are masterfully choreographed. Performance-Wise: Nick Nolte steals the show. He's mesmerizing. He so deserved an Oscar-Nod for his performance. Jim Caviezel as the protagonist, delivers a heroic, heartfelt performance. Sean Penn is superb. Elias Koteas &amp; Ben Chaplin are credible. John Cusack is restrained. Woody Harrelson is first-rate. Jared Leto leaves a mark. John Travolta &amp; George Clooney are good in cameos. On the whole, 'The Thin Red Line' is a Cinematic Achievement, NOT To Be Missed! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonetheless, a war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War is a nasty business. One of its most dangerous characteristics is its strong appeal - when we're not at war, we are drawn to it. In the movies, this causes them all to be seductive, no matter how much they are aimed at revealing the horror of it.Kurt Vonnegut commented on it, in the foreword of his major novel, 'Slaughterhouse Five', where he tells a nurse that he's going to write a book about the war, to reveal its monstrosity. The nurse warns him - no matter how he writes it, it's still going to be a movie with Frank Sinatra in the lead, glorifying war. He assures her that this book will not be a movie.Of course, a movie was made of it - though not with Frank Sinatra in the lead.'The Thin Red Line', also based on a book, surely aims at a peace message, but it turns out pretty much like any other war movie. Soldiers - some brave, some cowardly - run around in a beautiful jungle, shooting enemies while saying or thinking poetic existential stuff. So?Me, I'm bored with the thoughts expressed, which are far too conventional, far too superficial, although pretentious. I'm equally bored by the countless gun shots, the struggle to win a hill and then the struggle to keep it, et cetera.There might be a story hidden in all of this, but it has not been extracted, instead it was camouflaged by a lot of scenery, intermingled with fractions of contemplation. At least, that jungle is easy on the eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mallick's brilliantly stylized lens of war, men and nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Thin Red Line" director Terrence Mallick has chosen a well-known war novel by James Jones and given us a brilliant vision that combines the interaction of war and nature along with the thoughts and actions of men in a crystalline organic drama. Much in the way Frank Lloyd Wright created his "organic architecture", a confluence of the site, native building materials and utilitarian form and structure that defined the style, Mallick has graced his audience with an amoebic creation containing the unlikely and intolerant co-mingled elements of nature, war and man.Much of the criticism of the film's content and style seems to stem from the opinion that war movies must be realistic, faithful to historic review and in this case, loyal to the writings of the author of "The Thin Red Line", James Jones. Mallick is an artist of film making and if this is the form we seek to understand, it would appear that he has triumphed beyond the highest zenith of this time-honored genre.By contrasting the natural cinematic beauty of the landscape and people of Guadalcanal against the hellish realism of war, Mallick has successfully fused the emotions of, about and between men caught in this impossible situation with the use of narrative voice-overs, a technique he previously mastered in his two other films, "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven". With the main characters thoughts being shared and shaped gradually throughout the film, the actors and the audience experience the growth of emotions simultaneously. This can be viewed by skeptics as manipulative or it can be viewed as powerfully soulful and heartfelt, while building magnificent character studies that transcend war itself. This is the risk and daring that sets Mallick apart from his more popular counterpart, Steven Spielberg and his sentimental saga, "Saving Private Ryan".The viewer must either jump aboard for this thrilling, gut-wrenching ride of insightful fulfillment or emotionally abandon ship in favor of the memory of logically safe and realistic dramas that are recognized as the hallmarks of our treasured war film library. I would suggest that many viewers seem to take the easy way out and reject Mallick's art as frivolous and ill-conceived. I would, however, recommend that you whole-heartedly sign on without turning back to experience Mallick's tour of brilliance. It's the only way to discover the true greatness of this film or to even possibly consider it as one of the finest war films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War as a metaphor for life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm reminded of the sequence in which Witt and Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn)'s response to Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel)'s death at the end of the film - "Where's your spark now?" in response to Witt's comment to him just before his death that he still had some spark. For Pvt. Witt, the Earth is a beautiful, idealized place. He is like a figure from Plato's famous Allegory of the Cave in which people sit chained to a wall looking at shadows created by things passing in front of a fire opposite them. They believe that the shadows are actual things and not reflections of them. Pvt. Witt believes that the Melanesian island where he goes AWOL is an example of a idyllic, perfect place while in fact evils have already begun to take hold there, had he been paying attention. This is evidenced by his conversation in which he talks with a young lady there and she reveals that she is scared because he is a soldier. He asks her why the kids don't fight and she says that they do, just not when adults are watching. Life is flawed even in places where it seems untouched by worries and problems. The woman on the island already has experience in dealing with the US military, to the point that she has developed a fear of it.So it goes throughout the movie, in many contexts. There is a conflict between nature and man's greed. There is the internal conflict in Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) who abhors his duties and finds them futile, but on the other hand wishes for advancement. There is the conversation between Lt. Sgt. Welsh and Witt in which Welsh says there is no other world, there's just this one rock, while Witt holds that he has seen a more idyllic world. In their final conversation in which Welsh asks Witt whether he's still so idealistic, Welsh seems more tired of war and receptive to a more positive view of human nature but it's too late by then. The change in Welsh through the movie is subtle but clear - from the gung-ho squelcher of the insubordinate Welsh at the beginning to shots of him throughout the film in which he appears more ambivalent about the wisdom of war.One other relationship in the film is also key-that of Staro (Elias Koteas) and Lt. Col. Tall. Staro refuses orders to take a position which the Japanese are holding very securely and Tall re-states his point that he is ordered to do so, in spite of the fact that Tall has made it clear that he finds his professional position abhorrent. Tall is battling against himself - forcing himself to convey orders which he himself finds repellent.The sensuous, lingering shots of nature, followed shortly by brilliantly photographed footage of war are also strong evidence of this contrast between what we are pressured to do and another world. This is masterful film-making. It's war as the antithesis of what is life. It's no wonder Malick doesn't make many films because visions of this magnitude and insight do not come in the length of time it takes to conceive of, write, cast, film, and release "The Waterboy."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen. I don't even consider this a movie since it was devoid of a plot. All it really was, was Mallick trying to fit as many metaphors into three hours as he could. His point was expressed by about five metaphors into the movie, but he chose to bang the viewer over the head with another 100 or so "nature is evil, man is evil, war is bad" metaphors. The only redeeming value this movie had were some of the actor's performances, especially Nick Nolte. Travolta and Clooney's performances were laughable, but Sean Penn did an adequate job. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. I WOULD RATHER SCRATCH A CHALKBOARD FOR THREE HOURS THAN WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically Masterful, but Nothing More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line marked Terrence Mallick's return to filmmaking after an extended absence from cinema. A tale that is epic in scope and in its production, the film follows an ensemble of soldiers fighting in the pacific theatre of WWII. The cast is packed full of incredible actors, and the names below the line are impressive as well, however, despite the talent involved in the production, the potential of this film is not realized. The cinematography is incredible, the battle scenes are breathtaking, the score is moving and the actors all are impressive in the scenes they are given. The problem lies in the fact that the film spreads itself too thin. Many characters are given one or two scenes in the movie, and are completely absent from the rest of the film. Jared Leto, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C Reilly, John Travolta, and George Clooney each portray roles in which they appear as barely more than a cameo, and as such it is very difficult to care for any of these characters. The primary characters are portrayed by Jim Cavaziel, Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, and Elias Koteas, but problems aren't absent from these roles. Cavaziel's Pvt. Witt and Chaplin's Pvt. Bell have similar voices and, when in uniform and helmet, similar appearances as well, making their characters difficult to distinguish, a problem compounded by the multiple voice-over narrations. As well, the Pvt. Bell character is given a great deal of screen time without much in the way of a character. Sean Penn's Sgt. Welsh has some good interactions with Pvt. Witt, but these are too few and too far between to make up the core of the film. The characters played by Nolte and Koteas have several good scenes together, but these again are too few, and these characters do not factor in very much in the film's second half. There exists no character relationship strong enough for the film to really have any anchor, and though the language in the narration is pretty, it is too fleeting to give the film any central message. The saving grace of the film lies in its technical accomplishments, and for some this film will be worth watching for these alone. However, for one hoping to be drawn in to the film's characters or plot, I think this film will disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite war movie the part where he is in the village it was great. Showing the inner peace in him. Also the symbolism with the old lady dyeing in the begging showing the inevitable. This was one of the first war movies I saw, and it has stuck with me for a while. I would recommend this to any one.Also I think that the part where the one guy pull the pin on the grenade, just to realize its stuck to him. Its a great scene. All in all it is one of my all time favorite movies. It can be compared to other great war movies as, Apocalypse Now, and Band Of Brothers. It is up there with Exit Through Gift Shop, Jurassic Park, Alien, The Big Lebowski, and Pulp Fiction. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line was written and directed by Terrence Malick in 1998. Its topic is the battle of Mount Austen during the World War II Guadalcanal Campaign.The casting of this movie is exceptional. The Thin Red Line is also a very original war movie. The importance of the settings in which the characters progress is part of this originality. Indeed, the movie shows us an idyllic island, inhabited by some indigenous people. We have a real presence of Nature with Fauna (parrot) and Flora (jungle). However, the most surprising is the metaphor between soldiers and Nature. For example, all is peaceful at the beginning. Then, war gradually destroys men and Nature (the camera shows dead bird and pierced leaf). Another original aspect of The Thin Red Line is the soldier's portrayal. Indeed, the plot presents the stereotypical of soldiers who are insane, or resigned for example. However, these various traits are shared by different characters : there is not just a main character embodying all these traits. Moreover, the soldiers seem more human. Indeed, the viewer watches the film as if he has soldier's eyes : he can identifies himself with soldiers. And the fact that enemies have the same behavior (fear, prayer for example) despite of different cultures participates to this atmosphere : they are not monsters.In fact, the only parts of the movie which can be debatable are the battle scenes. There are some classics as when lieutenant refuses to sacrifice his men's life, or the achievement of a small group of soldiers in front of a regiment, but there are stereotyped and a bit not realistic. Moreover, this movie is not for people who like traditional war movies : it is not a bloody war movie, and the audience has to wait more than one hour before seeing the first battle scene.In conclusion, the Thin Red Line gives us an original point of view about war and its consequences on human and Nature. Even if the film is quite long, Terrence Malick directed here a really beautiful movie, especially as far as images are concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review about The Thin Red Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is based on a novel by James Jones published in 1962. The film was directed by Terence Malick and was released in 1998. During WW2, a deserter named Witt, who is living in a Melanesian village, is taken back by the army. Their mission is to take the whole island to the Japanese who own half of it. The film takes place in an idyllic environment, away from everything. The village where deserters live at the beginning has a peaceful atmosphere but which is also on a land of battlefield. The whole film is all about that, how can the natural beauty of the world be damaged by the horror of humans. This contrast exists in the portrayal of characters too. For example, some soldiers who are afraid to fight or to die can be really cruel against their enemy when they confront them. Even if it is a war film, there isn't much of battlefields scenes. The director gave a lot more attention to the soldiers, their behaviours, feelings and the relationships between them. Through voice-over, you can have access to characters thoughts. There are a lot of reflexions about what they just lived or their life and how war has affected it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meandering and indulgent, but strangely moving and well made meditation on war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terence Malick returns after a 20 year absence. He goes into full philosopher mode with this complex, haunting war movie. A strong ensemble cast, many of who are given little to do, deal with the fight against the Japanese on the Pacific islands. They have many different arcs which are often left unsolved, ultimately adding up to a more universal portrait of the effects of war on both man and nature. If you don't like Malick, don't watch it. This is pretentious and indulgent filmmaking; when it wanders, and believe me it does wander, the film can feel lost and confused. It doesn't quite feel complete even though it's 3 hours long (A bit too long in my opinion) It's not to everyone's tastes and requires patience to appreciate. I didn't get it completely, but I still enjoyed it overall and despite the snail pace of The Tree Of Life, Malick crafts some pretty thrilling battle set pieces here which I wasn't expecting at all. This may be for very specific tastes, but it's a fine war poem to rival Wilfred Owen.Acting all around is good, even though most of the actors have little to do. The script feels confused in places, but it's well written and has a subtle e but genuine emotional power. Thankfully it's not just endless voiceovers this time. Malick's direction is excellent and the cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping, with beautiful image after beautiful image illuminating the screen. Despite how good Saving Private Ryan's cinematography was, this should have won the Oscar. It's got an interesting narrative and despite the absence of brutal combat and harrowing war sequences, it's a very anti war movie. The Thin Red Line is not as good as SPR and is too long, but it's a very interesting movie with great direction. Despite its complexity which ensures many viewers won't completely get it, there's still plenty of emotion and drama to speak to the audience. The film also has a fine soundtrack, with some great hymns from Melanesian choirs.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps, the greatest war movie, in terms of scale.I only wish it had a protagonist who takes the story forward. Yes, we have an army of soldiers and there is a battalion. But a guiding force would have done so much more is what I firmly believe. As it is, the film is no less than a great war film.There is a supreme ensemble cast which includes Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, George Clooney and a host of many other actors. They do a great job in empathizing with the characters and playing their roles perfectly. They become soldiers and behave like soldiers. Not for once, did I see a Sean Penn but I saw a passionate soldier fighting for his country. All the others have done a fine job I must say. Though there some hundreds of actors in the whole film, never did I was there was an extra or someone is out of place. That is what I think is utilizing resources appropriately.The cinematography by John Toll is exemplary and indeed I can say this is one of the finest works I have seen in a war film. I learned that this film even with such great camera work did not win an academy award for cinematography but it was awarded to "Saving Private Ryan", which also has fine camera work and great choreography of war scenes. I can understand the fix, the jury would have been in deciding which one was better.I resisted myself from watching this, because I never thought I had the patience of sitting through a 3 hour full length war film, which is highly detailed and nuanced. Yet, after watching it today, I confess I have seen one of the finest war films of contemporary cinema and I salute the director Terrence Malick for showing the war as it is, unabashedly, uncompromisingly and more importantly, bringing the human emotions on to the surface without any drama.The director Terrence Malick has done very few films in his career. He began in 1969 and yet this was just his fourth film as a director. He surely has a vision that is grand and it takes time to detail all of those. But, I hope he does more work and showcases his talent giving such exemplary cinema.A 4/5 for this one and I ma happy to have finally watch it. To watch it again, I need a lot patience though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incoherent And Erratic But Will Grow On You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of this film was not pleasant, I felt that it was just too introspective and did not have a driving plot, or at least an interesting or dramatic one, that gripped me. A few months later I decided to give this another try and see if it's able to change mind. In a way it did but at the same time, it's previous flaws are still prevalent but at least much more tolerable and clearer with the second viewing.The film was based on the book by James Jones, who also wrote From Here To Eternity, and the screenplay was written by Terrence Malick. I have not read the novel so I cannot say whether or not this film is accurate or that it approaches the same way that the film does. Malick's screenplay on the other hand is a hit or miss for me. There are moments that are brilliant and definitely makes it stand out against the other WWII films. The main issue that I have with this film is that it is too introspective, which I don't mind as long as there is an interesting plot to drive when the voice overs are not present. A little over half of the film is driven by a main plot but then the last hour and 20 minutes is more of self-reflection and each main character's perspective of the situation. The screenplay contains themes of faith, life, death, war, peace, love, sacrifice and family.Terrence Malick's direction in this film feel so incoherent and erratic. At one moment intensity occurs but then it just slows down all of a sudden. It isn't as bad as it was in my first viewing but it did still bother me a little during my revisit. This disjointed feeling does throw me off at times but at the same time it makes the film different and unique from the other war films that this film is generally compared to. True, sometimes I do wish that it does have that excitement and physical intensity of a film like Saving Private Ryan but at the same time I wish other war films had this deep and self-critical view of the war and it's soldiers. His work here may not be perfect and far from his magnum opus, The Tree of Life, but it has grown and improved on me that I am now confident in coming back to this film knowing that it has this great quality that other films don't.The film's photography was handled by John Toll, worked on films like Braveheart and The Adjustment Bureau. Malick is a director who loves natural photography exposing the beauty in nature and the use of natural light to fill the scene. I am one of those who come into a Malick film expecting beautiful photography but this film just doesn't get up there, this is due to the fact that I have seen Malick's work with Emmanuel Lubezki. There is still beauty in Toll's photography, the scenes in the hill in particular, and it does still get the job done when it comes to putting Malick's script in picture. Toll's photography is much deeper in my opinion than other Malick films, and it makes sense given that this film is more about experience and feelings rather than plot and visceral focused. I do wish that it was more surrealistic but I guess that it's just asking too much as the film's setting and plot is quite grounded to reality.The film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer. His score for The Thin Red Line is great, it does what it does and it is able to get an emotional response from the audience. However there are moments that I felt needed a little more emotional kick from his score as the situation felt grand and important. Also I picked up that his works on multiple films have a similar sound, or at least a trademark of sorts. This kind of disappointed me as he could have given his later films a much more original style rather than coming back to what he has already used. His later works still are effective though for those films. Do I think The Thing Red Line is his best work? I think not but it is definitely nowhere near his worst.The film's cast is extensive and bloated, in a good way. I don't mind that characters just all of a sudden come in and play a small role but there are multiple moments in the film that felt like the scene needed a little more time and a much more subtle way in introducing it's characters. Maybe it's due to the fact that Malick cut around 2 and a half of it's original running time. I did wish that the film did have a central character that we would follow for the most part and have little side moments with the others but what he has done with the final cut is good enough. The entire cast in this film were great, they took their roles to heart and gave it their all. This made the film much more believable and also made the introspection aspect of it much more interesting than what it already is. Stand out performances include Caviezel, Nolte, Harrelson, Koteas, Chaplin and Otto.This maybe the favorite of the general audience when it comes to Malick's work but for me it just didn't hit that mark. This may grow on me further on subsequent viewings but for now I can only say that this is good war film that deserves to be watched at least once as it has a large cast, great photography, a moving score and interesting direction from Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shared Secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't catch this at the cinemas, but I remember very well when it came out. I was 11 at the time, and would eventually see it the next year on video. That year I'll always recall with fondness, since then I also saw Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999) at the cinema and also found Von Sternberg's "Der Blaue Engel" (1930) at the local library. These three films, all seen in a relatively short period of time, launched me to the orbit, and I've never come down. Surely I had seen great films before them, but I credit these three for setting me to take on film as a hobby.I've seen the film again twice on the breathtaking Criterion Blu-ray during February, before that seeing it perhaps five or six years ago. So in some ways I've been reliving much of the amazement. Relishing, really. I'll do the unthinkable and quote myself, since when I wrote about Kubrick's film I came upon an idea that's valid here, too: "I never really thought about the connection between "Eyes Wide Shut" and Malick's film until now, but really, they both move in the realm of dreams and memories and projected, subjective realities ? between something that did happen (to someone) and something that might have happened. There's ellipsis, ambiguity, metaphor. Both work their magic in visual terms." Indeed, Malick's cinema is often seen as visual poetry, and no matter what one might think of the term, Malick's films can be appreciated very much in this mode, mindset. Not only the craft, which is apparent, but the soul, too. He does require patience and willingness, but very much like Tarkovsky (sometimes ever more than!), the way he allows us into a very personal vision becomes a kind of shared secret. And this kind of romance is the best way I know to remember any film, and by "remember" I mean to love and to live, and to live again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>125 minutes of cinematic excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many many times... that is, the first 125 minutes of it. I can't watch the final 40 minutes, they... suck. Somehow, at that point, the movie loses focus, tension and yes, even craftsmanship. The imagery gets weaker, the voice overs get tedious, the misery of the characters stops reaching inside you. However, what comes before that is just overwhelming cinema.It's a shame John Toll didn't get the Oscar for cinematography, but obviously, at that time Saving Private Ryan was too groundbreaking in its visual aesthetics to not steal it. Today, however, after zillions of other movies have turned the shaky hand-held-fast shutter-bleached bypass look of SPR into a lame clich, we realize that the cinematography in TTRL is outstanding in a much more profound and timeless way.Same goes for Hans Zimmer's score, which is inspiring and beautiful and could stand it's own ground against anything simply as a great piece of modern music. It's a score that can easily bring tears to your eyes, but it still transcends the movie rather than blatantly forcing fake emotions onto you.The acting is great and i've never felt cheated by those short appearances of Travolta and Clooney. Travolta, as always, is really into his character and has a tense chemistry with Nolte. Clooney, well... in my world, this movie is only 125 min long, so i never get to see him anyways. Nick Nolte is indescribably awesome as Col Tall. Way over the top, but in a believable way, and every time he's on screen, the movie is just so damn gripping. So there you have another Oscar TTRL should have won but interestingly, Nolte had another nomination going that year (which didn't make it either).Now, it's said that this movie came down from a first 9 hours cut to a 6 hours version and finally reached the 3 hours mark for theatrical release. Well, i wish they would've taken it one step further and shed away everything that comes after the storming of the Japanese camp. Maybe after Staros is relieved of command and flies off. That would've been a perfect point to end this movie...Regarding comparisons with Saving Private Ryan: These two are completely different kinds of movies, so comparing them is just as pointless as arguing whether Bruce Lee would kick Chuck Norris's ass or the other way around. I think that in 2012, SPR looks a bit outdated while TTRL continues to be a very appealing movie with timeless, beautiful and transcending cinematography and music. One that can and, if you allow, WILL make you contemplate about human nature, love, life and war on a level way above the usual cheap morality play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In this world, a man himself is nothing. And there ain't no world but this once."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest war films of all time, if not the best one of the 90s. And yes, I do include Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan". I own both films and every time I watched "Saving Private Ryan" I couldn't help but feel something was missing. Then I finally saw this movie and I felt complete. To be clear, this movie's beautiful cinematography fuses with narration from multiple characters and an orgasmic score to create a very surreal, at times dream-like atmosphere.A great aspect of the film is its often poetic dialogue coupled with beautiful images. One of the subtle notions of the film hinted at thru out; the camera continuously captures the picturesque nature of the island where death reigns supreme. Does nature mock man for killing one another? Is it indifferent? This is a perplexing and tragic question the movie poses. It also displays the brutality of men during war, quite effectively portraying the frailty of the soldiers on both sides. One of my favorite scenes has to be when Arie Verveen as Pfc. Charlie Dale sits down next to a dying Japanese soldier and says to him "I'm gonna sink my teeth into your liver, you're dyin'. You see them birds up there? They're gonna eat you raw. Where you're going you're not coming back from."Accompanying all this is a score by the great Hans Zimmer that quite frankly is one of his best. At times roaring with ferocity and yet at many times full of melancholy, the music of the movie can shift moods seamlessly and without ever feeling out of place. And the battle scenes are incredibly shot, the camera often following soldiers right thru the chaos of war. Cementing all this is a spectacular cast, probably one of the most impressive I have ever seen in the war genre. Nick Nolte, John Cusack, John Travolta, Jim Caviezel, and Sean Penn there's talent tearing at the seams in this one.I would love to someday be able to purchase this so called director's cut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A POEM OF CINEMATOGRAPHY...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times, when the word "masterpiece" cannot fully express the excellence of an artwork. And words as "poem", or "saga" try to fill the void. But in some occasions, the phrases and words seem so empty, when we're looking at an experience of cinema so majestic and flawless... "The Thin Red Line", or "TRL" for short, is one of the few poems of the modern Cinema. Hopefully, not one of the last as well. Because the watching of "TRL" creates a feeling of elevation, a feeling that there will never be something so wonderful again. "TRL" has all the elements of a successful film. The cast, which brings together some of the greatest performers of our time, is guided superbly by a director who knows perfectly what he wants to say, and manages to say it without doubts or fears. The location, a bloody battlefield. A hell in the middle of paradise (or is it paradise inside hell?), captured magically by the camera lens, appearing almost alive, with its own will and rules. The score, both meaningful and beautiful, helps in pointing the tension and the flooding emotions of the characters. In one line, we could say that "TRL" is a perfect example of technology that supports characters, not vice versa. And this could be the key to a successful film in our hard, weird cinematographic times...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, Un-paced, semi-poetic, a film for the simple minded.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I watched "Days of Heaven", I have been eager to see this film, and boy was I disappointed. The pacing of this film is exactly the same as his previous film....except I found it very unfitting in a War movie. The metaphor of War and Nature that he show through out the movie, is pretentious, simple-minded. Like a 13 years old school boy's concept of war. A lot of flash back is about the central character's carnal desires.. while in the heat of the battle. I found this absurd. If this really happen in the war.. I would expect the whole US ARMY been defeated. The last scene also is terrible.. showing Japanese soldier fighting the Americans in slow motion (ala almost a John Woo Style), trying to show inhumanity of the war in a slow-motion poetic way. The acting in the movie is horrible as well, unrealistic acting at it's best..(you can probably compare the acting to those smash hits of the 80s such as "Best of the Best") This is pretentious and unwatchable. Personally I would prefer "Saving private Ryan". (as surprising as it sound, Spelberg is better director in almost every way in this his movie compare to TTRL.. the acting is more realistic, and logical, pacing is just right, and lastly it is not pretentious)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out quite innocent enough. You get a good feeling from the tropical setting and the wonderful camera angles. This, however, seems to be all that the director is interested in doing.There are action scenes, most memorable is the scene where the "good guys" take the hill from the "bad guys". This scene is full of suspense and builds up to the climax quite well.This film falls apart by including to many "thought provoking" scenes where the characters contemplate life. (If I have to sit through one more scene where the camera pans around Nick Nolte for 30 mins. while he waxes idiotic I think I'll puke.)This film would have been better, if not the best film of that year, if they had edited these "panorama" scenes down just a bit. Go watch Saving Private Ryan instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick is truly a poet; celluloid his canvas, images his language.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrance Malick won the filmmaker's achievement award at the Taos Talking Pictures Film Festival in April of 2000. His third film, 'The Thin Red Line', was vigorously discussed-and inevitably compared- to Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. Malick was robbed on Oscar night. Contentions fall where they may, that matters little. (Scorsese and Kubrick were never favored at the Academy either.) The existential philosophy presented in 'Line' places it far above the likes of 'Ryan'. Think of Spielberg's war film as pyrite, and Malick's as a cultured pearl. Therefore, I will not devote another word to comparing that hack (Reese's Pieces, anyone?) to a traveled thinker like Malick. Fade in on men wandering in the depths of the Japanese jungle, trembling, armed, ready. Cut to a bird, watching over the men. There's a war going on all right, and it's much bigger than Guadocanal. Malick underscores man's purpose and place in life, showing war as an evil deviation from nature that "poisons the soul." Malick's work here, a meditative study on man's essence to wage war on opposition, reverberates to truly great directors of the past. Such films as Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood' or Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' lend their contemplative breath to this film. Beneath the layers of bloodshed and gun smoke rests a callous and withdrawn observation on humanity-- almost as if this film was made by an extraterrestrial documentarian. It is this level of callous thought and impersonal narrative that defines this film and defies the rigid company it is placed with. Unlike any war film before it- with the possible exception of 'Apocalypse Now', 'Line' delivers a stunning journey into the collective spirit of the human race. Profound cinematography, brilliant and truthful acting, and a broad palette of emotional paint weave a tapestry of storytelling that should be studied for decades to come.Tolka's Bottom Line: Take a really deep breath, hit 'play', and don't look away until you've redefined your understanding of spiritual conflict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It didn't take long for a better film, a more effective film, than Saving Private Ryan to come along!Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is a flawed yet superb war movie; without those annoying Hollywood American Flags waving and one where you do care about the characters. After all, who among audiences really gave a damn about Private Ryan? That was the problem with Spielberg's film.We often don't even learn who the Private Ryans in The Thin Red Line are before they die, but it still seems to matter a lot more. The soldiers in The Thin Red Line are to a large extent anonymous, grimy and nameless, but they're human. They're us.The Unknown Soldier is after all a most powerful image, because he or she could be any one of us. But to have this perspective we need to be encouraged to focus beyond the bullets and the blood, the screams of terror and pain and this is what Malick has achieved. And that's in spite of absolutely riveting battle scenes.The Thin Red Line was filmed in The Port Douglas area near Cairns and this area is painted very prettily indeed. This is a small problem for locals in the early section of the film because it's hard to accept that the movie is set in Guadalcanal instead of North Queensland. Guadalcanal was the site of a vicious battle between the Japanese and the Americans which occurred a year after Pearl Harbour.Malick muses beyond the conflict though, often deadening the sounds, swinging the camera away from the terror in a man's eyes onto the beauty of nature; a passing beautiful butterfly. Or he'll have a soldier in the midst of carnage, nose in the dirt, hiding from death, concentrating on the way dew or blood drips down grass stalks. And that's what must have happened. And that seems much more important than the bullets ricocheting by, as long as the bullets miss.We can easily see the point. This is Malick's preoccupation. Why kill? Why fight? Why why, when our Earth (and our North Queensland) is so beautiful. Basic stuff, but we humans so often miss the point don't we.The film has a big name cast although some like John Travolta and George Clooney are only on screen for a few moments. Travolta is important though playing a hateful Captain, pulling rank on an older, smarting Lt Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) setting up Nolte's character beautifully. Tall's a career soldier who is willing to sacrifice men for his own advancement and glory within the army.But there's little else in The Thin Red Line in the way of rounded characters. The soldiers are only trying to survive, and win (stop) the battle. Soldiers in the film begin to assert their individuality and then often Malick drops them. Sometimes he has them killed.There are relationships that mean little in the context of the movie and they should have been cut. Sean Penn although interesting could have been left out altogether. The film needs to be half an hour shorter, and that's its only fault.But still The Thin Red Line is a terrific film. Malick is a thoughtful director. He adds voice overs and asides about how stupid the battle process is even though it's doubtful that any of these soldiers would have had the time or the inclination to muse on the human condition. It's an unusual tactic by a director but effective.He often shifts the view away from the obvious and that gets us thinking. War sometimes must be like that. Extreme fear will cause the brain to disengage; to self protect; to shut down sensory input. The Thin Red Line emphases this and also the opposite. It's an exciting, tense war film that is also philosophical. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this movie. I liked it. But I can't give anything more that a 5 for it. Unless I get emotional. Then I would give it a 7. Maybe. DO NOT watch this movie if you are looking for any action war scenes. Sure there are a few, but nothing compared to even the most low budget war movies ever made. If you are, however, looking for some (contrived) emotional insight to fighting men then this might be a film for you. I have heard that the original cut was 6 hours long. (6 hours!!!!!) Now that would probably be a great torture tool if we ever decide to torture people. Watch this film if you have nothing to do and enjoy the (actual) simplicity of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A breathtaking, different kind of war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1998, the same year as blockbuster "Saving Private Ryan", "The Thin Red Line" was doomed from the get-go. If you're looking for the bigger names, be it actors or director, or want to see fast paced action, or even just the plain old high budget Hollywood war movie, this is not it. Everyone else is welcomed into this different kind of film, which some say isn't even a proper war movie. That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it is true that "The Thin Red Line" approaches the topic from an entirely different angle, or from multiple angles to be precise. Malick highlights lives, struggles, hopes and dreams of various people, helps us look through their eyes of what transpires on the battlefield and how it reflects on them and their relationships to those who share their unreal experiences.But it's not just the soldiers who play major roles in what transpires on screen, it's nature itself which is there and prominently so, it is always there, regardless of what gruesome deeds man decides to commit in its very heart. Sky, clouds, winds, grasses, animals, plants, man, the latter is just one of those things, a part of it, a necessity or a burden, judge yourself. Maybe there is even a subtle point somewhere as well when we see big names like Travolta and Clooney cast yet appearing only for one or two minutes or so. They are not important. But this film is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two great war movies came out in the late nineties. "Saving Private Ryan" was a great war movie in that it introduced new and very effective filming techniques. It was extremely realistic and set new standards for military action movies, which made it also very entertaining. "Thin Red Line", on the other hand, is as different from "Ryan" as Guadalcanal is from Normandy. It is much more than a war movie and much more than an anti-war flick. It is a study into human nature and about the full range of emotions that uplift humankind to wondrous heights or sink it to horrendous depths. It is in fact a complete study of mankind under extreme conditions. The cinematography and soundtrack are also unique in setting new standards of quality and will probably be taught in schools for years to come. This film may not be great entertainment but is definitely one that should be kept in every library for serious viewing, preferably with one's kids when they're old enough to stomach the gore. It is simply superb. A truly great movie.</fullReview>

Reilly , Larry Romano , John Savage , John Travolta , Arie Verveen , David Harrod , Thomas Jane , Polyn Leona , Miranda Otto , Matt Doran.Directed by:Terrence Malick.Awards:Nominated for 7 Academy Awards while not winning any of them including Best Picture, Director, Adaped Screenplay, Cinematography, Original Score, Sound and Film Editing. it also won Best Picture Golden Bear at the International Berlin Film Festival.Review:Few weeks back when i saw that this movie was going to be shown on a specific TV channel, i got really excited and was very curios to watch this movie. Already have seen and quite appreciated The Tree Of Life so much i thought and knew exactly what to expect from this movie, a movie by the master of non linear narrative style Terrence Malick. i have no problems with this type of narration, in fact i love it and enjoy it more than any other way. few film makers can do the required amount of justice to it and he is someone who fully does. he have been really appreciated by people who appreciate good work but his movies are not something everyone can like and digest easily but that should not be the reason to hate someone or have mixed thoughts about there work just because you don't really get or agree with their point of view and their own style of filmmaking or else this whole world would become a clichd mess, have some diversity in your nature.I can really understand the whole excitement and craziness back when this project was announced, this movie alone had many actors in it with many voice overs and cameos from other along with other actors whose work have been cut as i earlier said in the editing process. i was quite fascinated to read that every actor in Hollywood was wishing to join his movies and a long endless list of them who met him in different places. quite exciting and something that really shows the power that this film maker got and the respect of his genius abilities. this movie was planned very long ago but faced many difficulties before even starting to make it and so on. still in its current form it is a masterpiece. another interesting and well known thing was that it was released at the end of the year when everyone already have seen another big War movie that year, one being Saving private Ryan. i call The Thin Red Line, a Saving Private Ryan for the deep and philosophical minded people, truly it is. many people were miffed by how bored they got watching all that but i was more than excited seeing this than anyone else. i truly enjoyed watching it. i am not going into comparison business but i loved it more than Saving Private Ryan but still kept it currently on second position of 1998 seen movies.You don't see the amount of gruesome bloodshed and gut spilling that you will witness in any movies that is the main difference. it never follows a specific plot and goes to a non linear way or a stretch of scenes which i found really thought provoking and amazing in a sense that how excellent it felt with this movie. i thought the whole concept that Malick thought was well done and i never connected and felt in such a deep way with a war movie or its character the way i did here even though you don't know much about them or they don't speak a lot. several scenes show different perspectives and inside voices of the men which i thought was powerful. you will see trees falling or other things in terms of nature when you see a soldier getting shot by the enemies, a real sense of deep philosophies in it that never feels overdone or off place which does in many other movies but instead here t elevates the movie to a level of greatness. i honestly think that this movie over shadowed Saving Private Ryan in my mind and also few other movies. one of the finest and excellent war movies ever made. movie is just purely fascinating in every way, i even liked the war scenes the shoot out ones they looked quite real and scary and moreover real and natural than any other movie i ever saw in a further more in-depth and further close look at what its like to be in a war. i saw those scenes as something i might be thinking or making up in my mind while reading about them.Outstanding Cinematography done in this movie, one of the best i have seen ever. brilliant job majorly by Hans Zimmer who created such great score for this movie an outstanding work yet again by him. superb in every technical department. edited very well and also i loved the sound and other effects which it didn't have quite but still. i haven't seen any of the Malick movie before this one as far as i remember so i call this his finest work yet. Screenplay have been written excellent just masterful work. now there are many actors in the movie but performances by Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas is just brilliant and outstanding.It had some heart wrenching and heart piercing moments, quite a sad and severely emotional movie in a very poetic way, something i love to see and i would want you to see. Highly Recommended. can't believe it didn't won any Oscar and all the negative criticism this movie faces it is a work of greatness people.Rating: 5/5 A+Follow My Blog: HollywoodAndMe.Blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this great evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Thin Red Line' is perhaps one of my personal favorite movies of all time. It marks the return of the notorious seclusive writer/director Terrance Malick, who had not completed a film in twenty years prior to this one's release.This is not your typical war drama. It is so much more. It has everything your normal combat movie would cover, excellently shot battle sequences and explores the turmoils of war. You see first hand how the characters slowly begin to lose their grip on reality, as innocence if the first causality of war.Malick handles the story by starting out with two American soldiers who go AWOL, somewhere on a small island filled with natives in the Pacific Ocean. This segment, to me at least, in the greatest sign that life really is beautiful. After the AWOL soldiers are back in the navy's possession, that's when we are introduced to Guadalcanal, a small island with a Japanese airfield.What follows are incredibly scenes of action, some surpassing the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Platoon.' The soldiers question, in great detail, why they are fighting this war (Not politically but philosophically.) The movie is long, sure, but needs to cover a great amount of information.The cast is phenomenal. Nearly every actor with a speaking role, (and a few without,) have become big name actors. The best performances comes from the veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays an aging Colonel. Who he didn't earn himself a Best Supporting Actor nod, or a win, I do not know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised that not many people saw this because it was nominated for seven Oscars. I guess people tend to ignore this film because it came out the same year as Saving Private Ryan. I would see both of them because they both are unique in their own ways. Now that I look back, I wonder how Shakespeare in Love could beat this film.This is about the battle of Guadalcanal during the second world war and the terrible things about war and the strength of bonding with one another.The acting is very good. I knew like everybody in the film. Sean Penn is the best though. He has really powerful dialogue.This isn't the action film most people think it is. It's more of a drama that requires people to think.The cinematography is very good. I love the score by Hans Zimmer too.Overall, this is one of the best war movies ever. It could be a few minutes shorter though. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THIN RED LINE, directed by Terrence Malick and co-directed by God, will be released on Blu-ray from Criterion in all its HD glory and with extras today. When I saw it the first time in a theatre back in 1998, I knew that it was one of the greatest films ever made - a spiritual work of art that has no equals. A great war film about peace (an oxymoron?) and a celebration of all forms of life on earth - humans, animals, and plants. Beautiful cinematography, haunting music, creative editing, and the most original use of multiple narrators ever used in cinema. The fact that the great company Criterion is releasing it on Blu-ray is icing on the cake and I will cherish the extras even though (not surprisingly) there will be no audio commentary from Malick, which would have ruined the mythos of the film anyway. Malick, like Kubrick before him, lets his films do the talking and leaves them open to interpretation by the viewer. If all world leaders, heck, if all people on our planet would watch and absorb this film, the world would be a better place. From 1998 on, every time I have watched THE THIN RED LINE, I have been given proof that God exists and through Him, art like this can be made and appreciated by all of us.</fullReview>

With to many irratic flashbacks and flashforwards of the main characters, it never gets clear who has what mental problem.If only it had been another combat movie about the battle in the Pacific, it would have made a nice good short WWII movie. But allas the irrelevant personal problems are the "red line" throughout the movie. And what a thin line it is, I would almost say it's invisible.Survival tip: Play spot the celebrity.

		<shortDescription>A movie with an extremely ambitious goal, which it more than achieves!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the release of the excellent 'The Big Red 1', every war movie has tried to do the same thing. That is, to convey the horror of war, and the loss of innocence caused by war. This is indeed a very powerful message, which has to be expressed. However, most film makers, at this stage, see this as 'shooting fish in a barrel'. Even master Spielberg could not stretch beyond the 'horror of war' theme in the brilliantly shot Saving Private Ryan.But, not until Terence Malick, has anyone tried to reach deeper and darker into the effects of war. 'The Thin Red Line' showed us how (through the murder of another human being, and the fighting for a cause you really, deep down, don't understand), your soul can be lost.From the opening scene, where Private Witt (James Caviezel, in a star making role), plays with the doe-eyed innocent children of a village he has deserted to... through to the final scene where, upon leaving the Island of Guadalcanal, we see (heart-wrenchingly) the change that has happened to these innocent boys, we are shown how the effects of the past events can never be left behind, but will always be with them. But if you watch this movie with an open and alert mind, you will notice that, there has also been a change in you. You become fully aware of how lucky you are, to have not experienced war in your lifetime.Acting wise, this movie was unbelievably overlooked. Ben Chaplin's scene where he reads a letter from his wife (who occupies his every thought), just to read that she has left him for an Air Force officer, always makes my heart sink with pity, and fill with anger at the same time. What excellent directing, but even better acting!!! And why the performance of Nick Nolte was overlooked by the academy is also a mystery.Much was made of Steven Spielberg's directing of Saving Private Ryan (Indeed he picked up another gong), but all he did wad use a hand held camera and on over-exposed colour film...... mix that with the gory, panic-filled opening scene, and you've got some super stylish visuals. However, Malick was ingenious enough to use the effect of the battles on the surrounding wildlife (a confused &amp; scared snake in the long grass, a bird dying at the feet of the fighting soldiers..... ), to show us the destructive horror of war, not just simple blood and guts, but the irredeemable damage caused by such senseless carnage.An outstanding achievement of a movie, which could be analyzed for an eternity, and which requires numerous viewings, to gather the full impact of it's message.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terence Malick's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" has sparked some heated critical controversy since it was released theatrically. Few recent films have been so highly praised and so despised by equal numbers of viewers. There's no need to belabor comparisons with Saving Pvt Ryan. They are two vastly different kinds of films that happened to come out in succession. For me, "The Thin Red Line" is a far more rewarding picture. Like all great works, it requires multiple viewings and close attention to be fully appreciated. This is not an action picture in any sense of the term. Yes, there are battle scenes (one spectacular battle in particular, for the taking of a hill) The director, Terence Malick, uses the wartime setting to make points about the human condition (especially, humans as PART of the NATURAL WORLD), because war intensifies and foregrounds the most fundamental emotions. A major aspect of the film, often neglected in reviews, is the theme of the dualities of existence and how they may never be reconciled in the human mind: war/peace; nature/civilization; life/death; individual/group. The film (derived loosely from the James Jones novel) is Whitmanesque in seeing mankind as a part of nature--to the basic state of which he must return someday--and in a need for each individual to see himself in others and as part of a greater whole.Surely, many actors who participated in this movie were frustrated when they saw how much of their work was cut for reasons on timing and concision. But of the performances we do see on screen, several stand out: the great Sean Penn creates a memorable impression, as do John Savage, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, Ben Chaplin and Jim Cavaziel. Special mention should go to Elias Koteas for a beautifully rendered portrayal of a man torn between duty and morality. A magnificently photographed and haunting film, "The Thin Red Line" demands close attention and more than one viewing. For some, it will be well worth the effort. The DVD issue is technically very impressive, with room-shaking low frequencies and stunning nature imagery. More bonus material than the Melanesian folk songs would have been good, but there's no real complaint here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic In Its Own Right!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the fuss about Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan and which one was the better of the two was totally uncalled for. These are two movies looking at and focusing on two very different themes with the only common grounds being the situation in which they were shot.While SPR had the plot it still looked like a Hollywood movie and this was evident at the attempt to be politically correct. Like most Hollywood movies it comes out making the Americans looking politically correct as ever.Thin Red Line on the other hand was not about the war or about being politically correct. It was *the journey* through the war and it did the most amazing job on dealing with the emotions, the voices, the thoughts which run through the minds of any soldier who faces the situation that the characters in TRL faced. One thing which I will have to admit after seeing this movie is that Terrence Mallik is a genius and a legend in his own. The way the cameras drifted far away to focus on a bird with broken wings struggling for survival, with the sounds of explosions on the background was a brilliant way to depict the same feeling within man himself in a similar situation. The only problem about TRL was that the characters or atleast most of them were just characters and not names which I remembered. This lack of connection between the audience was the only let down.To settle the battle between TRL and SPR, I gave both 9`s out of 10; But I gave TRL a 9 when I was thinking of giving it a 10 but thought that would be unfair to some movies which are better and I gave SPR a 9 while thinking that I should give it an 8 but felt that would be too disrespectful for something which garnished so many academy awards. Thin Red Line has to be one of the best movies related to war, ever made in the same league as APOCALYPSE and FULL METAL but surely better than SPR!! Take your time before you come up with your next one Mr. Mallik as long as it is worth the wait and that Thin Red Line definitely was!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some films don't need a plot - this is one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thin Red Line" features much more musing and philosophizing than combat. I suppose that's the clearest warning I can give to anyone who needs a movie to be plot driven. This is more like a poem than a novel. There is no protagonist, unless you really stretch the term. There is no one antagonist- not even the Japanese. Some of the U.S. soldiers even feel a connection with their enemy, or else mourn the lack. But I think it's a good film even without a strong story line. This is a remarkable achievement for Malick. He pulls it off. In the right hands, a strong theme can replace a strong plot. Malick's not interested in Good Guy vs. Bad Guy. He's after the struggle to maintain a sense of hope in the worst conditions. You see this most strongly in Sean Penn's character, who is deeply conflicted. I do have some problems with the movie. Generally, the bigger the star, the more damage they do to it. Travolta and Cloony are awful. Cloony in particular plays the same guy he always plays. He could deliver the same lines dressed in black rubber body suit. Travolta is just not believable. I thought Sean Penn gave a good performance, but something made it hard to believe. I just didn't see him as a 1st sergeant. Maybe it was as simple a thing as his hair style. I could have bought him as a lower rank, easily. Nick Nolte was believable. The battle sequences are very strong, very effective at putting you in the middle of the scene. I ducked from tracer bullets once. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films of the 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will, but Terence Malick's gorgeous opus was 1998's most stunning oscar contender. Although I enjoyed "Saving Private Ryan," and found "Shakespeare in Love" to be absolutely wonderful, neither film could match the profundity, depth, and utter beauty of "The Thin Red Line." In truth, "Saving Private Ryan," and "The Thin Red Line" should never be compared because their tones are so strikingly different. Yet Malick's representation of WWII is far more realistic, and less jingoistic than Spielberg's. Whereas Spielberg treats war as a necessary evil in "Saving Private Ryan" and looks at each one of his characters as a hero, Malick questions why people fight in the face of Eden and reveals his characters as flawed. There is no dramatic salute scene or shot of a waving American flag in "The Thin Red Line," for Malick's aim is far deeper than that of Spielberg's. Not only are the films performances well executed, and its themes amazingly explored, but "The Thin Red Line" is one of the most visually beautiful films created in recent history. The shots of waving grass exhibit the extreme beauty of Guadanacanal, and serve as the perfect contrast to the horrors of war the picture presents. "The Thin Red Line" is true cinematic poetry, and is destined to go down in history as one of the greatest war films of all time</fullReview>

Could be, but for me is one of the best movies I ever saw. As rude &amp; raw as a real war, "The thin red line" really introduce yourself into the Second World War with violence. With fear &amp; with blood. With suffering, with impatience (the same impatience this group of soldiers felt searching for their enemy) &amp; with valor, with courage. That's the whole movie.Do you want famous actors? Well yeah, you can have some (Sean Penn, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, George Clooney, &amp; many others).Do you want action? Of course there is action in this movie. But most of all you will have reality. Not all the soldiers come back home. We know it now with "The thin red line". As I said, I loved this movie. A piece of art. An historical file for future generations. This is war, kids.Mr. Malick, bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly intense and spiritual movie, that uses the act of war to search for the answers of God, Heaven, Hell, good and evil.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thin red line is one of those rare movie experiences that leave an impact on the sole of the viewer. It is a surreal experience that shows, probably some of the most realistic portraits of modern warfare ever filmed. Yet, the film keeps asking the viewer to think about the reasons why the madness portrayed on the screen actually happens. The films Hero (Witt), is a symbolic and highly spiritual character, who believes he has seen heaven, all the while he is going through hell. To me he was an angel, searching for the meaning of evil in life. Searching for answers, for God.The war scenes in this film are very very powerful. The acting is outstanding. Nick Nolte gives the performance of his career. Scene after scene rivets our senses. In the end the only answer given is that we are all victims of fate, and if fate is God, then we are at his mercy. One of the greatest films of all time, and it will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eschews the Cliches of the Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I asked for a war movie that eschewed the entrenched clichs of the genre, and I got it. But I'm not sure I liked it (the clichs are quite comforting, it turns out). The Thin Red Line seems to me to depict how war must be. It includes everything -- valor, cowardice, terror and incompetence, but mainly uncertainty and profound longing to be elsewhere.Paul Fussel (in his book "Wartime") talks about the mindset of WWII soldiers: they had a job to do and they wanted to get it over with and go home. This movie captures that outlook -- the characters' motivations are genuine. John Cusack's character is about as close as the movie comes to depicting traditional heroism and Private Ryan-style bravado. But even then, it's permeated with pragmatism. Taking the bunker means getting the job over with. Nolte's character is motivated by insecurity and careerism. This is his last chance to advance his career in a war. And he has Travolta's character -- younger than him but a general already -- goading him. Captain Staros is also quite credible. As Nolte tells him, he's not a coward or an incompetent, he's just not cut out to do what needs to be done. And he's probably right. In a traditional anti-war movie, Nolte would have been demonized for ordering the frontal assault rather than the flanking maneuver. Here, he's vindicated by events. That's what was necessary.OK, all that said, I'll join the chorus in condemning the ponderous narration, the torpid pace, and the excessive length. I think, however, that these were part of Malick's attempt to convey a sense of what war is like. Not some great, relentlessly heroic adventure, but a lot of boredom, waiting, and agonized thinking about home, punctuated by violence and terror. While all that may be true, one must ask, "does it work as visual narrative?" Not always, which is what leads, in my view, to the many strongly negative reactions to this movie (along with the inevitable comparisons with the far more traditional Pvt Ryan).Of course, the film looked great. One never thinks about the natural world in which this war was fought, nor of the indigenous people. The scene toward the end when the Japanese infantry simply appears out of the forest along the river is great, as is the scene depicting the assault on the bunker. That equals the battle scenes in Ryan. The acting is solid all around. The music, on the whole, worked, though some scenes of silence would have been preferable (and I kept thinking that a Philip Glass score would have been perfect). All in all, The Thin Red Line is an ambitious, though qualified, success. It's just not fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRL is one of the most powerful films I've seen. It is too bad that the trailer inaccurately depicted the movie as an action-packed war movie. I thought TRL was closer to THE PIANO than to SAVING PVT RYAN.I especially liked the images. Opening with the crocodile gliding into the water and ending with the palm tree sprouting on the beach. Other memorable images were the birdcages when Witt's mother died and when Witt talks with Welsh in the house. The orchid in front of the burning Japanese camp, the mother hen and her chicks, all interesting.There have been several criticisms of TRL: 1) no character development, 2) no plot, 3) too long, and 4) trying to be too deep.Witt, Welsh, and Doll all developed during the movie. Witt grows to realize that evil may be inherent in men (witness his return to the native villagers where they fight and have enemy skulls). Welsh realizes there is more than making an island of oneself (his aiding of the gut-shot soldier). Doll realizes the effect Witt has had on others in the final voice-over as the ship leaves the shore.The plot is there. This is a complex and difficult film. Careful attention must be paid to the voice-overs and the images to understand the plot. It is essentially the same as the book: the growth of men in combat with the spirituality of Witt thrown in.The only extraneous scenes were the cameos of Travolta and Clooney. Even these scenes helped to develop the characters: Col. Tall's ambition and the contrast between Clooney and Staros as father figures. The acting of Travolta and Clooney fell short. Even with these scenes removed, the movie would have been "long."The movie (especially Witt) was spiritual. This was an interesting difference from the book where Witt was a prejudiced boozer. It was a little strange to hear Eastern philosophy about the interconnected nature of all things being voiced with an Kentucky accent but it was definitely not "dime-store" philosophy.If you don't like to think or if you are looking to be spoon-fed and manipulated, then this movie is definitely not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I said in my Tree of Life review Terrence Malick's style is one I highly appreciate rather than adore. That doesn't stop me though from liking his films a great deal. The Thin Red Line was my first Malick, and after seeing five of them it is still my favourite.The pace is meditative, but I had no problem with that. This film wasn't only a war film, it was also a meditation of war, so the pacing was appropriate I feel, not only that I find this meditative pace is a characteristic of Terrence Malick, his films being visually beautiful yet meditative.As is the case with his work, Malick does do a superb job directing, the visuals are astounding and the music is very haunting as well. The story may seem pretentious, but I was too transfixed and absorbed by what was going on to care, and how it treated war was interesting and different with "Every man fights his own war".The action is genuinely tense with an atmosphere that is genuinely authentic(for example you can smell the sweat literally), and I also found some scenes quite moving. The dialogue is provokes thought and the characters are often real in a compelling sense. The acting is as good as can be, particularly from Sean Penn and Nick Nolte.All in all, a fine film and Malick's masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is poetry on film: a beautiful, bitter, harrowing, thought-provoking contemplation of life, love, death, pain, loss and fear. Without playing too much to one side or the other, the film depicts each viewpoint as if it's of the utmost importance and the line between enemies is slowly blurred by common human emotion. The quiet, almost hypnotic voice overs lull the viewer into a sense of calm that is in stark contrast to the violent struggles of war splayed out across the screen. The beauty in every shot only further illustrates the tragedies that play across the landscapes. There's no typical war movie here. Instead, it's a hauntingly philosophical look at the effects of war on all involved...from the soldiers in the field, to the hardened commander, the 'enemy' and those left behind at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explores that fine line between a beautiful and an ugly place as characters attempt to find themselves amidst it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a wonderfully observed, slow-burning film chronicling the madness of war and the effects it has on those involved. Told from a couple of characters' own points of view via narration, the film documents events in the Pacific during World War Two and is a triumph of capturing thoughts, feelings and emotions felt from the first person perspective. As a war film, it is the anti-thesis to something like Pearl Harbor or a Rambo sequel, as exploring sensations, feeling emotions and the opening up of one's mind is the order of the day. Whilst combining beautifully captured imagery, but never quite coming across as a piece that glorifies warfare or make war as a whole 'beautiful' per se; The Thin Red Line is a marvellous achievement in straight, un-perturbed and anti-formula film-making working within a distinct genre.It's the film's poster that best captures what you're heading in for when it comes to The Thin Red Line. Three separate soldiers, ducked down amidst the reeds, either cowering; planning or maybe just observing. The item that springs to mind, or indeed captures our gaze, are the three separate eyes of these men ? not the helmets dictating to us the obviousness of the genre; not the brightly coloured foliage designed to distract us by informing us of how strenuously low down these guys are; not even the impressive cast list to the left can alter our gaze. It is the eyes that are looking off centre, eyes that are capturing whatever they're looking at with a small matter of fear, surprise, anguish and acceptance. Each of the soldier's helmets block out one of the other soldier's eyes, rendering the picture somewhat uncanny, but it goes some way in telling us it is a film all about looking; observing and gazing at what's presented to you.The film predominantly centres around three men, men who are Private Witt (Caviezel); Private Bell (Chaplin) and a Colonel by the name of Tall (Nolte) ? soldiers in C Company based around the area of Guadalcanal, during the Japanese occupation of that fateful time. The film opens in the most un-war-like of fashions; with a voice-over accompanied montage of all things beautiful as Witt mingles with some Pacific region natives on an island set away from the war and away from the fighting. This is not a plunging us into the forefront of battle al Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now with some beach landings or a Napalm bombing and this is not a throwing us into the harsh, behind-the-scenes reality of something put across in the opening of Platoon. For better or for worse, this is an opening set away from not only firefights and bombing raids but the war and the warfare area itself. Although interestingly, like some of the above examples; it accompanies its imagery with some soft, instrumental and somewhat classical music.The essence of Malick's film being one of the patient variety is captured in the film's attitude to war as an individual item. Rather than open with acts of warfare as explored in the previous paragraph, the director here implants a dizzying array of aspects of mise-en-scene onto the screen that foreshadow violence and blood-shed without ever giving us any. Large, towering cannon-like artillery guns line the decks of the warship we spend much of the early exchanges on; there's a huge, nervous build-up to some beach landings which double up as the film's first example of military action of some kind, whereas each and every solider carries with him a rifle making the presence of firearms extremely prominent. These things, along with the given fact the beach landings are quiet and un-countered by the Japanese, are examples of the film showing us the implements and actions of war without ever actually giving us war itself. Indeed, Malick presents us the results of any fighting before we see any fighting when the bloody bodies of two dead soldiers are encountered.But that's not to say there are no scenes of fighting at all. The beauty of the location, and the manner in which the camera makes us well aware it is in love with the place in the opening few shots of the film, is purposefully grossly juxtaposed with the notion of long, bloody warfare within the jungle. The first instance of fighting is painful, rather arduous and for not very much as American forces struggle to get an entirely firm grip on a hill dominated by enemy machine gun and mortar placements. There are a number of things that are to The Thin Red Line's great credit; firstly, the fact the film manages to sustain a distinct level of intensity following these Guadacanal landings, and the instances of one's mental and physical endurance being pushed. Secondly, the film's multi-equilibrium approach of detailing a central character's decline in marital status is handled well enough that it doesn't detract from the ongoing pain and suffering of the war as a whole unfolding around him and everyone else. The film is of the slow burning, but ultimately rewarding variety - Malick takes each step as it comes; dealing with fear, desperation, desertion and the lust for glory in an observed and timely fashion, the likes of which we should relish given the current rarity of films of this ilk.</fullReview>

Something started to be different. In lenght of time i realized that i need to see this once more. Then once more. Later some scenes once more. Some flicks are just meant for watching more than once. This movie is not only about words or some dialogs. A dying soldier covered with blood combined with an outstanding view of nature brightly describes the dualism of this unique movie that could be made like this only from director Terrence Malick. You shouldn't avoid this even if you hate war movies because TTRL is largely philosophical. One of the most influential picture movies i have ever seen.

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" directed by Terrence Malick is a very pretentious and pontificating film. The Motion Picture as a whole is very well directed and shot. The cinematography is exceptionally beautiful yet the dire narration and purposeless flashbacks hinder the flow of this film and cause it to drag interminably.The casting on the most part is good except for John Travolta's unconvincing turn as Brigadier. This really was a poor piece of casting and only proves that certain actors can't play against type.The war scenes are remarkable in there execution and incredibly well filmed. The explosions are very convincing and unlike the usual war film. The attack on the Japanese camp and machine gun post are also highlights of this film.The flashbacks to America and the poor little wife waiting in a slip for her husband to return seemed completely out of place. All the tension that had preceded these scenes was lost in an instant and so the cycle began again until another sentimental flashback, they just kept coming. I really feel this film could have had more power with out the interminable narration. The actor's succinct expressions seemed to convey the meaning of this film without the procrastinating. Why have actors act, if the narration tells us what they are thinking or feeling? For example in one early scene between Nick Nolte and John Travolta, Nick Nolte perfectly translates through his body language and expression the turmoil and impotency he is facing, so why literalise it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Red Line - Must See At Least Twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People jump too quickly to label this beautifully filmed, subtle work as a "war film". The Thin Red Line is no more about the war in the South Pacific during WWII than "Gone From The Wind" was a war film about the American Civil War. Rather, The Thin Red Line is, among other things, a movie about the loss of hope. James Caveziel's Private Witt who has seen another, better world while living AWOL in a melanesian village is set against Sean Penn's company sergeant ("the world is blowin itself up as fast as it can arrange it"), who, despite his cynical view of life, is fascinated by Private Witt. Then there is the absolutely magnificent performance by Nick Nolte as the passed over career West Point colonel, reduced to taking orders from the newly minted general as played by John Travolta. This movie is full of subtlety and symbolism. You must see at least twice. Yes, there is some graphic violence, but is used expertly to define and refine the characters, not the gratuitous violence of any number of "war films"(including the 1964 rendition of the same James Jones book). Watch for the symbolism of the crocodile and the cage bird as the film develops. Filmed on location in Australia and Guadalcan, it is also visually stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply explained, The Thin Red Line is a war movie like no others! Why? Because it dosen't film war. It film the people of war. The warriors, the casualties, the death and most important of all, the myth. All you logic thinkers of the world, in front of your desktop, ask yourself. Would you still think logically if you were in from of your imminent destruction? Maybe not.The movie opens on a beautiful sequence of Private Witt, getting closer of mother nature. Witt, despite not being a brilliant man is in some kind of communion with the nature. Well, the whole damn movie is. Malick dresses up an intriguing yet, interesting comparative study between nature &amp; nature of men. Terrence Malick goes deep into the nature of men confronted to death and destruction. You even see some touching antropomorphisation of nature, taking care of the departed when Coombs, taken by the waters of mother nature, takes a trip, by the rapids, to the other world.That's the major difference with all the war film I see. Death isn't the finality. What was bring by mother nature goes back to mother nature and Malick expresses it in a beautiful way.For the haters who say the movie dosen't have a plot, yes it does. Americans have to take back Guadalcanal. Simple but effective, not as plot less as a stupid average action movie heh? But Malick dosen't revolve about that idea. He's filming death and it's mythological surroundings, a bit like in the Iliad by Homer, who's cited by Malick once with Nick Nolte character.A truly beautiful and astonishing movie that went straight under the radar as far as understanding is concerned.A movie to see about individual living war.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films like this shouldn't be taken for granted.And Iam afraid too many have done that already.But that just can't be helped in today's shallow and superficial world of cinema.Terrence Malick's third and comeback picture is a masterpiece in itself.It contains some of the most poetic and poignant scenes ever seen in the history of cinema.The performances are all equally good,specially Penn,Caviezel,Chaplin,Koteas and Brody's.This movie served as a springboard for James Caviezel and it fully displays what he is capable of as actor.His scenes are very emotional and expressionistic,like Richard Burton himself or even Brando came back to do their best.I won't waste too many lines on describing this movie.It is best to try and experience it on your own and then look for answers and try to understand it fully.I haven't yet managed to do the last bit.It only shows the genius and brilliance of Malick's films.I have seen "Badlands" recently and there I found the same haunting and beautiful expression,complemented with the incredible landscape.The landscapes add tremendously lot to the artistic feel of the film.Specially the scene where the soldiers march through the fields where nothing but an overwhelming silence meets them.Just that moment expressed the whole feeling of being in a war.The fear is very monumental both in this film and "Badlands".Fear of not making it and the struggle for survival are ever-present.The film also shows the ambiguous face of the war and men who stand behind it,generals and commanders.Captain James "Bugger" Staros in Elias Koteas' incarnation portrays a typical disillusioned under-officer who has to take orders and carry them out no matter how unreasonable they sound.It all becomes too much for him and he bails out,losing some respect from the men in his command along the way,notably from Sgt.Welsh(Penn).John Cusack portrays the heroic and young Captain Gaff who,after carrying out his orders successfully and is deemed a hero by Colonel Tall(Nolte),realizes just what kind of man his superior officer is.He is the idealist as opposed to Staros' disillusioned and more experienced character.This is also another great angle that the film offers.Its only a shame Cusack didn't have more screen time,but thats a common sickness and in my opinion the only possible downside here.As I said,wonderful acting,wonderful landscapes and photography,music couldn't be better(Hans Zimmer never fails) and the poignant message altogether-make this a truly majestic work.This film deserves a 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is not for those with short attention spans. It is a long, poetic, and very deliberate look into human nature and anyone who sees this film expecting another Saving Private Ryan will be disappointed. The film asks the question, "Where did we go wrong? Is it really human nature to destroy ourselves?" and while the battle scenes are beautifully shot, the linear narrative is not what the film is ultimately about. Similar to 2001, which explored the origins of man and our place in the universe, The Thin Red Line explores the nature of human existence.This film is about how people, faced with death, can dive deep within themselves and pull out a beautiful image to comfort them and remind them what they are living for. Perhaps it's the intimate touch of your wife, or the way the sun feels on your face as you float in the warm tropical water. But your dream is shattered when you open your eyes and find yourself face down in the mud, gripping a semi-automatic rifle, feeling the weight of a dead friend on top of you, and anticipating the order that might very well send you to your own violent and painful end. You grasp for that one thought - that one memory that can help bring you peace and remind you why life is so precious.I can not recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is understandable but somewhat intolerable knowing that this true masterpiece, original hard work of a director would not even get the respect it deserved. This is my all-time favourite movie. Yes! The primary reason is that this movie appealed to the persons mind making the person think instead of trying out for an Oscar.-Most people obviously did not understand what a true masterpiece this was. Only at a superficial level is this a war movie. Instead of just making the movie from the book Terrence Malick includes the theme of Nature vs. Human (With aspects of love and God questioned by different characters each significant and with dept). The start of the story Showing Private Witt up to his death is a true symbolisation of him as a part of nature. Like mankind he starts in a paradise of nature and dies like all the other soldiers with a view of a natural element. I would not be going to far if I state that the final shot of the plant near the shore specifically represents Private Witt. When you listen to the narration and carefully take note on the camera shots this makes complete sense.-This movie is also a revolution for American cinema because it is one of the first ever movies that does not try to gather Oscars by flashing American Flags all over the place and playing to viewers patriotic views. Instead the perspective of the enemy is shown fairly as well.And the message is not "America is the greatest country, it saved the world" and I whole-heartedly agree with the viewer that stated that a person who hates this film must have really enjoyed and cried in Independence Day. I send my gratitude to you, sir.And more striking: All the viewers who have hated this movie have not really clarified what aspect of the narration "Did not make sense". So obviously they feared to think or pay attention to the narration.And for the viewer who stated, when talking about the characters, that "people don't think like that" I advise him to read the works from writers who have experienced war. Please read Earnest Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms" and Thornton Wilder's "The bridge to San Luis Ray" you will find extreme similarities in thought with Terrence Malick's adaptation of The Thin Red Line.-Another notable aspect of the movie is the fantastic acting of Sean Penn, Nick Nolte and Jim Caviezel. Especially Jim Caviezel's performance is also proof to how some directors like Terrence Malick are considerate for their actors and are willing to take risks allowing them to have important roles.-A movie is ofcourse not complete without a soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has created fantastic music, which sticks to your mind. Especially the scene in the smoke covered forest where the two enemies fight it out. The sensation created was a tragedy.-Finally I would like to finish this review by stating that Terrence Malick has opened a complete new dimension with additional characters (The most striking private Witt), scenes and offcourse message and theme. Too bad that people do not want to realize that theme and originality and the influence of the director is starting to re-shape the classic definition of Hollywood.-As Hollywood as well as America continues to open itself up to the world I am sure that this type of movie will be given more consideration. So cheerfully people speak about Globalisation but we sometimes have to realize that even the people who we consider to be our enemies are not purely evil. We are all human beings with our good side and our bad sideFor my last paragraph to make any sense to you please read the quote from the Japanese soldier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't just watch this movie, really take it in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has their opinions and is allowed to give them, no question. I do, however, think that, judging from a few of the comments, a lot of people missed out when they watched The Thin Red Line. Yes, the cinematography was absolutely flawless, portraying the beauty of Guadalcanal as the backdrop to a hideous and gutwrenching bloodfest. Everyone realizes this because it was right there in front of them. Yet, the true beauty of this film is the fact that the fears and questions these men deal with are understandable and very realistic.A frequent complaint about Line is that it fails to shape its characters and show enough of them to make the audience care about their fates. The character's makeup is irrelevant in a film like this though. You see a man die gruesomely, and you can only feel bad if he has had a lot of screen time? I think not. I am very impressed that Terrence Malick took a risk and chose a different route. Showing each character briefly gave you a sense of what each man was going through instead of just two or three of them. Why single out a few characters just because they're huge Hollywood stars?I also really enjoyed the fact that the Japanese soldiers were not portrayed as the evil, emotionless enemy. The film showed them as frightened and edgy despite being on the other side. It really made me feel hatred, not for the Japanese, but for war itself and what it does to its victims.Watching this movie did require time and dedication, but films nowadays seem to only be eye candy; a melting pot of special effects, basic dialogue, and familiar faces. Very rarely does a movie come out that makes you think about life, whether it be the lives of the characters or your own. Saying I was forever moved by this film feels like an understatement. I guess I'll say that I feel extremely lucky to be one of the people that have witnessed this soul stirring film. I obviously recommend The Thin Red Line to anyone and everyone who loves good filmmaking. I only recommend it, however, if that person is willing to take 170 minutes out of his/her life to appreciate every minute of this cinematic brilliance.</fullReview>

The key to this movie is that it shows bravery in the face of terror--young men who do incredibly brave acts even though they are afraid for their lives. Being brave does not mean you are not afraid. They acted because they believed in their "just" cause at the risk of everything. A powerful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The battle is inside the enemy is ourselves...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is not a famous director. Few things are known about this man and in 35 years he only has directed 5 movies. In Hollywood not directing a lot is generally not a good sign. But Mr. Malick is unlike any other director and his films are unlike any other films. When "Badlands" opens it was said to be the first film since Citizen Kane, where a director is so in control. Except maybe from Mr. Stanley Kubrick or Mr. Sergio Leone few directors control their creation as much as Mr. Malick. Basically what you see on screen is what he wants you to see. And with the "Thin Red Line" what we see and what we experience are beyond the picture?as the film takes place in our mind?War movies or anti-war movies for that matter have been a major genre in cinema and they all share a lot of similarities (battle scenes, sense of adventure, History and patriotism etc?)."The Thin Red Line" is not about battle scenes; it is not about adventure and or patriotism and is not an historical movie in the sense that Guadalcanal historical background is only used as a set, a stage. Still "The Thin Red Line" is about fight, the worse fight ever experienced the most horrible one and the most life changing one. The fight takes place inside and outside, in our soul and all around. In the "The Thin Red Line" Mr. Malick depicts a battle against the devil within and against events no longer in our control. This is the trial of Death, the fear of it or even the excitement from it. This trial is unfair in nature and physical battle is only a revealer that the trial has begun (e.g. the attack of the hill). During this trial our profound "animality" and humanity will be exposed to everybody but more importantly to ourselves. The events / elements are taking their revenge. Men lost in the center of a conflict that they (themselves) have created can't control the course of the rage. And why can't they? Just because the dogs of war can never be controlled once they have been unleashed. On one hand the soldiers are lost in the jungle; it seems that nature is not going to be an ally. On the other hand the Melanesians autochthons commune with their environment like they are part of it. This contrast is re-enforced by the music, the noise of hell is made of machine guns and mortars firing bullets (war) and the music of heaven is made of enchanting Melanesians songs (peace)? Is Mr. Malick giving us a lesson? Not really. Since "All Quiet in the Western Front" we know that war is not glamorous. What Mr. Malick reminds us (in case we forget this wide spread truth) is that we are alone and in front of Death we are even more so. The wife of Ben Chaplin (Private Jack Bell) is a reminder of this fact. Through his camera, Mr. Malick succeeds in isolating the person. Death (given or taken) is no longer a collective faith but an individual one and the phrase of Private First Class Doll "I kill a man" echoes in our head like an alarm clock forever plugged to our brain.Serves with an outstanding cinematography from John Toll and an impressive cast if not perfect, the "Thin Red Line" is one of the most thought provoking film I have seen in years. Some people might call it pretentious well?pretension is when perfection has not been achieved. I personally call it masterpiece?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that brings soldiers back from the dead, along with their hopes, fears, and dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick de-emphasizes the common depictions in war movies, and focuses on the conscience of few soldiers fighting in the Guadacanal. This movie is a true William Faulkner approach on emphasizing the human mind. Last year, I took year-long courses in HS about WWI, WWII, Vietnam, etc. We would read textbooks that would write about war statistically "100,000 men died for our country" blah blah blah. It seems that what we learned in school, news, and other sorts of media, would try to make war very patriotic. "A Thin Red Line" shows what many textbooks and propaganda seem to hide: The real horrors of war. I can see how many viewers may find "Line" very dry. This movie was full of symbolism that may have been hard to grasp. I believe that the only main character, Pvt. Witt, made the point of the movie clear. Pvt. Witt symbolizes the hope in this movie. Malick brings us to a world that is cruel and savage-like. The only way out from this death and bloody world for Witt is thru the power of the mind. It is only through the mind that soldiers can walk out of this war, and thru this mind, Pvt. Witt finds peace and serenity. Pvt. Witt shows that the real courage isn't thru killing someone, the real courage is sticking to the feelings that remain in your soul, like the love for his wife, "giving calm a spirit", and nature. At his death, he grasps all things he still possesses that will bring him to peace; which is ironically what he wished for in the beginning of the movie "to die with calm like my mom." He finds his peace and calm with the only thing he had left: the memories of his peace during his stay with the families that had lived in nature. The use of voice-overs helped objectify the soldier's experience. One soldier depicts how senseless war is after he shoots a man for the first time ". . . I did something worse than rape, and I don't get touched by doing it." "Line" stands as true literature, poetry, and truth. As the story builds, the meaning of war dissipates; war is not about politics or ideology (after all you don't see any of it intervening during the Guadacanal). I do agree that there were some things that weren't clear in the movie as well as some muffled voices. Yet this movie stands strong. This movie brings back soldiers from the dead, to give them back their character, their dreams, their hopes and fears. The film's foundation is to comprehend the deep and emotional battle within these soldiers in order to bring some hope and truth within the meaning of life. This is a compelling movie that takes patience, understanding, and hope that the other viewers feel the same emotional and complex feelings that lie within the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an astonishing film. Malick's pictorial sense--and his use of internal dialog and narration--is, in his three films, revolutionary. The aim here is to give a sense of each man's personal war at Guadalcanal, and Malick's use of voice- overs and his beautifully filmed cutaway footage succeeds brilliantly. The action scenes feel true, giving the full sense and throttle of battle without the false bravado of other war films. The fear feels real as does the desperate need for survival and triumph. Caviezel's Witt provides the viewer with a perfect mirror, and Sean Penn's counterpoint character, Sgt Welsh, is Witt's best foil. Nolte's Col Tall is also perfect.But it's how Malick photographs and crafts his films that make them archetypes for other filmmakers like David Gordon Green and Darren Aronofsky. Go andtake a look at the first 10 minutes of this film. Listen to Witt's narration; watch the jump cut of the native woman laughing. It's about the best 10 minutes of film you're likely to find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1990's philosophy applied to 1940's...doesn't work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am willing to bet that anyone who thinks this is the best war movie of all time is either a bleeding heart liberal with no concept of war, or is under 30 years of age (or both). The thought processes, philosophy, and values of young men in the 1940's were totally different than the 1990's. This movie was loaded with late 20th century thinking. It is a disgrace to offer history with a modern slant (of course we see history constantly re-written in schools using this same methodology).The only character true to the 1940's form was that of Nick Nolte. Sadly, everyone looked at him as the bad guy in this film. What a crock. Movies like this do not accurately depict the social, emotional, anthropological, physical or spiritual act of war as war was waged at that set certain period of time. The Vietnam warrior's mentality was different. Desert Storm's mentality was different. This is perhaps the worst war movie of all time. As a professional warrior and historian, this movie should end up in the bottom of the same lagoon we keep seeing over and over again in the movie. This is one whiny and whimpy movie. Too many crybabbies.Forget about the "hype" of "Saving Private Ryan". SPR was good becuase it applied 1940's style and philosophy to the era it depicted. Another true to form war movie, "When Trumpets Fade." This and SPR are the modern interpretations of World War II. Thin Red Line is just that..."thin"! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've been titled "The Thin Red Plot"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the reviewers here use the term "brilliant" to describe this film. They believe it represents a deeply artistic portrayal of war. These same film-critic-wannabees probably also listen to Kenny G and drive Volvos.Certainly the cinematography is stunning, and a couple of the performances are very good, but to call this a brilliant film is ridiculous. It lacks a plot, has incongruent cuts between scenes that leave the audience confused, and the cameos are badly mis-cast. I mean, John Travolta as a brigadier general? Come on!What's worse, the film seems to admonish the audience that "life is beautiful and war is a meaningless hell." Well, no kidding. It's insultingly patronizing to sit through a three hour message movie, especially when the message is a no-brainer and has been said before in much better films.Don't let anybody kid you. This film is clearly not on the level of Saving Private Ryan. The gorgeous cinematography of the wildlife and tropical rainforests is the only good thing I can find to say about this movie. Otherwise it is badly editted, plot-challenged, and way too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War in Arcadia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is not your typical World War Two film. Instead of focusing on battles and heroes, Malick's film looks at a group of soldiers fighting in the Guadalcanal, at their responses to the situations they've been put in.The best thing about the film is its (Oscar nominated) cinematography. Every shot looks like a work of art, and while this is largely helped out by it's tropical setting, you can tell a great deal of thought and care has gone into every scene. Some of the landscapes are amazing, and Malick even finds time to fit them into the battle scenes, the natural beauty of the island providing a stark contrast to the savagery of the battle it hosts. Hans Zimmer's (again Oscar nominated) score is also hugely effective, a fine example of this being when the Cusack-led attack on the bunker starts to go awry as it highlights the toll the battle takes on the psyche of the soldiers.Key performances come from the calculated, ruthless Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte), and the "soft" Captain Staros (Elias Koteas), but the cast is a bit too big and indistinguishable to really note anyone else. Whilst Jim Caviezel has the biggest role, he doesn't so much as as philosophically muse his way through the film, until he daydreams into his death. Such philosophical musings and mental interludes are obviously the basis of the film, but in my opinion they're used too regularly to be genuinely effective. There are only so many flashbacks you can watch and "gee, isn't nature beautiful" sentiments you can listen to before they grow old and hamper the film's progress.It's fantastically shot, but in my opinion too many philosophical ramblings hold back what could have been a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visually extraordinary disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" is a good film, peppered in numerous areas with wonderfully directed scenes, several complex and interesting characters, and a terrific ensemble cast. But several great qualities don't make a movie great, and the problem with "Thin Red Line" is that those positive attributes don't help the central movie. It's interesting to watch, and Malick's direction combined with John Toll's excellent photography work is at times astounding. But rather than heading for an interesting story, Malick's screenplay instead focuses on the "poetry" of war, for lack of a better word.Malick uses horribly annoying voice-overs throughout the movie, as his characters make profound comments on the nature of evil and the like. One major problem with the voice-overs is that the camera is often focusing on one character while a different person is speaking his mind to the universe. During the first half of the movie, I was annoyed because I had no idea who was talking. During the second half, I didn't care.The movie's two best performances come from Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas, and Sean Penn and Jim Caviezel also make interesting characters. But as the movie drags and lags, the audience loses all interest because, although the characters are complex, they have no connection with the plot.The result is a movie that is brilliant to look at, boring to listen to, and long to watch in the theatre. After finishing this movie, I felt betrayed because I realized that I had just watched a good film that could have been a great one.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, the so-absurd-they're-funny parts are few and far between, so I walked out after about 40 minutes and went into the theater with "Civil Action".This is the second film I have just plain walked out on - the first was Belushi and Aykroyd in "Neighbors", which was Citizen Kane compared to this movie.

		<shortDescription>Hard Movie To Like At First, But It Gets Better....Much Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film came out the same year as "Saving Private Ryan" - two blockbuster 3-hour World War II movies - but was nowhere the same success at the box office. Up until lately, I agreed with most other people that Steven Spielberg's film was more more appealing than this Terrence Malick movie....but now I am not so sure. I find both of them fascinating.It took me a long time to come around to liking this film. One problem was I expected more since I had to wait 20 years for another Malick film after his fantastic "Days Of Heaven." always one of my all-time favorite movies. I appreciated that Malick, in his two previous films, wasn't just a visual genius but had characters that expressed themselves without a ton of crudeness or profanity. In this film, Nick Nolte, ended that verbal romance with an assault of GDs that rattled off like a machine gun. That, and narration that sounded like some stoned-out New Age-guru or some '60s freak, , turned me and millions of other viewers off, most of whom could make no sense of the almost incoherent ramblings.Well, that narration, as I have since discovered - especially by putting the English subtitles on - is not what I thought and Nolte I can just do the opposite: hit the "mute" when he starts another of his obscene tirades. Now, the film is what I'd hoped it would be! It only took four viewings for me to fully appreciate this film. Hey, some of us are slow learners, I guess.The narration, to the best of my assumptions, is simply the anguish several of the soldiers feel as - in the middle of a horrific war - they try to make sense of life, death, suffering, war and spiritual matters in general. They agonize over loneliness of being separated from their wives and family, or they compare two extremes in civilizations as they now exist in one that is far removed in one they came from. Spiritual matters are discussed by Believers and non- believers, optimists and cynics. Seeing the narration on screen in the form of subtitles helped make me appreciate and make sense out of them. It's pretty heady stuff, as it turns out. Some may still think it's pure nonsense, but I'm willing to give Malick the benefit of the doubt.Meanwhile, the action scenes are excellent. In "Ryan," they centered more in bombed-out cities, but here the fighting takes place in a remote jungle. This really is the story of Guadalcanal. The scenery, much of it filmed in either Australia or the Solomon Islands, is just gorgeous, just the kind Malick loves. A true lover of nature, Malick gives us one spectacular scene after another with all the greens of grasses, tress and leaves you'd ever want to see, complemented by an assortment of exotic birds and reptiles. It's just stunning in parts. If you ever call a war movie "arty," this is it, with the great nature shots and reflective narration. They both provide needed relief from the intense action/profanity/suspense which occurs in the middle of the film as the Americans attempt to secure the top of a hill fortified by Japanese troops. The action scenes are realistic, have wonderful sound and well-filmed. The soundtrack also is very nice.As stated earlier, my only complaint was Nolte's character, "Lt. Col. Tall." who is the Hollywood stereotype of a gung-ho military officer they don't like (and they don't like many). He's constantly screaming and is so abrasive he almost ruins the film. Actor-wise, what's interesting is that a number of these "stars" in here were relative unknowns when this came out in 1998 - men such as Jim Caveziel, Adrien Body, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas - and now they are established actors whom most of us are familiar with. Despite the other big names you see advertised here, the stars of this film are Caveziel, Koteas, Nolte and Sean Penn. Many of the "names," such as John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack, etc., have only very minor or cameo roles.Anyway, if this movie turned you off when you first saw it, please consider giving it another shot. You might be pleasant surprised. It's better than what first meets the eye!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line (1998): Dir: Terrence Malick / Cast: Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson: It has been two decades since Terrence Malick directed his last film Days of Heaven and his return is welcome. What the title represents is beyond me but it involves the war between the Americans and the Japanese. Each soldier carries their own personal war and how it has affected them and they are played by among the biggest casting call in recent history. Malick went all out and received top draws in the talent field. There are many climaxes and subplots that render each performer their personal slot within the film. Sean Penn is superb in his warnings to a fellow soldier about attitude. Nick Nolte is excellent as his attempts to look out for the welfare of his men. Jim Caviezel steals scenes as a dare devil soldier who ends up a decoy and finds himself within a fatal position where it could spell the end. John Cusack is featured as a soldier trying to get water for the troops. This is a tremendous cast with everyone getting their moment while making this a rare ensemble war film. While the film isn't quite up there with Apocalypse Now, it is certainly a worthy candidate for a double billing. Malick's return is highlighted with explosive action that ranks all too convincing in its payoff. It is a tour of the dark depths of despair and casualty. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a triumph, however if only....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a very difficult film to review. I watched it a couple of nights back and have attempted to write a review several times. However each time I felt I was approaching it with either too positive a slant or too negative.When TRL is good, it is truly brilliant. It seems like every emotion of war is captured so perfectly. The terror, the heroism, the triumph, the guilt, the acceptance of fate, even the monotony. The intensity achieved in the capture of a strategic bunker has rarely been matched in any film, of any genre. The raid on a Japanese camp captured some of the most haunting shots I've ever seen, featuring scenes which were as tragic as anything in Schindlers List. There are some beautiful performances as well, from Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin and Dash Mihok in particular.If only Malick had known what he wanted to achieve when he set out, he could surely have made the greatest war film of all time. The first edit came in at five hours, and a whole host of famous faces were entirely cut by the time the final version was settled on. A number of others were left with little more than cameos, meaning we never got a chance to know them as characters so we remember them as Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack etc. No genre of film relies on the audience seeing the cast as real people rather than actors more than a war film, given the intrinsic link between cinema and reality. This is what makes Malicks decision to cast so many well known faces all the more head scratching (although it is important to remember that many of the ones featured in the final cut and previous cuts were much less known then).Having said that, what is left is still a fine movie, beautifully shot (excepting for the occasional art for arts sake moment) with one of the finest scores I've heard in a long time. It speaks volumes of Malick that despite the obvious flaws in his approach, he was still able to produce such an affecting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good old Terrence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war. The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful. The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect. The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.Though the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie Did Not Expect This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really having my doubts with this movie at the begging of the movie because it was really slow, but this whole movie goes by a little slow and that's the whole point of the story, for you to make you think about whats happening and "Why do we kill people?" "Whats the gain of war?". The questions are asked throughout the movie and at the end you are waiting for the answers but they never come, leaving you to think of the answers, which I thought that's why the whole movie succeeded. By its slow pace and it makes you actually remember and knowing the characters that died and got wounded in the battlefield. It also makes you very touched and sad for the soldiers and what they had to live through,and what all soldiers usually have to live through today. The only reason in my book this movie is not a 10 is because the start could have been sped up and the movie could cut like 15-20 minutes out of it, of just pointless visuals.But ending the review on a good note the visuals in this movie(which I loved) where amazing. They are a good piece to this movie to make you think about the beautiful environment on the island and the characters have great development and they are overall good actors. I would totally recommend this movie to someone that wants a slow paced action movie,and stunning visuals and good character development. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it a nature documentary? Or is it a war film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gets a 6/10 from me for the excellent war sequences. Unfortunately, they are very few and far between! I might give it an 8/10 as a nature documentary perhaps...Honestly, I've seen this film three times now and I still cannot understand the praise it gets. Firstly, its looooong - far too long. I kept thinking "they could have cut all that bit out". Secondly, is it me or does this seem like a (very well shot) nature documentary?! Im not joking...it does seem like Malick had to shoot a war film but thought "I know, Im not really into war and stuff really - Im going to shoot a nature documentary at the same time". Honestly there is far too much arty nature footage in this film - sometimes I forget its a war film or that there is a war actually going on in the film! If I want to watch a nature documentary Ill watch a nature documentary.Thirdly - and my biggest problem with this film - the romantic sub-plot/flashbacks. My god these bits are dull, useless and completely irrelevant! They were obviously inserted to add more "poetic meaning" etc - they really DO NOT work! I can just imagine even the people who love this film wincing a bit when these bits are on. They also help to destroy any momentum the film has (and its struggling in this department as it is what with the constant filming of swaying grass, monkeys, tribal people etc which of course have nothing to do with the plot - what there is of it). Why the editors of the film couldn't see this is beyond me.I've no doubt that the recent blu-ray release looks fantastic and perhaps this has influenced people's opinion of the FILM itself (god forbid ;) ). My clock-watching during this film was almost constant.To sum up - I think Malick wanted to film an arty nature documentary - the cinematography is indeed excellent. But as a war film? Forget it. You could halve the running time of this film fairly easily and it would still seem a bit bloated. Im sure its very poetic and has a lot to say about how man is bad and nature is good etc - zzzzz. Im amazed I stayed awake till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the opening of this film the viewers are introduced to private Witt. A deserter and pacifist, who appears as a saint or a personification of Jesus, sent down in the utopia of madness to remind his brothers about their humanity. Witt has left his post with another soldier and settled on a beach inhabited by Melanesian natives. Captain Staros is the former lawyer who reveals his benevolence and inexperience when he defies an order from his superior officer to save his soldiers from what he considers to be a suicide-mission. An event that turns into a personal conflict between a person who is willing to sacrifice as many lives as necessary to win the war and another who wants nothing more than to avoid lives from being lost. The roads of the Americans and the Japanese are magnetically drawn towards one another deep inside the jungle of Guadalcanal where every life stands and falls in the hands of faith.In this poetic representation of war, Terrence Malick reflects over man's existence through the sensitive camera lens that observes mankind and nature from multiple perspective. By using changing voice-overs Terrence Malick invites the viewer into several characters way of thinking which creates a rare though somewhat familiar intimacy between the characters and the viewers. "The Thin Red Line" is sterling when it comes to John Toll's detailed cinematography, Terrence Malick's subtle filming of nature and the enchanting flashback scenes which stand in considerable contrast to the dehumanizing consequences of war, and in Terrence Malick's depiction of war he focuses on the brotherhood and numerous characters individual perceptions and reactions to the war that goes on both inside and outside of them. So many of the acting performances in this film is great, especially those by Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas and Jim Caviezel in a breakthrough role where he plays an unorthodox main character and main narrator. This examination of man's encounter with nature's allure, peace and cruelty enters the depths of existentialism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's war poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is a war story told with images. There is a difference between that and a movie. It is a bold piece of film-making, especially for a war film, yet it makes all the same statements only without the stereotypes. If the creators of those dumb spoofs made "War Movie," it would be hard to make fun of this one. It's not the most engaging of films, but once again, it's more art through images and narration than a film.The plot is more like loosely combined narrative threads, a structure akin to a piece of music like a suite or symphony. There are distinct movements but everything is tied together with narrated reflections that repeat throughout. First there's Pvt. Witt (Caviezel), a soldier who's gone awol in the South Pacific, living in a kind of paradise on an island until a military ship comes along and he feels obligated to join up. The other story lines are different soldiers in the unit of young men. The island is Guadacanal and it represents a key turning point in the war against the Japanese.The cast boasts a lot of prominent actors before their prime such as Adrien Brody and John C. Reilly, but a lot of staples such as Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and Nick Nolte as the war-mongering Lt. Col. Tall, whose life devotion to the army clouds his judgment, particularly when he orders Cpt. Staros (Elias Koteas) to lead his men on a sure suicide maneuver -- the film's most "standard" dramatic moment.The beauty of "Red Line" is not only John Toll's moving cinematography or some of the most memorable film editing, but also its ability to be a war film despite not acting like one. I love a war film that makes a particular choice about how it portrays "the enemy," which director Terrence Malick certainly does. For much of the film the Japanese are faceless enemies firing from a far, but as the fighting heats up, suddenly we see them, we recognize their humanity and how war has affected them too. We see the soldiers grow closer and without any extended obligatory booze, cards and cigarettes scene.Malick's film does what good poetry or music ought to: It uses its method of consumption as a means of affected people, of getting an emotional response. Sometimes that response is "bored," especially considering film is not the entertainment media of the patient person, but many times it's surprisingly effective. The cutaway flashbacks to one of the soldiers with his girlfriend or wife on numerous occasions that are set simply to music and narration are so much better than a dramatic flashback where a scene plays out, so much better at communicating the feeling of longing."The Thin Red Line" has some tough competition when it comes to aiming at being one of the best war films ever, but it stands out as different among the pack, which might be the more impressive feat.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetic and philosophical nature clearly sets it apart from other war movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a title, that comes from a poem by Rudyard Kipling, to the opening voice-over to the all-star cast, the poetic and philosophical nature of The Thin Red Line clearly sets it apart from other war moves.The closing lines carry the essence of this gritty conflict: "This great evil. Where does it come from? How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us? Robbing us of life and light. Mockin' us with the sight of what we might've known. Does our ruin benefit the earth? Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine? Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed to this night?" Brief appearances by an all-star cast mark this movie as something special. Adrien Brody, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Tim Blake Nelson, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, John C. Reilly and John Travolta all make brief appearances.Though Woody Harrelson and Nick Nolte give powerful performances, to see James Caviezel's incredible angelic demeanor is know why he was cast as Jesus in Mel Gobson's The Passion of the Christ.Yet this story is not a WWII Pulp Fiction. It is more Apocalypse Now meets Flags of Our Fathers. As such, its dreary poetic nature is likely to remain with the viewer long after its green on green jungle fighting scenes. 7/23/2009</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had mostly heard negative things about Terence Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line' but now that I have seen it, I'm glad that I followed my instinct to give the movie a chance. What makes this one different from other movies is the beautiful storytelling. With solid writing, 'The Thin Red Line' has a poetic feel especially through the powerful voice-over. Mallick also makes fine use of the beauty of the spectacular island and it contrasts marvelously with the ugliness of war. The superb cinematography and dazzling visuals capture both the horror and beauty of the circumstance. Unlike the many numerous war movies, this one takes a deep psychological perspective of what's happening in the mind of the key characters. Here the major ugliness of the war is what was going on between the American soldiers as they are being forced to take orders that would only lead them to death or suffer the consequences of disobeying them. What also intrigued me was that these people were portrayed as normal and flawed human beings who feared for their lives. Mallick handles each and every sequence with skill. The editing department deserves mention because given the long duration, the pace is steady and it didn't feel as though I had watched a very long movie. The score is fabulous and the sound effects are brilliant. The enormous cast includes Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, Adrien Brody, George Clooney, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta and Nick Nolte. All the actors do a terrific job but it is Caviezel who mostly carries the film. 'The Thin Red Line' is a refreshing watch and I don't hesitate to say that it's on par with 'Saving Private Ryan'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ranks Among the Best War Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a second is wasted in Terrence Malick's ambitious masterpiece, a meditation on death, courage, and love in the midst of war. John Toll's cinematography is stunning, and it is clear that every shot was well thought out and carefully considered. The stereotypes that are present in even the best of war films are non-existent here, each character acts like a human being, and we do not need any flashbacks or dialogue to truly get a sense of who they are. The acting is fantastic across the board, as each actor knows their character inside and out, conveying a wide range of emotions without the use of dialogue. Nick Nolte deserves special mention for his scene-stealing performance as Tall, and the ferocity he brings to the screen grabs your attention without distracting from the rest of the film. Malick gives the film a very intimate feel (this is especially apparent in the battle scenes), and the viewer experiences the wide range of emotions felt in the chaos that is war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a haunting picture with images that appear to me now and then, a reminder of the beauty of the film amidst the dark backdrop of war. It presents the idea that we are inextricably drawn to war as a race on this planet. The beauty of nature that surrounds us must ultimately become destroyed through our action, our own greed. It's a bleak picture with glimpses of what could have been for one of the characters. His vision that there is another world, a better world is mocked by Penn's character throughout. This idea is raised I think about three times between the two characters and in the final scene you almost think Penn is starting to believe his friend who seems at peace with himself. Sure enough however it is Penn who visits his friend's grave, and is left to mourn alone. Is it better to be the victor or the vanquished? Neither is the answer here. We kill a part of ourselves with the hate and anger that we allow to drive us to war. So not a happy film. The final shot seems to offer hope of nature's resolve, of it's ability to rise above mankind and after we are all long gone it will still be here in its infinite glory. The music by Hans Zimmer is superb and the piece 'Journey to the Line' is a sound I find so stirring it moves me to the very core. This was worth the wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War poem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To its credit, The Thin Red Line is a novel approach to the war movie genre, which otherwise tends to be rather formulaic. It's a war movie that also tries to display the thoughts of its characters, and it visually showed me the war in the Pacific in a way I hadn't seen before -- for instance, by showing us not just soldiers but at least some of the native inhabitants of the islands (although basically as mute savages).I didn't really enjoy the long poetic stretches though, at least not on DVD. I thought they were too elaborate, too well formulated to be realistic, and too ditzy. It's something that came across better when I saw this movie for the first time in a proper cinema.The narration has its flaws, too. It was only after I read the synopsis on Wikipedia that I learned that Pt Witt had gone AWOL with the natives prior to the main events of the film; before, I always wondered how he got to hang out with them. Apparently the movie was heavily rearranged during editing and many scenes ended up on the cutting room floor (I would have loved to have seen Mickey Rourke in this!), so that may account for the choppy narration. It's also difficult to follow the individual story threads as the film switches around quite a bit, and those actors all look pretty much alike (all Latin lover types except Nick Nolte).Oh, and I thought that the shell-shocked soldier ranting on about "Leaves! In the wind! That's what we are!" was too histrionic.So, this movie may not live up to all its aspirations, but it's still absolutely watchable. And as always in war movies there are muscular, rippling torsoes a-plenty, if that's your cup of tea.</fullReview>

While it is indeed overlong and parts towards the end bored me, the bulk of the film is hypnotically engrossing. The directer has an uncanny ability to film nature and takes a dispassionate nonjudgmental view of war and human suffering. The pace is deliberately unhurried and allows you to experience what's happening on the big screen. There are simply too many recognizable faces, some of whom should have been edited out of the film. Still, Sean Penn, James Caviezel and Nick Nolte leave an impression.Overall 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is one of the best, if not THE best, war movies ever made. It tells the story of a group of soldiers before, during, and after the invasion of Guadalcanal in WWII. Pvt. Witt (James Caviezel) theorizes about death and life in the world of war after he goes AWOL yet another time. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin), homesick and devoted to his wife, philophizes about the war of love inside of him. The relationship between Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas, in one of the best supporting performances ever, in my opinion) and Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) is examined after Staros refuses to obey Tall's orders in the heat of battle, knowing that it would mean certain death for his squad. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), a weary war veteran tries to hold the team together and focuses on reforming Witt. These are just a few of the dozen of story lines presented in The Thin Red Line. However, if you ask me, there are no real story lines. It is a war seen through the eyes of the soldiers who are facing the horrors of this practice. This movie is long, it is slow, but it is also meditative. Not boring, but meditative. It is a thorough, beautiful, and shockingly realistic examination of the paradox we call war. Now, this film is not for everyone. It's not for people with short attention spans. It is not for people who need constant action to stay entertained. But those who are meant to see this film, will see some of the best cinematography, direction, and pure realism ever put on screen. This film stays with you. It is a beautiful and haunting symphony to the art of the human soul, the world of nature, and the pure horror that war holds for ALL the people involved.

		<shortDescription>War doesn't ennoble men. It turns them into dogs, poisons their souls...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In THE THIN RED LINE, Terrence Malick serves up a compelling story full of chaos and intrigue, in a visually pleasing manner, as is his artistic tendency. Many shots contained herein serve to give the viewer a 'feel' of the environment. Such shots focus on images as diverse as crocodiles, insects, dogs, streams, and hills (to name a few). The brilliant imagery leaps out at the viewer in a profound manner, to enhance the overall experience of the film.The story itself is a deep and immersive one; it is intelligent, multi-dimensional, complex, and character-driven. Malick assembles an all-star cast for this motion picture, with mixed results. Some are quite magnificent, including Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, and Ben Chaplin. Some are mediocre, including John Cusack, Adrien Brody, and Woody Harrelson. And a couple are just plain awful (John Travolta and George Clooney), but thankfully they have very little screen time and hopefully viewers are too starstruck to notice their poor acting. They decrease the film's overall quality to some extent, but should not take away from the film itself, as it remains a gripping war movie, easily one of the best to emerge out of the 1990s.Having been made shortly after the excellent SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, this film had huge footsteps to follow, and it does so successfully for the most part. The problem is that THE THIN RED LINE falters a bit in its final quarter. The editing seems rushed, and story stumbles a bit, seeming incoherent as it rambles and sprawls. The resulting sense of disorientation takes away a bit from the film, but should not detract any potential viewers, as the film is epic in scope and content. THE THIN RED LINE features some excellent cinematography and writing. Unfortunately, it will always seem/feel like the less-favoured second child, after Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. In this case, it is not necessarily a bad thing.I consider myself to be a huge War-movie fan (and critic) and I thoroughly enjoyed THE THIN RED LINE. It deals with the terror and panic that grip soldiers on the battlefield in a refreshingly chaotic and complex way. On a side note, Martin Scorsese (possibly the best director of all time, and my personal favourite) lists this as his second favourite movie of the 1990s.3.5 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at #97. Unreservedly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It always sounds a bit lame when you hear a 20 something who's never actually lived through a war let alone be part of one praise a war film for it's 'realism', but this is exactly how I imagine a real war to be. No bias is put on the emotions of one side, both Americans and Japanese are shown to have the same emotions of fear, anger and in some cases insanity. Usually in war films it's only a small minority that show fear and sometimes cowardess and I sometimes imagine that in reality there would be a hell of a lot more soldiers displaying these emotions and characteristics, as shown in the thin red line where most characters at some point experience this, even the hardened Seargent played by Sean Penn.Despite all this two characters really stand out for me. Elias Koates is fantastic, playing the 'professional businessman turned soldier' with equal skill and magnanimousness as Hanks does in Saving Private Ryan, and Nick Nolte as Lt. Tall, an uncompromising experienced soldier in his first real war. The standoff between those two on the hill was a real standout moment.This is my first Mallick film, despite being close to buying Badlands on a few occasions but I'll definitely be buying that one soon. I can see why film buffs revere him so highly. His sweeping style and imaginitivity behind the camera lends really well to epic war films and I'm surprised that he hasn't done one before this. I can imagine the same style will also translate well into westerns and road movies too! All in all, despite not breaking new ground in terms of the battle scenes, Mallick tries to show a more human, spiritual and moral side of war and in that I think he succeeds. The characters seem more 'real' than possibly in any other war film I've seen since the huge raft of British WWII films of the 60's and for that alone I think it's a great accomplishment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overly meditative war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that I usually recall about Malick's "The Thin Red Line" is that it was released around the same time as Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan". These are two vastly different approaches to similar subject matter, both of which ended up vying for the Best Picture Oscar.The strong point of the film is undoubtedly the direction by Terrence Malick. Intimate scenes and chaotic battle sequences are shot with equal aplomb and throughout the film the cinematography is truly exceptional.I wish that I could say that the score matched the grandeur of the visuals but I was completely underwhelmed by it. That is unfortunate since so many scenes emphasize the score to a large degree. The score would be passable in the background but it is much too uninteresting to cannot carry a scene on it's own.The cast is well assembled with only a few questionable choices. Particular standouts include Nick Nolte and Sean Penn, though I find that the cast is so large that it allows only a handful of actors ample opportunity to strut their stuff.The thing that ruins the film for me is the snail's pace combined with an overly meditative approach. I would have much preferred if the frequent voice-overs had been trimmed extensively. That, combined with the relative lack of action (not a problem in and of itself), lulls me to sleep.With a plethora of vastly superior war films out there I don't think that there's any need to waste time on this one. It's a marked alternative to "Saving Private Ryan" but even if you're not much of a fan of that film (like me) you may be even less impressed by this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many viewpoints? Choppy? Was supposed to go for 9 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick reminds me more of a painter than a film maker, in that he doesn't seem really connected or concerned with how an audience is going to respond to his films. He simply makes them, puts them on display and lets you think whatever you're going to think.Apparently the first cut Terrence Malick did was 9 hours long.Although even I could never sit through a 9 hour film, i can understand why the finished product (coming in just shy of 3 hours) appears choppy or not fleshed out enough, and why some key players seem only to flit in and out like hummingbirds. But, given these constraints, Malick still delivered whatm, to me, is one of the few definitive "anti" war films out there.Okay, in my slightly annoying over-analysing of this film i came up with a few things I call "flashes of brilliance", moments in a movie that make me go "whoah...that was COOL!" basically...Anyways, some flashes of brilliance in Thin Red Line: 1. Capt Staros (Elias Koteas) close up shot of his face as he wonders aloud: "The Japs gotta have something protecting those approaches..." The scene immediately cuts to a POV from a Japanese machine gun bunker. There is total silence, and the barrel simply tracks back and forth, slow and menacing, letting WE the audience know that Staros is indeed correct.2. Contrasts - many examples of course in TRL, but my favourite has to be the baby bird, a struggling new life in the mud as we hear the thunder of war all around. Brilliant. (oh and FYI if you have ever actually SEEN a baby bird being born you will realise this baby bird is NOT dying, as some commenters have stated)3. POV shots as the US troops storm the Japanese encampment. No more needs to be said.4. Difficult scene to watch - the American GI "talking" with a wounded Japanese soldier, being so casually vicious and evil, but speaking in such a slow, gentle way, before leaning over and pulling gold teeth from a dead man's mouth. Chilling.5. A soldier crawling through long grass and the long grass touching his face reminds him of his wife's caress. Inspired brilliance, IMO.The film is not perfect. It's lengthy and convoluted, and has too many viewpoints. A more narrow field of focus would have helped the film, as it is, it's a little "detached" in that you don't feel as much for these young men as you should in this situation.Although the moment near the end, one of Sean Penn's final "inner-monologues", I paraphrase, but one sentence ends with "If I never meet you in this life, let me feel the lack..." a moment that hit me in the heart and made me swallow, big time.Many have complained about the lack of dialogue. The beauty of Terrence Malick's writing is what is NOT said. Like the scene where Witt gently washes water over a comrade's head who has just come from a battle and is crying.But, then again, I'm just a PSEUDO INTELLECTUAL so what would I know? ;)</fullReview>

Sean Penn has an Oscar-worthy performance and is by far the most successful in the cast. He is the one who "opens" and "closes" the film. People will surely remember Penn's complete assumption of the character. His Sgt. Welsh is very carefully crafted. Nick Nolte, as Lt. Colonel Gordon Tall, hands in another outstanding performance. Several actors distinguish themselves in supporting roles. John Cusack is so good that he seems underused. Woody Harrelson portrays a mean but heroic Sgt. Keck in his brief role. John C. Reilly turned in a strong performance as well."The Thin Red Line" is nearly three solid hours of a beautifully complex and poetic motion picture. It's very realistic, unlike Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan", for example. Best war movie ever. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fabulous film.I was blown away by it, total class.SPR has been my favourite film of all time for years and it still is up there for "Stick in the drawer and have some fun" But this movie the thin red line is a masterpiece of emotion.I watched the film when i was 11 And i hated it but now i am much more appreciative of this films truly great qualities. Not only is the fighting in this film thought provoking and gritty it is also accurate and realistic, i loved the battle scenes but its also the other things that go along with it.The relationship between the soldier and his wife in this film gives the impression of the pair being soul-mates and the way she dumped him for another man really showed how quickly life can change. One minute your in love and longing to be in the arms of the woman and the next your world falls apart as she leaves you, it really gave me a jolt when i was watching that part.Overall the film is fantastic and has some of the best camera-work i have seen for a film in a long while.Truly class film and is up there in my favourite films ever 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful, poetic and tough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's The Thin Red line was released in the same year as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but each film couldn't be more different. Ryan focuses on how a man's innocence dies in war, Malick's film is about how a man's soul dies in war. The thin red line is flawlessly acted, a special notion should be given to Jim Caviezel as the Kentukian Private Witt, Seann Penn as the enigmatic Welsh and Nick Nolte in a performance as good as in Affliction as Colonel Tall. The film is well paced and the voice overs really reaches the heart, specially Witt's quest for immortality. Unlike the book, Welsh is not a nutter and Witt is more Philosophical. As well the relationship between Welsh and Wiit is more like the one of Warden and Prewitt in From Here To Eternity, another book from James Jones.Brutal and Beautiful this is in my TOP FIVE FILMS OF ALL TIME. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film brilliantly uses the Guadalcanal story from James Jones' book to show the horrors of war against the beauty of nature. Voicovers provide a philosophical point of view of the various main characters as their lives unfold and we learn more about them. A love story shown in flashback is also used as counterpoint in one story. At once beautiful, shocking, horrifying difficult to watch in some instances Malick only brings these points more fully into clarity. One of my favorite war films along with Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now Redux. The performances are stellar especially Jim Caviezal as the gone AWOL soldier who has a love/hate relationship with his first Sargent played by Sean Penn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is the mirror that he provides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malick provides us always with a mirror. This is not good or bad, but just a view of ourselves. What appeals to you about war, any kind of war, on our side our theirs? Do you like it, or see that it is necessary, or hate it and see the futility of the effort? It is most certainly never beautiful, at least not when you have lost someone to it or even look back upon it from some future point and historically. This man, by allowing us to participate in the story, let's us make our own decision. In this case, the thin line is thin because of the apparently very slight difference between our own internal decision and that which our culture, nation, and whatever else influences us directs us to make. It's up to each one of us, not the collective. In fact, this is the last war film anyone needs to see (that is, unless you like the idea of war or think that it is necessary). Watch his latest, The New World. It speaks even clearer to how much power to change the world we each have as individuals. And if you appreciate this director, you owe it to yourself to also see the films of Peter Weir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving exercise in existentialism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the film I can completely understand how people can utterly despise it. They probably felt the same way I did while watching Castaway, several hours of my life better spent watching paint dry. However I was fortunate enough to first see the film as part of my university course, and am therefore privy to some academic insight. In The Thin Red Line, war is not the finished piece, only the canvas. The theme of the film is existential ambiguity, wonderings on the nature of humankind, our world and the next. Private Witt and Sgt. Welsh represent the two possible outcomes of existentialism, theism and nihilism. Its about religious experience, positive and negative. Crisis is a medium for religious experience, it sparks the sleeping giant inside that demands to understand the who, why and how of life. These themes are subtle, and it really does seem like its going to be a film about war. There is little hint of any other major issue at work, perhaps only the tagline 'every man fights his own war'. Either way, writer Terrence Malick uses war because it is the perfect medium for illustrating the anguish of the ambiguity. Facing death in battle is a likely moment to be reflecting on existence, are we just dirt or is some transcendent deity watching over us from the heavens? I'd certainly be wondering along these lines if my chances of being blown away were increasing by the second. Possibly the most tragic lament on the ambiguity of life comes at the end, Sgt Welsh's solo prayer to God, "If I never meet you in this life, let me feel the lack, one look from your eyes, and my life would be yours". His anguish is so profound, his cry for comfort so pained. It leaves you solemnly reflecting on our lonely lot. Its a truly wonderful film provided your in the mood to see it, maybe not if you've just been to see Saving Private Ryan and your looking for another moving drama on war and glory. The only glory featured in The Thin Red Line is God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply put...the greatest war film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The heading "greatest (blank) ever" is thrown around a lot, almost jokingly at times. But this is, in my opinion, genuinely the perfect war film. Because it came out in the same year as Saving Private Ryan, Malick's masterpiece took a back seat to a grittier, more realistic war film. But what we as viewers got in 1998 were two movies that showed different aspects of war. Saving Private Ryan is hailed because the film-making was so involving and intense that it makes the viewer feel like they are actually in war. On the other hand, The Thin Red Line, from one of the finest director/screenwriters in the world, Terrence Malick, does not dilute the effect of the violence of war, but it also shows how psychological war can be. Often, we have seen movies like Apocalypse Now, where the mental damage of war drives a man to insanity, but that is not what Malick wanted to show. The Thin Red Line is just as realistic as Saving Private Ryan, but the emotional spike is far more powerful. Part of that comes from Malick's trademark transcendentalist film-making, showing the sweeping landscapes and the beauty of nature, while at the same time emphasizing the environmental injury brought about by the interaction between men and nature. Part of the emotional draw comes from the characters, and there are many. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are phenomenal as they always have been, but it is the supporting cast that brings the reality of this film to light. Dash Mihok comes off as a surprise, as does Jim Caviezel, in one of his earlier roles. But there is also the Malick "silent character," here personified by a pale and small Adrien Brody. Other actors of note that only made this film more incredible include Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John Savage, John Cusack, and Miranda Otto. But one of the keys to the success of this movie is the powerful, ominous score by my personal favorite, Hans Zimmer. The scene in which the army storms the Japanese camp is chilling, both with what is shown on screen and how Zimmer's music hauntingly beautiful. All of the elements of fantastic film-making are present, yet that does not answer fully the question of why this movie alone stands above all the other war films in history. What does Terrence Malick do that makes The Thin Red Line so effective? When you watch war movies, there is seldom a personal feel them. Hundreds of soldiers race into battle, and many of them die. The Thin Red Line has these clich scenes, but there is another echelon of consciousness. Malick uses voice over narratives not to explain what is happening, but to explain what exists in the mind and not on the battlefield. War is not merely fought with arms, but with minds and hearts. At one moment, an American is killing Japanese soldiers and ridiculing their dead; yet soon, he shakes so hard that he cannot contain his own fear. This is kind of war that has never really existed before in film. For a plot as simple as taking one hill on a Pacific Island in World War II, The Thin Red Line supplements with substantial philosophy and psychology, showing the humanity as well as the darkness of war. In essence, The Thin Red Line is the most complete war movie ever made. If it had come out a year before Saving Private Ryan, perhaps we would consider it first when we think of revolutionary films. It is a complicate tale, one that is anti-war while still recognizing the courage and glory of it. You would be hard pressed to argue that it can be labeled as simply as pro or anti-war. But that is how Malick tells his stories. The moral ambiguity of humanity set against the backdrop of the natural world is his method. I have never seen another movie as significant and brilliant as The Thin Red Line. It is easy to compare it with movies like Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, but Malick's film is on an entirely different level.In this war, there is a thin red line between sanity and madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thin red line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i thought the thin red line was a dramatic piece of cinematography, maybe not a great realistic war movie, but an epic piece of movie-making-what defines this film is the psychology of war and also human nature itself and its involvement and processes during times of extreme horror and anxiety- for example, 'nick Nolie's' character is shown to be possessed by his inner ambition to succeed, and this comes at the cost of the lives of his men, interestingly it shows his feelings of regret in the early scenes by medium of voice-over- before the actual events happen. this film was released at the same time as Saving Private Ryan, famous for its realistic depiction of war, through time though audiences have evolved and become desensitised and after viewing it a few times it seems like a normal war film with a rather Hollywood-type plot. The Thin Red Line is a far deeper experience questioning human behaviour and morality, and has some poignant scenes. such as the baby bird , newly hatched,stretching and struggling in this new world-while in the distance guns and explosions are going off signifying the death and destruction brought upon by human nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Malick is a genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an accurate meditation on war! It encompasses and puts into actual speech the feelings and emotions of different kinds of soldiers and it is a film of utterly beautiful cinematography. I had one chill after another while watching this movie and I sat through the three hours almost crying. I believe that Terrence Malick created his masterpiece here and I admire him for what he knows about the creation of feelings via cinematography. In one scene, where Jared Leto sees two men of his platoon killed and hesitates about what to do next, Malick inserts a scene where we see the sun passing over the blades of grass. Then the camera goes back to Jared Leto and we see him getting killed a few seconds later. That's it right there! Usually battle scenes in movies display a relentless velocity and don't allow the viewer to take a breath. In this movie Malick shows how complete silence can turn into complete horror from one second to another! However, if you're German, do not watch this film in German. The voices of Caveziel, Chaplin et. al. simply don't have the same melancholic ring to them that they have in the original version. A lot of people probably can't relate to what this movie is about, but I served a year in German army and that gave me an inkling. So long, your favorite German critic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Astonishing Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line appears to be a film about war at first glance. It also appears to be a film about the nature of courage in the face of horror. On some levels it is these things and more,but beneath it's surface lies an even bolder subtext. Weaved into every frame of the film is a sweeping exploration of not only war but the nature of existence itself. What is our place in the universe? Is there any real possibility for peace when all of nature exists in a struggle for survival? How does beauty shine through even in the most horrible of places? These questions linger throughout this haunting film.Director Terrence Malick masterfully juxtaposes scenes of nature and indigenous peoples with scenes of battle and the struggle of the soldiers. The film unfolds in a dreamlike pace, moving from character to character, changing perspectives continually. The film is based on the novel by James Jones about the battle of Guadalcanal in World War 2. The cinematography and score are breathtaking. The acting is superb all around, especially Nick Nolte and Jim Caviezel. If you let it in, this film will leave you with a profound and lasting respect for the beauty of existence- a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater when it first opened. The audience expected "Saving Private Ryan in the Pacific," and many were very disappointed with that they got instead. Meanwhile, I was amazed.It is not plot-driven. It does not explain its back stories, its subtexts. Those are for you to figure out.It combines music, images, words, sounds into a poem of sorts, transcendental, spiritual, human, ambiguous, thoughtful.It is amazing only if you are willing to be patient and bring a thoughtful eye and an open mind to it.I just saw "The New World" and the audience reacted in much the same way -- leaving and talking out loud during the film's closing images (but not the credits). It too was slow, poetic, thoughtful, exploring the interiors of characters and the spiritual implications of life on earth. Heady stuff, but the audience wanted more action, more plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the first war films I watched and truly felt that a director actually believed that war is an Una-glorified undignified approach of mankind ,this film was directed by a poet, and it shows. This film shows how both sides suffered physically and mentally with war, and it also shows men doing something very strangely in a war move, showing emotion; near the end of the film after the Americans assault a Japanese base, an American soldier goes round pulling out Japanese soldiers teeth and in one very touching scene he kneels down and says to the dying soldier "Your gonna die now,... see those birds they;ll eat you alive" ... later the Japanese soldier responds "What are you to me?...nothing" , much later on the American soldier looks at the gold teeth and breaks down crying after hearing the dying words of the Japanese soldier, a very touching scene. This film gets you involved emotionally , especially because you see and hear the soldiers thoughts.The way the film is shot is very dream like and beautiful. Overall really I love this film , apart from Das Boot and Stalingrad , no film has dignified war as being a traumatic not glorified and terrible chapter that mankind repeatedly does and never learns from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In my book it was good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the privilege of viewing The Thin Red Line on HBO a few days back and my mind is still fresh about it. The film follows the fateful battles of American forces in the plans to take Guadalcanal and two soldiers especially. Private Witt is played by James Caveizel and First Sergeant Edward Welsh is played by Sean Penn. Caviezel's character isn't really developed enough for my liking. Every time I saw him, I felt that he was just there for the thrill. He does show humanity to the Japanese prisoners and is brought around as the good soldier. Caviezel does give a fine performance even with the few lines he has. He helps you to understand the life of an innocent soldier, a kid in the war there because his country told him to go. Sean Penn's character is my personal favorite. Penn's character is the only man who is actually realizing the horrors of war and how much devastation they are causing. Malick should have given Penn more screen time because of the way his character and Caviezel's worked so well together.My favorite part of this film is the way nature is woven with the battle scenes. The battle scenes are unsettling and horribly graphic. But while the war rages on, Malick shows that there is a world beyond the battle. He works animals into the battles like I've never seen. The scene that struck me most was when the baby bird is shown with its feathers charred off and it's dying. It shows the true horror and devastation war has on everyone. The battles will shake you in a way you never thought possible. The scene in the village is one of the most heart-pounding and emotional battle scenes I've ever viewed.The lead characters are introduced with V.O. (Voice Overs) and in my opinion, is a fresh and interesting way to do so. For a WWII film, The Thin Red Line succeeds. The battles are brutal, the drama is solid, and the characters are somewhat believable unlike other WWII films (coughWindtalkerscough). The film is a step below Saving Private Ryan but still should not be missed. Nick Nolte gives a powerful performance as the commanding officer and some other supporting roles work well with the film. It is a shame the movie was cut back so much. A war film such as this should have been lengthened a little more, possibly to three hours or even more run-time. In the end, The Thin Red Line is excellent. The Thin Red Line. Starring: James Caviezel, Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, and Adrien Brody.4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films, if not the greatest, ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to make this short and to the point. The Thin Red Line is one of the greatest films ever made. It isn't even about war, it is about what is it to be human, who are we? what is good? what is evil? what is the purpose of life? I had to watch the film a few times to catch everything, one viewing isn't sufficient. I've seen it at least 20 times by now. There are many people that either didn't get the movie or dismissed it simply as a war film. Not many movies have a prerequisite for proper viewing, but this one does: you must be reasonably intelligent, open minded, and slightly comprehend the generality of life. The voice overs are in-genius and enlightening. I must say it is helpful to have some background on Einstein and his beliefs before viewing this film. The basic concepts of each are intertwined. On this planet, in this solar system, in this galaxy, in this incomprehensible universe.. what is it to be a human? The Thin Red Line provides enlightenment to this question using war (the must horrible creation of man) as a tool for showing humans in their purest emotional form. This film is a must for all people.WITT V.O. Who were you that I lived with, walked with? The brother, the friend? Strife and love, darkness and light--are they the workings of one mind, features of the same face? Oh my soul. Let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made. All things shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Thin Red Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion only true filmmakers and artist can appreciate this film, not saying that I'm either of them. This film blew, "Saving Private Ryan" away, which was a good movie in its own right.The problem with, "A Thin Red Line" is that it was a poem and like most poems it's very subjective. You either get it or you don't and so it was so very poetic that it went right past most.The best thing about the film was the way he Mr. Malick described nature and what happens to it during war. Rarely do yo actually get to see tree's, the landscape, animals and even humims who don't share the polit'ricks of war. Life some how continues in spite of man's mission to destroy it with grace as a almost innocent bystander.I always feel like most Actor's, to include the Hollywood heavies who really enjoy being able to perform their craft as it was designed, not the nonsense they feel obligated to take because of the money. I could feel their commitment to something more powerful than money...life it self.Regards,KI</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Film is a masterpiece, a jewel, the actors were fantastic and the soundtrack by Zimmer outstanding. Tired of seeing war movies which are a simple succession of unrealistic heroes actions or exacerbations of special effects (from Rambo to Saving Private Ryan, Behind the Enemy Lines,etc, etc). This one is what I was waiting for, contemplating, in an artistic way, real human aspects of war, with real characters with a personal story that affect in their actions in coherent manners and in complexes ways. The overwhelming atmosphere of the movie, far away of being boring, is also a very good representation of what the war is for the minds that must confront it. Lots of transcendental inquires emerge from what it is being showed and some interesting answers are insinuated, what makes everything more interesting for the one that is prepared and receptive. The film made me feel that I never want to be at war, loosing my wife, dying stupidly blowing my as by accident or because an ambitious lieutenant. Common ones made people want to be in the place of the hero, presenting characters that are almost invincible and, of course, natural seducers. Another funny and perhaps transcendental question about all this is why most people prefers the second type of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly a war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Red Thin Line is one of my favourite movies of all time. It seems a war movie (it talks about a group of soldiers during the Guadalcanal battle, one of the most terrible in the Second World War) but when you watch it you realise that is much more. I firmly believe that there is no other film which reflects, with such reality, the psychology of the soldiers: its fears, its hopes, its dreams, etc. The action and how the battle is going on, lose importance with the wonderful dialogues between characters. In this way, it becomes a reflexion of the non-sense of war and violence, of how we can become heroes (even if we are not)or crazy (even if we weren't), of the meaning of loyalty and friendship, of the real meaning of killing another human being. The photography is simply amazing and reflects the paradox of the situation: enormous dosis of violence in a paradisiac island where every site is beautiful (I love the scenes where the soldiers are walking and they encounter the natives from the islands acting if nothing was happening, as if there were no war). The acting is brilliant (specially Nick Nolte, as always) and the direction is so personal (I think no director actually has a style similar to Malick one) that makes the film unique. I must also mention the beautiful music. The whole film is pure poetry and I can't understand how he didn't win an Oscar. Even if I must admit it's not an easy film to see I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

He also may have had a hard time with the intense level of emotional content that generally is not present in his other "war mediums". I am attempting to overcome the romance of war that he gets from his video games as well as other action / adventure movies. I think he got it. I am hoping that he got it. Time will tell. Actually the next six years. This movie does such a great job and kudos to the actors and crew for their attempt to show the horrors of what is, sadly, our real national pastime. This movie sits on my shelf next to Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Redux, Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down. All movies that I believe show us the stupidity of war and the tragic-ness of how we maim whole generations of our young.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good Effort from Malick, Could Have Been Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is a great director. Badlands is credited on my top 20 films of all time. Days of Heaven was a four star movie also. The Thin Red Line was sometimes a struggle to get through, but one of the best features about this film is that after watching it, it felt very complete. You had truly seen a full movie.There are some faults with this film which prevented it from being on Malick's mantle of masterpieces. One, many of the death scenes seemed very clich and came off as sappy. The flashback scenes to America are very pretentious, tiresome, and ultimately pointless. Third, as many users have said this, it is a struggle to watch from the 30 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes of the movie.As the opening scenes show we are in for a pretty good movie. We see an alligator staring around while in a swamp. You see young children on a Pacific coast island playing along. Jim Caviezel's character goes there and gets along with the people until a US ship finds him. Disrupting his almost Zen like existence.The positives of this film definitely out weigh the negatives. The cinematography in this film (like all of Malick's other films) is spectacular. Jim Caviezel does an extraordinary job. He channels many different types of emotions to create an extremely fascinating character. All of the cast was great. Sean Penn did a very good job as a compassionate but sometimes somber Captain. I was expecting him to be in one of his other screaming roles. Nick Nolte is great as the firesome head of the command. I felt he had a very watered down character of this in "Hotel Rwanda". This movie definitely hits something on the emotional level. From the lone scared American soldier screaming out in the rain grasping himself to the broken down and confused Japanese soldiers, it is hard for this film not to tug at your heart. The scenes with the natives are nothing short of poetic. As you hear them sing songs, have their arguments, and play along, you have the feeling that Malick might be exploitive. No, Malick commands these scenes with such grace that I found them to be some of the best scenes in the movie.Once again we come to one of my first statements: a complete film. It truly is. It does not make you wanting more of it. But it certainly does not make you want to shut off in disgust after watching a nearly three hour films. Although this movie is at times challenging to watch, it is ultimately very rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've never been so much impressed by a war movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I knew from the first minutes that it wasn't like any other war movie I've ever seen. Terence Malick does not primarily show the violence and destroying of war, he combines it with wonderful pictures of nature and by moving deep into the soldiers thoughts. I saw films like "Platoon", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket", too (no doubt, they are quite good), but mostly they only focus the human and his negative declinations during the war. In contrast to that "The Thin Red Line" has kinds of philosophic undertones. It goes deeper and asks questions like "How can the world create two such different things - the destroyable human being opposite the tranquil beauty of nature".In this film there are so many quotations I keep in my mind. My favorite is: 'One man looks at a dying bird, and thinks there's nothing but unrelenting pain. But death got the last word. It's laughing at him. Another man sees at the same bird - feels the glory, feels something is laughing through him.' That is the language the film is written of. It isn't this typical war language, it is a language that hides its content and meaning. Maybe this is one reason why the film isn't as popular as (e.g.) "Apocalypse Now"; but here you have to concentrate on the (well-written) monologues &amp; dialogs and be open for them. Then you can feel that it goes deeper than other war movies. And that makes it unique. A unique masterpiece of art.It always makes me cry when I see Witt (marvelous performed by Jim Caviezel) dying. First you feel like you lost your guide who lead you through the movie, then you have a soothe feeling when his voice comes over again but nevertheless I keep crying - not because he's dead, but because of this overwhelming feeling he delivers despite the fact that he's dead.The atmosphere - when you see one of the characters dying or during one of the fight scenes - is put into action with an emotional soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. Also the songs of the native singers seem to match perfectly to the atmosphere. At the beginning they reflect the usual peace out there in the jungle and in the end they reflect the peace Private Witt has found.I don't think these sentences can express how this film really is, but I hope they make it accessible to reality. But the best will be when you watch the film and find out yourself. Of course that's always a matter of opinion, and naturally there will be people who'll find that there's too little action in it and find it soporific and monotonous. But I think it is worth watching and after you've seen it, you keep preoccupied with it and its messages. It will always be one of my favorite films. I give it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film on the inhumanity of war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor SPOILERSAs you might gather from my username I am a terrible fan of this movie, so much so, that I'm now known as this movie.The name Terrence Malick (who wrote and directed this movie) is legendary to me. I saw his only big movie besides this, the 1978 Oscar winner "Days of Heaven" in 1995, when I was sixteen. I thought it was immediately the most incredible movie I'd ever seen. Not because it was flashy, or impressive in any way, but because it was real, and harsh and told you the inescapable truth, no matter how you wanted to run.At the time this incredible invention called the Internet wasn't so readily available (I didn't really get to using it until 1999), so I was searching high and low for more movie by this incredible guy called Malick, but I never found any. So when I finally heard the name Terrence Malick uttered in connection with this movie in the summer of 1998. My old memories came flooding back, and my excitement rose when I heard of the incredible cast, which is immediately the first incredible plus that this movie carries around. The cast is simply awe inspiring. Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, John Travolta and George Clooney were some of the big names this movie offered. In addition this movie contains a large amount of then unknown but now big actors like Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ), Adrien Brody (The Pianist) and Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, and soon Alexander). And even beyond that it offered even great performances from actor who I'd never seen before, and haven't seen since like Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John Dee Smith and Arie Verveen. With such a terrific cast of names Terrence Malick didn't surrender the movie to them, but kept all the parts in balance, or even gave the emphasis to some of the smaller names, as Jim Caviezel arguably has the largest part and hadn't even acted in a major movie until then.When I finally went to see the near three hour movie I can only say I was astounded by it. The movie hit me as 'Days of Heaven' did, with the realization that I'd seen something truthful and powerful, unlike 'Saving Ryan's Privates' which I'd seen several moths before, which, apart from the great opening scene, was a pretty bad movie which prays on stereotyped characters to advance a plot which only is about shooting and violence. When I saw this movie I felt profoundly touched by a deep realization I'd seen something the soldiers had really been through.The plot is rather simple. It is the story of the army that took Guadalcanal Island in the pacific in 1943, seen through the eyes of several soldiers. And with this incredible cast of unknowns and much-knowns we get something very unusual, namely an actor, not action, driven war movie. Much of the movie is not about the marines shooting up a bunch Japanese, as I said there is little plot, but an examination of what happens in between those rare moments when soldiers saw any action. But Don't get me wrong, there is action galore, including an hour long scene where the soldier's try to conquer a hill occupied by several Japanese gun emplacements. The story is not told by dialogue, but through he thoughts of the soldiers themselves, told through the narration.The movie is also very visually beautiful. Oscar winning cinematographer John Toll (Braveheart, Ledgends of the Fall) has created a veritable masterpiece of camera work.The movie is severely criticised for being too long and too slow paced. I do feel that those criticisms miss the point slightly. The point is that the soldiers never knew when they would be fighting again, and so the slow pacing, to emphasise the point that they weren't always in combat.Another criticism is that when you watch this movie its like flicking between the nature channel, history channel, and occasionally the psychology channel. Although this is partly true (the movie opens on a shot of a crocodile, and frequently intercuts to show animals, or wide landscapes) the movie clearly wants you to look beyond the realm of a Jean-Claude van Damme like shoot-up movie, nor would the movies point have worked if it had been about the shooting, like Saving Private Ryan.This movie is mainly a humanitarian movie. It shows mainly the contrast between life (the Malenesian scenes) and death (the battle scenes). It promotes life, but not by voicing it. It shows it strong and powerful message by showing how horrible war really was.A terrific movie, definitely a 9/10 (maybe even a 10/10), which is very high up on my list of all time favorite movie. Nominated for seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director), winner of the prestigious Berlin Golden Bear, and winner of Best Director at the New York Film Critics Awards and Chicago Film Critics Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and disturbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was deeply moved by this film. Sometimes brooding and harsh, sometimes beautiful, The Thin Red Line looks at war from more points of view than any war film I have ever seen.It may be that these many points of view hurt the film's cohesion for some in the audience, but for me the combined effect of each character's thoughts and experience is what gives the film its great humanity.This is not a flag-waving war picture, nor is it an action-adventure film, and yet the battle scenes have a mad, intense terror that faithfully capture James Jones' depiction of close combat. There is courage aplenty, compassion, agony, stone-cold fear and red-hot murderous rage. There are soldiers who want medals and recognition, soldiers who will do what they can, and soldiers who just want to stay alive. And always-- the gulf between officers and enlisted men,-- a key theme in Jones' novel.We Americans have always looked upon WWII as a--I hesitate to use this word-- "moral" war; a war we undertook only after great provocation against two ruthless, aggressive enemies. I for one have always believed this, and do still. But..., my God, these were YOUNG men. They mostly wanted only to live..., only to LIVE. Can we really understand such irreparable loss?More than any before it, this film makes us look directly at this horrific sacrifice. All Quiet On The Western Front, with Lew Ayres, comes closest. But of course, that was a film based on a German novel.I'm getting emotional now. But that's the effect this film had on me. I hope I've conveyed it in some measure. I leave you with James Jones' "Dedication" to his novel, The Thin Red Line:This book is cheerfully dedicated to those greatest and mostheroic of all human endeavors, WAR and WARFARE; may they nevercease to give us the pleasure, excitement, and adrenal stimulation that we need, or provide us with the heroes, the presidents and leaders, the monuments and museums which we erect to them in the name of PEACE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, Unique War movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very good because it was so original. The script and the shots from the film is very poetic and artistic which i like a lot. This film is almost the complete opposite of Black Hawk Down because it focused more on drama than constant fighting. But There's one thing that bothers me about this movie. Why is the movie called the thin red line? I remember they had a shot of a thin red line in the beginning in the ship prison but i still don't get the significance. Usually movies explain the title or its self-explanatory but this one definitely doesn't. I don't even remember anyone saying "thin red line" in the movie. If anyone who reads this understands the symbolism please post a comment on it. If not ill try message boards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why ??? is this movie so underrated on IMDb, every time i see that score it puts me down. Story:Based on the novel by James Jones, THE THIN RED LINE tells the story of a group of men, an Army Rifle company called C-for-Charlie, who change, suffer and ultimately make essential discoveries about themselves during the fierce World War II battle of Guadalcanal. The story takes place as Army troops are moved in to relieve battle-weary Marine units. It follows their journey, from the surprise of an unopposed landing, through the bloody and exhausting battles that follow, to the ultimate departure of those who survived. The story is more than a tale of men fighting a key battle, one which would ultimately stem the Japanese advance through the Pacific Islands. It explores the intense bonds that develop between men under terrible stress, even evil; to Jones, who served with an Army unit in Guadalcanal, the soldiers' feelings and emotions developed into nothing less than a sense of love...of family. The horrors of war helped them lose their idea of self and of the world around them. They were no longer fighting solely for patriotic reasons or the larger world and its issues which had brought them there; they were fighting for survival and for the men next to them. My opinion:This is one of my favorite war movies of all time together with Appocalypse now, Platoon and Saving private ryan. The best about the thin red line and also what makes it so different than all those other War movies, are the poetic dialogues from some of the carachters they really make you feel bad about war. "war doesn't make men noble it turns them into dogs" and please let be honest this is the truth.also great is the cast which exists of Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John cussack, Jim Caviezel, Adrien Brody, Woody harrelson, George cloony and much more fine actors.And then of course the beautiful nature scenes from the south pacific, and one of the best soundtracks from Hans zimmer.Maybe the amount of action is less than movies like Saving private ryan and blackhawk down, but the action scenes this movie contains are very good and make you sit at the top of your seat especially the Japanese village scene makes you believe that War sux. This was the first movie that Showed me that there are no Winners and heroes. "It's all about Property"The Thin red line never gets me bored, and is listed in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. a nine out of ten9.6 /10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie, but it might disturb those who had other expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing some of the reviews, I guess some of the things must be gotten straight immediately.If you're looking for a war movie with fast-paced action ? la Saving Private Ryan, this is not the movie you're looking for. If you're looking for a movie that will tell you all about the battle of Guadalcanal and how it happened, this is not the movie you're looking for. If you're looking for a movie with a structure you can easily recognize, with a strong good hero you can immediately identify with and with evil baddies that must be defeated, this is not the movie you're looking for.If you're not open to something new and that can disturb you movie-watching habits, and if you want a movie that will just help your brain cell rest and entertain you, look for something else.There, you're warned. Now you can watch this movie with a free and open mind, and you'll probably appreciate it more.The Thin Red Line is a movie that happens during war, but it's not a "war movie" as it's usually understood. You'll soon find out that how the Guadalcanal battle is going on on a whole is your last concern. War could here be understood only as a context in which men are much closer to death than usual, where they have to deal with killing or being killed. That's what it's about. The Thin Red Line is a men story, the story of men who have to shape their relations to each others, to the world around, and you won't stop being in awe and turned upside down if you tie your mind to the company. It's not as much linear as it is a composition ; the behaviour and personality of the different soldiers, the images, the voices off, all send back one to the other and eventually form a big scheme. Yes, that's a movie which is not all evident, but that one grows inside you every time you watch it.The Thin Red Line is one of these movies that can change one's life, reshape one's philosophy on life. It can be an unique experience if you give it a fair chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot and philosophical account of WW2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line was unfairly overshadowed by the IMO poor and clich ridden Saving Private Ryan (both made in 1998). It is beautifully shot and well-acted account of the conflict in the pacific island of Guadalcanal.The film starts with Private Witt (Caviezel) living with the natives of the island. We appreciate the simple and peaceful life that they lead. Caviezel is brilliant as the moral and peaceful private. He is constantly questioning why these people's lives should be disturbed.Also excellent is Penn as the cynical Sergeant who was only there because he was asked to be. Although I won't delve into each of the characters, all are three-dimensional and none fall into the war movie clich of fighting because they believe it is their patriotic duty.The film is deeply philosophical and while it never contradicts itself, it seems as if the same few points are only made but just by a different character and in a slightly different context.Although the film wasn't made just to contain battle scenes, the battle scenes in TRL manage not to convey the most of the soldiers as gung-ho killing machines. Instead the audience can see the fear conveyed by soldiers and how they don't want to kill the enemy. This is very realistic as according to a program recently, only 2% of the soldiers in WW2 actually shot to kill the enemy. Most of the soldiers just shot anywhere with no intention of killing anyone or even purposely forget to put ammo in their guns so they wouldn't be able to shoot anyone.One of the amazing things about TRL was that the audience felt sympathy for when the Japanese died. Even though the film didn't follow the Japanese, the scenes of aftermath with the injured Japanese, we understand that they are going through the same as the American soldiers and that they don't want to fight the war. The only problem with this film is that it is too much too long. It could have been cut to about 2 hours with no loss of coherence or plot.Final score ? 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when it was released in '98 and I was underwhelmed to say the least but, recently, for some reason I felt compelled to give it another try. I would admit that many of my favorite films have been ones which I disliked at first but eventually grew to love. Such classics as Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West are two such films. I would add The Thin Red Line as the third such film. The star power in this film is so much that you'd expect it to overwhelm the film itself much the way the stars of The Longest Day did with that film. You couldn't become engrossed in the picture because you kept waiting for the next movie star to show up. No, in The Thin Red Line the stars only accentuate the film and bring the story to the forefront. Strike that, the story is off little consequence. It's the mood and tone of the film that drives it. I only warn that those that don't like it the first wait a while and view it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is war?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is war in itself? The most important thing what a war movie needs to show. Without any politics and anything what can be important in another film. This movie satisfied this. We could see a lot of scenes of violence and combat in the former films, and this movie is so "visuable" as well. But the main part of the shown of this was when a soldier shot a japanese and started to recognize he killed a man, an won't be ever punished. This was a murder in spite of this is a war. The basic ethical dilemma in every war. The biggest scene of the film was Nick Nolte's when he shouted with Cpt.Staros, I think that was an Oscar-worthy small role. A carrierist soldier who creeped a lot for rank-progress, wants to occupy that hill that he must occupy, for what he paided a long time ago, through long years, now he must show. He obviously interest the life of his soldiers, but now it doesn't seem. The only one what seems, the booty, that he must get. "Just he wants the island" This movie shows the war very visuable, and philosophically. The film become a little bit slow this time but mistic natural pictures and strange thoughts compansate us. The locations and the japanese pacific theater of war especially suitable for philosophy. Peter Bakos</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of those greats which can absorb you entirely if you let it. As with many of my favourite films of all time I was not too impressed on first viewing. This was probably due to my expectations being different to the type of film it is. It has a fantastic ensemble of cast including Jim Caviezel on top form, the brilliant Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and a best to date outing for Ben Chaplin. Woody Harrelson, John Travolta and George Clooney make cameo appearances.The photography in this picture is amongst the most beautiful and artistic ever to be seen, the stark contrast between nature's beauty and the evil of war is thought provoking. The voice over, fantastic soundtrack and abstract scenes add to make this film an amazing experience. The scene when the marines storm the Japanese camp is a monumental one showing the true terror of war, this one scene is worth more than the whole of "Saving Private Ryan".Well that is my view, if you have not seen this film then make sure you do. If you've seen it once and were not too impressed, give it another go like I did, you may be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God, I love this movie. People can think what they want about it; I watch it again and again and find I am basing my own philosophy, my own view of the world on it. It's like Mecca; I keep going back to it, finding new forms of enlightenment and and new layers of wisdom. It also appears to be of the 'love it or leave it' variety, judging from the comments on the review page. I first saw it a couple of years ago, and now I have both the video and the soundtrack to the film, which I thought was unbelievably great and a masterpiece in it's right. But I do respect it if people find the film simply doesn't 'speak' to them. People respond to many different kinds of movies, and we all have movies that we claim as favorites and hold to our heart because there's some indefineable SOMETHING about the film that just touches the deepest chords of our soul every time we think about it or see it. What other people think about it doesn't really matter to us, when it comes to those kinds of films. I could endlessly praise this film, but it's late at night here so I'll just finish by saying that I think "The Thin Red Line" is the wisest cinematic examination of the human experience ever put to film. The dialogue, the voiceovers, the exposistion, the music, the photography-everthing is miles beyond in it's intent focus on the strange and wonderful behavior of the human race. I also find it to be the brainest, most intelligent film I have ever seen without a shred of prentention. That's what I think is Terrence Malick's greatest strength: an ability to express his ideas in a rather obtuse and arty way, without it SOUNDING arty and obtuse. It just sounds true. That's all I have to say for now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told to watch a WWII movie for my history class (I'm only 15 years old), and in my opinion, The Thin Red Line was a great choice. I admit that a few parts of it were beyond my comprehension, but it was still easy enough to understand. I was too young to see this movie when it came out, and technically I still am. But anyone can appreciate this, and if you don't you're either (1) a shallow person looking for entertainment instead of meaning, or (2) maybe you're just not looking at it properly.I was bored when I first saw this, but when I went back to watch it again, everything just clicked. It was easier to identify the voices of the narrators, and because of this, the whole movie was more clear. Including the nature shots was an absolutely brilliant idea; it offered a contrast between peace and chaos, Heaven and Hell, sanctuary and danger, and anything else you can imagine. This movie goes so far beyond the cliched good vs. evil - it goes into people's souls, it breaks the rules, it offers you an outlook on war that other directors are scared to touch.If you couldn't tell by what I've written, I give this movie a 9 out of 10. The only reason it isn't perfect is because it wasn't clear the first time, something that could drive people away. But for those of you who have only seen it once, I strongly encourage you to see it again. You have no idea what you're missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Movie in any Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many's the time when a movie, or any work of what I see as genius, has suffered the attempted deflation by people who use the most debased methods of argument.Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is one such movie. It's the story of Guadalcanal, an important and bloody battle fought in the eastern theatre of World War II. The main argument put forth by those rapier wits is that is supposedly features a number of ridiculously famous actors who have never failed to be taken seriously in a serious role: George Clooney, John Travolta among them. But most use this argument to blast the movie haven't seen it, in my experience. The fact is, those bloated personalities spend a very small fraction of time on the screen. Then rest is taken up, mostly, by actors of little notoriety but considerable talent. Also present are twi famous actors whose fame cannot defeat their ability to suspend our disbelief: Sean Penn and Nick Nolte.Aside from the selection of cast, the other cheap and narrow-minded shot people take at this movie is the overall tone and the philosophy expressed. While there are a few very long and seemlessly orchestrated battle scenes, the beating core of the movie is it's contention that the world is bound by an intrinsic cycle of conflict of harmony. Paralelling the bloodshed between man, there are shots of trees being strangled by parasitic vines and wounded birds struggling to take flight. But Malick's vision of Nature isn't bound by the suffering inherent in it. He sees the possibility for joy and harnony, expemplefied by the scenes of the idllyc goings-on of a tribe of aboriginese that a soldier, played by Jim Caviezel, lives among while going awol from his company. In fact, it is this soldier's monologues that periodically play over the film, in which he alternately revels at the genius inherent in life when expressed in harmony and peace, and and then puzzling at the brutal mindlessness of conflict.It' s clear to me that this is not a war for someone expecting a cathartic jingoistic realise. There is very little nationalism here. It presents an unresolved dichotomy between believing in the existence of a harmonious paradise or being resigned to a world of perpetual conflct where the only solution is to retreat from the world.And if you fail to find my arguments concerning the ideas expressed, than what's left is still a beautiful exercise in the portrayal of the inner lives of terrified men, and a beautiful visual aethetic (one of the implicit points of the movie is that, all the while this tumult and noise is going on, the jungle in all its dangerous beauty, goes relatively undisturbed).</fullReview>

Juxtaposing the surreal beauty of Guadalcanal with the brutish horror of World War Two was a brilliant move. I would have touched that venus flytrap too. Would have liked to see the fish that live in trees, though. Penn, Nolte, Caviezel, and Koteas are amazing.Adapted from the bestselling James Jones novel of the same name, the story follows American infantrymen fighting their way across the island of Guadalcanal in early 1942. Both sides experience the utter chaos of war, and stumble across the thin red line that divides sanity from madness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is a very complex movie.It demands an enormous degree of concentration and should be seen more than once in order to listen more intensely to the dialog and/or assimilate more profoundly the series of exquisite artistic images.The destructive nature of War forms the basis for a philosophical essay on the human condition and nature in general.The movie makes no concessions at all to those viewers who are looking for yet another action-packed story of heroic soldiers who are willing to die for king and country.It is a courageous attempt to look at life as it really is.An extract of the dialog which comes very close to summing up the general theme, is the following: " They want you dead or in their lie. There is only one thing a man can do: find something that is his: make his own island" The weak aspects of this movie are mainly the following: it is too long: the opening drags on and the ending is an unnecessary repetition of ideas which have been amply developed in previous scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been shocked and disappointed to read a stream of negative reviews of this film - obviously by a lot of ignorant and very narrow-minded film goers. Terrence Malick has crafted a film of exceptional poignancy and beauty. Indeed, it is an anti-war film, and this is just one of the reasons to celebrate it. It shows the madness, the raw humanity and the futility of war. This is the real deal, people. The cinematography, and rousing musical score by Hans Zimmer, dovetail exquisitely with some fine acting. Sean Penn, Jim Cavaziel and Elias Koteas are standouts. All those people whinging and opining emptily about the cameos of John Travolta and George Clooney are missing the point completely with this film. Really, what does it matter? This is a film that I found very moving. Poets and philosophers, in particular, may well appreciate the Zen-like opening and closing scenes. Quite simply, one of the best of all time. 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As happy as I was to see Malick's return to film direction, this film does not provide a complete view of the conflict at Guadalcanal. I think that the producers overbudgeted on star power, at the expense of some basic scenery that a World War II epic necessitates. (Thornton dubbed narration for the entire film, but it gets edited out. Big waste of money). The film is philosophical and introspective, fine. But it didn't just didn't look like the Pacific theatre of war.Where were the planes? WWII initiated the mass production of fighter aircraft, it was the first time airpower figured prominently in a large conflict, even Fat Man and Little Boy were dropped from U.S. bombers. In TTRL battle scenes, when aircraft are mentioned and supposed to make an appearance, all we get is a sound file of a plane passing overhead. A moment later, a SFX mine blows up in a field, which is supposed to simulate dropped ordinance. Not good.As for dialogue, scenery, photography, and characterizations, I have no problems. Some people complained that the soldiers in Red Line were too modern and intelligent for WWII soldiers, but that seems like a highly conceited and ageist viewpoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite it's title, The Thin Red Line should have been called The Thick Red Line because of the star studded cast it took, there wasn't a single no-name actor in the show, this film also happened to launch the career of Jim Caviezel (Catch from Angel Eyes) as a mainstream actor, the scenery was quite breathtaking as it was shot in the South Pacific and it gives us a realistic view of World War II and the events that took place, the battle scenes were quite good with the special FX, and it made it an entertaining movie to watch, I give it an 8 out of 10 and if you think it is "Three hours of sitting on the couch getting a sore ass", you are sorely mistaken</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I am 19 years old. When this movie came out in theatres I desperately wanted to see it, but was too young to get in. I just forgot about it after that. The loads of negative reviews didn't help much either. I just finished it about 4 minutes ago, and I am in awe. What a beautiful movie. The images, the sound, the acting, the everything. I love this directors style. It is something you don't see very often. Some of you may say, "thank God" but I really don't see what is so bad about it. I think that today's viewers get bored if there isn't an explosion or an F word every six seconds. The three hours flew by for me. I really hope that more people see this movie. It is a real shame that it has gone pretty much overlooked.This one is definately worth renting, and even worth buying. I'm going to ebay now to find it. I'll bet the director commentary (if there is any) is amazing. Hope you all find this review helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last ? the Truth about WWII. It was won by disorganized groups of neurotic existentialists, with late-90s haircuts, speech-patterns and concerns, who never got the plot because John Travolta didn't get enough time off from finishing Primary Colors to explain it to his men. Airplanes were used only for ceremonial purposes, before and after battles led by psychologically damaged commanders with no strategic direction. In fact, film is not really an appropriate medium to depict the geopolitical forces at work in the conflict with Fascism. We can best understand it as Off-Broadway studio theatre, with the individual anxieties of the small cast a subtle composite projection of the director's state of mind. Unfortunately, the director had to work with film, but he managed to maintain the intimate studio feel by concentrating on close-ups and monologue, and eliminating any wider narrative frame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, sorry to disappoint the reviewers on this site but i neither hated or loved this film. I'll start with the good points. I thought the main characters were extremely well cast. I believed right away that these men were in an extraordinary situation and were trying to deal with it as best as they could. The dialogue although sometimes slightly drawn out was poignant and moving. Some of the cinematics reminded me of Apocalypse now but were unique all to themselves. The beautiful landscapes marred by the incessant barrage of munitions provided a stark contrast to the placid life of the natives disrupted by the harrowing nature of war.Unfortunately i am unable to say i loved the film. I felt quite early on that the film suffered because of its self appreciation. A beautiful panning shot of water lapping against reeds on a shore would have had the desired effect had it been just 20 seconds long, not a full four minutes. This use of contrived cinematics marred the final effect just because it was used too much. I also felt the Cameos by John Travolta and George Clooney were stunts just to get the punters in the cinema. After all, they were credited in all the trailers but had only a few minutes of screen time between them. I am a fan of war movies because they normally portray the harrowing nature of the deepest emotions a human can endure. TTRL could have explored this point more fully but ultimately lacked the emotional response attributed to such conflicts.Some beautiful cinematics but drawn out a little too much. Some great dialogue and casting (Woody was spectacular) but ultimately a mediocre approach to what could have been cinematic history.6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- The Thin Red Line: 7/10This movie was an amazing effort by director Terrence Malick. It was his first production in 20 years, and many big name actors wanted to work with him. In how many movies do you see Clooney and Travolta play minor, brief roles? It's based on conflict at Guadalcanal during the second World War, and depicts the horror of war quite well (but not as well as Saving Private Ryan, which itself probably couldn't reflect just how horrible it must have been to fight in the second World War). This has a huge cast of faces you'll recognize, and is almost an all-star movie. My problem with it was the length (2 hours, 50 minutes), which made the movie drag for a looooooong time early on. If I had connected to the (IMO often dry) voiceover dialogue I might have enjoyed the early stages, but I'm a little ashamed to admit that I was waiting for the action. When the pace quickened, the movie became excellent, with some amazing, intense fight scenes. The movie also finishes off quite expertly. Supposedly hours and hours were cut out of this, but I still think the movie could have benefited from at least 50 minutes being chopped out of the final version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetically Introvert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult for a film on war to entirely disengage from war's psychological dimension, and in fact few films do. Occasionally, however, a motion picture comes along that focuses solely on the psychological aspects of warfare. As one such film, 'The Thin Red Line' is an untypical deliberation on the mental internalization of war as experienced by a group of US soldiers engaged in the bloody battle of Guadalcanal, in 1942. The film is long and distinctly introvert, containing extensive narratives of the participants' thoughts. The comparative lack of combat scenes will inevitably alienate action-seeking viewers, but this is deliberate. Indeed, the film's few battle scenes are vivid, realistic and spectacularly filmed, a clear message from director/screenwriter Terrence Malick that he could have produced an action film, had he desired to do so. Instead, he chooses to concentrate on the long periods of inactivity between clashes, focusing his camera lens on the faces of war's disillusioned participants. This allows for several polished performances by all actors involved, above all by Ben Chaplin, Elias Koteas and Woody Harrelson, who surpasses himself during his character's final moments. John Toll's inspiring cinematography and Hans Zimmer's expressive score almost manage to mute the film's shortcomings, which include the manifest lack of continuity in the script -the latter being further impaired by a surprising failure to conclude and pull together the many threads unraveled throughout the film. Overall a refined production with several outstanding attributes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read alot of bad comments about this movie, and many before I first saw it 3 years ago. I hesitated to see it because I had heard SO much negativity about it. Naked Natives, Pretentious poetry, etc...I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I like all kinds of movies, I am a true fan. I like action, comedy, sci-fi, suspense, but this movie also holds distinction for me. The pace is slow, yes, but if you have an attention span of longer than 5 minutes, and you have lived a little bit of life, you might enjoy this one. It is very surrealistic, but it is often the vehicle of surrealism that allows us too see our own reality more clearly. Unlike the 1964 original, the arcs are not clearly defined, and the conclusions aren't tightly resolved. It is a different kind of film. A trip if you will. If you are relaxing at home on a Sunday, this movie is a good choice.AC</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somebody once said that war is not about guns and explosions, but about people.Strictly speaking, war is about guns, explosions and people. But the basic premise of the aforementioned quote is sound.The Thin Red Line focuses more on the people, but not at the expense of the guns and explosions. As such, you get a wider picture of the conflict in which the movie is set, rather than myopically centered on the microcosm of battle. How's that for big words? I'm impressed, and you should be too.In this movie, the audience is given the opportunity to relate to most characters before they are shot or blown to bits. I suppose this helps to convey the tragic waste of wars and something else profound.To summarise: if you like war movies but don't like this movie, there is something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A couple of bright spots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thin Red Line fronts itself with a set of established names in the acting business. This puts people in the seats, and that's all nice and good. The irony is that a small name, Jim Caviezel, grabs the emotion and becomes the core of the movie.The movie is a bit misguided. A lot of scenes are slopped together, and although it reflects war it's not good cinema. What makes a movie good is the ability to sweep up the audience and control their feelings. Once the audience is confused it's very hard to get this to happen. I think that, in literary form, you can catch the view of many easily. In a movie, it becomes jumbled and too much for viewers. The battles in the movie were good, but the plot seemed to try too hard to pluck our sensitive cords.Caviezel carries this movie. As Witt, he shows us a man who only wants beauty and peace in his life. Unfortunately, a war becomes the only way to attain this. I feel for him every time he escapes to his Utopian dream, and allow myself to be swept up in that dream with him. If you do this you can understand how terrible this war was for Witt.Witt's last scene in the movie is so beautiful I couldn't speak for a long time. Watch as Caviezel's face turns and gathers what he's been dealt, the realization. It's there. And then, just through watching his eyes, you know what will happen. I actually thought it would've been perfect if they cut it there and had him swimming or something, with that captivating soundtrack going in the background. Unfortunately, they added a little more, and I don't think they should've.The bottom line is, watch the movie through Witt. You will find a message, not to mention one of the greatest scenes in movie history. And keep that soundtrack in your mind while watching. It plays so sweetly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to releasing this Malick was well on the way to becoming regarded by many as the greatest director ever. As the years of silence continued his previous films - a routine early 70's road movie with guns and the one about farming that is useful as both a hypnotic and purgative - rose ever higher in the minds of those who see only artistic integrity in not finishing anything. It had to end of course and this film brings the hype down to ground with a resounding thud. What we have is a very average war film. Its not much fun to watch though as it has a HIGHER PURPOSE. This film aims to tell you that war is bad - cue much wordy philosophising. Add in beatiful cinematography ( I suspect Malicks real strength might lie in travel programs ) and a collection of ridiculous celebrities appearing to show us that at heart they are really ARTISTES whose usual output is some kind of necessary slumming. This film represents the worst kind of middlebrow trash - too posh to simply entertain and to stupid to make anybody think. I suggest you watch almost any 50's b-movie , Cross Of Iron ( Hollywood's greatest war-is hell movie ), Saving Private Ryan ( manipulative but more involving and more intelligent) or Apocalypse Now ( a film that dares to confuse, bore and amaze - a work of real artistic risk).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A uneven but great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been intrigued by the reviews thus far. This seems to be a movie that falls into that love/hate category. No one is on the fence - either they hate it or love it.Personally, I love the movie. I remember watching it in the theater and thinking, when is George Clooney coming? This was after 2+ hours, and I looked forward to another 2 hours - thinking that Clooney had a significant part. Obviously, the joke was on me.I loved every minute of this movie, and I wished it went on for another 2 hours. I've heard the original cut was 9 hours (!) and I would gladly pay money to see that. Hans Zimmer's score absolutely made this movie - it would be an entirely different movie without him.The Thin Red Line is not your typical war movie. The studio made a mistake in the way it was marketed, trying to make it more of an action movie than it is. While there are some great action scenes, it is not the same experience as Saving Private Ryan. This is a relatively bloodless and gore-free movie compared to Spielberg's drama. However, on its own terms, this is a superior movie. It deals with feelings, thoughts, and philosophy. In terms of battlefield experiences, you won't see anything that surpasses the opening D-Day scenes of Saving Private Ryan. However, for a different, more philosophical treatment of war, The Thin Red Line runs circles around Saving Private Ryan.For instance, the attack on the Japanese outpost, where the only sounds are the score from Hans Zimmer, is one of the most powerful and moving scenes in any war movie, period.If you are looking for a traditional war movie, I would heed the comments of other reviewers and avoid this movie. However, if you are in the mood for something different and challenging, you will not be disappointed by this masterpiece of a movie.Tim Irwin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS IN REVIEW***Hauntingly beautiful in every regard, Terrence Malick's third film to date, 'The Thin Red Line' is cinematic bliss. A study of life, death and war in nature, the film traces American soldiers fighting in the South Pacific ? the Guatemala Canal ? and their fight for survival. Told from several perspectives, the film relies occasionally on voiceovers, something that can sound the death knell for films when used in a lazy fashion. These voiceovers, especially that of Jim Caviezel's character Private Witt, actually assist the viewer, lending us a heightened sense of compassion for these men, most of whom see the futility and waste of war. Different from Spielberg's war opus, 'Saving Private Ryan' ? the films are often unfairly compared due to their sharing the same year of release ? Malick's film does not rely so heavily on the lauded action set pieces that made Spielberg's film seemingly everybody's new favourite ?war' film. Sure, there's action in 'The Thin Red Line', but in between the shoot ?em ups, we aren't bored by the philosophical ponderings of the characters, unlike the generally trite reflections contained in 'Saving Private Ryan'. (I should probably point out at this point, for fear of being labelled merely as a ?Spielberg hater' that I actually like most of Spielberg's films?)Some scenes are fuelled by the conflict between the warring nations, others drift along solely on the genuine emotion on show. The scene in which Witt (Caviezel) is surrounded by Japanese soldiers is among the most emotionally affecting I can think of; it never fails to bring tears to my eyes. Such emotional expressions in the film are not rare, with the voice-over ruminations, flash backs to happier days for Ben Chaplin's character and the soulful music adding considerable emotional weight. With generally flawless direction from Malick, beautiful music by Hans Zimmer, gorgeous, lush photography by John Toll (even the gory battle scenes are beautifully done) and some performances that could be described as superb (a few gluttonous Hollywood mistakes are thrown in, but are forgettable, so the film doesn't suffer too badly), 'The Thin Red Line' is my pick for the best ?war' film ever (if ever pigeon holing a film into a genre was stupid, this would be it), and one of the most poignantly stunning films I've had the pleasure of seeing. Forget the comparisons with Spielberg's film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not exactly wonderful but just about bearable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This didn't exactly enthrall me. I was frequently bored, waiting for something remotely interesting to happen.There was nowhere near enough action in this film, rather disappointing effects really. There were a few fantastic moments, but these were few and far between. The initial battle sequence is often lumpy and doesn't flow very well in places. The sequence is often unclear and it took what seemed forever before we actually saw a Japanese soldier. This may be because they're meant to be hidden, but unfortunately seems as if the budget didn't allow extras. When the enemy did come into play, the interraction wasn't exactly as tense as would be expected from a warfilm, indeed at times it felt like a social get together rather than a war.The subplot of one soldiers 'girl back home' was a touching one, and very often true. This was refreshment from the already scant action, and although the romance story doesn't ruin the film, the flashbacks were too long and too many. Also, they maneged a sex scene which in my books should be banned from warfilms forever.Don't get me wrong, this film isn't bad. It's really not. The cast (apart from perhaps Nick Nolte) are good, in some cases excellent (Dash Mihok comes to mind, though his part was too small) and there are a few gems to be found here.But don't expect this to be a film that leaves your head reeling and that will leave you thinking for days afterwards. This is no Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers.It is watchable (just) and only occasionly excruciatingly boring. But it's not wonderful by any means and instantly forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with many of the truly magnificent movies in history, this movie is bound to be misunderstood over and over again. So it doesn't surprise me that so many people have panned this movie so vehemently. It seems almost every amazing film I see, I find droves and droves of people who swear it's the worst thing they've ever seen. But all I can say is that some films are meant for some people, and not for others.This movie is about war, but it's more about Life, about the beauty of it, the questions it poses to all of us, the people we surround ourselves with during it, and the way we may face it's end. This movie is saturated with life, so richly that I find myself abuzz, awash in its wake. Amazing cinemetography, an inventive and unique screenplay, a tremendously well crafted score, and this poetic beautiful writing (yes in the voiceovers). Pure genius. James Caviezel gives the performance of his career, or of any actor's career. There are times that he captures this look, almost like he's staring into the eyes of God, like Wes Bentley at the end of American Beauty. And that's the movie I was thinking of while I was watching it. Two masterpieces illustrating the same truth in the most remarkably different ways. And the movie is long yes, but its so meticulously laid out. It is so perfectly gradual, like a sunrise, unfolding itself to you color by color.I am so unmeasurably glad that this movie was made. Mankind strikes again with our brilliant creativity. I am truly sorry for anyone that cannot understand it.</fullReview>

The music, amazingly enough by Hanz Zimmer, is breathtaking, and I don't mean in the Jerry and Elaine way, it really is. So, what's Malick doing here? He's using the two most important things in creating atmosphere and using them to draw us in to the movie.But then why were there so many aggressive attacks on this film? Well, for one thing audiences weren't willing to open themselves up to the movie. From the first shot of the gator writhing in the mud people wanted to dislike the movie. Those who were anxious for Malick to fall on his face after a 20 year hiatus would do anything they could to help him stumble.And what's more pathetic than an artist trying to communicate genuine emotion, but being unable to articulate it in words?So, this film, with Malick's much-hated voice-overs, is simultaneously hated and loved with a passion. It's always bewildered me how someone could attack an artist, most of whom are sensitive to begin with, and call their work terrible without a second thought.This movie is from the 'Apocalypse Now' school of war movies. That movie was a giant-sized, drunken masterpiece to this writer. I loved how the movie progressed with insanity the longer you were in it making it harder and harder to resist (sort of like a Physics class -- if you're not getting after a week, you're left in the dust). This movie is somewhat hallucinogenic like Coppola's film, but more poetic. And I don't mean it's poetic in that it reveals great truths or is crammed with profundities. It doesn't and it isn't.What it does have is a feel. From my perspective the camera was literally that of a soldier (or soldiers). Throughout, the camera moves along a sight-line, has a few double-takes and watches with awe. We feel as if we are only catching glimpses of a war from the point-of-view of the soldier. The film was criticised for dropping actors before they were on long enough to be fully made, but so what? Who says we have to fully understand a character? Do you understand everyone you've ever met? No, and neither does the soldier (the viewer); he sees as much as he sees and then moves along.In his list of the top ten films of the 1990s, Martin Scorsese said how this was like and endless film, like an endless war. He's right. We feel afterwards as if we came in the middle of a conversation. Now, this could be deliberate, or it could be due to the fact that the film was supposedly edited down from six hours.Either way the film is one of the best of the 90s, with some wonderful moments of watching Sean Penn, Nick Nolte (who chews the scenery, but is only getting better), and Jim Caviezel, who has a perfect thin-lipped, blue-eyed, big-eared vagueness to him.4 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It lacks something, but I can't put my finger on it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had already gone to see Saving Private Ryan, then I saw TTRL. Perhaps if I had seen them in the reverse order, I might have liked TTRL, but to this day, I just can't get into it. It is one of the few movies I have seen at the theater where I felt truly compelled to walk out before it ended, and let me tell you, I can sit through some pretty long and drab movies. Some of my favorite movies are double VHS tape ones like Braveheart, SPR, The Godfather, 2001, and so on. I disliked the constant stream of narrated, narcoleptic philosophical thought that ran throughout the movie. The narrator's voice was like a few Benadryl, guaranteed to put me out. For war films, there are many better choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Philosophy Question:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that after Forrest Gump every simpleton southerner who goes around asking stupid questions with his thick accent is the next Aristotle? May some scholar strike me down if I'm wrong, but I don't recall reading very much of Hobbes, Plato, hell, even Marx, where they open up with a question like "What is war?" Does Hollywood think it's audience isn't quite sharp enough to catch on to philosophy that runs deeper than that? I don't think this film's philosophy would have bothered me so much except that it seems like every film when it tries to get sophisticated gets simplistic and asks the question "What is . . . " ? Find a new opening, new metaphors--find some originality for God's sake. To find peace of mind and understanding of the world, you have to have that right annoying, regional ring in your voice and the IQ of a retard--that worked for Forrest, and the story was cute reasonably original, and touching. But for once I'd like to see a normal talking, maybe slightly above average--street smart--guy have a pretty firm grasp and peace within himself. With that said, let's just say some characters irritated me and I shed no tears for them when the end of the film came. This is the movie that would not end for me. Instead of going into overkill on the action, the bloody, the horrors of war--Thin Red Line tries to take a more subtle approach. Fair enough. I enjoyed Patton and that had nothing in terms of action compared to say, Black Hawk Down. So less emphasis on the gunfights, more emphasis on the soldier's emotions, mentality, feelings, etc. Still, fair game--once again Patton is more about the man, not he war he fought in, but with the 1970 film Patton I actually liked and bought into and sympathized with the man being portrayed. In the case of Thin Red Line, I can't really say I care to remember any of the characters in the film. None of them spoke to me. None of them convinced me they were more than cliche cutouts, trying with everything in them to become a fully fleshed out character. In the end I wound up watching a bunch of people I have no interest in watching on film thinking, remember the good 'ol times, and frankly, I'd rather not. With subpar narration, multiple voice overs by what seems like someone different each time. Then when the 'climactic' battle takes place, I was in awe at how well the images and the music (provided by Hans Zimmer) came together as all sound effects were silenced, and the music/images spoke for themselves. I was ready to turn the movie off with the satisfaction of at least getting a killer ending. Guess what? That was the midpoint . ..By far the high point of the film is Zimmer's incredibly subtle, yet extremely powerful score. This score contains what I feel is the most powerful track of any war film. Other than one spectacular sequence about midway through the film, I couldn't help but constantly ask myself "When did I start this film? How much longer do I have?" Especially after they journey to the line . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tiresome disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie. I read the book in junior high and I was quite surprised when I found out they were making a film. I figured it would just be a knockoff of "Saving Private Ryan". I wish it had been.All this movie is a one disconnected scene after another. The movie alights on one unimportant character after another without laying down much if any story line. The almost constant mental voiceovers, far from helping you understand what's going on (a la "Blade Runner") only annoys the viewer. First, you don't know who's voice you're hearing. Second, it's a bunch of drug-induced, cryptic, fragmented deep-thoughts that you struggle to make fit in with what's on the screen.Big stars come and go. The guy who's the main character (you tell yourself) gets killed. You see all these scenes of various "Man-on-the-Canal" scenes. Then it ends. If it weren't for the battle scenes, this would be a total loss. As it is, I wouldn't watch it again if the remote were broken and I were down with malaria.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's philosophy, not realism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm astounded by the percentage of writers here who insist on calling this a war film and judging it using that term. The Thin Red Line is not a war movie. It is a meditation on life. War is merely the vehicle for examining life. Because of its ability to slice away the mundane (nobody worries about his next car payment when there are shells falling around him), it's a perfect vehicle for examining what should be most important in humankind: ourselves and our relationship to the cosmos. This is what Malick is chasing, not a realistic depiction of war. A critic on this board said, `If you want to find out about Guadalcanal, read about the history of the United States Marine Corp.' I suspect that Malick would agree. The location of the conflict in the film is completely irrelevant except as it shows the diversity and profligacy of life. It could take place in Washington or Ecuador just as easily. The only mistake bigger than thinking this film is about war is thinking that the director has any interest at all in the Battle of Guadalcanal. He doesn't, and if one wishes to learn about Guadalcanal he should read history or rent a documentary. But Malick is not making a documentary here, he's trying to make art. This is where many of the complaints about the movie fall down:`This film treats both sides as moral equals' - Yes, because in the endeavor of war as in all endeavors, we ARE moral equals. This may offend some, but the average Japanese soldier fought for his country and his honor, just as the average American soldier did. He had no influence and probably little interest in the politics of his nation. He was fed what was important for him to know - just as American, British, and German soldiers were - and what he really wanted was to be home just as those other soldiers did. We all intrinsically value the same things despite our national differences. This is the meaning of the dead Japanese soldier's speech when he asks, `Are you righteous? Kind?' We all wish to be righteous, kind people - or at least seem as such. This is also what Witt means when he says: `Maybe all men got one big soul everybody's a part of, all faces are the same man.'`Movies like this do not accurately depict the social, emotional, anthropological, physical or spiritual act of war as war was waged at that set certain period of time.' - Exactly, because the director has no interest in that. He has no more interest in showing the 1942 state of mind than Frost had in showing the 1914 state of mind in a poem like `Mending Wall'. Malick is reaching for something more eternal and elusive just as Frost was. Malick is merely using a conflict from the 1940s as a lens through which to view something larger.`The explosions in this movie look very fake and it glorifies a combat-dodger (James Cavaziel).' Fake explosions? This is a factual error in that Witt is not a `combat-dodger.' He ASKS back into his unit. If Malick is glorifying anything through Witt, it is a glorification of the man who is living a spiritual existence in the most visceral of human activities. Witt has a dream, and it's a dream that encompasses everything. Malick expresses, through Witt's vision, the truth behind the surface: everything is one, eternal, and magnificent. (In the movie we are given a shot of a great bird circling - one of those nature-shot distractions that are so maligned by some reviewers - with Witt's voiceover `Oh my soul, let me be in you now ... look out at the things you've made. All things shining.' Compare this to William Blake's `When thou seest an Eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius; lift up thy head!' This is where Malick is coming from, and it's the reason why `you have tough U.S soilders spewwing poetry as good as Lord Byron.' Because they too are a portion of Genius. We all are.)Is Malick's goal in examining these philosophical questions pretentious? Perhaps. But if one takes this stance he must be prepared to dismiss nearly every great religious and philosophical thinker in history. They have argued that these are the ONLY questions worth considering. Or perhaps these critics imply that artists don't have the right to approach these issues - that they are purely the domain of Buddha and Aristotle - and that artists who do (whether poets, painters, or film directors) are nothing but self-indulgent egotists. Maybe. This is subjective.As to whether one should rent it or not, these quotes are fine summations of taste. Know what you want before you invest in this because it IS long and the pace is leisurely and thoughtful: `I was hoping for some juicy war stuff to take place' - Little of that in this movie. `what is the bottom line of the movie' - The one scene that is consistently credited by those who hate TRL is Cusack's charge. Not surprisingly this is one of the few times in the film where the action is linear and goal oriented - where there is `a bottom line.' The viewer is offered a simple prescription: `We're going for the hill. Cheer for the Good Guys.' This scene is the most Private Ryan-like in the entire film precisely because of its simplicity. The viewer is not asked to consider but only to feel, and there is a very definite payoff. If you need a clean start and endpoint, do not see this film. You will probably be terribly bored. `The director just tried too hard to make it look poetic and beautiful' (generally tied to the assertion that the plot is indecipherable or non-existent) - Looking for a story in this film is like looking for a story in a Keats poem. Understand: you will not find a great deal of story. You will find beauty. If you must have a clean narrative, by all means avoid this film. You'll find it bad.9 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amazed by how many users have written a review to this film.I think it's a great film. it might take you more than one viewing to come to the same conclusion. It did for me. I went to see it first in the theatre, and was perhaps all keyed-up after seeing Saving Private Ryan. As a result, for some reason, I felt a bit disappointed. I even disliked the film. When it went to cable on a regular-basis for a while, I saw it again and couldn't remember why I disliked it the first time. With time, I saw it a couple more times and realized how good the film really was. On the otherhand, my personality, experiences and interests no doubt effect my opinion, just like anyone else's. Or for that matter, your's. Who you are will have the greatest bearing on the quality of this film, or on any other film made.It's a great film if you give it a chance, and if it still doesn't work for you, then nothing I or anyone else who enjoyed this film will make a change. Those who didn't like the film, they have a right to their opinion. But you might want to give this film the benefit of the doubt. You might be disappointed, or you might be surprised. It's up to you, not to us.Bottom-line: Watch it. Even if you think it sucks, at least you found out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrast to Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I was still caught up in the wake of Saving Private Ryan, which I think is very gut wrenching and queasy- which is war and it was great. But it didn't seem to capture the individual character. Private Ryan was a war film construct for the mass population -directed by the most popular director ever. In other words- it's how everyone pictured the patriotism during WW2- only showing people the gritty reality that they may not have been able to imagine. The Thin Red Line tells a different story. It digs deep into the mind of the adult man trying to come to grips with the tragedy of War. The movie uses very little humor to express how confusing it feels to kill, watch your friends get killed, live in constant fear, etc. It seems these men are trying to explain to themselves how this war will change their lives. The characters in Private Ryan seemed to have magically adjusted to being in War... and they are MOSTLY "cool" with it.A note on cinematography- Private Ryan may have been in color (unlike Schindler's list) but it still remained limited by shutter speeds and de-saturations that gave the image a time period LIKE other IMAGES from that time. This separates the audience from reality- especially when the effect has worn off after it's been re-used in other films (Every Spielberg and Ridley Scott film since as well as others). The Thin Red Line was rich in color, like the Guatal Canal has been for thousands of years. These soldiers didn't see a tight camera scope with every other frame skipped to give gritty strobe like effects when they were fighting. They saw reality- the same thing we see everyday when we're not glued to some kind of screen. This film captured that as closely as possible- but still achieved a specific softness in light that became its own look.Conclusively- I want to say that Private Ryan is a film that was told by many Grandpa's who were proud to serve their country. The Thin Red Line is the reason why Grandpa never wants to talk about it.</fullReview>

So many talented actors and such great chemistry between all of them. I think this is better than Ryan and Ryan has 8.4 average!! They are two very different movies (surprising as that may seem) but in both there's a message to be learnt. I think most people failed to see it...If you have the chance, watch it in DVD.

		<fullReview>The first time I saw TRL I'm ashamed to say I actually dozed off a few times. Five viewings later and I'm afraid I'm still missing something in this profoundly beautiful film. TRL is so much more than a war movie, it speaks some fundamental truths about human frailty, the insignificance of human concerns in the vast scheme, the complex mix of ugliness and beauty inextricably interwoven into everything. After choking down so many 'Pearl Harbors' this was just what I needed. Some of the critizisms are a little scary; 'long and boring', 'inauthentic--not enough blood', 'pretentious'. Sounds as if they're disappointed they didn't get more of the same.</fullReview>

I can describe this movie in one word; stupid. "The Thin Red Line" had no plot, and not enough conflict to be considered a war movie. Sure there was fighting and people dying, but it had no conflicts with the characters. There was no real story. The constant inter-monologue, did not help. It only confused the audience. I can't believe that this movie was nominated for an Oscar. This director didn't know what he was doing. "Alpengeist", you have no idea what a realistic movie is. "Enemy At The Gates" was VERY realistic. It was based on a true story, and everything was true. If you cannot handle movies not being realistic, then you shouldn't be watching movies and voicing your opinion on IMDb.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every movie fights its own war - And this lost due to being unfavourably compared with `Saving Private Ryan'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Thin Red Line' has gone down as being `that other war movie' that came out at the same time as `Saving Private Ryan'. Accused of stealing from the latter, `The Thin Red Line' got over looked, and unfairly at that as the two should not be compared.`The Thin Red Line' is about the Americans and their role in the conflict of Guadalcanal during World War II. It focuses on a group of soldiers and a couple of key battles they took part in. It does not focus on any particular soldier instead choosing to float between certain key people, allowing us to share in their thoughts and feelings. Whereas `Saving Private Ryan' struck a primeval chord in viewers with it's raw, unflinching visceral look at war, `The Thin Red Line' decides to take a more poetic, human approach. Thus the characters can share themselves using narrative devices such as voiceover or memory sequences. These often act as linchpins for the character - the memory of a lover, a thought on childhood, a musing on nature and life's beauty. Some characters thus have undercurrents of fear mixed with bravery, others - such as Nick Nolte's character - the sadness of time gone by. To this end most of the acting is well up to scratch. As is his forte James Cavaziel plays brooding intensity to a tee which, when combined with his flashback sequences, creates one of the most memorable characters of the movie. Nick Nolte is on fine form as the tired old veteran, desperate for one last grasp of glory. John Cusack shows a range beyond mild comedies as the caring but determined Captain and Elias Koteas has the virtuous flaw of caring too much. The characters interact quite well and the changing viewpoint gives us a more personal feel to them all.It's the direction on this piece that makes it however. A certain accusation can be given that the movie - without a central lead or plot hinge - is a bit too abstract, a bit too free floating. There's a certain truth to this but the direction embellishes the movie, makes this possible detractor almost a distinguishing quality. We're seeing a meditation that's not just on war, but on the human condition with all its glories and foibles. There's a fair amount of juxtaposition - a cut from the brutality of a battle into the stillness of nature via swooping a camera down into grass, or cutting to a shot of wildlife. The cinematography employed is gorgeous with a real harmonic beauty to it. You could look at this movie and just sheer grin at the prettiness you see. This does, at times, have the effect of detracting from the horror of war - the sense of brutality can be lost in the lingering landscapes.`The Thin Red Line' shares nothing but a war with `Saving Private Ryan'. The brutal edge that drives home into the viewer is lacking, but this is the far more beautiful of the two, imbued with a sense of lyricism that cinema often lacks nowadays. At times the meandering ambivalence of the movie can undermine it - there's no real central plot - and the lack of a lead character can undercut its strength. Despite that the poeticism is ultimately rewarding and the haunting imagery, and narrations of the soldiers and their journey would sit in your head far more than the flag-waving gore-laden exercises that war movies have become. 8/10.</fullReview>

It was a movie with no flaws, great acting, directing, and some of the best shots ever in any movie. I loved the battle scenes. I thought they were so realistic, and very emotional. The philosophy in the movie is what sets it apart from the other WW2 flicks, and Saving Private Ryan's shallow storyline. SPR is not better than TTRL. Not even close, I slept on this movie and It's a big mistake if you havent seen it, and still choose not too, just because it recieved such little recognition. This is a classic in my mind, and will be a fine addition to my DVD collection.

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick directs this beautiful poetic masterpiece about the dark terrifying experiences that is war, and the brotherhood of men that help keep themselves alive through nightmarish ordeals that they are forced to go through. When men talk to us about there experiences on the battlefield and how day after day there main goal in life was to just do there best at what every human being is trained for, and that is to keep living. We try to understand how it felt, how it was like to wake up in the dirt that you slept in the night before, the sentimental bonding you shared with someone for only a brief moment and then the reality of losing them to enemy fire. A lot of people paid their duties to there country, and death was the price. The truth is, we can never fully understand or even make an attempt to close our eyes and vision what some of our grandparents went through, or what others had to live up to.The Thin Red Line is a film that is focused strictly on the idea to get that message through to us. It follows a number of poetic soldiers as they venture of into the battlefield scared, confused and unaware of the dangers that lie ahead of them. The soldiers are led by one captain, who's love and respect for his men guide him through the thoughts of losing them under the dangers that war is.The film is filled with a large popular cast that has undying talent and it is this talent that is projected a lot during the film. The acting and memorable story telling will capture a lot of the thoughts that will leave you helpless and stunned as soon as the end credits appear.Every film that displays enough emotion and beauty as this film does has a message that can be interpreted in so many ways, that a gathering of friends will surely be able to devote many conversations regarding its tale of courage, friendship, and most of all the privilege of being able to breathe and wake up every morning, no matter how hard life may be.The message I get is one that I hope everyone will one day be able to except because it is one that requires us to except how we live and most of all, realizing that you should live everyday to its full potential. The beauty of life can be seen through a painting, the way you look into someone's eyes or even during a difficult time such as war. Some how with the graphic horrors that is war, and the suffering that every man is forced to deal with, this film successfully tells us that in any nightmare one can succeed in finding peace with them selves. It is a film that reaches the brightest and darkest aspects of the human soul and should be noticed as being one of the most expressive poetic storytelling masterpieces of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good to see how the soldiers feel during difficult battles with an enemy ready to do anything to possible to get a final win. The merit of the film is that it shows different personalities during the battle, an officer very busy with his subordinates, another higher one thirsty of win, other soldiers in a near panic, others showing their solidarity to support the action. In general, the message of the film is good and although dealing with war, it is a real antiwar film.

		<fullReview>A star-studded cast makes this movie very great. It follows the autobiographical novel of the true events at the Guadalcanal. I enjoyed everyone's performance and they were all really good. This movie still doesn't beat Saving Private Ryan but it still ranks very high in my war movie collection. I haven't yet read the novel but I plan on going to get it as soon as possible. I heard it's really good.Overall the entire movie is excellent with great performances.

		<fullReview>This is, in fact, a very beautiful movie with flaws. The multiple narrators work to give you a sense of the great multitudes of men who engaged in the war, but they're confusing and tend to diffuse the narrative speed. On the other hand, Malick is not concerned about narrative, and certainly not about speed. He is a lyric poet, and what he wants the audience to think about is the meaning of war.The story begins in nature. The first image is of a crocodile slipping silently into a swamp. This is the theme, the duality of nature. It is so beautiful -- even this old croc -- but it is also deadly. Men and women are beautiful, in the idyllic world of the opening scenes -- but the soldier is AWOL, and they come find him to put him in battle.From that point on, the story is a series of meditations on man, war and fate. The images are gorgeous. The words, and the characterizations, are profoundly involving. The narration often suffers. Who's talking here? What exactly is he talking about? Who's that dying? Is he the same guy we saw on the boat? And so on. There are times when you think that the narrative is being deliberately left in the background, because the audience is another victim of "the fog of war."I just watched the DVD this weekend, after seeing the movie in the theaters. On second viewing, I gathered a horde of new meanings from this beautiful movie. I think it would also surrender new layers of meaning every time you watched it. Perhaps that's why I think it's a better DVD movie than it was in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courageous and Groundbreaking War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is not your traditional war film. By Malick's choice of a more non-linear or anti-plot narrative, he has made a film less accessible to many audiences who often prefer the more traditional antagonist/protagonist multi-act story. This is especially true of a war genre picture where old clichs and story arcs are expected.It is unfortunate that this film was released the same year as Saving Private Ryan as it led to many comparisons which are really unfair to both films...They are much different in their structure, intention and scope. For me Ryan could not hold the excitement and virtuosity of its first 30 minutes, making any climax unfulfilling. This is not to say the rest of the film is bad, it just could never live up to the high one feels at the start of the film. To me, the Thin Red Line a much more fulfilling and groundbreaking film, not because it is without flaws because there are many, but because it tries to wrestle with a much broader scope of themes then simply the human perspective from the winning side of a war. Malick instead chooses to not only explore the human reality of war but also the very nature of war. In this context his choices become much clearer. The characters are not archetypes but instead individual layers of the human exploration of the same question; they are almost one voice in a way. Their motivations are not as important as their natural responses and coping mechanisms to the absurd situations surrounding them. The events and stages of the battles do not build to a climax because there is no climax. Both the weak and the strong die, there are no moral winners and Nature continues.All this can be unsettling if you come to the theatre expecting a traditional war film but I challenge you to look at this film from a different perspective. It is pretentious at times, for example, I believe the scenes of Travolta and Clooney are in the film to poke fun at the war genre itself. They are very clich and I think the idea is to show how strange those clichs actually feel against a horrific and realistic war backdrop.But if you give the film a chance there are very poignant moments where the sound, dialogue, music and images are perfectly combined to create some the most emotional and dramatic war sequences put to film. I for one will never forget the first time I saw the attack on the Japanese Bivouac. In a word, it is absolutely haunting. Also, the film has many layers to unravel for future viewings. I highly recommend you see it in a theatre like setting, as its impact is undeniable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserved every available award for '98</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reclusive Terrence Malick came out of a 20 year sabbatical to direct this stunning adaptation of James Joyce's novel. Oscar winning cinematographer John Toll's photography is achingly beautiful and is only one of the many highlights of this tremendous film, which was itself one of the few highlights of the '98 film season. The script and score are also invaluable in producing this hauntingly real film. Although robbed by Shakespeare In Love of the Best Picture award, The Thin Red Line is one of the many examples of those films that totally surpassed their 'competitors' when it came to the award. Unfair comparisons to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan turned many would-be viewers away. (Well, that and the 3-hour running time perhaps). Whereas SPR was a war film that showed the unabashed glory of war, THRL is a more cerebral and un-Hollywood take on war, showing the ugliness and futility that wars produced. Malick's script doesn't suffer from pretension as others have argued; it is just a brave enough piece to juxtapose intellectualism with the ?action' of war. The acting by the ensemble, led mostly by James Caviezel and Ben Chaplin(yes, i know its an ensemble) is all mostly well above par. The actors deliver their lines with aplomb, not degrading the humanitarianism with smirking preaching. Although the ?cameos' by John Travolta and George Clooney do bring this aspect down, as they simply seem to be overacting, showing off as it were. The Thin Red Line is one of the most beautifully acted, written and directed films of the last century, as well as being one of the best ?war' films ever produced. Absolutely stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People who say that this is a bad movie, do not understand much of it! This is a movie where you have to think with, explore deeper meanings of life and the human mind. It's not like a Saving private Ryan where the director 'thinks' for you. The film only works for people who have really thought about life, the meaning of life etc. It's about questioning the way we live our lives. Are we doing the right thing here on earth or not? One of the best things that the movie brings forward is the goodness/evilness of mankind. Think about it: Is there any other species living on this planet that has so many ways of killing and torturing each other and that kills itself at such a great scale? We're just a sick species and (almost) everybody eventually acts in self-interest. We don't care about each other, we just use each other for our own purposes and we let others to die and to starve. And the thing that makes me even more angry is people's hypocryt response and sympathy (like: "Oh, but we care about them, we give money!) for those who have less. I can't even think of a reason why the humankind deserves to survive, but this is not something I have to worry for, because eventually (like Sean Penn said in the movie) we will wipe ourselves out! The more we evolve, the more we are getting to our own self destruction. Think about this, not for ten minutes or 1 day, but with every thing you see/hear/feel and you will understand this movie. But this is not a movie for people who want other people to think for them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Embodiment of the IDEA of war...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw The Thin Red Line in the theater, I was overwhelmed by it's photography and ambiance, but was suspect of whether or not I had actually been told a story. Upon subsequent viewings, I realized that I had not been told a story, but had in fact been asked to experience some of the feelings felt by those in combat during WWII. It is not a popular notion that an American soldier would show fear in the face of his enemy, but that must occur in some men (and women) during a battle. Malick did not hand us our story complete with Cliff's Notes on how to respond (a la Spielberg), but allowed us to be taken into a situation that most of his audience members would never know otherwise: the moment just before a fight, the waiting, the instant of awareness after just being shot. These are not things that an actor can fully express to us. Knowing this, Malick has augmented these moments through photography, expression and silence. To me, The Thin Red Line is a meditation on the idea of war, rather than a representation of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is, in my opinion, the best war movie ever filmed. It brilliantly explores the private terrors of the front-line troops and the folly of dying for "dirt," as one of the soldiers remarks.Sean Penn is rock-solid as the sergeant, Jim Caveziel is innocent and Christlike as the questioning narrator, and Nick Nolte is always on the brink of bursting an aneurism as the colonel who wants to defeat the enemy at any human cost. Elias Koteas, John Cusack, and Woody Harrelson also deliver intelligent, heartbreaking performances.But the film is as much about the duality of nature as it is about war, and director Terrence Malick has no equal when it comes to filming images that stay with you long after the movie is over. He captures the beauty and cruelty of nature in breathtaking ways.I strongly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates fine acting, glorious cinematography, and a pitch-perfect point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I am surprised to learn that there has been negative reaction toward this film (and even that someone walked out of it). I found it extremely engaging and, to my mind, a very perceptive representation of what it war nust be like for some individuals. The characterisation was weak; it was near impossible to identify the emotional bent of any of the characters, except maybe the Nick Nolte madman character, but perhaps that low characterisation is a feature of the movie. There was certainly a sense that all these men American AND Japanses were human soldiers, nothing more nothing less. And that underscored the tragedy in all the killing. I had no sense that this was a major strategic battle (having not read or heard anything of the film beforehand) and as such it appeared to be a senseless scramble up a beautiful hill.Much as I liked the film, I have a few basic plot questions. At the risk of sounding naive, why in fact did the main character walk through the village in the middle of the film. Was this figurative or is the opening sequence in fact something that takes palce in the middle? I agree that the village represents a kind of Eden but am confused (a little) on the chronology.Also, do you think that when this main character, Jack, gets a Dear Jack letter, he gives up hope and thereby volunteers for the dangerous river scouting mission at the end (where he gets shot)?Finally, what on earth happened to Nick Nolte? He just seemed to disappear by the final scene? Is that why Clooney pops out of nowhere as the new leader?I don't mean to reduce this excellent film to it's plot, and accept that on other levels it works beautifully, but I would be interested in any clarifications...!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an extremely compelling display of poetic expression through film. Malick has been known to do it beautifully in Badlands and Days of Heaven, and he again hits the right tone with The Thin Red Line. Making films regarding existentialism is a difficult thing to do well... and subtlety is the best approach, something Malick knows and executes in a great manner every time. He speaks with words, but more importantly with his camera. Toll's cinematography is perfectly appropriate for the mood of the film. I was also touched deeply by Hans Zimmer's incredible score, by far his best work yet. Don't compare it to other films, it stands all by itself as a unique movie unattached from every other.

A place where, instead of a war story, we just find a bunch of character flaws in every GI and lamely put them under a microscope. It leads to...well, nowhere. The proof is in the pudding, I say. You'll see SPR has a place among the greatest, if not THE greatest, war films of all time. TRL continues to be ignored by both networks and the DVD buying public. Even Pearl Harbor, a love story with sfx, will surpass TRL. And rightfully so... a neighbor of mine served in the pacific, losing an arm to a Japanese bullet, and he frowned on this film as any kind of accurate representation of that theatre of war.</fullReview>

It does not star any big-name actor although their name appear in cast list, however, it makes sort-of air of desperate that created by all of these soldiers. I was attracted by the moving of the camera and the slow sorrowful music which play more important roles than actor themselves did. In fact,character is treated in this movie as not-so-important factor by director.They were just some 'symbol' surrounded by environment, like nature and human being.What we can get from PLATOON is that war is a tragedy of a nation.What we can get from The Thin Red Line is war is a tragedy of human being.</fullReview>

If you're expecting big fight scenes a la "Saving Private Ryan" or "Pearl Harbor" you're in for a big let down. It's NOT that type of film. It's more of a psychological film, where we deal with the fear and anguish of the soldiers rather than dealing with their mutilated corpses on the screen. Only time will tell if this film ages well. I remember seeing "Apocalypse Now" when it came out and it also looked confusing and contrived; but now everyone regards that movie as a masterpiece. This is definitely not my favorite war movie, but then again, I wouldn't say is total junk either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thinking Man's War Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Thin Red Line' came out around the same time that `Saving Private Ryan' did, and it is a strikingly different film. Without taking anything away from the great `Ryan', `Red Line' works on almost the polar opposite. Taking place during some of the most brutal battles of World War II in The Pacific, this film mixes as many points of view as it has characters, which is a lot. The all star cast is great, Terrence Malick's direction is superb, and the messages are complex and thought-provoking. While not necessarily examining the pro's and con's of WW II specifically (which would be a hard case to make in my opinion), this film intends to explore the nature of war itself, and man's continuing need to partake in it.I thought Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Elias Koteas were especially great in this movie. The contrasting of images of machines, guns, blood, men, wildlife, nature, flowers, etc?was not heavy-handed and quite effective. There have been many great war films, and I am a fan of a lot of them, but this one ranks among my favorites because of its originality and beauty. I haven't read the book yet, but I plan to. I'd give this film an A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I believe in solipsism. You have to at least consider it after viewing a show such as this. I don't mean solipsism as defined as total self-absorption, I'm referring to the somewhat uncomfortable feeling that one exists alone and the rest of world only lives in the mind. And in a paranoid turn I may consider the fact that I am a sort of guinea pig being manipulated by some force majeure, a la `The Truman Show'. How else can you explain such soi-disant `art' films, such as this and `Blue Velvet'? It can only be some omnipotent being whose maniacal experiment is to test the reaction of a human who witnesses a film that is uncommonly bad, only to see it incongruously praised by strategically-placed chimeras (that would be the majority of the posters here). The `reality' of the matter is that the `Thin Red Line' is bad beyond the pale. It is a discursive mess wrapped snuggly in sweeping camera work. It is overwrought and ponderous. Its attempt to achieve surrealism is forced and achromic. And if I may be so priggish I should point out that the filmmakers fail to observe a simple rule in moviemaking by making the characters indistinguishable. Here the dramatis personae look so much alike, and are so inconspicuous we are left with a turbid jumble. The clat camera shots make this an ostensible `masterpiece', but the other aspects of the film reveal a convoluted, insipid work. At least that's one person's (if I really exist) view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the book by James Jones at least three times since I bought it in the seventies and each time I was rivetted by this engrossing, straightforward story of a company of men involved in a battle in a particularly brutal theatre of war in WW2. When the movie came out with all the usual ballyhoo of a big production I decided to see it but never actually got round to doing so until I rented it on video a few days ago.Movies are seldom as good as the books they are based on, but I was hoping that this would at least approach the book. I was very disappointed. There were, at various points during the three hours of the film, some exciting battle scenes, but there was far too much time taken up with self indulgent photography, long boring sequences during which nothing much happened, and muttered pretentious pseudo-philosophical monologues, none of which contributed to the enjoyment of the movie. The US Army and Marines fought a particularly hard battle in the Pacific in WW2 but it had to be done, and they did it as efficiently as they knew how. All that "what is war for?" drivel should be reserved for movies about Vietnam, which was a different war altogether.This movie was a waste of a good story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who compare this to Saving Private Ryan, I will tell you that although they are both WWII movies, they have little in common. Saving Private Ryan was a gritty, gory, intense action war movie. The Thin Red Line is more like Apocalypse Now, as it is more psychological than violent, with a more beautiful backdrop to it than Ryan. Terence Malick does a fine job directing a strong cast of men through their personal conflicts. James Caviezel is wonderful as a subtle, peaceful man dragged into a useless conflict. Nick Nolte is also superb as the typical disgruntled colonel who wants all the Japs dead. The stunning cinematography is a sharp contrast to the brutal battle scenes that occur throughout the film, and Hans Zimmer again proves he is the king of war movie composers. With all this praise, the Thin Red Line should not go bad. But it sours a little. Malick drags the film out heavily with voice-over narration that could've made more sense, especially after the raid on the Japanese camp. The film picks itself back up for the denouement, and I was overall very impressed by this thinking man's war movie. 1-10 Overall--7.5 Direction--7.5 Photography--8.5 Acting--8 Story--5 Music score--8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE THIN RED LINE (1998) Rating: 9/10The Thin Red Line is a war drama that reached inside me like no other film in 1998. It made realise the true horrors of war, like missing people and regretting killing enemies. The characters are so soulful, developed and well played-out it'll bring a tear to your eye. The acting is brilliant from the mostly-male all-star cast. Sean Penn is strong and stunning, John Cusack is very convincing and Nick Nolte is angry, loud but somehow we see through to his good heart. But it is the brilliant Elias Koteas who takes the cake in The Thin Red Line. His performance is indescribable. A true performance to be cherished, and we rarely get such a strong young actor to bring up such a magnificent portrayal of a man going through a rough time. We don't see enough of George Clooney, unfortunately, but his extended cameo is still surprisingly memorable. There are a lot of excellent things about this war movie, but Terrence Malick's amazing direction truly wins us over. This man hasn't made a movie in 20 years and he has come back with this love-it-or-hate it flick that most of the world enjoyed to the fullest. This is mostly due to Malick's brilliant control over the movie and handling his task with absolute calmness and sureness that it'll do well. Kudos to you. The sound and editing are all fabulous and the cinematography is breathtaking. The score is also very powerful and captures the movies beautiful brutality. Overall, this is one of the best and most beautiful war films to ever be put on screen. The Thin Red Line is unique and special and a stunningly shot flick that I am sure I will never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nature not to blame for man made war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the positive reviews. This filmed moved away from the usual daily dialogue of soldiers in films like Platoon (not in itself unrealistic or invalid) and gave the characters the chance to express some of their deeper feelings. I thought the inclusion of the crocodile worked well. At the beginning of the film this is the first image we see. My first interpretation of this was that it represented the inherent threat of evil and desire to kill which exists in the natural world. Nick Nolte's character notes nature is cruel as an explanation/excuse for the brutality of the fighting. However this is quickly contrasted with the awol soldiers who live peacefully with the villagers who themselves coexist peacefully with nature. Although one of the women refers to the boys fighting. The next time we see the crocodile it has been captured by the soldiers and has become another victim of the fighting and of "civilised men". The fighting disrupts the natural world rather than being an integral part of it. Or so I thought anyway. In England we have just had a good documentary series called Hell in the Pacific which includes interviews with veterans of the pacific conflict. It was made by Channel 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are we really the winners?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read a professional review of this movie, where the person wondered why all war movies have the message of "War is hell, but we still won." After watching this movie again last night, I started to really wonder if we had won at all. I know that many people call this movie "pretentious", "boring", and "left me squirming." I wonder if they saw the same thing that I did. Sure Saving Private Ryan came out the same year and sure it was about WWII, and sure it had those 25 minutes, but somehow this movie conveys the absolute horrors of war far better than Saving Private Ryan did. I've noticed that some people have mentioned that they think that most of the people speak far to eloquently for rural men. Yet, the men only spoke poetry mostly in the voiceovers and the most of the characters who spoke like it were educated men like Bell and Staros. Also, if you look carefully at the nature images a lot of them mirror what is going on in the film. Everyone who has said that they hated it should really watch it again, don't expect a lot of physical action, this movie is about the mental states of everyone in the film. If you hate it still, I think that there must be something wrong, somewhere. I wouldn't all this the best movie ever made, but it certainly deserved it's Oscar nomination and certainly deserved its critical praise. I also recommend the soundtrack, but be forewarned that some images from the moviemay come while listening to it, which is one of the reasons that I think that both soundtrack and movie were great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adult emotional drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To compare this film to SPR is an insult to TRL, It's like comparing McDonalds to a classy restaurant.SPR was a mainstream flick with some simple slow motions and corny dialog to appeal to the masses, which it did.TRL, isn't a traditional, movie, its art and its not going to appeal to the masses. There's some action, but very little. The film isn't about the gore and heroics, it's about emotion and feeling. When you make a film you don't just plant the camera down and say act, you can use technique, back drops, music and dialog to convey the feeling of what is going on. This film was conjuring up the emotion and mind of the viewer to think about how you could deal with a life and death situation. Killing people, who, are as scared as you just for a piece of earth.If you've ever been in a crisis situation in your life, your thoughts and feelings aren't displayed in your face or your actions, they are in your mind. Most people will probably think of a loved one or better times in their past. This is what the film is trying to show, its not just showing what people are doing it's trying to show the paranoia, thoughts and feelings. It does that through music and film sequences.Yes, I'm sure, most of the time soldiers joked and acted stupid and didn't think about life, but this film isn't about that, this is about stirring the soul of the people in the audience, who, hopefully will never be in that situation. Giving them a glimpse of what it would be like to be the soldier not the spectator.My only criticism is that I do think it's is slightly long, especially towards the end, which spoilt the film slightly. Still it's much better than the normal thoughtless trash that is shown and would recommend it to most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Malick or not to Malick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years the debate on Malick has been a simple one, is he a great director because he makes beautifully lyrical films, or is he a lazy over rated director because he makes beautifully lyrical films that rely on the voice over? For me, the use of the voice over has never been a cop out per se. Somewhere between "My Dinner with Andre" and the action genre, a voice over can be helpful if not necessary. Malick has used this technique to propel his previous films ("Badlands" &amp; "Days of Heaven")and focus the movie goers attention to the moral ambiguities being portrayed on the screen. In each case, I found the narrative to be unassuming and not a representation of his inability to craft a story through his lens. In the case of "Thin Red Line", the enormity of the issues at hand takes the voice over to the forefront, admittedly making it the central delivery system of the narrative. So once again is Malick lazy or skilled? I believe he is the latter and "Thin Red Line" is a wonderful film for this reason. Simple themes such as life being out of balance can be delivered in image alone. Godfrey Reggio proved this with his brilliant "Koyaanisqatsi". Yet attempting to communicate the struggles between action and thought, technology and nature, innocence and corruption in a manner average movie goers can grasp is a tall order (a casual read of a cross section of comments on this film shows just how tall indeed). So Malick's reliance on multiple voice overs can be excused. The "Thin Red Line" is a beautiful and complex film that provides a fitting end to his trilogy that started in 1973 with "Badlands".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't commented on this film before, simply due to the fact that I had walked out of the theater when I first saw it. It turned out that there were only four minutes left, but I didn't want to comment having not seen the end.. who knows, there actually could have been something interesting in those four minutes. I've just watched it again, on video, and I'd like to give my two cents:This is a film that pretentious people will say they loved, for the simple fact that it makes them feel smarter than the average viewer You will notice that the majority of the positive reviews given here state that to fully understand this film, you need "patience, open mindedness, (and) intelligence", and to be "intelligent and sensitive". Apparently, if you don't enjoy this film, it is because you are not intelligent enough, and not because this is simply a poorly made film trying to pass itself off as intellectual.Watching this movie, it is as if someone decided to take the intensity and raw emotion of "Saving Private Ryan", which this film is often compared to, and the creativity and beauty of poetry, and smash them together. There are ways that this could have worked, but they don't here. Rather, "The Thin Red Line" comes off as alienating, frustrating, and weak, albeit beautifully filmed.There is some vague concept of a plot, hung around a handful of tentpole characters who are either established actors confusing stupidity for humanity, or young men, straight from the latest issue of "Details", who all look alike and spend an inordinate amount of time bathing under waterfalls.You would think that the amount of time spent on characterization would make the viewer feel something, anything for these characters, but despite what feels like hours of voice-over, nothing is ever really said about them, their lives, or their feelings. In my opinion, I would have had much more empathy with the characters if they had voiced their thoughts in coherent, normal ways. I don't know a single person who expresses themselves in the fashion depicted here... like a Calvin Klein advertisement, only less interesting. Don't take my word for it, look at the 'memorable quotes' section to the left... and remember that these lines were written for a major motion-picture, and not poetry night at the local coffeeshop.I'm not familiar with Mr. Mallick's work, but I would hope that, due to his reputation, this is an abberation caused by the sudden rush for 'war' films after the success of "Private Ryan". I prefer to think that he is an intelligent director who respects his audience, but was carried away by studio's urging, along with the dozen actors all pulling for their own oscar-winning speech. If this is not correct, and "The Thin Red Line" is indeed the film Mr. Mallick wanted, I find it sad that a respected director would make a film so vapid, egotistical, and, despite it's pretentions, ultimately meaningless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i would like to explain something about this review: All lines inside "" are excerpts from other reviews to this movie, and i think they will make my point more clear than my own ravings. This is not only one of the best movies i have ever seen but this is the first movie since about 13 years, that that made me cry.I didnt only cry because it was so sad or something like that, but more because it was almost too intense for me( and im glad that this is not a forum or you would be tempted to call me wimp or something). I just didnt wanna see any more characters die, be it americans or japanese(although you have no real insight to their side, except for their faces during the battle, that say more than enough).I am 23 years old and im not a "professional warrior" so maybe i couldnt judge this film correctly. I didnt see any "lack of entertainment" in this WARMOVIE, nore did i "wait for some good action" in this piece of "liberal arthouse crap". Im not saying that action is bad in a war movie, but i sure as hell dont see why it is necessary to go for the glorified ultra violence from SPR again, which in my opinion is distastefully used to create a moment of suspense where non would have been necessary to depict the horror of war. The message that the one place on earth, where people can come as close to paradise as they will ever be, is filled with death and useless violence trashed me more than any other movie i have ever seen. i am sure i am one of the "young people who dont know what war is like", but this movie more than any other makes me gratefull that i probably will never make that experience. sorry for the possible spelling mistakes..</fullReview>

They raved. But did anyone understand it? I don't care how "philosophical" it was, or how pretty the flowers on the island looked in contrast to the brutality of war. It was virtually impossible to follow the strategy of the soldiers or frankly to care what was going on or to care about the characters.I think no one is willing to say that the movie is actually too-long, boring, ploddingly paced (inexcusable for a war movie) and poorly acted by most.YUCK!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie, if you haven't read the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching ?Saving Private Ryan' and hearing all the hype about ?The Thin Red Line,' my interest was peaked. The sheer brutality portrayed in the beginning sequence of ?Saving Private Ryan' put me in complete shock. Up until the end of the first 30 minutes of ?Saving Private Ryan,' war movies never really gave us an accurate depiction of what it's like to go into battle. What could possibly be going through one's mind as you step off a boat knowing the enemy is pointing a machine gun in your direction, just waiting for the moment when the ramp is dropped. Up until that point, when watching a war movie, those thoughts never crossed my mind.With my interest peaked, and another movie about the same war to be seen, I decided I wanted to learn a little more about war in general, and the pain and anguish young men between the ages of 18 ? 27 went through. Me falling in that age group had something to do with it as well. So, instead of paying $7 to go and watch another war movie, I decided to spend an extra $7 to buy the book. I wanted to read the book first, and then watch the movie and see how well it followed along. This was either the worst mistake I could've made, or the best choice I have ever made. Now that I have confused you, I'll attempt to explain what this means below.The Worst Mistake:I have seen the movie, only after reading the book, and have heard/read a lot of great reviews, including the ones on this site. After hearing/reading all of these reviews, I can definitely see how this movie can be seen as `philosophical', `beautiful', `poetic', etc. However, the movie, even though it is rather long, seems to only skim through the entire book, hopefully capturing the main scenes and give them a short, 2-minute sequence in which to grab your attention and make you realize what these young men had to endure.For example, a man is lying defenseless in the middle of the battlefield screaming in anguish, while being shot at, desperately asking for help. No one can help him, for fear of being killed in the process. The screams become so unbearable, that finally Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) risks his life just to provide comfort to the dying man by giving him enough morphine to keep him quite until he dies. My explanation is basically how the movie interprets this moment, and many other moments: quick and not too powerful. And after watching parts like this, having already read the book, I knew I wasn't going to be satisfied with the rest of the movie.In short, had I not read the book, I may have enjoyed the movie.The Best Thing:Had I watched the movie first, I may not have even thought to read an excellent book.It's hard for me to say how I liked this movie. To be perfectly honest, I didn't like it very much at all. But, as the old saying goes: `the book is always better than the movie.' And in this case, there is no doubt about it.So, here are my recommendations:- If you have already read the book, and have not yet seen the movie, don't see the movie.- If you are planning on reading the book, don't see the movie- If you're not planning on reading the book, see the movie- If you have seen the movie, read the book (even though already seeing the movie will have clouded your own opinions, and killed your imagination)- If you have already read the book, and have seen the movie, tell me I'm wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently the battle lines have been drawn: If you liked The Thin Red Line, you are obviously thoughtful, rational, perhaps even a member of Mensa! If you did not like it, you are a moronic member of the unwashed masses, incapable of appreciating anything more challenging than Ace Ventura or that "Hey, Vern" guy.I consider myself of average intelligence and tastes. I watch and enjoy a wide variety of movies. I've never taken a course in film criticism at the local community college. I don't know much about art, but I know what I like. And I didn't really like the Thin Red Line. But hold on, I didn't hate it either. Please, reserve judgment and read on...TTRL is a beautiful film. Visually stunning, with compelling and disquieting cinematography. The colors, jungle images, the depictions of simple village life, the grimy reality of war were all filmed in a truly incredible way. The comparisons and contrasts were "in your face" and arch, as if to say, "here is The Message." The lack of a linear storyline was hard to swallow in a nearly three-hour film. And yes, I realize the point was to illustrate the random and chaotic nature of war. The characters were not as developed as you might expect in a film of this nature (and length). Travolta and Nolte chewed up the scenery in their limited appearances in way that would make Jim Carrey feel uncomfortable.That being said, I've watched this movie five times. I appreciate the human face it puts on war. It forced me to confront the fact that war is young men and women, scared and confused, doing the unthinkable under circumstances almost unbearable.The Thin Red Line is not the best movie ever made. It's not even the best war movie ever made. I would give it a "10" for cinematography, a "2" for everything else. That averages out to a "6". A middle of the road score from a committed member of the middlebrow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hello When I saw this film at the cinema when it first came out I didn't really enjoy it too much. Despite being beautifully shot I thought it was disjointed and rather pretentious. However I decided to watch it again and have changed my mind totally. This is a fantastic film. of course it is not perfect, but it wears it's flaws on it's sleeve and is all the better for it. Any comparisons between this and Saving Private Ryan, good or bad, are totally irrelevant. They are different films, SPR is a cracking piece of entertainment, with a blunt message, showing you the physical horrors of war, whilst TTRL is more of an exploration of the mental side of war. Soldiers ruminations and the disjointed nature add to the poetic feeling of this film. The cinematography is superb, the action scenes are taught and tense, the acting is magnificent, particularly the scene after ($possible spoiler$) the 7 men have cleared the Japanese bunker, and Ben Chaplin realises what has just happened, and the look on John Cusacks face when Nick Nolte tells him he doesnt know what its like to be passed over, is superb. One problem I do have though is the voice-overs, I found it very difficult to work out what they were saying, particularly Nick Nolte. they all seemed to speak in this low gravelly slurred tone making it difficult the make out what they were saying. Another thing that annoys me is the pretentious comments that this film seems to inspire. A kind of snobbery "I understand this movie and I'm going to write about it in a high brow style to show you that I 'know'". Anyway give this film a chance, dont be cynical like I was when I first saw it and just enjoy it. Although I'm sure it's not to everyones taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most intriguing war films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long been a firm believer that Apocalypse Now is the best war movie ever. Although this movie does not quite top it, it can be considered in the same league and takes the number 2 spot. In many ways, it is similar to Apocalypse Now in telling the story subtly through vivid images and never once telling the viewer what to feel or think. The sheer artistry of this film is also reminiscent of its worthy predecessor. The recurring images of the bird visually conveys a message that could never be put into words. This movie is also intriguing because it is not your typical combat film. There is the usual "group" of soldiers, or maybe they are anything but usual if viewed in the correct light. In addition, there is no clear cut enemy. Sure, everyone knows they are fighting the Japanese, but this film does not make you feel that the Japanese are the enemy. Also, the action scenes are secondary to the other scenes in this film. If you are looking for a lot of intense combat action, this movie is not for you. A typical action-lover most likely will find this film long and incomprehensible. However, this film is very intelligent, artistic, and the message that underlies it is unforgettable. This film is a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb film, made with a dreamlike quality, which contains intense combat. The film emphasizes the utter fear of combat very, very well. Before the soldiers even land at Guadalcanal, there is much screen time devoted simply to capturing the fear in their faces. This carries over to when they're on the battlefield, too. And you really feel like you are experiencing combat. It's terrifying.In the meantime, the film presents voiceovers of several characters, representing their interior thoughts and emotions about what they're doing and what they're thinking. It's remarkable that a film of such great scale (hundreds of soldiers in the frame at once; huge battle scenes) could at the same time have such an interior, meditative quality.The film is also strong in presenting combat as a part of nature, as part of the natural cycles of life and death. We are all living things on this planet, the film seems to say, and even though war is a man-made event, it nonetheless happens, and we live and die like other creatures.On the one hand, this is the most expensive art movie ever made! On the other, it is a beautiful poem of a movie which presents gripping combat sequences while managing to stay true to its powerful, antiwar feeling. Try to see this on the big screen if at all possible. It really loses a lot on TV.I also must commend Hans Zimmer on his excellent score. It perfectly captures the strange, dreamlike quality of the movie as a whole. It is one of the most haunting and beautiful scores I've ever heard. (And it was used in a PEARL HARBOR trailer.)</fullReview>

The only reason I liked "Saving Private Ryan" better is because it was more action in it. But "The Thin Red Line" is much better made. You really get the feeling of how war is, and you get a real kick inside you. You feel the horror inside you. The music is perfect to the movie, and is one of the reason that makes the movie so good, sad and realistic. From the beginning when the soldiers arrives at Guadalcanal to the end of the battle, you feel like you were in the war. The director of the movie have maked such a realism that you never have seen before! And I think this movie really have earned "The Best Warmovie" award. (If there is one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a marvellous attempt to put the audience in the shoes of a battlefield soldier. Not that I thought so at first -- indeed, I expected a "Saving Private Ryan" in the Pacific, which had me quite excited. And after leaving the theatre, unfulfilled, I trashed the film.But nevertheless, I watched it again when it came out on video. And rather then sitting there waiting for those exciting action war scenes that I had foolishly looked for the first time, I absorbed the film. "The Thin Red Line" is one of the most engrossing films I have ever seen ... which completely justifies its length. To those who get it, it will completely enwrap you in the sorrow that these men faced. I sat amazed for the three hours.A point in the movie that had bothered me was Hans Zimmer's score. I'm a huge fan of his Grammy-winning score to "Crimson Tide," however I was deeply disappointed the first time coming away with no notable theme or something I could tangibly (and mindlessly) hum to myself. After I got ahold of the soundtrack, I played it in my room, closed my eyes, and again allowed it to envelope me the same way the movie had ... and especially tracks like "Journey To The Line," slow, but powerful once they build... truly moved me.Depending on who you are, you will either love this movie or hate it. If you were disappointed by "Ryan," you'll find the missing emotional level in "Thin Red Line." I certainly did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly dreadful, overrated piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having eagerly anticipated this much-hyped film I would just like to say how disappointing the experience was. A pretentious, oftentimes unintelligible narrative, possibly (who knows?) reflecting on the meaning of life, far too long (around 3 hours) - really one of the worst films I have seen in a long while. For those interested in reflections on the meaning of life, I suggest you go and see "contact." Call me old fashioned I go to the cinema to be entertained and this came nowhere near. I would rather mud-wrestle my own mother than have to sit through this dull affair again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor movie, very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Saving Private Ryan and hearing about Red Line coming in half a year, I looked forward to this movie for more than six months. It not only was a disappointment, it was a genuinely bad movie. I'm all for unique movies, non-linear plots, and intellectual pieces, but this movies was pure art-house crap. It was impossible to care about characters that came and went and never materialized again. It was impossible to tell who was "speaking" during the voice-overs, and what they were saying often made little sense. For a while I wondered if maybe some of it was just over my head, but I talked to many people who felt the same way. We agreed it was UNDER our heads. Several people got up and walked out of the movie. I would have, but I kept thinking (okay...he'll wrap it all up in the end). But he didn't. Malick, after all the hype about his brilliance, ended a poor movie with a poorer ending. The only two characters who'd been central at all so that the viewer could connect with and care about them were Webb and (I forget his name now). One of them dies with a silly grin on his face (Jim Caviezal's character) and the other just disappears. Webb gets a dear-john letter and then we never see him again. All the critic acclaim I heard and read for this movie made me swear off critics once and for all. "Malick is BRILLIANT" they drooled. "The way he poetically juxtaposes the horror of war with the beauty of nature is magnificent!" Yeah...whatever. There were some great shots of nature/warfare colliding...but there was no story. It might as well have been a slide show! Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the anti-thesis to Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this was released with the intentions of satisfying all who were not satisfied with Saving Private Ryan. I think it reflects upon the idea that war is not often as structured and as climax building as "Private Ryan" would suggest. It also lends itself with the idea that you really don't know who will live and who will die in a war. We didn't know who would live or die in the other movie, but we do know that Private Ryan would live. This movie does not reveal what would happen to anyone, and I think it was a surprising change to see how the story unfolds to all the characters. Was it as good as "Saving Private Ryan"? No. But was it disappointing? Certainly not. Some notable photography as well. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different type of war picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a unique and interesting look at war. It makes war look beautifully poetic, but perhaps this is not the right approach to making a war film. Although, I must say, as a film, The Thin Red Line is fantastic in the technical aspect. Toll's cinematography is gorgeous as is the best score of 1998 thanks to Hans Zimmer (note: The Pearl Harbor trailer music is from this score: Journey to the Line). I was satisfied with the way the film looked, but it lacked a lot for a supposed war movie. War films should show the terrors of war, and if your going to make it poetic, then still show the terrors of war. The cast was dull and so was the drama. But it came across so visually stunning that I must give this an above average rating.***/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I see what the director was trying to accomplish: showing the strain of war on the soldiers, and how nature goes on unperturbed by humans scurrying around and blowing up stuff. The fighting was pretty intense, and it was good to see the Japanese both as shadowy hordes and as broken men (just a step or two beyond where the U.S. soldiers were).But as a movie it was too long; I kept expecting to see credits roll, and the flick would just continue. The narrator waxing poetic didn't move me, and I *like* war poets as a rule. The narrator didn't engage me particularly. The jaunts off to hang with the natives were irritating.Like I said, I could see where the director wanted to take me, but I think he could have followed a shorter route.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My number 171 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, you have read correctly. This is my number 171 movie. It is one of the worst war movies I have seen yet, but it is still good. Let me compare this one to other war movies.1. Saving Private Ryan ( 1998 ) : SPR is way intense than TTRL (1998), but it is more intense than every single war movie so far, and I think, it will ever be the most intense. A German cinema magazine wrote about The Thin Red line : Spielberg will be jealous. But I do not know what he could be jealous of, if talking about The Thin Red line.2. All Quiet on the Western front ( remake, 1979 ): This is more intense, too, because it shows more what war is like.3. Die Bruecke ( German film, 1959 ). It is much better. It deals with seven German boys ( aged 14 - 16 ), who have to defend a very unimportant bridge at the end of WWII. You hear the sounds, that Steven used at the end of SPR, when the tanks arrive, in this movie. And here they are even better and more intense.4. Das Boot ( german film, 1981 ) : it is not a war movie like the thin red line or SPR are, so it is not comparable to those. But I think Das Boot is better than TTRL.5. Platoon ( 1986 ) : Platoon is much better, because it is more interesting made and it is more thrilling than TTRL.6. Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 ) :FMJ is much better than TTRL. FMJ is much more intense, more interesting, and everything is just better: the directing, the actors, the sound, the score, the script, everything. In FMJ you see two movies. One is 40 min., the other one 50 min. But this is 140 min, and they are way worse than FMJ.7. Bridge on the River Kwai (1957): This is the movie that is worse than TTRL. It is very boring if you see it twice and it lacks of good actors, good directing and everything else you can lack of.Either I have not seen the war movies, that I have not mentioned, or I do not consider them as war movies. all in all, I rate this movie 7/10. it could have been much better. It is watchable, but worse than many other war movies.CU, Rinho</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the thin red line is a masterpiece about the war in the pacific during world war II. never before have i scene a war film that shows us every side, every angle, and every thought of a bloody and important battle.the battle of guadacanal was a turning point in america's battle against the japanese. as the soldiers crawl through rolling fields, hunker throught beautiful forests filled with animals, and wade through streams, we can practically feel like we are there.malick's casting is unbelievable. i sdnt like sean penn or nick nolte, but there characters in this film are unforgettable. you come away from this movie having felt you know what every man in this battle was thinking. the poetry and visions let you into their minds and their pasts. we even see the japanese that they fight against upclose, which is a delightful change from shadowed figures running through the mist. we really see what the enemy is like too, and their condition during this point of the war.i believe that the academy must have missed this film, because to me and many other, this is the obvious best pictures of 1998, and that i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film a few more times and remarkably, it just gets better and better each time. I'll concur that it's arty, but so what? When I first saw TRL in the theatre, I was disappointed. I expected another Saving Private Ryan and didn't get it, for which I am now grateful. It's my opinion that TRL and SPR are masterpieces in their own rights and to compare them against each other is counterproductive and does little or nothing to encourage others in viewing them.It doesn't have 'slam-bang' action from scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment; Neither did the actual battle campaign. If you need to see endless on-screen 'combat', you may want to pass on this one. If you want a film that says a lot with outstanding acting and insight into the minds of its characters, this is a very good start. Women might enjoy this film more than the others, not just because of the actors but by the philosophical merit of the script.It's not really like "Saving Private Ryan" at all. It's more akin to "84 Charlie MoPic" than "Apocalypse Now". This is a different style of film than SPR, etc. Different director, different storyline, different setting (U.S. ARMY at Guadalcanal in '42, NOT Marines!). They were all outstanding filmatic interpretations of men engaged in the vicious, murderous business of War. As were other films such as "A Midnight Clear", "Catch-22" and "M*A*S*H*"(the 1970 film). Check 'em out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>poetry+cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films I have watched so far, "Thin Red Line" stands out as being an exception due to the fact that its the only and the most successful attempt to fuse two mediums of art; namely poetry and cinema. Not necessarily because the film is emotional, there are so many films out there which sway you between depression, despair, sorrow, ecstacy and the likes. Its because every scene is both emotionally loaded and DENSE, making the film be available to infinitely many interpretations with allusions to the deepest, incomprehendible dimensions of humanity, extreme subjectivity. Some things just cannot be conveyed through cinema, like Sureyya's lines "Your voice has the messines of a house"(a very crude translation). And somethings just cannot be conveyed through poetry, like DePalma's Mission Impossible. Terence Malick identified the deficiencies of both mediums and complemented them with each other, which resulted in a surrealist, subconcious-hungry masterpiece with definitely one of the best cinematography out there. This film should not be represented solely by talking about its plot, because its significant does not lie in its plot. It renders words to be redundant, plot to be redundant, peripheral ideas to be redundant. It digs down to feelings that you have last felt when you were 10, innocence, and through that leaps to divinity. Thank you Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prequel to "The Things They Carried?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this film again shortly after re-reading Tim O'Brien's terrific short story, "The Things They Carried," which took place during the Vietnam War, and was struck by the similarities between the characters.In the story, "the things they carried" referred not only to the tangible items they carried through the jungle, but also the emotional burdens they bore, such as guilt, fear, etc. One character spent so much of his time thinking about his love for a girl back home that he believed it affected his ability to do his job in the war. O'Brien served in the infantry in Vietnam, which lends his story immediate credibility.While Malick's film has been criticized by many as being an unrealistic depiction of war, especially when compared to Saving Private Ryan, I'm hesitant to jump on that bandwagon. Are Private Bell's flashbacks to private moments with his wife really that unrealistic when you think about what soldiers had to do to get through their days? Like the character in The Things They Carried, it probably acted as both a burden and a hope.Many of the characters in the Thin Red Line all held on to some personal value that made their existence in war both more tolerable and more horrible. Sean Penn's character wanted to numb himself to the horror, but couldn't. Private Witt believed in a better world somewhere else, which stood in contrast to everyone around him. Colonel Tall craved military victory, but even he realized the futility of it all when he sent Staros home because he was too weak, but was going to recommend him for the Silver Star and Purple Heart.As odd as it sounds, this film is more character-driven than "Saving Private Ryan," which had a slew of non-developed, stereotypical characters who were slaves to a boring plot. Interestingly, I read a Tim O'Brien interview in which he said Saving Private Ryan, aside from the first 20 minutes, which portrayed an accurate, vicious, fragmented battle, basically sucked because of its linear plot. To him, war was anything but linear. He wasn't asked comment on The Thin Red Line. I'd be interested to know how he responded. Maybe he'd say it's a piece of pretentious garbage. Who knows? The film isn't perfect, but I continue to be impressed with the depth and detail of it after each viewing.</fullReview>

Well, this ain't it.As a film, yea, it's artistic. It' "purdy" to look at. It's poetic. Sure, but does represent the war in the pacific, HELL NO! Excuse me. Well, In a way, it does look at war from the individual's point of view, and in a way it doesn't. People in war are a lot more frightened than the people in this movie. They don't start crying mommy till they realize their legs are gone."Artists" will like this movie. That's who it was made for. But you want a truely good story about the war in the Pacific? Read Flags of our Fathers by James Bradley, and you'll see this movie is nothing more than artistic war. Go see Saving Private Ryan, and be amazed.Oh, and by the way, Saving Private Ryan, while it is mainstream, is genious. THE THIN RED LINE IS MAINSTREAM TOO!!!!!! OKAY?!!!!!! And The Thin Red Line ain't genius, are you art boys okay with that? The big Budget for Saving Private Ryan was put to good use.

		<fullReview>A second viewing of this film has totally changed my opinion. This really is an outstanding movie. That said, I can definitely understand why some people wouldn't like it.When I first saw the Thin Red Line in the I found it to be very long and slow, with little or no action. I was expecting an action packed movie with a strong central theme (winning over the island). What bothered me the most was the fact that there was almost no real story or plot to follow. It left me in the dark as to where the movie was going. I remember sitting in the theater after the movie had been running for an hour thinking "This film could end in the next five minutes or it could take another hour, I just haven't got a clue".When a friend who hadn't seen it yet talked me into seeing it a second time, my reaction was totally different. I already knew what happened so I didn't have to wonder about the plot. I was able to pay attention to the fascinating images and brilliant cinematography. There are just some terrific scenes in this movie. The scenes where they captured the ridge and the enemy camp are outstanding.The movie really demands a lot from the audience. The narrative is pushed so far in the background that you have to be really attentive to understand all of what is happening. If you do give it a chance then it can be mesmerising.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, in some ways, is even better than Saving Private Ryan. It's poetic and poignant, and seemed more for an arthouse than mainstream cinema (of the two people I saw it with, one fell asleep and the other went to watch Payback). Spielberg's movie was grimly realistic, unflinching, while this one focused on the individual, with flashbacks and dreams and then suddenly they're out on the field again, fighting an enemy they never see. It invites us to watch, never to judge, and doesn't really give a point or plot, only how the war affects each of the men, in different ways. Less bloody than most war films, though violent nonetheless. The kaledioscopic patterns shifts from an individual perspective to none at all when they charge out and you don't know who's talking anymore. That's when the unseen (and never heard) narrator makes and appearance (that you can't see). You don't really know who the enemy is, because you see them both, though they don't see each other. But to be warned: if you came expecting a mainstream thriller, you might be disappointed, unless you see it differently. And maybe let the sweeping, paranomic scenery sink in, and then you'll probably like it.</fullReview>

His questions, eg, "Who were you that were with me?" appear to make little sense and are just quasi-philosophical rubbish. However, the film does have some redeeming features: the cinematography is wonderful and the sequences where the soldiers storm the hill are perhaps deserving of comments that this is the best war film ever.Maybe it could have been - but Private Witt soon puts paid to that idea!

		<fullReview>i have to say, this is my favourite film. it's not perfect, there's not a whole lot of always coherent plot but there's just so much in it that it would be blasphemy to not respect this film.so many people come to see this film expecting to see a patriotic american war film which americans go home at the end of the day and are decorated at their honour. i had this misconception before i viewed this film so i was a bit reluctant to see it.(don't get me wrong, i'm not xenophobic, i'm just a bit tired of war movies [they don't deserve to be called films] which follow this tiresome formula.)as it happened, i chanced upon this film and i instantly fell in love with it. yes it is long and at times, pretentious but there's just something really really magical about it. it has a kind of aura.i guess because of terrence Malick's unique understanding of philosophy, people with an understanding of it will see all the visual symbolism in it but then others just dismiss it in that they think they'll never 'get it'. i don't have a very knowledgable understanding of philosophy and i was still profoundly moved by this beautiful visual feast.plot is not everything. before i saw this film, i always thought it was. in many ways, this film had a very unique feeling to it in that we were the omnipotent 'god' like figure who saw everything and realised what everyone was thinking. in all honesty, not all wars are fought with a coherent 'story' to them. in fact, the words coherency and war are just such juxtapositions to start off with that i wonder as to why we've come to expect perfectly developed stories amid a big battle. that's probably more ludicrous that what some people describe as ludicrously pretentious rantings in THE THIN RED LINE.yes at times you don't know where it's going and you don't know what's happening but i guess that's a big feature of war...you're not always in control all the time with perfect comprehension of your surroundings. it took me three viewings to work out where they were going, what they were doing, etc. but the emotion is not on what they do but the whole experience.i'm constantly amazed that people will without hestition, vote commercial mass market films like Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan before this one. in my mind, the competition should never have started because THE THIN RED LINE is in a league separate from the films i have just mentioned and their counterparts.i refuse to rate this film because rating itself for such a film is condescendingly patronising. instead, i will say that everyone, sit through it and then make up your mind because inevitably, there'll always be films which don't please everyone. just have an informed opinion (ie watch the whole film) before you judge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overshadowed, by Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, looked from the trailers almost as if it was a rush job, trying to cash in on the Saving Private Ryan hype, which had been banded around for weeks in the press. I took a chance, went to see it. Hey, it had Shaun Penn in, and Woody Harrelson. It couldn't be too bad. I, like many others was shocked, when I realised the caliber of this film. No-one seemed to know it had been made. I think there was around 6 other people in the cinema watching it that day. The Thin Red Line, is a masterpiece. A stack of the Best actord of the present day, play out a superb screenplay, taken from a brilliant book. Direction is superb and the cameo count is excellent. The Thin Red Line is, what some would describe as an 'arty film' but don't be put off. It weighs in at just over two hours, with probably only one hour of real fighting, if you want to see this film because you're a Clooney fan or a Travolta fan, you will be dissapointed. Penn, Cusack, Nolte, and Harrelson all put in top-draw performances. You may also recognise Jim Caviezel from films including Wyatt Earp, The Rock and G I Jane, who gives a sterling performance.My view of The Thin Red Line, is a modern Apocalpse Now. Focusing on an unseen side of the war. It won't change your life, but I can't help thinking that if it had been released further away from Saving private Ryan, it would already by a considered a Classic Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see that several users have compared "The Thin Red Line" to "Saving Private Ryan". While both have to do with WWII and the trials and tribulations of war, they are really not all that comparable. And I don't mean in the "good or bad" sense; I mean in the fact that just because the neatly packaged mile-a-minute "Saving Private Ryan" appealed to the mainstream audience (myself included), "The Thin Red Line" takes time to actually breathe.And with that methodic pacing, no not "plodding", I found myself on the edge of my seat. The movie's very different approach to realism, as well as surrealism, sustained my interest, even with the perplexing monologues. You'll notice that the different voices overheard have much to do with the reflection of existence and man's relationship with the world around him. Yes, even with battle, I could imagine one would reflect on his existence- as short lived as it might be. This is captured perfectly at almost every moment with the American's invasion on this Pacific Island.I found "Saving Private Ryan" to be more of a tightly wrapped package, with it's character driven plot and a very different film confined to certain constraints; it does let loose, but is so much more the emotionally manipulative film. "The Thin Red Line" has its characters more as heralds of emotions and states of mind. No it wasn't the gore extravaganza that war films tend to be, but it rather uses war, WWII in particular, as a vehicle to show what happens when morality collides with life and death. (By the way, it did win it's share of awards, just not the ones that Hollywood tends to pat itself on the back with... :P ).</fullReview>

I like this movie and I liked the book as much as Catch-22. It destroys every illusion of a glorious, theatrical war. The frequent celebrity casting might be distracting, but the realistic action sequences and cinematography are absolutely stunning. For anyone who wanted to gauge the deeper psyche of fighting men, from the petty ambitions of the officers to the fear and self-sacrifice of the NCO's, this is the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film with potential, ruined by sloppiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, I thought this movie was going to be good. Then as I watched for awhile, my brain was twisted into a mush by the nonsensical rantings of the narrators. Sometimes it was deep in thought and helped along the mood, but other times it was completely uneccesary, and didn't make sense. I consider myself as a pretty good movie analyzer, and I couldn't make sense of a lot of things. Sometimes the movie just became slow and dull and didn't keep me captivated. All you beatniks out there can say what you will about it being deep and portraying the human emotions, and how man copes with is environment, but you don't have me suckered. I like a deep movie that takes a lot of thought, but no matter how much you think, insanity does not make sense. I give this 6/10 for effort and because I like war movies. P.S. George Clooney was in the movie for not even 5 minutes. I was pleased</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is wonderful to see that Hollywood can still put out a movie like this, unlike the usual garbage it turns out. If you have an open mind and are not afraid to think during a movie, then this is for you. The imagery and insight into the minds of different soldiers is spectacular, and most scenes give a good idea to the "wrongness" of war-how it goes against nature. This movie also displayed how there is no good or bad side in war, that they are all a bunch of scared young men who are not exactly sure why they are involved in such madness. Most people canned this movie saying it's unwatchable, but Ill tell you that if you give this movie a chance and pay close attention to what it is trying to give the viewer, you will be in for a visual treat. And I am no Art "goon", I am just a 20 year old college student that actually likes movies that involve more then Jean-CLaude Van Damme kicking bad guys in the head. I liked the movie so much I bought it on DVD.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may not be what most war genre fans may be used to, or be expecting. It is not a film which splatters blood and guts from beginning to end, attempting to outdo each mangling and tearing of limbs with another more fantastic explosion of bodies. Some may find the story slow, others may think it is overly dramatic in its attempt to get into the minds of those participating in the war. But what it is overall is impressive, striking cinematography. Some of the images would be appropriate were they to be framed, and hung on the walls of galleries and museums. The words are thoughtful, poetically written, and the cast is a compilation of all-star actors. If you're looking for action and excitement... skip this film. If you're looking for an intelligent, visual essay on another side of war, you may find this film worth watching. My only regret is that I haven't seen the original in order to compare the two. That is my next assignment. 9 0ut of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on James Jones' novel, director Terrence Malick comes out to direct his first film in two decades. And he hasn't lost a bit of skill in that long absence. This movie is very poetic and show more than Oliver Stone's "Platoon", Samuel Fuller's "The Big Red One", and Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" did. The characters, Hans Zimmer's music, and John Toll's cinematography make this film one to cherish. There are strong performances given from Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Jim Cazeviel, Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin, John Savage, and so on. Nolte, Penn, Chaplin and Cazeviel stand out as the best. In my opinion, if "Shakespeare In Love" didn't win BEST PICTURE, this movie should have. Toll and Zimmer deserved Oscars for their efforts. Forget "Private Ryan", rent or buy "The Thin Red Line".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Plot Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if John Wayne and Oliver Stone had together made a film about the invasion of Guadalcanal? What would you get? Something like "The Thin Red Line."Or maybe something better--focus, cohesive plot, and characters worth sympathy. "Thin Red Line" has almost none of that. What *is* worthwhile is its dispassionate exam of the demoralizing; no matter how evil the enemy or how "good" the war, war is still hell. It is however a pity (and waste of talent) that combat's winnowing of the courageous and strong from the marching hordes of the average doesn't get across to us. Courage is instead mere naivete or disguised desperation, and strength a kind of inevitable brutality, and as interesting as all that might be by itself we still get a barely engaging story. Throw in a slew of sensual but too-vague flashbacks, battle scenes only above-average and an aftermath straight out of Oliver Stone of the capture of a Japanese base camp, and soon the demoralized characters demoralize the audience. This is no "Saving Private Ryan."Strong performances from all involved, especially from Penn and Nolte, and from Harrelson were it not for a role brief as a cameo, casualty of a weak plot. The lush scenery is a big help, too. Not much else does. And when it all ends, as the victors depart Guadalcanal and a job not very well done, it is more evaporation than ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line came out at almost exactly the same time as Spielberg`s Saving Private Ryan, and was therefore ignored by many. The Thin Red Line is directed with style by Terrence Mallick. It is a long movie(2h 50min)and sometimes it feels like its too long, but this movie is definetely worth your time. The Thin Red Line focuses(unlike Saving Private Ryan) more on characters and less on spectacular war-scenes. But both movies are great. But I must mention the spectacular orchestral soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. This is one of the best music I`ve ever heard in a movie, and really makes the movie more atmospheric. (The German documentary "das dritte Reich in Farbe" used the same music). 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my mind of likes and dislikes this film is the exception to the rule that whichever version of something you see first, you will like better. After seeing this movie I rented the 1960s version, which now ranks as my favorite war movie. This new version is too surrealistic, and slowly glides from one confusing scene to another. This movie is like a long blur, and even by the end I couldn't tell one character from another. The advantages of this version over the old version: Vivid color over black and white, more detail (One scene has some P-39 Aircobras in the background on what I take to be Henderson Field), and a better diologue between Captain and Colonel when the former is relieved. However, despite these advances, I think the original will be far more enjoyed by the average filmgoer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE POETRY OF WAR.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A review that i read recently pretty much sums up the difference between Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line: "SPR" is the prose of war, "TRL" is the poetry. This film throws us numerous characters and relationships in the nearly 3 hours it runs. We meet Witt and Welsh, a private and sergeant, who argue about heaven, hell, and all in between. The characters Capt. Staros and Col. Tall are introduced to us. The former refuses to send his troops on a suicidal mission ordered by the latter. We see a father-son relationship between Colonel Tall and Captain Gaff, the colonel's protege. Through flashbacks, we view the love between Private Bell and his wife back home. These friendships/conficts are the core of the film. Unlike "SPR", which brilliantly revolved around the blood and bullets, "TRL" revolves around heart and soul. There are numerous religious references, as well as metaphors and hidden messages throughout The Thin Red Line. Some obvious ones are Witt's life displayed throughout the film (childhood on the island, growing with the troops, realization of purpose of life, death, "reincarnation" as child on island)and the idea that Witt is some sort of savior (sacrificed life for others, healed wounded). well, on the scale on 1 to 10 (10 being the highest):plot: 5 script: 8 acting: 8 cinematography: 10 direction: 10 music: 6 (not a huge factor in film, though)OVERALL: 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film disappointed me. It felt incomplete. Partly, I think, because I never identified with any of the characters. Sean Penn's character came closest, but still no cigar. No character was allowed to develop enough. This must have been deliberate as the director had 3 hours to do it in. The film felt like an attempt to recreate the impact of Apocalypse Now, while deliberately omitting Martin Sheen's character.If you are going to make a film without a traditional storyline, then at least give the audience something else.Also, when I see any film described as a 'visual masterpiece' I immediately think of David Lean. Visually, Malick's film cannot be compared to Lean's epics.(Now I think about it, the character Witt reminded me a little of Dr Zhivago - in the way he manages to appreciate beauty despite the human tragedy being played out all around him.)At times the film did work for me, Cusack's cameo, the emergence of Ben Chaplin's 'inner resolve', Nolte's performance. But in the end the film always lost its momentum with either a clich or by just having the character disappear altogether.Oh, and John Travolta was laughable.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Speilberg's Pallid Simulation of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although some prefer the big budget simulations offered by Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line offers a much more subtle and thoughtful, if not always successful, alternative. As a historian, I would suggest that "simulations" of War or Holocaust will always fall flat, because they cannot hope to match the shear enormity of the experience. Saving Private Ryan encourages us to identify with the characters and their situations, and in the end fools us into believing that we actually understand what it was like at D-Day, while in fact simply reinforcing familiar myths and preconceived notions of war. In essence I would argue that Saving Private Ryan fails for the very reason we think it is good, because it fools us into believing that it is "realistic" and thus we are now drawn to it as initiates in the sacred knowledge of war. The Thin Red Line is not a grand simulation, a heroic tale, or yet another ode to the "Greatest Generation." Rather, it is a poetic piece suggesting the irreconcilable differences between life/humanity and war. On the surface it is rather a conventional and familiar narrative--capture the hill against impossible odds-- but the actual underlying story is one of escape. In fact many different very personal escapes from military situations which ask men and women to sacrifice their morals, their consciences, their lives, their careers, their singular happiness. This film is not always successful... the Notlte role, while a crowd-pleaser-is a bit broad--and the screen play is at times uneven, but it is a rare case of a truly ensemble cast, devoid of the usual overblown characters, bad accents etc. In particular, the actor playing Witt is superb. The broader public will always prefer the easy flattery of Saving Private Ryan, which makes everyone feel in control and knowledgable.... I would rather suggest a more difficult, but more fruitful path. If the the Thin Red Line still falls short, it is already miles ahead of the pallid simulations</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film set out to convey the realities of war then it did so successfully, for war is 95% boredom and 5% dread and fear. In my case I dreaded that the film would never end. Like many films these days the dialogue largely consisted of indistinct mumblings and mutterings that hindered instead of helping the plot, and it needed all the help it could get. The cinematic photography was excellent but surely a movie is not just a visual experience? The mood was overwhelmingly sombre. War is no laughing matter but soldiers develop a black sense of humour to cope with the stress of combat. The only humorous touch appeared at the beginning of the film when the native walking in the opposite direction exchanged a disinterested glance with the soldiers, and I'm not sure that this was intentionally funny. The director only conveyed a one-dimensional image of war like a piece of "performance art" projected onto a screen - a series of stills instead of a moving image. Only Nick Nolte's acting saved us from a living death. A disappointing effort that could have been so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think thin red line is not a good movie but might be a good book. A movie should mainly use the actor(actress)'s body language including the action, the countenance and so on to express the main idea. This movie didn't make good use of the body language. Instead, there were long long monologues of what the soldier thought about the war, lots of suspicion in mind.I think it was poorly directed and the script was terrible. I wonder what on earth the director wanted to do by the combination of the fighting scene and the peaceful scene. Only to let us see how bad the war was and how peaceful life they could have enjoyed?I have watched it twice and I just couldn't get the whole story line. There were too many similar characters. I mean these guys looks so similar that I couldn't even tell who is who. And I think the story itself is not attractive.Obviously, it is an anti-war film. However the director didn't do well enough to make you feel the horror of the war. Compared to the bloody, horrible and touching 20 mins scene of the landing in Saving Private Ryan, scenes in Thin Red Line are simply not touching enough. At least, Spielberg's twenty-minute-scene really gave me a feeling that I had been right there. It told me how cruel the war could be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame so many people seem not to get this film. It's a shame so many of them need the pedestrian symbolism and manipulative direction of Spielberg to tell them how to feel. It's a shame that at the end of the Twentieth century many people still believe that WWII was fought by John Wayne, rough and tumble cowboys who could kill a whole enemy infantry like they were swatting flies. To knock a film like The Thin Red Line yet embrace Saving Private Ryan should insult anyone with a conscious, anyone with a family member who fought and/or died in any war. To say that the soldiers were not disillusioned while fighting in WWII is a grave misstatement and an oversimplification. Don't tell me for a second that those who died in the South Pacific or Europe did not regret their decisions. Don't tell me those who died left this world with brave or poetic last words, lauding their God and Country. The Thin Red Line shows war as continual, frightening, confusing. Saving Private Ryan had its Tom Hanks leading the way to save some anonymous Ryan, oblivious to the fact that there was a war raging all around them and the fate of the world was still up in the air. Remember, D-Day was the turning point, not the victory. The Thin Red Line shows us that little Ryan would've been marched to his death as quick as anyone else, no man was more important than victory.To call WWII the last good war feeds the propaganda and lies that have survived in our culture since Pearl Harbor. Maybe that's why The Thin Red Line was overlooked by so many. It is an honest contemplative look at war, realistic and not as pedantic as Saving Private Ryan. It does not break the world into Good Guys and Bad Guys. Instead it shows us the haunting similarities between soldiers on both sides. While there is absolutely no question in my mind WWII was necessary, to simplify it to the standards of a Hollywood movie cheapens what was really lost. In war, there is the "us" and "them" mentality, but don't forget that regardless of side, they all died the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this film for the second time, recently, I still have mixed feelings over it. It certainly has magnificent scenery and camerawork which results in some very vivid images. While Saving Private Ryan took a view of war through the eyes of the ground troops, TRL seems to be seen through the eyes of an all seeing angry god (to put it pretentiously). I liked the fact that the film addressed the effects of war on the natural environment and displayed interactions between the soldiers and the local wildlife (snakes, bats, alligators, dogs, etc.). I liked that the Japanese weren't just depicted as stereotypes (although, they may have been portrayed a bit too idealistically). I liked the performances of James Caviezel (who reminds me of the young Monty Clift) and Elias Koteas, in particular. On the down side, Sean Penn was a mass of mannerisms and gelled up hair. Nick Nolte and John Savage overacted themselves into the realm of parody. John Travolta was extremely awkward and unconvincing as a navy admiral. Other cameos, such as those by George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, etc. were just distracting and, rather than draw you into the movie, just reminded you that it was another "hollywood" production. Plus, the film never got you emotionally attached to any of the characters. Even after seeing it a second time, I could still never identify any of the characters by name. None of the deaths were as emotionally wretching as that of the medic, Wade, in Saving Private Ryan. The Zen philosophy of the voiceovers may have worked for one or two of the characters, but I can't believe that the majority of soldiers think like that under fire. Overall, while the scenery is best seen on the big screen, I think the movie is easier seen on video- where you can fastforward past some of through some of the dreck and performances and get to the best moments of the film. I'd be interested in hearing what an actual veteran of the Pacific thinks of TRL. Overall, I must say that, despite its flaws, I think that Saving Private Ryan is still the WWII movie to beat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full of rich imagery and detail, Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line is one of the finest movies ever made. The movie is gripping and poignant, anyone who says its boring and defends that by saying "I got the point" is missing the point. The Thin Red Line is not a lesson to learn, it is a moment to experience, offering the viewer a chance to make his or her own insight. Because of the subject matter and the time of the release, The Thin Red Line begs comparisons to Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, so I'll tell you, The Thin Red Line is far better then Saving Private Ryan. The Thin Red Line derives its power from characters, not graphic violence. Violence is cheap. It seems that Steven Spielberg nailed every detail recreating the carnage of D-Day, that was his goal, the next step was to come up with a silly plot, then the step after that was to come up with a set of cliche laden characters to carry out the plot to show the violence. Life-like characters and scenes take precedence to life-like violence in Malick's film. The acting is stellar, Woody Harleson, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn (perfect cast), Ben Chaplin, John Cusack, Elias Koteas as well as many of the Japanese actors are all outstanding. The only one out of place is Sergeant McCron (horrible performance by John Savage) who is wildly over-the-top in a movie where everything is so beautifully understated. Fortunately he is only in a couple minutes of the movie. The stand-out is no-name James Caviezel who is stunningly brilliant as Kentuckian Private Witt, who speaks volumes with his face alone. This movie is very intelligent, more so than I can fully grasp, but don't watch it thinking that there is some hidden message you have to discover that most Hollywood movies would pummel you with using every cheap sentiment trick. Simply involve yourself in this movie and soak up every image and emotion and when the final credits role and you listen to the Guadalcanal natives singing, you will have appreciated and enjoined a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film shows us the horrors of war and voice overs. The uneven pacing of this film is probably it's worst enemy. When this movie is good, underscored by unbelievably good performances by Nick Nolte and Sean Penn it's excellent, but it gets brought down in endless scenes that come out of nowhere with the camera focusing on a leaf in the middle of the battle. Perhaps this is how real battles are fought, but it makes for a lousy movie.Despite these problems, the director has given us some excellent portions with some long overdue portrayals of the Japanese both in defeat, victory and madness. And the battle scenes are as good as anything that any other war movie could have come up with.With that said, The Thin Red Line is a very good movie, and a very entertaining rental.</fullReview>

It is my second best war film after "Platoon" and a close second at that. The characters understand that they are going to die. If not in war then somewhere else. Witt knows that, so he deals with it in his dream like manner. He has made his peace with dying. It is beautiful to watch, this calm portay of chaos. Not really an anti-war film but just a chance to show us how it should feel to die. Brilliant!</fullReview>

It's not that I disliked 'SPR', but this movie is just outstanding. Everyone should watch it because it is a great, dramatic piece of art. The history, the pictures, the expressions on the artists faces and the score just go so well together. I cried throughout the whole film, which, with this one, is nothing to be embarrassed about. I can only recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in watching a serious film on the subject of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War As Seen From the College Dorm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often a film is made which captures a few moments of experience from wartime, which conveys the sights, smells, and fears of those who have been touched by this unique human experience. And then there are films which just pretend."Thin Red Line" is one of the latter, it's the work of someone who is trying to imagine what he hasn't experienced and so we get a lot of water cooler philosophy. I wanted to like this film. The falseness of the premise, that soldiers, essentially, are walking philosophers, made that impossible.The number of muddled themes in this film, the nature of authority, myth of the noble savage, transported me back to some freshman room dorm. There's very little in the way of character or story which compensates for this falseness of premise.Those who want a feel for the life of soldiers might check out E.B. Sledge, "With the Old Breed", a memoir of Marines at Peliau, which is more cinematic than anything seen in this film. The tightness of relationships forged in combat comes through, the fear experienced is real, the horror of it all is palpable.I have a lot more respect for the other war film of 1998, Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan", because while that film had flaws it did have moments of real authenticity. Resisting the temptation to preach or choreograph in combat scenes, I think, should be a minimum requirement of modern war films.Those who enjoy water cooler conversation, who don't want to think "outside of the box" (the conceit of this film is astounding), won't know what they missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty of nature contrasts horrors of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regret listening to a friend of mine and not seeing this in the movie theatre. The cinematography and acting are incredible. Unlike most of the JOHN WAYNE style war movies, the soldiers in this film were flesh and blood human beings and not cardboard cutouts. This film was a artistic and though provoking approach to a war film. TERENCE MALICK contrasted the beauty of nature and the horrors going on within it's confines. PRIVATE RYAN was more or less a straight laced war film (and a fine one at that). THIN RED LINE goes for the art house crowd. In some aspects, it reminded me of EUROPA EUROPA, and some of the other WW2 era art house fare that has come out of Europe in recent years (ie. SOLDIER OF ORANGE). This is a beautiful film to look at. The jungles of Guadalcanal and their lush greens are eye poppingly beautiful. If you want a mindless war film with phony heroics and bad one liners check out MISSING IN ACTION 3. If you want something thought provoking (and when I mean thought provoking, I mean on a KUBRICK level) I highly suggest this film. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

This is Malick's best film to date (it is just as beautiful as "Days of Heaven", but less detached).On the surface, the film explores the philosophy of war and love. On a deeper level, it is also Malick's portrayal of Hollywood filmmaking and his relationship to it. Malick inserts himself as private Witt, the soldier who wanders off to look around at nature and natives; and as Fife, the corporal too thoughtful for the brutality that surrounds him.A dreamlike and beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it in our nature to destroy ourselves?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first line of The Thin Red Line says it all: "What's this war at the heart of nature." This movie is an excellent war film, but it is much more than that -- it grapples with questions of morality, divinity, mortality, and love.The main question of the movie (many questions in this movie but little answers, which is great -- leaves the audience to solve them) deals with the nature of war: Is it in our nature to destroy ourselves? Does nature destroy itself intentionally? ("Why does the land contend with the sea?"; "Nature is cruel, Starros, look at the way the vines twine around these trees, devouring everything.") Does nature want us to destroy ourselves through war? ("Does our ruin benefit the Earth?") Essentially the soldiers ask, "is there any purpose to the madness of war?" "If there is a higher power, and he's (or she's) truly divine, couldn't he put a stop to it, and if he doesn't maybe he has a reason, maybe there's a purpose to it -- but what?"Another interesting question put forth by this movie deals with how humanity has separated itself into different cultures. Pvt. Witt, when he looks at the natives in New Guinea, sees a life, a peaceful life, he wants to be a part of but realizes he never can (like when he went AWOL among the natives and was later captured and made a stretcher-bearer). This is very evident when native woman he was nonchalantly talking to while he was AWOL told him she was scared of him "because he looked army."At first he sees these people as "pure" because he thinks they don't engage in serious conflicts; he sees them as basically almost existing in a utopian society. But later, when he goes back to a native village, he realizes that they have problems, too, after seeing two native men engaging in a serious argument, a child with boils on its back, and a row of skulls in a hut. They have problems, but on a smaller scale and they're as close to nature as you get, so maybe, just maybe, the whole war is a part of nature -- but why?"We were a family, how'd it break up and come apart so that now we're turned against each other, each standing in the other's light? How'd we lose the good that was given us, let it slip away, scattered and careless? What's keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory?"Why can't nature be divine, why can't we be divine? How'd we separate ourselves? What's the purpose of this war?As you can see from the previous quote, much of the dialogue in this movie sounds like poetry. This is a movie you can put in the VCR (don't get me wrong, the camera work is great) and use as background noise because the characters have so much to say, and they do so very eloquently. Unlike most war movies, which usually have a single or no narrator, pretty much every main character has something insightful to say.I have not even scratched the surface of this movie. It has so many questions to ask and things to say. Basically, the bottom line is: If you're a teenage Rambo fan, you'll be disappointed, but if you liked Platoon and don't mind a little bit of poetry, you'll love The Thin Red Line -- and that's the bottom line.By the way, when you first watch TRL, you'll most likely think Pvt. Witt (who is my favorite character) is the main narrator, but this is not so. In reality the most insightful of the bunch is Pvt. Train (he's the big blond guy), who will probably seem the shallowist out of all the characters on your initial viewing, but he actually asks most of the important questions about the nature of god and the nature of nature and the nature of man:"Darkness, light, strife and love, are they the workings of one mind? The features of the same face? Oh my soul, let me be in you now, look through my eyes, at the things you made."I really liked Saving Private Ryan, but I loved TRL -- it should have got best picture, but unfortunately it came out against stiff competition and good marketing by Speilberg.</fullReview>

For example, showing a dying baby bird, water running down a leaf, flashbacks to childhood, being able to hear the character's thoughts, musical score, and the juxtaposition of other images. I felt he was trying to create another 'Apocalypse Now'.However, don't compare this film to 'Saving Pvt. Ryan'. Compare it to 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Pvt. Ryan' to 'The Big Red One'.After my first viewing, I give 'The Thin Red Line' a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The timing of this film's release is unfortunate. Those that do remember it seem to consider it the "other" 1998 WWII film. Had it been released a year earlier or a year later it might have been given the recognition it deserves. I haven't been as affected by a war film since Platoon.First, let's get the nitpicking out of the way. I found the cameos distracting, as only a few really matter to the story. I also found it difficult to keep a few of the characters straight as some look very similar. These are really the only gripes I have.The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, maybe the most stunning visuals I've seen in a film. I missed it in the theater but have a large TV and home theater system, and with the lights off it is an amazing visual experience. The score is also among the most fitting and beautiful I've heard. It swells and flows with the story perfectly. The story itself was so involving I did not notice the film as being as long as it is. I won't give out any details about the story, but somehow it manages to explore the natural world, the nature of man, and the nature of war simultaneously. There are scenes of incredible natural beauty, quiet inner dialogue, and some of the most intense battle scenes I've ever seen - as intense as anything in Platoon and Saving Private Ryan.Buy or rent this film expecting an experience, not to find out whether Private Ryan is the better film, or in search of an exciting depiction of battle. Just turn down the lights and set aside a few hours to experience it. I found this to be a much more memorable film than I had expected. Maybe the best war film I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently reread Norman Mailer's "The Naked and the Dead", though I have never read the Jones novel on which this film is based. But the style and subjectmatter are very similar. Some of the plot lines I had trouble following and some of the dialogue was difficult to pick up. Subtitles would have helped me understand some of the sequences with the Japanese. Also, I would have preferred fewer celebrity bit-parts - I didn't listen to Travolta's lines since I was checking the credits to ensure he was actually in the film. Like the original Mailer book, this movie reminds us very effectively of the terrible suffering by men in the infantry in ground wars. In recent years it has not been politically correct to recognise this. Yet it is inevitable that, whenever some foreign group's men become aggressive and expansionist, good local men suffer. And, in the past, they have suffered most and in greater numbers, than the women and other minorities whose contributions we applaud today.</fullReview>

Apparently I hadn't paid attention while making a choice at the videostore and got caught by something completely different. This movie shows how I always thought war would be like when you're actually fighting in it. It shows the constant fear whether you'll live through the next moment. The disorientation of being in an hostile environment. The atypical behavior (or is it precisely typical) you develop in that environment. The doubt of what you are doing is right of wrong. Being almost delivered up to the mercy of higher ranking officers with ambitions, who will gladly give up your life to reach their goal. All this is brought to you by the random thoughts of the individual soldier. The casting adds to the feeling of alienation: big names that are almost anonymous in the crowd of "war-meat" and live and die just as the rest. In essence it's about the risk of loosing you're humanity. And what's the purpose of it all? As Sean Penn states at one point: "It's all about property", which - to my opinion - is basically true.</fullReview>

If this film had come out five years from now or five years ago, it would have been better accepted.If this film could just be given a chance to stand on it's own and be judged on it's own cinematic merit, it could be recognized as a classic film.The camera work is absolutely breathtaking. Like many Kubrick films, every single frame of this movie can stand alone as a beautiful still photograph.Some people complained that this film is over-long. Yes the film is very long indeed, but it needs that length to convey the sense of hopelessness and bravery without manipulating the viewer. It's called subtlety, a word Oliver Stone can not pronounce. I found this film to a brilliant piece of cinema-literature that should be looked at more closely so it can be truly appreciated for the genius that it truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe me, I have been threatened with death for completely "missing" the point of this film. It is absolutely one of the most breathtakingly beautiful films in terms of photography, editing and marriage to music. Technically speaking, it is certainly worthy of the tremendous praise heaped upon it. However it is one of the most pretentiously dull films I have ever seen. I find this film neither profound or original and if Terrance Malick wishes to make "art" as he obviously does, he must either say something that has never been said before or he needs to say something old in a way that hasn't been approached yet. I'll give him credit, he did achieve that with his earlier films. The concept that war is a meaningless waste, dehumanizing and evil in its destruction of the natural world is something every human being should already know. If Malick's objective is to teach those souls who are not aware of that reality, then he needs to make a vehicle that is more accessible to the masses. If no one understands your point, then why make something. This film is about alienating the audience, and call me old fashioned, but film and theatre are about forming a sembiotic bond. Every symbol in this film distanced me and allowed me to care very little about the outcome of the narrative. And I must admit, feeling distant about the scared young men on both sides who had a job to do in that war is a dangerous thing. Malick's script is not original in any way, in fact it is frequently nothing more than watered down Steinbeck. Buddhist tome poems make for great poetry, they don't automatically make great films. If Malick desired to make a statement, I recommend he spend much more time with Kurosawa that master of philosopher, artist and entertainer. Should the film be watched? Most certainly but since art is ultimately a personal reaction, this is mine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll agree with the haters, who thought this was a boring, nonsense drag, when i first saw it.But if you would only give it another chance, It would soon sink into you, as it did me. The Thin Red Line turns out to be a masterpiece. Gripping the true viewers who look at movies for a reason. I'll agree with the commentators here at IMDB that say it's at the same wavenlength as 2001:A Space Odyessey. First off, pvt. Train(!) is the main narrator of this movie! Not Witt! If you don't believe me, put your CC (closed caption) on and see for yourself. The main question of the picture, I believe, is that War is capable of destroying all that God has given us, but why? Thats the reason why you see the beautiful landscapes, exotic animals, etc. Of course it goes further than that, Showing what man can go through. Man has the emotions. As Col. Tall (Nick Nolte in a perfect performance) says "Nature's cruel, Staros" giving the backbone of what is going on. Yet the soliders in Charlie Company show you what goes on in their minds: "I killed a man, worse thing you can do..."You are my sons..."Who are you to me?...Nothin""Shut up in a tomb, can't lift the lid....""Be with me now..." Add all this with the excellent cinematography plus Hans Zimmer's gorgeous score and this is a great film. This is one that i won't ever forget. Like I said before, please check this one out. Even a forgettable character like pvt. Train plays a huge part in this. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this rather poetic piece of art a few days ago I must say I'm truly amazed. Being unfamiliar with the previous works of T.Malick after these three hours I can't wait to experience the other two of his name.The absolute moment after I had seen this movie I was truly overwhelmed by its philosophical power, the brutal honesty and the visual poetry. This is one of those masterpieces where your emotional eruption in the end speaks for itself and the analysis is being done only to explain your love for this piece upon others. All through this film I felt as if I was somehow brought beyond my physical restriction. Its visual poetry was beyond powerful, as the characters' either minted nostalgia or futuristic longing. The film itself was simply an epoch of life. As it circles. Eternal. In the horror they were all thrown inside no one could possibly avoid the confrontation of themselves, the confrontation of life itself. Whatever belief they possessed before the war, the one thing they all had in common, both American and Japanese soldiers, was the simple fact that they were all the features of the same face, all the workens of one mind. Everyone is a part of everyone, everything a part of everything.</fullReview>

I've heard the debates surrounding this film (too long, slow, not in-depth enough with all the characters)--and none of it really means anything, because you cannot compare this film to others. Please see this film--and try to watch it uninterrupted, to get the full experience. On a final note-the score by Hans Zimmer is one of the most moving I've ever heard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Earth's Great Treasures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few films that actually has the power to change the way one thinks and goes about his or her life. It certainly has all the philosophical weight of Kubrick's best films, coupled with Malick's own unearthly wizardry at making nature a living, rippling, beautiful beast. Malick certainly reaches a creative bit of transcendence here, as this film has a narrative structure somewhere between BADLANDS and DAYS OF HEAVEN and really seems to go beyond anything that DAYS even touched. As for its sad comparisons to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (which was NOT an anti-war film,) they should be written off. SPR can't touch this work; it's in a different league, made for different people. THE THIN RED LINE spares no expense and really paints a complete picture of existence on this planet in the WWII macromicrocosm. The final shot is one of the best, most piercing, most life-affirming pieces of art ever. I get teary just thinking about this film. I just wish it, along with 2001, would have a shrine in which they could be shown all the time. If Malick makes another film, I fear he might simply implode in an infinitely small, dazzlingly bright explosion of pure art. If I could save five films for the post-apocalyptic world, this would be one, along with 2001, DR. STRANGELOVE, ROUGE. . .and BIODOME. You know. For like, instructions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and Realistic WWII Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a gritty and realistic WWII drama that is among the best WWII movies ever made. It's about a battle for an unknown hill protecting a Japanese airfield on a remote Pacific island.Director Terrence Malick divides his film into three parts. The first deals with the hours preceding the battle and shows how the individuals are dealing with the rising tension. The second, the battle itself, contains some of the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed. The final part deals with the aftermath of the battle and its effects on the survivors.Nick Nolte, in one of his best performances, heads a large cast as the commanding officer of the company of infantry who sends wave after wave of soldiers into a seemingly suicidal battle. Elias Koteas also stands out as the beleaguered captain forced to carry out Nolte's orders. "After 15 years, it's my first war" Nolte tells him.Sean Penn, billed over the title, does not dominate the film as he usually does, but instead effectively underplays his role as one of the platoon sergeants. Several recognizable stars appear in featured roles and cameos. Among them, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, John Savage, George Clooney and John Travolta.Although almost three hours in length, believe me you will not notice the time. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No movie can convey the way war looks, feels, sounds, you get the idea. If you want a movie that conveys the horrible sights of war, do see Saving Private Ryan. The Thin Red Line actually penetrates life beyond the realm of war. I like it for that reason exactly. It ties war to some of the most intense philosophical questions while using a decent superficial plot to entertain those with elementary school mentalities. It does not lack humor, although much of it may only be funny if you see where the writer is coming from. I noticed many people gave this one a "1" for a rating. Trust me, the average IQ of those people mirrors that rating. Overall, a superb film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah I saw this one, back in January-and must say that I liked it quite a bit-especially two parts. The long march up the hills, in the foliage and greenery, where the fighting is sudden, sharp and savage. I think this is as good as any of the 'Private Ryan' sequences, save for the opening Landing stuff we all know is a classic. And the attack through the Japanese camp is well handled too. Nolte and Cusack do well with their roles.But I had trouble sorting out some of the guys-Chaplin and the one who gets the 'Dear John Letter', among a couple others. Malick spent too much time with the Philosophic nattering and scenic shots-some of which were great but went a Lonnnng way by hour #3. The movie could use better focus and spent more time on the guys who went up the hill, Woody Harrelson and Cusack and co. It's just something that I found confusing as watching this, and wished they'd fixed before releasing it.But still, it is quite a film, Malick was nominated for best Director and the movie for Best Film. While I can't rate it over Ryan because the way it loses focus, neither am I slamming it-I enjoyed Thin Red Line, and agree with some of the others here-it has a Kubrick feel to it, doesn't it?Here's my rating-*** outta ****, good stuff over all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that will challenge you. It is a haunting epic of the confusion created in the thick of battle. It is a tragic tale of a city ripped to pieces by the american war. It is a tale of a maddening captain and the troops he ships out to fight as though they were just meat popsicles. It is the story of a man, unwilling to kill, who finds the courage to be a hero in his own mind. It is the story of a man, hardened by war, who learns to love his fellow man. It is a journey of a young boy out into the gaping maw of certain doom, and how he survives it.Terrence Malik rivals his first movie (Badlands) with the most certain movie ever made about what war is like. Unfortunate for the critics and american public, that this Oscar nominated film be tossed aside in View of the most violent anti-american film ever made, Saving Private Ryan. (The point of Ryan confused me more, eight men die saving one? And thats courage?) And Maliks' sweeping camerawork and excellent eye for the big screen just enhance the feeling that you get while watching this film.Very much like 2001, Solaris, and Seven Samurai, The Thin Red Line uses the audience as one of the characters, not spoonfeeding the pre-teen generation their plotlines. And this is the quality we should start to see more often. Perhaps it was just not time for The Thin Red Line to prosper, but it will shine on long after Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love have faded away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voices From the Front</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is the most ambitious war film since Apocalypse Now. It is a complex web of voices from various people involved in the Guadalcanal invasion in the Pacific during World War 2. It is brutal and beautiful. It is real and fanciful. It is a tremendous accomplishment for 2 hours but it lasts 45 minutes longer than that. Written and directed by Terrence Malick, much of the story is poetry, dreams and beautiful photography of native peoples in gorgeous countryside. But there is a war here with the beauty and it is shown in all its horrible brutality. And under all this, the politics and ambition of the officers in charge is shown making and resisting brutal decisions. All of this flows together giving a bit of the experience of this war.Looking at all of this, The Thin Red Line is an incredible juggling act but sadly after 2 hours the story loses its way. Once a main character finds out that his wife wants to leave him, the flow of the story stops. The plot stops, we no longer know how current scenes fit with the beginning and middle of the movie. This main character who beautifully dreams of his wife, comments on war, life, humanity is the heart of the film. Without him the film limps along at the end left with disjointed thoughts and images. The movie may be a half hour too long (the thoughts of the characters become repetitive and artificial after a while) but I would not have a clue about how to end it sooner because there is no real ending, it just fades away.The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan both ambitiously make comments on war. Yet for my taste they do not improve on Platoon or Apocalypse Now. For a World War 2 film it may be better to see something like Midway which plays the story straight and better represents a much more simple, trusting and patriotic time. In spite of my criticisms I recommend seeing The Thin Red Line because of its comments on love, life, death and brutality. It is a filmed poem for the most part that challenges the audience and that is quite a rarity with movies these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched The Thin Red Line with no expectations despite very mixed reviews from friends who had seen it. I was sorely disappointed.There are moments of genius - the attack on the hill is perfectly framed and filmed with excellent use of steadicam and soundtrack.However, the yearning to be much more than a good war movie led to ambiguity which served no purpose. I felt nothing for the characters in the movie which is key to listening to the complex narration with interest. The narration was too overblown for its own good and became grating.The use of big stars in cameos as officers was a good idea - charismatic generals or senior officers who are not core to the story. But by publicising the movie as having stars such as Clooney in it the "cameos" became laughable. Clooney appears in a brief scene where you do not even hear him due to narration. This was pointless.So, a film that has moments of genius but overall left me feeling disappointed and wishing I had spent the time rewatching Saving Private Ryan. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamy but confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked "The Thin Red Line" without really being drawn into it. It contains imagery that will stay with me for a long time, and it is a compelling depiction of the grinding journey of numerous characters through the invasion of Guadacanal. It is clearly a labor of love, and the effort shows. It contains a stellar cast that includes Sean Penn, Stanley Tucci, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, with a walk-on role by George Clooney. These are the strong points.The movie opens with two soldiers that have found an island paradise and are living amongst its peaceful inhabitants when they are picked up by a passing battleship and arrested for going AWOL. They are dropped into a battalion that is storming Guadacanal in a crucial battle for territory. Leading the troops is a zealous commander played by Nolte as a man driven by what he perceives as fate and leadership, but is hiding deep-seated insecurities beneath the surface. The movie basically follows this invasion from beginning to end, and depicts the randomness in which the characters live or die during it.I mentioned before that there were numerous characters. I should say that there seem at times to be dozens that the film follows from beginning to end, and I frequently had trouble telling them apart. Although I have little doubt the novel the movie is based on follows the same structure, I think the film could have benefited from some strategic trimming to focus on a smaller group. I could not really identify with the characters since there were so many the movie is forced to jump from one to the next so rapidly I often didn't realize it had changed scenes. We see one guy crawling through the grass and then later another guy, cut to so quickly it seems like the same guy.The movie will undoubtedly suffer comparison to "Saving Private Ryan", the other WWII movie released that year that won acolades for Steven Spielberg. That movie had a clear direction and a definite message, and it focused on a group of characters you could really identify with. Of the two, I prefer "Ryan" for the reasons I stated above.But "Thin Red Line" is worth seeing for its quiet moments of truth, and the way it convincingly displays the complete futility of war. As we watch men forced to climb through the tall grass up a long hill and get cut down by hidden enemy soldiers, we can see the senselessness of it all, the waste of life. It must be unimaginably frustrating to be ordered to take an action that you know will end your life and accomplish nothing, and be unable to protest.The movie, as I said, contains visuals that are striking. We see things from the soldiers perspective as they creep up the hills of Guadacanal to the enemy guns at the top. There are sunsets, and native children swimming in the crystal tides. There are closeups of captured enemy soldiers that express their fear and humiliation through their eyes.Perhaps the thing that will stay with me most is the music. Parts of it contain the clear voices of a Melanesian choir, and is as haunting and beautiful as any music I have heard in the movies. The film has a standard soundtrack that is worth its salt but you may consider springing for "Chants of the Thin Red Line", which contains exclusively Melanesian chants used in the film, sung by various choirs of the Blessed Islands."The Thin Red Line" deserves to be admired for its boldness in not attempting to be a carbon copy of so many other war movies, or a pale imitation of "Saving Private Ryan". It wants to be a dreamy overview of war in its own right, and it accomplishes that goal. Perhaps it is best to view it in the right mood and simply allow it to wash over your mind, and then remember the parts that struck you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw Terrence Malick's first film in 20 years and what can I say - unbelievable. We saw two war films come out in 1998, "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Thin Red Line". While most Americans were shocked by war yet fell in love with Spielberg's seemingly realistic approach to it, there were the select few, mainly filmmakers and critics, who saw something more special in Malick's film.I was like most Americans, captivated by such beautiful yet gruesome depiction of WWII that I was not willing to agree that any movie could be better. I watched in awe during the opening sequence as young, confident soldiers took the beach with their skills only to be shot down as quickly as they stood up. When I watched "Private Ryan" for the second time, there was something missing. The war looked real in the film. The performances were great. So what was it? Character development.I decided since I had lost my feelings for this "great" war film that I would check out the other war film of 1998. I was blown away. It had the feeling and emotion that I had only seen in one other film before - "All Quite on the Western Front." Terrence Malick created raw emotion or what I would like to call moving poetry. What kept people watching "Private Ryan" was the battles and how they looked through the viewer's eyes. But what kept people watching "Thin Red Line" was what went on through the soldier's eyes; what the soldier's felt in their hearts.I can't quite explain the raw emotion which I felt because I felt different about the film that my friends did. We all liked it, but each and every one of us became attached to one or another character for different reasons. For anyone who reads this, who is looking to get touched, check out this film. It is slow at times, it's not an action film. What it is though is a perfect example of seeing into a soldier's psyche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed how the movie really showed the power of the mind. In two aspects, the movie shows how war is not only risking one's physical health but also his mental health. You see this one soldier scared as hell, but soon war rubs on him and he gets crazy wanting to kill. But this movie also depicts how the mind can be powerful; it can save you. The mind manages to bring Private Bell to peace, tranquility, and serenity; it makes him hope. Out of all the horrors in war, Bell manages to use his mind to take him somewhere he wouldn't at that moment be able to go to.The movie also portrays the other minds of other characters. You are able to know what that character is thinking at that moment. This movie values the mind of each individual. Some terrific scenes that conveyed vast amount of emotions. 4 Stars.</fullReview>

Much of it was wasted with excessive, silent scenes presumably to convey mood, which did nothing positive. The dialogue was childish, the message of the movie a cliche. There was no real story line. The symbolism, if that's what there was, banal. This is an example of how Hollywood thinks that by pouring money into a movie and spending a lot on scenery and location, it can manufacture something out of nothing.

		<fullReview>Yeah, yeah, yeah.You`ve heard it and you`ll hear it again : "Why did this movie see no success while Saving Private Ryan did?".I`ll tell you why.This is a classic example of a great book gone bad on film - well, not necessarily gone bad - but gone wrong. Totally.First off; lousy casting.This movie is filled with famous faces under all those helmets, ringing Hollywood names, clean cut american jaws, real "jack n dianes" as Mellencamp would say.Clooney. Penn. Nolte. The list is endless.Why? Why? Why?Malick is pulling a Woody Allen here. Only - it doesn`t work.We see Nolte and we follow him, are moved and disgusted with him, feel for him, and loathe him. His performance is spell-binding. Definitely. The only high.As for the rest .... waste of ammo. Especially Penn - with high greasy surf hair - is tired, dazed, un-moving. Yawn.They all are. This is like sending the army of dead into battle.Or the Federation droid army from Star Wars Episode 1. Faceless and lifeless, the young men move in...THATS HOW IT WAS somebody`ll say. Well, maybe, in arts, but not in REAL LIFE.Malick`s move is intentional. He bombards you with symbols and metaphors (shots and stills of animals, the wives back in the US, scenes of the men swimming, smiling, living the Bounty life) trying to purvey that a soldier`s fear and questions of life need no messenger, they should be common knowledge. Rightfully so, only he forgets to make it at all interesting.We don`t care. This is Apocalypse Now Light. With extra sugar.We care for the boys in Saving Private Ryan (SPR) because they bleed, cry, scream, feel and MOST IMPORTANTLY talk and communicate like human beings - not like puppets on a string controlled by Malick.SPR brought war to the viewer, right up front. Now, this movie doesn`t have to do that at all. Only this movie tries to make us believe that the soldiers had James Joyce and higher philosophies of life on their minds every other minute as they crawled up hill in battle. It`s unbelievable, it`s too stuck-up.The tall green grass sways beatifully in many of the scenes where they try to take that hill from the Japanese, but you are left with the feeling of Malick asking for reshoots if the wind doesn`t carry the grass just to his liking, NO MATTER how well the actors just did their scene. Yeah, it`s nice camera work, but thats really a negative when your story is a no-story.Malick has heart, no doubts there. Only he needs to be able to communicate his visions much better.Cold and cool, the Thin Red Line is window dressing. A heavier, more beautiful version of Hamburger Hill - lacking the power of Platoon, the realism and in-your-face attitude of Saving Private Ryan, even the coolness and provocative nature of Full Metal Jacket and the drama and thoughtful, believable pocket-philosophy of Apocalypse Now.By-the-way : Watch out for John-I-Have-My-Own-Jet-Travolta in a horrible role as commanding officer aboard the hangarship in the beginning. He delivers a Pulp Fiction meets John Wayne version of old time Hollywood war movie commanders. With his "ain`t it cool" cigarete moves. Unwillingly funny, you`ll look away. Yuck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting is good. The cast is fabulous, the photography is great, and there are moments of nice dialogue. After the first half hour of the movie, although I know about Guadalcanal I failed to see what their mission was. Obviously to get up the hill, but why? Guadalcanal was not was not mentioned in the movie once. The book was about Guadalcanal. The movie is excessively subjective. As an adolescent I loved watching movies such as Fellini's Rome, and other movies that were primarily subjective and invent theories and dwell in the abstract. After years of graduate school and writing I have arrived at the conclusion that the more I know about a subject matter or a definition, the fewer words I have to use to describe them. This movie despite its good sides left me wondering why take so long to say whatever point there was to the movie. I hate to say it, but I think even war-buffs would want it to be more spelled out. If you in a stage in your life that you like to figure things out, even if it has to be discovered through guts and blood, this is a movie for you. I rather have the author lead me to where he wants me to go than to wonder on my own. I like theories but there must be basis for theories, and metaphors. A bunch of guys going in this uphill battle with no explanation of what they are doing is senseless. Could it be the point is that war is senseless? I just wondered! In Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Saving Private Ryan the audience knows what their mission is right away, not in this movie! I wonder if I could I get the point if I were to watch it several times and knew nothing about Guadalcanal. Maybe the dialogue would be clearer but just watching the movie in itself is not enough to go anywhere with it. If I have to read the book, and do research after I watch a movie, it means that the message was not clear in the movie. Movies are about story telling. If you cannot tell the story in a few sentences after you watch a movie then the movie fail to tell a story. This is the case at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The unique masterpiece had something to do with the silent movie classic The Big Parade (The walk in the woods) and some gems by the genius war movie director Lewis Milestone (human perspective of the soldiers.) I think Malick had made two of the best movies of the seventies : Badlands and Days of Heaven. The fact that there is 20 years between the last and this one made him some kind of a Jean Vigo American director. LikeVigo, Malick is a true poet and a great artist, dealing with all that movies is all about: images. Malick did Thin Red Line like Malick's other movies. This is a pure wonder for the eyes and the soul. Acting direction is also amazing and so is the wonderful music. I will never forget the fear in the eyes of the Japanese soldiers in this movie. At last, I can't understand why some people can write that this movie is bad. Go see something from Hollywood. I prefer true American cinema and The Thin Red Line is absolutely the best US film of the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone seems to have seen "Saving Private Ryan." Whenever I mention "The Thin Red Line." I often get the following responses "I heard it sucked." "It's self indulgent." "It didn't have a main character." "No one could figure it out." Needless to say, bad press can really kill a film. I was glad the academy was able to at least nominate it for an award but unfortunately the great power and popularity of Steven Speilberg just overwhelmed the public and put "The Thin Red Line" into obscurity. Terrence Malick is a genius. "Badlands and "Days of Heaven" were indications of his ability and "The Thin Red Line confirms it." The narrative style and lack of a central character are far from flaws. They are artistic techniques that unfortunately most of the public just didn't get. The cinematography by John Toll is spectacular and Malick's use of the visual metaphor is unparalleled. See it and you will believe it. The film is spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine piece of work, but rather misunderstood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard some people talk about the lack of continuity in this movie, the lack of time top billed actors had on-screen, and the incoherence of the movie. These were the three key components of the movie.Since when was WWII supposed to follow like a script? The war was a winner-take-all escapade in which many a man went in with no real sense of direction or understanding to get the job done. In TRL we can't expect things to follow one after another, because that's not how it was. Seeing this you should expect plot gaps, things left not understood, and many questions becaue to this day that's still how it is.This movie was set to bring out the high quality acting potential that resided in indie film stars. I can't remember the last movie I saw Elias Koteas in besides Crash. It was a nice change of pace to see very little of the headliners and more of the small actors taking the scene. Sean Penn was a crucial part to the cast however. We needed fairly unfamiliar people to present the monologues so we couldn't affiliate them with any other part than that of the soldier's they were playing. One couldn't look at Travolta in the jungle and not see him even just a little doing disco. The movie took unfamiliars and gave them a part.Lastly, the film's monologues were incoherent for a reason. While there were scholarly types drafter into the war, the majority of those who fought in WWII and tend to fight in many wars, aren't necessarily the most educated. The movie's primary characters were of great diversity, some well spoken and the others having trouble collecting their thoughts. This only added to the realism of the movie. We hear the thoughts of a man who can't always speak like the poet we wish to hear, he just speaks what's on his mind. We don't always speak like Walt Whitman to ourselves, so why should we expect a man in the heat of battle scared out of his wits to do the same?Bottom line for me is that this movie was superior. I found Ryan to be a quality film as well, but too Spielbergy and too focused. TRL doesn't centralize on a small group of characters, but covers a broad range of people and gives us insight into both sides of the war both Allied and Japanese. A definite keeper along with Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, and Apocolypse now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-war masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly the finest anti-war film I have ever seen. It is beautifully shot, daringly edited, extremely well acted, and philosophically challenging. Is the plot slow moving? Hell yes. So what? This film isn't about what happened in the battle for Guadalcanal. It's about the human and philosophical significance of man's warring nature. Just because its plot is de-emphasized in favor of character and theme does not necessarily make a film "boring." Certainly it doesn't in the case of The Thin Red Line. For me, the film's three hour running time passed in a flash. It was one of the most exciting films I've seen in a long time. Is the film "artsy"? If by that is meant "does it take risks in its narrative structure and in its handling of the film medium?", then, again, hell yes. And thank you Mr. Malick. Compared to this film, Saving Private Ryan is shallow drivel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How about a more accurate title like The Long, Long Red Line?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, what's with the casting? The cameos by George Clooney and John Travolta added nothing to the movie. And what the hell was Woody Harrelson doing in this? One of my biggest problems with Saving Private Ryan &amp; JFK was the gratuitous use of celebrities, such as Jack Lemmon &amp; Ted Danson, to fill minor roles. All this does is distract from the story and remind the audience that they're watching a movie. My second big problem with the movie was the "reflective" narration. It added very little and became tired and annoying very quickly. "Who are you to take so many shapes?" the voice asks. I felt like yelling "who are you to talk over the movie?". Finally, the movie was way too long. I was expecting a climax about thirty minutes before it actually came and by then my butt was sore and I just wanted to leave. On the positive side, very good performances by Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. Nolte, in particular, comes on strong as the grizzled army officer, passed over for promotion, trying to secure the island. Jim Caviezel gave a solid performance as the reflective private Witt (though, as I've stated, the reflections should have been left to the dialog instead of the irritating narratives). The cinematography was stunning. I especially like the soldier's eye, view of the grass blowing in the wind when you know the Japs are close by. Decent I guess but an oscar contender? I think not. Could have been much, much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a war movie buff, as am I, then I would definitely recommend that you see this film. My only caveat would be to rent it and watch it over the span of two nights. The reason for that is because the internal dialogue the soldiers are having with themselves during this 3 hour movie is a bit pretentious. Those slower moments are beautifully offset by the spectacular camera work, however, which accompanies those "Deep Thoughts".There were several scenes which struck me in a way that no other war movie has done. They were both combat and non-combat scenes, and the effect they had was to put me right there in that setting. The combat scenes as they are attempting to take a steep hill with hidden Japanese machine gun nests seemed exceptionally realistic. I felt as scared and confused as the soldiers. If you aren't into war movies, then I would pass. If you are willing to give a war movie a chance and three hours of your time, however, then I think you will find this worthwhile. I gave it an "8" out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I enjoyed this film and was at times quite moved by it, I am sad to say that I found it rather boring. I sincerely respect the message of the film and don't mean to imply that there wasn't enough "Rambo" sequences. Quite the contrary. It seems that viewers of war films have matured since the combat glorification of the Rambo and Chuck Norris tripe of the 80's.The message of this film (and obviously the recent "Saving Private Ryan") does indeed get delivered. But the delivery is via Pony Express rather than FedEx. It simply took too long for anything to happen. And it was not captivating enough to have the 3+ hours seem any shorter.While the acting was very good, I didn't see any career performances. We've seen all of these characters before in some form in a variety of other films. Some of the dialogue between characters seemed a little too "poetic" at times and not reflective of what my interpretation of real-life communication would be like in those circumstances.One aspect I found particularly interesting, however, was the display of fear shown by soldiers on both sides. This is more realistic rather than showing us the "bad guys" as evil and glad to be where they were shooting our "heros". There was the same fear and perhaps reluctance on both sides.To compare this film, as another reviewer has, to Lawrence of Arabia, All Quiet on the Western Front, etc. or to say it is among the top 20 films of all time is a more than a little overly enthusiastic.It was a GOOD film, with an important message that does EVENTUALLY get delivered to the viewer. That's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was this just a "property war"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew going in that Terrence Malick requires some patience and pondering. "The Thin Red Line" does meander, quite frequently. But, after seeing "Days of Heaven", I knew it was coming. However, I also expected some stunning cinematography. Obviously, again, I was not wrong. This picture is gorgeous, and one of the strongest aspects of the film is its underlying comparisons between what is natural and destructive. Throughout "The Thin Red Line" a viewer sees nature at its most precious, and the war destroying this environment. The gorgeous destruction of Terrence Malick's film is a powerful issue, as is the question of who and why this destruction exists. Since this film conveys heavy doses of fright and occasionally cowardice by the troops, the question appears, and its a powerful question. However, raised on the Vietnam films of "Platoon", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket", I can understand the insanity of it all. War is hell, to quote a phrase, and is obviously appropriate to condemn. However, is it truly appropriate to label WW2 as merely a "property war", as coined by Sean Penn's character? Wasn't WW2 a little more important and worthwhile than that? However, I digress. The performances of Nick Nolte and Sean Penn are exceptional, as is Terrence Malick's gorgeous attention to detail. However, the philosophies of this tale and Malick's explicit appreciation for nature downtrod the story at hand. This was also a flaw in the beauty of "Days of Heaven". And unfortunately, I was expecting this too! I will say that the first viewing was tedious and disappointing. However, this is a film that stays with you, and thus, I am sure that I will get more out of it after another sitting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes I can't understand what people are thinking. It's hard to imagine what sort of people nominated this film for Best Picture of the Year. After 2 hours, I had to turn it off, rewind it, and instantly bring it back to the video store. I went into this movie expecting way more than it delivered. I was expecting a war movie; what I got was half a war movie, and half a "bring back all the memories of my life before the war" love story. Tossing a few big-name stars in the mix didn't help either. Harrleson, Clooney, Travolta ... perhaps they thought these people would salvage the film.Nick Nolte was spectacular, however; his powerful performance was one aspect that made it slightly bareable. Aside from Nolte, I found myself dozing off many times.In my opinion, "The Thin Red Line" could have been so much better. It IS a shame, however, that 99% of the people watching this movie were comparing it to "Saving Private Ryan". This didn't help matters either.If you have $4.00 burning a hole in your pocket, rent it. But make sure it's on a night when there's something good on TV, because you'll find yourself switching it off to see what the Baywatch Lifeguards are up to.Rating: 1.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as bad as some said; It could of been trimmed by about forty fives minutes of all the nature scenery and monologues and it had potential of being great. But...this is the movie. It was compared to "The English Patient" by some palates, I disagree. Let's put it this way: "The English Patient" was a boring, contrived, pretentious little Romance flick and the characters (and concept overall) were despicable and uninteresting. "The Thin Red Line" was the opposite. While the pacing might of peeved some people, it was nothing like "The English Patient." Let me reiterate, "The English Patient" was just a bad, hyped-for-no-reason movie, this is not. If anything, this movie was underhyped. It was fascinating, and somewhat different. It wasn't an action movie (and it wasn't as great as Saving Private Ryan) but there was no yah-yah-yah Hollywoodness to the finale or even the film itself and it relied on the thoughts of these soldiers as a key premise. Who narrated each of these thoughts? That's not important. War is a scattered mess. Think of yourself as a confidante in this movie who knows how to read minds of all the characters; You hear their fears, emotions, what is worth coming back (home) to, even their destiny. It may not make sense, but they're not saying this, they're THINKING this. (A similar plot device in the powerful WWII movie, "A Midnight Clear"). These characters might have not been people to care for, but the depiction of their feelings was realistic and the atmosphere was very well done. Now I'll admit, some of the "insights" went over-the-top, and few nature shots went on too long. But it is worth seeing once, as long as you lower your expectations and don't expect a superficial Hollywood movie with lots of action and a big name cast.</fullReview>

I have never seen a film that depicted not only the terror of war, but the terror of the soldiers in that war. The only movie that comes close is All Quiet on the Western Front (actually, the book is about 3,000x better than either version I saw). Sean Penn is absolutely great, although I wish he had more of the insane character that Jones created in his book. The only complaint I really have is the scenes on the tropical island that just drag on forever. Don't get me wrong - I don't want nonstop action, but I wish those scenes maybe had been cut a little bit. That aside, I highly recommend this movie, a much more realistic WWII flick than Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a movie about war, per se. It's about the people that fight it, people just like us. It's about why we fight, about how meaningless war can be to one man but a code of honor to another. Some (in this movie) look at it as a way to glorify themselves, no matter what the cost. Others see it as constant fear and suffering. It depends on how high you are in the chain of command. Extremely effective voice-overs ask questions we don't usually verbalize--questions that usually remain as bothersome feelings from the subconscious. Also extremely effective musical score. None of that constant, pumping "Armageddon" rubbish that brow-beats us into making some kind of emotional reaction. Instead, the music in "Thin Red Line" complements the scenes. A great ensemble movie. Caviezel's facial expressions are dialogue in themselves. Admittedly, the movie has a slower pace, especially considering it's genre, but it builds slowly and quietly, in between the lines, until you're left with something quite beautiful. It ages on the screen like a fine wine and your left to drink it at the closing credits.</fullReview>

If you are expecting a constant assault of combat action, think again. What I believe you get is probably a very realistic impression of what it is like to be in the Army, to be by yourself yet with others, and scared to death during WWII. I watched it with my wife, and she asked me a lot of questions, since I used to be in the Army before I met her. With all the camera shots and lack of dialogue, I explained to her that that is what it is really like. You lay around a lot, hot and sweaty, and all you can really see is the grass around you, the bugs, the dirt, and the sky. I can only assume accuracy to a certain level, since I never had to face battle. You get a lot of time to think while you wait, and this movie showcases that thinking time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is a beautiful, shocking and tragic film about the futility of war and the hopelessness that the soldiers on both sides faced in the wake of Guadalcanal. Unfortunately, it is also a confusing mess of philosophy, poetry and disconnected images. The film could have been improved had Malick chopped off the last hour's worth of film and gotten rid of the pointless voice-overs--the same problem which plagued another of Malick's films, "Days of Heaven."The beginning of the film evokes an almost Biblical beauty with its images of a paradise and a people soon to be lost as the Japanese and Americans meet in combat. And once the film enters that combat, it can only be described as amazing. Even more than "Saving Private Ryan," this film shows how terrible and pointless battle can be. Men get shot down before they can even take a step forward, a soldier accidentally kills himself with a grenade, the enemy remains almost unseen until halfway through the film--and when we see them they are not die-hard Japanese troops but rather sad, tired and ragged men who are in a situation that is as hopeless as the Americans are. And even worse, Lt. Colonel Tall, played brilliantly by Nick Nolte, is obsessed with taking Guadalcanal at all costs, ignoring the concerns and needs of his own troops in the process. The relationship between Koteas' Staros and Nolte is well-developed throughout the film. And when the climax of battle takes place at the airstrip, the camera swirls around the confusing mayhem of soldiers fighting and cowering--the scenes are both awe-inspiring and terrifying at the same time.And had the film ended right after this point, it would have been perfect. But it just keeps going on and on, adding in useless bit-parts for actors like Clooney and shots that make no sense, while also spewing out more meaningless philosophical babble. Throughout the last half I kept screaming for the film to end, but it did not. And when it finally did, the last two or three shots seemed tacked-on--I would have preferred a last shot of the boat going away from the rock and then a fade to black.In the end, "The Thin Red Line," is three films in one. It is a stunningly realistic war movie, a colorful National Geographic documentary, and an inane romantic/philosophical tone poem. Taken together, the film falls apart--although it is a glorious failure. But had the first element stood alone, it would have been something truly special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to comment on The Thin Red Line. I personally did not care for the movie for a variety of reasons, all of which can be made out to sound like that was exaclty how the director meant it to be. For one; the directorial showing of the contrasts between the beauty of the land the soldiers were in and the horror of the war they fought. At first, I found this interesting and very well done. But the scenes kept happening. More birds, more sunlight through the leaves, more raining dripping... you get the picture. In fact, it is so abundant that a companion of mine said "are you sure we didn't pick up a documentary?". Another problem was that there was an extreme lack in the development of characters. This could also be put off to the reality of war, where you never know one sinlge person. But i found that without knowing the person, you didn't feel anything accept that some famous actor just bit the dust. No remorse over the character. Now, i loved Saving Private Ryan, and these are two very different films. But to even suggest that The thin red line is a superior film is to me completely without merit. Judge for yourself; The Thin Red Line is most definitely worth seeing, at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>starts slow, but becomes excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line begins slowly and not so auspiciously, but if you're willing to sit through the slow beginning, the rest is well worth it. At least it was for me. I found the beginning too slow, with too much voiceover, and I hated the John Travolta cameo. I thought he looked as though he had had a silly little mustache painted on and it bothered me. But once the soldiers got ready to fight, the film became excellent. It was beautifully, stunningly, brilliantly shot. The cinematography should be a paradigm for future cinematographers to study! The film gave an interesting perspective by seeing the men as one unit instead of developing specific characters and illustrated the bonds and ties they felt toward each other. So, I'd say, you need to be patient since the beginning is slow, but if you are, you will see one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ingredients are there.. maybe too few cooks spoil the broth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were times, while i was watching this film, that I thought it was going to break through into a truly great, cerebral and subjective perspective on War.. in a class with Das Boot. It somehow got a little too wrapped up in its poetic aspirations, though. The acting is very good, the cinematography is great, the characters are interesting and authentic, but somehow the chemistry just doesn't mix. A better editing job (shortening and simplifying it) would have helped, a more cohesive plot line focussed on fewer characters. The final scene of the defeat of the Japanese, showing them begging and pleading, looks ridiculous to anyone who knows of the grim and stoic determination of the Japanese soldiers in the Pacific theatre. It does, I think, capture the fog of war for the common grunt, its story line is not contrived like Saving Private Ryan, it really is an idea and film that could have worked, but missed..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>excellent, resonating movie. the polar reactions of hate or love to this movie definitely make the thin red line intriguing in itself. some movies gaining this reaction e.g. pulp fiction, fargo, 2001: a space odyssey, rushmore typically hold up under repeated viewing, and even turn some initial naysayers into fans. all these filmmakers had the guts to put out an unconventional piece of film, not visuals that shove emotion down our throat, waiting for us to say we're sorry and that americans are the only people that can supersede the evils of war (spielberg). film is an art, a movie is set up to entertain or inform. that's the main difference between "the thin red line" and "saving private ryan". art has to be carefully observed to see all the nuances, and when you gain a general understanding of a piece and what it means to the artist, you feel more deeply gratified. i've seen the movie twice, and found some different things that i missed the first time. don't get me wrong, i liked saving private ryan. the action sequences in saving private ryan have opened up groundbreaking possibilities in the action of the war film genre, similar to how star wars brought in special effects and style back in '77. but i've seen that twice too, and i think that's more than enough. usually spielberg movies don't hold up after seeing them a couple times. some people feel that star wars is the reason for the decline in the number of quality films, emphasizing eye candy and style over character development, existentialism, and human nature, which the phantom menace shamelessly does. whether saving private ryan does the same for the war film genre remains to be seen.</fullReview>

It shows more than just body counts to the audience: it show the destruction of the innocent human and animal life in the outlying areas of the battle.

		<shortDescription>Seems to be brilliant, but does not cross the "red line" of focus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, there comes a movie that seems to be absolutely brilliant, even amazingly original, and you get kind of ticked off when that brilliance passes you by. Stanley Kubrick's works always seemed to do that for me, along with a few other "artistic" titles that come to mind. It's almost eerie that Kubrick just passed away recently, because "The Thin Red Line" seemed to me to resemble something which Kubrick might have presided over. There are many fascinating sequences and exhilarating spots of cinematography in this new installment of the World War II genre, but a lot of tedious, meandering sequences and a combination of disorganized messages that drift into others, seriously clutter up the story. I could never fully understand what the movie was trying to tell me that was supposed to be the main message of the whole plot. The plot itself passes like a ship on an unpredictable sea, sometimes torrential in its action and suspense but also needlessly dry in other moments. If Terrence Malick's "masterpiece" has one major problem that I can definitely pinpoint, it would probably be its excruciating length. If it ran maybe 45-60 minutes shorter in duration, it might have worked as a tight and alarming picture of war. Instead, it dances around a lot of different meanings and areas of entertainment, from the deeply poetic to the engagingly violent and mysterious. I would like to point out one great performance of the film before I depart. Nick Nolte is one of those actors that takes his time between projects, but always turns out an interesting, if not always likable, character. His work in this entry is just great, a three-dimensional role that receives too little screen time. Call "The Thin Red Line" an epic that is reaching for brilliance and is grasping way too far. Go see "Saving Private Ryan" instead, and get a point and great dramatic strength, something in which "Red Line" falls a tad short. Rating: Two stars and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-Hollywood should have won Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always find that the least favorite to win the Best Picture Oscar is my favorite (ex. L.A. Confidential). When I saw Saving Private Ryan, I was blown away by the first 30 minutes, but I found the film following D-Day was just Spielberg succumbing to the typical Hollywood film - find a main character and follow him to the end of the film, with some big climactic battle thrown in at the end. I was so disappointed, but alas, Spielberg is the most commercial director of all, Hollywood's golden boy.However, seeing The Thin Red Line was incredible. It was very unlike a Hollywood film, with its heavy emphasis on ensemble. Using some stars and some non-stars was great. For example, in Saving Private Ryan, one would not expect Tom Hanks to die in the first five minutes of the film - he's the star. Not so in The Thin Red Line: in this film, everyone has an equal chance to die. I also loved how well directed the film was - The camera really circled the chaotic battle very well. I understand why people did not like this movie, a friend of mine told me (before I had seen it) that the first and last half hour was good but the middle 2 hours sucked. I understand how people feel, but I loved the middle - it really showed how a docudrama is to be directed, very similar to Roberto Rosselini's Rome:Open City and Paisan.I think that if you like war films, you will probably like this one, but keep in mind that this is a three hour movie. Personally, I can watch any movie, but if you're looking for a thought provoking and visually stunning film, this is a great choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's much-anticpated third movie measures up to the cinemaphotography standard set by his earlier films, but its philosophical musings are often inappropriately distracting. It has a dream-like quality that is entrancing, but at times at odds with the subject matter. Some sequences, such as the attack on Japanese bunkers on top of a ridge, rank among the best depictions of combat ever filmed. Mr. Malick is also to be congratulated on getting his details right: the aircraft shown at Henderson Field, for example, are the right types in the correct markings for the period.Overall, somewhat disappointing, but well worth seeing, and definitely superior to the much-ballyhooed "Saving Private Ryan", a movie that was badly flawed by sentimentality and predictable plot elements. There is no false sentiment in "The Thin Red Line".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason that Terence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" is so extraordinary is the fact that Malick took HUGE risks in his direction of this film and THEY PAYED OFF. This film is NOT for mass consumption. It is three hours long and extremely heady. But it conveys the terror of war in a way that I have not seen in any other film. Except for John Travolta's ridiculous 5 minute performance towards the beginning of the film, the acting is superb. Malick's use of inner monologues is earth shattering. The film is visually LUSCIOUS. To me, this is what filmmaking is all about. Be warned, this film is completely emotionally and physically draining. But the payoff is that you'll get to experience the most artistically brilliant film of 1998.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of war movies in my lifetime, but this is the first in which I really felt something for the people involved. True, all of the characters do not have a lot of screen time, and yes, it is also true that some big named actors play only cameo-type roles in it. But that does not destroy the fact that it is a deeply meditative movie. I personally felt that it went farther in the psychological aspects of war that "Saving Private Ryan" went into the emotional side of the war. If I had my way Jim Caviezel would have been nominated, at least, for his role as Pvt. Witt, as would Sean Penn for his role as well. I really do think that this is a movie for World War II what "2001" was for the question of, "Are we alone," etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best piece of advice I have for anyone who hasn't seen this movie is to not think. As an amateur war historian (the Pacific theater in particular), I was excited at the possibilities of the movie showing the "other side" of WWII. However, I was completely unprepared for the haunting and strange journey TTRL took me through. Tedious in moments, ultimately the work is one of poetry in film, not a pseudo-verite, like "...Private Ryan". Also, unlike the Spielberg film, there is no moral base; there is only the sense of continuity that, as the film shows, points humanity back to nature. If I were to compare this film, I would actually reference Spielberg's "Empire Of The Sun". Both films deal with ordinary people in extraordinary situations, grasping for some semblance of humanity, yet never shying away from the elemental; life, death, and the beauty and tragedy in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid movie, in spite of a few faults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's true, this is a very long movie. It runs just under 3 hours, and much of that is quiet and internal, so it helps to be fresh and awake when you watch it. That said, I was never bored with this film, in spite of the meandering camera and plot. This isn't an in-your-face war movie, but instead takes a more hypnotic approach. This film looks past the apparent subject of the war in the pacific to frame moments of sublime natural beauty. Occasionally some of this parade of music and languid imagery crosses the line into near-parody. The choral voices and idyllic images of native children swimming in crystalline waters all feel a bit clich, and there's a sequence of a woman on a swing that is like being hit with a whole truckload of sentimental stereotypes. Thankfully, these are only brief lapses, and for the most part, the imagery is handled with great humility and elegance.Also, the internal monologues can get a bit tiresome. To me, the persistent philosophical internal voices of the characters are entirely unnecessary. They come in waves of empty metaphor and naively melodramatic ruminations. After the first few such interludes, I just tuned them out and focused on the more immediate visual and experiential aspects of the film, which I find to be a much more potent combination. Among the strengths of this film is its ensemble casting. The odd thing is that if you go into this expecting a Woody Harrelson/George Clooney/John Travolta/John Cusack movie, you're in for a surprise. The cast is an ensemble in the true sense of the word, many actors making up one whole. Most of the big names are just faces in the crowd, who speak their parts, and pass through. Even Nick Nolte and Sean Penn, who have fairly large roles, are not our protagonists, so much as forceful bits of scenery for the real main characters, all relative small-timers, to bounce off of, and really shine. The way the narrative passes through so many hands, through several viewpoints, gives Thin Red Line its epic scope. It is a journey through the experience of war, not just a vehicle for gory set-pieces on the beaches of D-Day, like Saving Private Ryan.Oddly enough, I consider this movie an excellent companion piece to Saving Private Ryan. Both movies manage to depict WWII in two very different and effective ways, and the experience of seeing one compliments the other. While not as colorful as Spielberg's D-Day, Thin Red Line's grassy ridge siege is an amazing, extended piece of performance and cinema, and every bit as successful at putting you in those fields, and in the soldier's experience.All together, this is a smart, affecting movie, that rarely takes the easy bait for thrills or shock value, and succeeds in spite of its few misteps.</fullReview>

But no, we get tedious voice overs where uneducated soldiers think things like "I will wait for you across the dark waters, yadda, yadda, yadda, etc., etc." There is nothing to "understand" or "get" about this film. The characters are flat, the story rambles and rambles and rambles and rambles and yet manages to go nowhere for the last hour, the cameos are distracting and unnecessary, but hey, the cinematography was great.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film not understood by many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does a war movie have to be blood, lost limbs and 'in your face' for the entire duration? Why can't a war movie make you think and make you try to understand something incomprehensible to someone who hasn't been there or, more fundamentally, something about human nature? Why can't there be both kinds, both appreciated for their equally brilliant but very different qualities? Yes, I saw both. I came out from both completely exhausted and think that although they are both extraordinary films, they are very different and can not and should not be compared.I saw The Thin Red Line in April. Since then I've read many reviews but have waited to collect my thoughts before writing my own. I've realized that thoughts on this film are not easy to collect but that it's now or never, so please excuse me if much of this is a garbled mess. Maybe I'm completely out there and missed the whole point, but the fact that "there was no story", that "there was no protagonist", that "they didn't show enough blood", that "there wasn't enough fighting/action", and that it was only about a bunch of guys crawling around in the grass...that just helps convey what a war is all about.It seems to me that The Thin Red Line wants us to understand that war IS confusing, that it's not "action packed" all the time, that there is a lot of planning/strategizing/waiting, that soldiers all deal with the horrors of battle but also that they're normal people and had at one time or another, normal lives that they will hopefully return to, that these things affect each person differently, that soldiers in combat bond with each other in a way that can only be understood by people who have been through some traumatic, intense and/or horrific ordeal together...to each other they are like family and more. But, in the whole scheme of things, they're a sea of faces all fighting for the same thing; something they may not even understand themselves. They are soldiers. Some of them will get killed. They will be replaced by others. It's an endless cycle until the war is over. I say this because in The Thin Red Line it was frequently unclear as to who was who...names were vary rarely used and when they were, they were often difficult to hear/pick out.I feel I should address the all-star cast that so many people felt was useless. First, I think it's great that all of these actors wanted so badly to be part of this film and to work with Malick that they accepted a fraction (what fraction, I don't know) of their normal salaries. I don't think that the cameos took anything away from the film. Instead, I think that they helped illustrate the "sea of faces" idea I mentioned above. For example, for me George Clooney at the end is just another in a string of officers who will lead the soldiers in the war, not more and not less important than the guy before him or the guy who will come after him.I've thought long and hard about the voiceovers and the "National Geographic" shots. What follows is only an attempt to put into words what I think...it will most likely sound like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but at least I've tried. I do not think they are out of place in this film, a war film. The dialogue makes you think...humbly tries to give you some shred of an idea of what is going inside the heads of these men, of their inner turmoil. The visuals reference not only the physical world but also the emotional world, the emotional confusion of individual soldiers. While there IS a war going on...there is calm, tranquility and peace in many other places in the world. Even between the battles there is calm...the eye of the storm. The visuals are ironic, a sort of paradox, seemingly incongruous (but are they?) and many other things. Useless and out of place are not among those things.Yes, The Thin Red Line is a film about war and all of its atrocities and I guess it's classified as a war film but is it really? The setting is on the battlefield but it's a film that forces us to think about the bigger issues: human nature, life, why we are here, what matters.... Issues on another level entirely that, on a day to day basis, one doesn't generally ponder and therefore are more difficult to grasp and comprehend.As I said, maybe I didn't understand anything at all, but I think I did, and it makes me sad that so many people can't appreciate/understand what was so eloquently/beautifully expressed, and not trivialized, in The Thin Red Line. They just didn't get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War poetry helps us tune in to the psyche of the soldier and this film was poetry. Not only was it visually stunning (who can forget the bird, the butterfly, the wind through the grass, the islanders), but it actually commented on the nature of war and how different people feel about it. This film is best watched alone in a cinema. Just let it flow over you. It is unlike any war film I have ever seen. It shows the struggle between humans and nature as well as the struggle within. The characters were interesting and diverse and the performances were wonderful. Especially Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, and Ben Chaplin. I love great war movies. I think the truly great ones actually comment on war rather than just showing graphic violence. I know I shouldn't compare but I thought it was a lot better than Saving Private Ryan. That film, while visually stunning, had nothing to say (unless you count the "make my death worthwhile" bit), the bookends were unnecessary and uninspiring and overly patriotic. If you want to see a good war film, see Apocalypse Now, see Platoon (we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves; the enemy was in us.) and see The Thin Red Line. The fact that it didn't win the Oscar for best picture is a huge compliment when you consider the bad, bad films that have won it in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Thin Red Line' was criticized by all the critics that saw it, and was deemed boring and predictable. I saw it with a friend who was interested in it, and didn't expect much.I stepped out of the theatre breathless; a different person. No movie had ever affected me that much since I saw 'Full Metal Jacket' years earlier.The mysterious but clever director Terrence Mallick has brought a new form of storytelling to the cinema. Typical movies have three sections, with two 'plot points' between them. There would be a 'good guy' and a 'bad guy'. The Thin Red Line defied that, but with such essence and depth that you will emotionally change.Based on the James Jones novel bearing the same title, it chronicles the American invasion of Guadalcanal, and watches as these confident, cocky men die for nothing. It unleashes deep, provocative issues that must be recognized by all for their importance in today's society.This movie does, however, require endurance, but it will draw you in to it if you yield to it. Everybody should, because, there is not only a Thin Red Line between sanity and insanity, but also between the wise and simple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was by far the best movie of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ought not to be compared to Saving Private Ryan. This movie was philosophical while also allowing audiences seeking other forms of entertainment to be intrigued by the excellent action sequences. This movie only had a budget of 50 million but the cast including John Travolta, George Clooney, and Sean Penn all took pay cuts because they wanted to work with Terrence Malick and they believed in the movies possibilities aside from the usual goal of "making money". This movie was very well done by Malick but I wearily must admit that some audiences have failed to see the brilliance that lies behind each scene whether it directing, special effects, acting or simply the sheer magnitude of the events occurring. I gave this film a rating of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The three hour film is almost a metaphysical meditation on the nature of war and evil in particular and humanity in general. What is good about this war movie is that it avoids moralising and instead concentrates on existential problems confronted by these soldiers in the face of death. The director has used documentary realism to good effect here. This is counterpointed by interspersing 'personal thoughts' of the characters.These breaks in the narrative bring in a more complex mental landscape. The battle scene on the grass covered hill slopes is among the best ever filmed. I would recommend the film to all serious moviegoers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expecting a new "Saving Private Ryan", "Platoon", "Full Metal Jacket" or "Apocalypse Now" I went to see this movie in Troms?, Norway. I came out of the cinema really disappointed. This movie was all a war movie should NOT be.Sure, some of the war scenes were brilliant, but that's also all the good this movie has accomplished.My list of complaints about this movie is quite long. First of all: those voiceovers! Whatever is the meaning of putting them there? Sure they have an important message to convey, but when they were put in as voiceovers the way they were, I almost fell to sleep during them. I think it would have been better putting the messages in as text on the screen, subtitles or scrolling text over the screen.Then you have the music. THIS IS A WAR MOVIE! Get the point! It's NOT "Back To Howard's End" or "The Age Of Innocence"! So the music in the film is really malplaced! That's one thing. Another thing is that it's there EVERY second of the film. I can't remember ONE second without music in the movie. And that's NOT a plus for a war movie. In a war movie you need scenes without music to meditate over what you've just seen. The music is also repetitive and boring. Some places it seems to be at the end of a sequence, and then it starts repeating itself over and over again. If you didn't fall asleep during the last voiceover, you might fall to sleep during the endless repetitions of the terribly malplaced, boring and repetitive music.Third: the actors. The men who fight in wars are your regular John Doe's such as you and me. Not your regular celebrities as George Clooney, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. A war movie gains on using smallname actors, they give a more realistic story when the soldiers are people you don't recognize just like that. In fact this is the only bad thing I found about "Saving Private Ryan" too, they should've never used Tom Hanks in that movie.Apart from being bigname actors, they don't do their parts too well either. This move would have gained much on using talented, yet unknown actors. Someone the public was NOT familiar with.That's enough said about this film. In short: it has a great story and great war scenes. But it's terribly made, with wrong actors, horrible music, and voiceovers straight out of hell. And when a 3-hour movie gets this boring because of that: it sucks! 3/10 is all it gets from me... And everyone I've talked to about this movie agrees with me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me what makes or breaks a war film is the development of the character. Malick achieves what others have only tried for; well rounded characters and believable dialogue. He does so by the interior monologue of the main characters. By the end of the film the audience has an extremely good and realistic sense of all the characters, the many emotions of war. The key is that he backs up this these words with images. Saving Private Ryan tells a story, The Thin Red Line shows a story. Malick certainly picked the right movie to make for his comeback. In addition, Hans Zimmer's score is amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line does what a war film should -- it makes a statement about the nature of man and the impact of war. Saving Private Ryan failed at the same task. It was an uninvolving docudrama. The Thin Red Line has mountains of thought placed in it. The beautiful cinematography assists Malick's depiction of war as a destructive force, not only against man, but against the land. It's wonderful how, at one point in the film, a character ponders man as a collective, and Malick obliges this thought by making it difficult to discern several of the main characters' identities. Definitely a must see.</fullReview>

Thin Red Line very close to Apocalypse Now as a many-layered exploration of human motivation and needs. As with Apocalypse, the war is only a useful backdrop for this exploration. The Thin Red Line forces thought and self-examination, in addition to ripping at one's emotions. Ryan hits only at the emotional level--doing this very well, indeed--but not requiring any deep thought, just a vague "gee, war is terrible" response. Ryan is a really good movie. Thin Red Line is great movie making with real meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I was expecting a movie.What do I mean by that?Well, in my mind, a film and a movie are two very different things. A movie is entertainment -- something that tells a story from beginning to end, and does not necessarily call upon your brain for too much work. A film is a statement -- it requires you to think and asks just as much from you as you ask of it. If you don't ask the film any questions (thinking it is a movie, as it were), then you are not going to get anything from it. If these were books, then a movie would be an Elmore Leonard novel and a film would be a book of poetry or a Shakespeare play.Despite Malick's track record for working on films, I was still expecting 'Saving Private Ryan II'. I walked out of the theatre saying, "What the hell was that crap about?" But something bugged me. It bugged me day and night -- I knew there had to have been something more to it, so I saw it a second time. Then I saw it a third time. Then a fourth.I don't usually call anything 'genius', but The Thin Red Line is as close to genius as you are likely to find in a film nowadays. The cinematography and direction was absolutely stunning -- no one can deny that this film looks beautiful. And the message behind the film is as equally beautiful as those widescreen landscape shots."But what about that lack of characterisation and plot", you ask?!I disagree. Every character in The Thin Red Line served a purpose, and served it well. Even Jared Leto's character, who we see for all of two minutes, had a texture that most Hollywood heroes don't show evidence of even after two hours running time.The plot? Well, it was about a mission to take a hill during World War II, wasn't it? That's not as brain-busting as an asteroid hurtling to earth, but it is still a story.The acting was fantastic. From Elias Koteas to Nick Nolte, to the excellent Jim Caviezel, everybody contributed to what will surely be remembered as the closest mainstream hollywood ever got to putting pure poetry on celluloid.I never fought a war myself, but my grandfather says The Thin Red Line was much more like real war than Saving Private Ryan could ever hope to be. Sure, Ryan's battle scenes were as graphic as you're likely to find, but TTRL captures the emotional side of war brilliantly -- lots of long, drawn-out periods of waiting, scattered with bursts of savage violence. Saving Private Ryan made sense, didn't it? Maybe that's it's main problem. The Thin Red Line didn't make a lot of sense to a lot of people, and maybe that's where it's genius lies.The bottom line is that war doesn't make a lot sense at all. All you can really do is watch, wait, fight and hope that you don't become the very thing you set out to fight against. That is the line between fighting courageously for something you believe in and just becoming another savage on the battlefield. And that line is a thin red line</fullReview>

However, if you like more concrete movies like any movie in the Indiana Jones series, then you may find it boring and confusing. Unlike many war movies, The Thin Red Line deals with war on a purely emotional level. Every narrative and flashback scene is completely stuffed with metaphors and symbolism, which makes it a neccessity to see it at least twice. I have seen it three times myself, and every time I see it, I find new things to contemplate. This is an excellent movie and should have, in my mind, won best picture at the Academy Awards.

		<shortDescription>Malick creates impressionistic work of great spirituality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Who are we, and what is the point of life?" These are just a few of the philosophical questions I found up front and center in Malick's The Thin Red Line. This movie is perhaps the most impressionistic war film I've ever seen. So much so, that I found it difficult, on a first viewing, to follow many of the film's characters and intertwining narratives. Dressed in their blood spattered uniforms, running through the smoke of battle, at a certain point everyone seemed to blur into everyone else. But it almost didn't matter because the real main character, if you will, of this movie is its unyielding and omnipresent spiritual quest. What is life? What is Love? What is it to be human? What is time? What is horror? What is beauty? How is it we come to know each other? And, how is it we come to know ourselves? Malick pointedly asks these very questions in much of the film's dialogue and narration. However, it is in the juxtaposition of the images of war with the images of the south sea island paradise where the battle takes place that Malick succeeds in crystalizing his best philosophy. We see blood being spattered on to tropical flowers, and leaves shot through with bullet holes offering a broken filter to the sunlight as they wave in the soft breeze. We see the curious tree top animals glancing down at a trapped, bleeding, and hunted man. And we are shown the clouds and the tall blowing grass as the last image seen by a dying mutilated soldier. It's almost as though Malick is suggesting with his imagery that in the unity of war and paradise we glimpse a fundamental truth of the human condition.This is a very special film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and lyrical, a scathing condemnation of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is one of Hollywood's true iconoclasts. After directing two of the most visually stunning and influential films of the 1970s ("Badlands" [1973] and "Days of Heaven" [1978]), he disappeared from the scene for twenty years, writing and directing nothing until this film. Like his earlier films, "The Thin Red Line" is a beautiful and lyrical work; it is also a scathing condemnation of the effects and consequences of war. Every actor in Hollywood was hot to land a part, and the cast is full of recognizable names. With but few exceptions, this is not a problem for the film. Never have I seen such a cast of big-name actors so thoroughly subjugated to a director's will. Standouts are Ben Chaplin as a young military officer, conflicted by the things he is forced to do and can view only as atrocities, and Nick Nolte as an aging general turned monstrous by his blind, overwhelming pride and ambition. (John Travolta and George Clooney, however, make such brief appearances that they are actually distracting due to their high recognition factor.) Malick is not afraid to indulge in overt philosophizing; contemplating the nightmare of conflict, one character wonders in voice-over, "This great evil: where does it come from? How does it sneak into the world? From what seed or root does it grow?" Caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding, these men find themselves demonstrating both cruelty and compassion, brutality and benevolence, and wondering at the meaning of it all. We can do nothing but wonder, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I went to see this film, I had heard nothing of it. From quickly glimpsing at the advertising poster at the movie theater wall, I expected a typical, linear U.S. triumphalist war film with some movie stars.I was completely wrong.So happily wrong.This movie is beautiful from the start to the end. Not because of all the images of nature or the poetry, but because nature and poetry get mixed with the horror of war in a perfect way. One of the great things in this movie is that we get into the skin of many of the characters, not only the U.S. soldiers but the Japanese soldiers too.And the picture shooting is perfect too. There's a scene in which the camera points towards the hill from the bottom, before the attack, while the U.S. soldiers are trying to spot the Japanese soldiers that are shooting, camouflaged in the tall grass. It's impossible to spot the Japanese shooters, but still we feel the need to scan the whole screen with our eyes to try to find them. Brilliant touches like this one are common thing during the whole film.If you found this film boring, it's because you wanted entertainment, not art.</fullReview>

I was very predisposed against this film the first time I laid eyes on it. But then, I saw it on a pay-per-view network, which made it my second viewing. With that, I finally realized, this is a pretty darn good movie! Don't get me wrong! It will go over your head the first time you see it. You'll be sitting there and thinking "Oh my God!

I saw it again, and was finally able to appreciate Terrence Malick's exquisite masterpiece. It's a really amazing film, because it's drenched with war, but it's not about the war. It's about human beings who are caught up in it, and yet, they are still able to endure and survive with peace, beauty, and happiness in their lives. It's a really beautiful film. But do realize, you have to see it at least twice to appreciate it. And if you've seen it once and hated it, try to watch it again and see a really great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most ambitious and rewarding film of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of interesting things I want to look at while discussing The Thin Red Line. My own feelings on what the film means, and the fascinatingly varied reactions the film has received.I think the many 'boring', 'hated it', type reactions have pretty much emphasised why Hollywood is making the type of films it is today. A lot of people, who consider themselves film fans, complain about how Hollywood is turning out things like Armageddon at the expense of artistic expression. Hollywood is only doing this because that is honestly what the people want.I'm sure that there are many execs and producers in Hollywood who want to make quality films, The Thin Red Line is proof of this. But it's clear from the general response to this film, that the greater majority of people don't want a film that challenges them to use their mind. They don't want a film that requires some philosophical and emotional input. They don't want a film that doesn't bring in the crowd-pleasing clichs. They don't want art, they want entertainment. People WANT Armageddon. The execs and producers have no choice but to make that sort of film, because if they don't make profits, they'll lose their job.I feel The Thin Red Line is the most ambitious film of the year because someone has had the guts to make a large budget art film for once. The Thin Red Line is proof of what can be done with the medium of cinema if one puts their mind to it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some arty-farty pretentious git. I proudly say that I enjoyed Batman and Robin. But that is base level, dollar driven entertainment at the best, it's certainly not art. It's only when a film like The Thin Red Line comes along, that you truly realise what a great medium cinema can be.Enough rambling, what did I think of it? This is certainly one of the most beautifully crafted films, perhaps ever. The camera work/cinematography, the editing, the art direction, the sound, the costumes, the music and everything else all come together wonderfully. The film is worthy on that alone. Certainly, you must see this film at a theatre with a big screen, and superb sound. I'm not sure how successfully it will transfer onto video.The performances deserve a mention. They were uniformly perfect.Now of course, it's the philosophical meanings of the film that are most important. What was Malick trying to say? Well here's my interpretation. I think perhaps a lot of people have misread this as an anti war film. With his constant comparisons of the battle to nature, I feel almost certain that Malick feels that war, is merely part of nature. Part of human nature. It's in our instinct to war with each other. Even more so, we have it built into us how to survive a war emotionally intact. He shows us that war is hell, but then shows us, that despite this, it doesn't destroy men. Most, in their own ways, find a way to cope.He does strongly put forward however, that despite being an undeniable part of human existence, it is undoubtedly the worst part of it. The most loathsome part. He compares the idyllic life (as seen by one soldier) of the native inhabitants on the island as perhaps, the good side of human nature. Indeed, in order to make it through the horrors that occur during the attack on the Japanese outpost, all the soldiers examined try to find a little bit of what's good about humans to focus on. Whether it be the idyllic life of the natives, a lover back home, by turning to religion, or just observing the wonders of the jungle and its wildlife. There's much more to this film that can't really be touched on here. I've already gone on too long.This film is not perfect. Some of the script doesn't work. But it is without doubt something to be admired and revered. It gives the mind more to chew on then a dozen or more of the usual Hollywood output. After Saving Private Ryan came out, some foolish people claimed that no more war films need be made. I think that notion has already been shattered, and I expect there will be many more great films dealing with war to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to concur with the view that the star powered cameos were really unnecessary, and that their inclusion would have to be more about box-office consideration than the body of art on display. I am though prepared to forgive the slight distraction this provides on the basis that the film is so strong on its own. War is totally abhorrent and quite rightly sits at opposite ends of the human experience to natural beauty and silence. I concede that the film meanders, but somewhat like a butterfly through a war zone. The feeling of fragility this leaves is worth the lack of fixed structure in the film. I found the film extremely emotional and resonant. In its complete pacifism it should not be compared philosophically with the other great films dealing with War. The message is clearer ... forget the glory and comraderie.... war is about entrails (not guts) and blood and fear and death.This film will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems to me that people are very divided on The Thin Red Line. You either love it or you hate it. When I saw it with a group of my friends I was the only one who liked the film. So much in fact that I went and saw it again two weeks later and I liked it even more. A good comparison that people are making to this remarkable film are how it is getting a similar reception that Kubrick's groundbreaking 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyessy received. While I was not around when that film came out, I have seen it many times and I think it's one of Kubrick's best. Apparently at the time many people trashed 2001 much in the same as people are bashing The Thin Red Line. Want to know why? Because both films are radically different from the other pictures being released today. Think about it, most science fiction films were nothing like 2001. And to be quite honest, not many are still on caliber with that great film. It went against all the Hollywood conventions. People found it "boring" that Kubrick would follow a ship slowly through space with classical music playing. I guess most people don't "get it." And now today it is a classic. Although there are still many, many people who say, "I can't stand that movie. It's so long and boring." Sounds very similar to what people are saying about The Thin Red Line I think.I think that once people begin to peel away the many depths that The Thin Red Line carries with it, they will finally begin to appreciate it. It's definitely one of the best war films made in recent years. Up there with Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, Coppola's Apocalypse Now (my fav war film by the way), and Oliver Stone's Platoon. The Thin Red Line breaks all the conventions of a war film. Most war films (including Saving Private Ryan) use what I call the "melting pot" platoon. This is that each soldier is from a radically different area to show how varying Americans are. There's the Jewish guy, the Brooklyn guy, the shy, cowardly guy, the rough and tough guy, the commanding Sargent, and the saintly Commander of the group. Most WWII films have this typical kind of group ot men. The Thin Red Line is nothing like this. None of the men know each other very well. They don't crack jokes between combat scenes. The heroic commander doesn't give a "riveting" speech as to why the men are here to die. None of that is here. Which actually makes it more realistic than most war films. As for the poetry, director Terrence Malick studied philosophy. So he is obviously very interested in the philosophical aspects of war which I found fascinating. Although I doubt in a combat situation men would recite poetry, it gives the film a feeling of an epic poem like Beowulf. I like to think of the film in those terms. That it is a basically an epic poem with images. That explains why this film does not rely heavily on a complex plot. Or have a clearly defined main character. Malick wants us to get into the minds of many different men put into a horrible situation and how they think and react to it. So I can understand why people dislike this film so greatly. It's really not a film for mainstream America. But to call it the "worst film ever" or "boring" or "it's too long" seems very unsubstantiated. Please, give this film a chance and you will see just how powerful it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most artful film I have seen this year. It was a mixture of emotion expressed through vision, and poetry. Malick brings you closer to contentment with life through unforgettable visions that linger in your mind, even perhaps subconsciously. It inspires creativity in films and art, and I have never seen anything like it. For those of you who want a plot and story spoon-fed to you, and merely be entertained by action and violence this is not your movie, you might say it's too long or boring. But for those who respect art and want to be entertained with thought provoking questions and reality, then you must see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great book, a good idea, but not a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt this film wandered too much. While it was visually stunning, with some memorable characterizations (namely Elias Koteas' Capt. Staros, who SHOULD have been nominated for an Oscar, and John Cusak's Lt. Gaff) and an excellent score, in all I felt it failed to draw the audience in. I've seen movies that were not traditional beginning-middle-end stories, but I felt that this somehow missed the mark on making a coherent comment on war. The parade of cameos did little to help this film really make an impact, also. I kept thinking - "Oh look! Woody Harrelson. Oh look! Jared Leto. Oh look! George Clooney (pointless cameo) Oh look! John Travolta. And on and on. Hollywood agents must have done some serious butt-kissing to get their clients into this film.The breaks in dialog so that the camera could pan up toward the sky, pause for a moment, and then pan back down so the dialog could begin again were distracting, also. This happened on several occasions, and I stopped caring about what was being said. Several people left the theatre while I was watching this movie, and I was relieved when it was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a greatly misunderstood film - to be deemed a classic in coming years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do people insist on criticising this film on the basis that it had no plot or that there was no central characters, or that the leading actors had bit-parts? I'm sorry, but you have missed the point entirely, and I feel sorry for you in that you could not see the tragic beauty encapsulated within this work. I bet you are the same people that complain that they could not understand 2001.The Thin Red Line is quite simply a poetic masterpiece. It is the story of many men, and of all of us, as we attempt to confront our mortality, and who and what we are. The Thin Red Line is a Story of War, not a War movie, but more than that, it looks at all of us, ordinary men, each unique in their own way, each struggling to find a sense of place and meaning in this life before the inevitable onset of death, sooner or later (or sooner in war). Men who attempt make sense of their lives, and what men are driven to confront in extreme circumstances.I cannot being to convey in words the sense of what I felt this film was attempting to say. I'm not talking in a religious sense, the monologues and the camera work seemed to allude to a universal oneness of all things, or a truth in all things, even in war, an impermanency set amidst a tremendous and universal permanency. War almost became an allegory for the flawed, frail and tragic beauty of human life and existence. How do we survive ourselves, how to we reconcile ourselves to ourselves, to each other, and to what it means to be human and to be mortal?The story was there, but the portrayal of war was probably more realistic than anything ever I have ever yet seen. In war, there were many moments where 'not a lot happened', many moments of stillness and inactivity, and when 'action' came, it wasn't necessarily on the large scale of a full assault with cannons blasting. It was 'matter of fact' as this film portrayed it. The very basic story was the taking of Quadacamal and the ultimate toll that the taking exerted on these men. The actor was Charlie company, and a collection of men who represent us all.In fact found the cast of leading actors a distraction, and I would have preferred a cast of unknowns. It was inevitable that you would end up saying, oh, there's John Travolta, or there's George Clooney, which on occasions, prevented you from being completely immersed in the film. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte to a lesser degree, I felt was the exceptions to this.Saving Private Ryan, because I cannot help make the comparison, despite having many moving moments, I found contrived and simplistic by comparison, a pre-digested account of the horror and inanity of war, replete with the standard references and hackneyed plot. A war movie for the Reebok generation. Spielberg could not help but delve into his Peter Pan style story telling. And despite his promise to look at the men of the war (and that war drives men on both sides to do terrible things), he could not help but delve into the standard all 'Germans are really bad and therefore deserved it' mantra. I didn't see that with Malick's portrayal of the Japanese. Sorry Saving Private Ryan was a disappointment, and the Stars and Stripes, replete with the attractive well-rounded blond-haired grand children was sickening to behold.Thin Red Line is quite simply a masterpiece (shot in North Queensland). Malick has almost created the perfect film...almost. All great artists are misunderstood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love war movies. I have seen great ones like Apocalypse Now. Most of them question what is the right conduct of a "good soldier", present confrontations between love and duty.This one film gathers war characters that are much closer to real life --as I imagine it since I have never been to war myself, although I am an officer. Soldiers are more or less moral, more or less humanitarians, more or less generous, more or less courageous, etc. Like in civil life, we should admit. That is what makes this film so fascinating.More: images are great, and the movie progresses through up hill (no pun!) and down dale, giving us the opportunity to rest from time to time, allowing the viewer time to think with the hero, or simply to savour magnificent sceneries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A juxtaposition of war and nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1978 Terrence Malick released "Days of Heaven" which was heralded as one of the best films of the 1970's. Critics noticed that his other film, 1973's "Badlands" held many of the same characteristics.Malick's pictures tend toward the meandering side of storytelling. Using characters as devices in a setting of such beauty and awe that the viewer is forced to read between the lines, the story isn't laid out for you to read plainly.So goes his newest film "The Thin Red Line" which was nationally released on January 15th, 1999. Many criticisms of the film fall under categories such as: tedious, too long, pretentious, uneven, etc. The criticisms, though warranted in theory, simply have no basis.In fact, "The Thin Red Line" tells a prodigiously epic story of men, some nameless, that have their guts shot out during the battle in 1942 on the Island of Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands.Though the film does go from showing the lush nature and sense of "Eden" on one island to the carnage on another, if you follow closely, you'll see the point. The film needs no explaining, it's an anti-war film in the greatest sense.Francois Truffaut once said that 'it's not possible to make an anti-war film, because all war movies, with their energy and sense of adventure, end up making combat look fun'. Had the great Truffaut lived to see Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line", I imagine he might recant that statement. "The Thin Red Line" is one of the best films of the 1990's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poetic!This word is the best one to describe this marvelous story. The first thing we notice when we watch is the meaning of the title. As far as I am concerned, two things can be said about it: in a formal way, a red line is a war front, where enemies combat (and that's the subject of the film); the other one, much more subtle, is that the thin red line is the border between the fight for convictions, nation and ideals and the fight, the cruel fight for surviving, such a thin line that sometimes we don't know when we cross it. That's what the film attacks: the man don't have to face this conflict, war is stupid, and we never know why we are in it. The soundtrack is perfect, as well as direction and photography. Terrence Malick proved to be an amazing director. I think it's not necessary to say that what happened during the last Academy Awards was completely unfair. Instead of winning not one, The Thin Red Line should have won all the statuettes to which it was indicated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long, winding poem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malick's long-awaited intellectual response to Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN winds its way across the screen like a deep slow river. Awash in the glory of living nature...hills of singing grass, brilliant birds, rich, black earth...the film is set almost entirely in voice over. From the internal voices of the Guadal Canal soldiers we learn of their fears, expectations, fragile hopes for survival, attempts to make sense of the pounding war. There are moments in the film of extreme beauty, extreme sadness and a thicker, more somber profundity than is often seen at the American cinema. The most clear and uncomfortable moments in the film occur as the American soldiers mingle with, abuse, humiliate, and then, at times, painfully identify with a group of captured Japanese. The face of a young Japanese man, destroyed in a grenade attack, can be seen through the shifting dirt of a ruined jungle, his thoughts speak the hardest and most poetic truth of the film: loving truth, loving good, loving beauty will not save you from the brutality, the subhumaness of war. Malick has etched a visual and linguistic poem for the screen, but it is a long poem and one with little hard plot. The Thin Red Line captures the fleeting thought, the smallest moments and strings them together against a natural backdrop of uncommon splendor. Don't go for thrills, go to sit back, listen, and wonder along with these soldiers why we do it again and again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, more than any other in recent years, reminded me of Stanley Kubrick. Like Kubrick's movies, it is not easy to digest all the rich content of TTRL in one viewing. And like the recently departed master's films, I am sure that TTRL will improve with each viewing (and I certainly aim to see it several times). Other similarities between the two master film makers include creating a vivid atmosphere and cleansing their movies of any "manufactured emotion".TTRL delves into the psychology of war. It seems to ask the question: What is it that can make cold blooded murderers out of innocent young men ? (a question also put to the audience in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket) and, Is anything worth shedding so much blood for? His answer to the last question is an obvious NO and TTRL could be termed a Pacifist war movie. For this reason, it is almost diametrically opposite to Saving Private Ryan. For other reasons, such as artistic integrity and creative film making, I believe it to be the much superior of the two films.I am sure that had Malick cut the first 10 minutes and some 20 minutes from the end section, the movie would have been more commercially successful. As I am sure Vertigo would have been during its initial release had Hitchcock given in to all those around him and save the denoument for the end rather than the middle. But would Vertigo be as great a movie today with those changes? I think not. History will be the judge on Malick's film. Meanwhile, catch it on the big screen while you can. It is an experience likely to be lot more rewarding than watching almost anything else around.</fullReview>

There was so much symbolism in this film that many people either missed, or where too dumbed down from Saving Private Ryan to understand. I did not care for Saving Private Ryan because I could not care about the story, or the cast. I felt for everyone in this film. I felt for the personal demons inside everyone. The poetic sceenplay is remarkable, and the flow of the film was free at all time. Many people stated that this picture bored them, made them wish they wouldn't have spent their money. Me?

		<shortDescription>The underrated and most misunderstood movie of 1999</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is certainly not for everyone with Attention Deficit Disorder and those who have the penchant for Armageddon-type razzle-dazzle action. The reason why the moviegoers loathed this movie is because it's overlong, inconsistent, inconceivable, pretentious, muddling, you name it. The movie philosophizing about war and the effect on humanity, nature and civilization is not easy to sell. The Thin Red Line is certainly one of the most brilliant, haunting and moving movies I have seen since Roland Joff's The Mission. It spoke for me intellectually, unlike others who have the zero tolerance for slow pace and elaborate rambling. But not without the obvious flaws -- convoluted narratives (intentionally or not), distracting cameos and disjointed editing in the final hour. I agree that some of the National Geographic Explorer shots are unnecessary, but Terry Malick makes the point that war is what decimates the stability of nature and mankind. It speaks for the essence of the metaphysics of the human mind.What angers me is the relentless comparision to Saving Private Ryan. The other manipulative and hypersentimental war movie have no place to compare to The Thin Red Line whose message have been convoluted because of people's assumption that they would see the reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The fact is, The Thin Red Line began principal photography a few months before Saving Private Ryan! The Thin Red Line does not delve to show the extremes of war such as extremely gory violence and carnage. Mr. Malick, despite the pressure, restrained from the excessive indulgence of violence unlike Steven Spielberg's hectic vision of relentless and unflinchingly inundate violence in SPR. The purpose of the movie is to show that the humans are lost souls desensitized by the atrocities of war and the perception that the soldiers on both sides are actually vulnerable humans instead of mere savage animals looking to kill (e.g., murder) more people to amuse and to advance. Stereotypically stoic characters are not in The Thin Red Line, unlike SPR. Instead some self-serving and conceited characters (such as Woody Harrelson's character) make the mistakes and regrets instead of succumbing to the final remark with a death rattle. This is what makes the man a human again -- before death comes to take over.What is vitally important is that this is a difficult movie to understand and analyze because it's so visually enthralling and abstract. Only Malick knows what he's talking about. The Thin Red Line is very much like the erratic Apolcalypse Now. To paraphase Francis Ford Coppola's most famous quote: "My greatest fear is to make a really s****y, embarrassing, pompous film on an important subject, and I am doing it." This is what Malick may have thought, but he allowed the viewers to think for themselves. I let Malick's vision roll over me, and as the film progresses, it made me think about the devastating consequences of war. It is the casualties of war and human suffering that made me think. Its destructive nature of war is what hurts the relationship between the Earth and mankind. It spoke to my mind instead of my heart -- I don't need to be medicinal -- that we think before we commit the most contemptible acts. To me, The Thin Red Line is both intelligent and spiritual.Too bad The Thin Red Line have been overlooked by the Academy and Terry Malick never had a compliment for his mind-absorbing view of war. The late James Jones would have liked the movie, but who knows. The public and critics' opinions on the movie are wildly divided. The Thin Red Line is certain to become one of the most debated movies in recent history.My only wish is that Fox would have the gut to release the original cut of The Thin Red Line as Mr. Malick wanted in order for his ideals to be comprehensible as originally envisioned.</fullReview>

Parts of the movie did keep one on the edge of his seats, particularly the horrendous charge up the hill and ensuing squad level battle against enemy-held bunkers. But this movie is really in a totally different vein from Saving Private Ryan, in-your-face, overpowering scenes of utter carnage and chaos.If nothing else, this movie simply did not make me feel the same way that SPR did. As brutal and graphic as SPR was, it made me feel a greater obligation to live life even more responsibly- having seen the enormous sacrifices made by people before my time. The movie made me feel that there was a purpose to the entire carnage- a noble conclusion that was reached at the end of the war. In fact, this experience was only later affirmed when I read Stephen Ambrose's Civilian Soldiers, which also makes mention of the Niland brothers that Saving Private Ryan was partly based on. But I only left Thin Red Line feeling depressed, that war was wasteful, stupid and of absolutely no value. Is this the message that we want to communicate to the soldiers, those of us, who may one day be entrusted to defend our countries against possible aggression?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Malick's work reflects a deeper sensibility about what the soldier must overcome to survive, both against the enemy and within their own ranks. I also think that Malick treats the Japanese more humanely -- they're just as afraid as the guys in "Charlie Company" were -- than Spielberg did in "Saving Private Ryan," where his presentation of the Germans borders on the stereotypical. SPR was about WWII and the American Spirit; TRL could have been about Vietnam, about Korea, about the Gulf War or the Civil War, for that matter. The film is not so much about War as it is about its impact on the Soldier.I'd have given this a higher recommendation, but I have to think about those unaccustomed to Malick's existentialist style, particularly the narrative. If you've seen either "Days of Heaven" or "Badlands," you'll not be surprised. If you haven't, you're in for a loooooooooonnnnnnnnngg three hours. It is beautifully and skillfully photographed, however; try to see it on a big screen if you still can, otherwise letterbox on home video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always a shame when Oscar nominated films fail to get even one award. The Thin Red Line, was just bad timing. Wedged between two Elizabethan movies and two other WWII films, it was going to be hard pressed to win a major award. I would've hoped it would have won at least one award out of seven nominations.I really enjoyed this film. Although I did feel it got bogged down in imagery and soul-searching narratives. The acting was superb, especially from Nick Nolte, Jim Caviezel and Elias Koteas. The action sequences were terrifying, and I was grateful not to be subjected to any limb-tearing, head-caving graphic scenes like Saving Private Ryan. The violence was much easier to watch, but just as harrowing.This seemed to be a more human film, as well. Showing each different soldier's private war, and the way they deal with fight inside, as well as on the battlefield. Watching the ordeal of the Japanese army revealed them to be as human as the allied forces. Whereas SPR used the Germans as faceless, almost comic-like villains, TTRL also dealt with the effect of the war on the enemy, rather than concentrating on the "good guys".All in all, this a great film. It shows you the terrifying battlefields of war, the peaceful splendour of the jungle and the spirituality of the men fighting for their country. It stand as a classic in the years that follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>profound use of war as a stage for a philisophical question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This brilliant film uses war as a stage for one of the great philosophical questions, is there any inherent value in life or is there only what we determine to be. In the opening talk between Sean Penn and Witt this is put forth "one man is worth nothing....there ain't no world but this one" verses Witts "I know there is because I have seen it". The constant tension of the film revolves around these two views as do the uses of nature and the many brilliant scenes. The most memorable being a soldier who removed the gold out of enemy soldier's teeth holding himself as he weeps and throwing the teeth away, finally his humanity has challenged his lower nature. Private Ryan , which I enjoyed, has no scene nearly as soulful. There is a MUCH stronger sense in RED LINE that the war will never leave any man who survives it, except for Ryan himself, this is not even touched on in Private Ryan. Criticism of the plot not being clear is foolish, maybe to slow for some, but VERY clear, take the hill then clear the enemy out afterwords. From beginning to end, a brilliant, soulful examination of how humans struggle to find purpose and value in the most hellish situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank God It Won No Oscars!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two of my buddies went with me to see this three hour drivel. We all agreed it stank. We laughed uproariously at many of the scenes. First of all, John Travolta, George Clooney, and Woody Harrelson COMBINED are in this movie no more than ten minutes, Clooney for less than a minute. If The Thin Red Line is so great, why are these currently "hot" actors even in the film? Can't it stand on its own merits? In Saving Private Ryan the actress who plays the Ryan brothers's mother is an obscure actress, as is the actor who portrays General George Marshall, the most powerful American in uniform in all of WWII. The Thin Red Line could not stand on its own. Why do the voice-over narrations sound like hillbillies from the Ozarks? Were all the men who fought at Guadalcanal hayseeds from the South? The combat veterans of D-Day said Saving Private Ryan was very accurate but the vets of Guadalcanal laugh at The Thin Red Line. My own father was wounded and captured in the European Theater. He was a POW for four months and weighed under 100 pounds when he was liberated. He tells me that at no time did he wonder why he was shooting at Germans and would he meet them in the hereafter. The soldiers in The Thin Red Line (as well as the very overrated director) must have never heard of Pearl Harbor or the Bataan Death March. If the soldiers in our armed forces all acted like those in this incredibly stupid movie, the United States wouldn't be able to defeat Ethiopia. A terrible movie!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not so much artistic as simplistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TTRL represents everything that I dislike about the modern American movie. I can think for myself. I do not need a movie to tell me how to think. TTRL wants to tell everyone exactly how to think. This movie did not allow audiences to analyse the film beyond the parameters of its own oppressive ideology.The use of voice over was about as ridiculous and unnecessary as ever (remember Bladerunner?). Not that I'm blanketly against the VO. It's just that when the movie itself is so very obvious, so very simplistic, well it makes me wonder why it tries to set itself up, with a couple of sky shots, as 'artistic' at all. this movie would have been a little (and I really only mean a little) more endurable without the incredibly didactic inner monologues.Mawkish VO, simplistic moralising, self-righteousness overload. This movie was an insult to my intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love it or leave it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "The Thin Red Line" with the knowledge that it would be deliberately paced and philosophical. I didn't expect another "Saving Private Ryan". I went away filled with wonder. While not a perfect film, it was one of the best I've seen in a very long time. For some reason, I found it reminiscent of "Das Boot", "Stalingrad" and "The Mission". Many have mistaken it for a war movie, when it is a movie set in a war. OK, it was a trifle overlong, with a few flashbacks, voice-overs and nature scenery shots too many, and both Travolta and Clooney felt out of place, but the overall effect was stunning. I have never seen war portrayed in this way before, with soldiers on both sides being scared s***less and desperately trying to execute their orders despite seeing their comrades die. The footage is from the soldier's point of view, crawling on the ground, noticing irrelevant details, being confused in the midst of combat. The portrayal of the Japanese was superb - not the usual American racist bespectacled, buck-toothed gook shouting "Banzai!" and dying for the Emperor. At first, the enemy is faceless, firing machine-guns and charging, then seen up close as scared, humiliated and very human (still, we must remember that the Japanese atrocities were among the worst of the war). While it is futile to compare it with "Ryan" (it's like trying to compare "Star Wars" to "2001"), I will still do it, as so many has already one it. The greatest failing of SPR was the big slump in the middle, the sappy patriotism and the stereotyped characters. The attention to detail was impeccable, but the end result was still slightly disappointing. TTRL is visually stunning and very violent, with strong performances all over the line. The pace (or lack thereof) requires that the viewer detach him/herself from expecting the standard rhythm movies have, which is certainly hard, especially if you think "war movie". TTRL is a movie that makes you think, something which obviously isn't appreciated by the "Armageddon" lot, and therefore very satisfying if you are fed up with the standard Hollywood fare. I can understand that some people feel cheated (that movie trailer appear to have been misleading), but try to _watch_ and _think_! I read through some of the comments, and feel that the review made by the Bosnian veteran was most valid. If an ex-soldier feels that the film has something to say, I think that's praise indeed. My own experiences from my (peacetime) military service makes me agree. "The Thin Red Line" isn't for everyone, but if you don't want to be treated like "Everyone", you are in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Red Line: Entertainment or truly hard work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons between 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Saving Private Ryan' are inevitable given that they are both running for a considerable number of the 1999 Oscars. In my view there is little comparison in terms of quality, powerful imagery and entertainment. 'Red Line' could have been an excellent film. It had the opportunity to use some wonderful scenery and actors to properly portray the viciousness of the Guadalcanal fighting, accepted by most as one of the major pivotal points of the war in the pacific. Instead we were treated to considerable numbers of shots of the local flora and fauna in between often difficult to follow passages where the story, such as it was, unfolded. Most viewers, even if they hadn't seen SPR, would have felt short-changed by action sequences that lacked the necessary bite and special effects which failed to portray any sort of real intensity. Having brought together the correct uniforms, weapons, talented cast and a wonderful location, for the director and crew to have short changed the cinema public like this is nothing short of diabolical. To fall so hopelessly between the two stools of message and entertainment is similarly unjustifiable. The entertainment factor was limited to some nice scenery, some average action sequences and the odd passage of excellent acting. It was also diluted by the meaningless ramble of some of the voice-overs. The message factor was always going to be lost on a cinema audience that was struggling to stay awake and concentrate on the evening I saw the film. Most who pay good money in the cinemas would prefer to be entertained rather than mentally challenged I'm sure. The death of one of the main players in the movie was so understated in the 'dying' sequence that I'm sure many people only realised later. The rambling on of the film after the action is completed beggars belief. Although I can see many flaws in SPR I believe it would be a complete travesty for 'The Thin Red Line' to deprive it of any awards or kudos in any department other than acting, and then only maybe! How best to sum up the film; I have seen most films about combat and I own a great many. This one will only make my video collection if someone buys it for me before I can spread the word about it. For me 4/10 tops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thin Red Line is the best war film I have ever seen, in a year with two W.W.II films one was based on pure visual stimulation with little symbolism to make it appeal to the masses. Thin Red line was an emotional and mental, full of amazing scenery and symbolism. This was the only war movie that rendered me motionless, I sat in the theater shaking during the raid on the Japanese camp. A far better movie than Private Ryan although the Oscars do not seem to be showing that so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch Thin Thin Red Line with a couple of my friends as soon as it opened in Hong Kong. I realized it was something very special as soon as it started. I had never seen anything like it before. I think this movie is one of the best I have ever seen and director Terrence Malick did his very best. The scenes and images in it were absolutely stunning, and I thought the movie had a very deep meaning in it. It wasn't just some senseless, pure action, war movie or anything. This wasn't just about war: it was about humanity, and every individual person, what we have in common that makes us human.People who have seen "Saving Private Ryan" can't compare this with it. It is entirely different from Private Ryan. People complained that The Thin Red Line was boring, it had too much commentary in it, it was too long, and a few people even walked out half way through. I have to admit that it was a bit too long and it was a bit boring at times, but it was originally six hours long, and a lot of it had to be cut, in order to shorten it to three hours. That is why some people might say that it seems "incomplete for a movie". Some critics thought the characters were poorly developed. Despite what others said about the film, I enjoyed it very much. It was a very difficult movie to adapt, I personally read the book itself. Terrence Malick tried very hard, at his best, to make this movie and I think people should look at what's great about it, and not only point out the flaws and the bad points to it. The acting was terrific too. Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and I think everyone should see it, and not be discouraged by those who did not enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong and overblown. Very pretty in places.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd read rave reviews of this film and unfortunately this led to an enormous sense of disappointment. Articles in the press have speculated about the whereabouts of Terence Malick over the last 20 years or so. He certainly hasn't been to the cinema. The film, while beautifully shot in places, was an exercise in self indulgence and cinematic excess. The pacing is certainly more reminiscent of Apocalypse Now than Saving Private Ryan. The plot (such as it exists) leaves the viewer detached and ultimately uninterested in the plight of the poorly sketched characters. While some may argue that the feeling of detachment echoes that of the participants, it is not good cinema. The film has three main sections, the first a long and rambling introduction to the characters and background. Given that this lasts for 45 minutes or so, it is surprising how little one knows or cares for either by the end of it. The second section deals with the 'action' of taking the hill and is the closest that the film comes to having a plot, characters or indeed anything of interest to absorb the eyes and mind other than the scenery. Shot at times like a Kurosawa epic, but lacking that directors feel for emotion and drama, the action is played out by such anonymous characters that the effect is wasted. The third section of the film has a feeling of denouement, but lasts over an hour. This is the longest and most drawn out segment and occurring as it does after nearly 1hr 45 mins the effect was literally numbing, to the bum as much as to the mind.The final parallel between this artistic endeavour and the war it portrays was the relief felt by all parties when it was finally over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK... here's the thing: Many people try to draw comparisons between The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan. I say this is somewhat unfair, because both are masterpieces of their OWN sub-genre. The only comparison I'm forced to make is the personal effect of the movies. SPR kept me thinking for two days. Correction, the first 30 minutes of it did. It definitely sheds a new light on what grandpa was talking about...The Thin Red Line did not. Not because I'm immune to philosophy or because I cannot open to symbolism. As you can see from most of the comments here, everyone interpreted this symbolism differently. I think the only person who truly knows what each and every frame represents is Malick. This is why I have to agree, yes, the movie was too long. Then again, imagine what it's like having to cut an incredibly long but astonishing film over and over again. Naturally you try salvage as much of your message as possible. But it's like a fairy tale to a child that could be much more colourful if mom didn't have to go to sleep as well.Either it should have been given justice and allowed to break all the rules thus becoming a half-day movie leaving the brain incapable of dealing with the information but never forgetting the experience even if it is overtime. Or it should have been cut a bit shorter focusing a tad more on the main message, exploring the soulless claustrophobia and terror but without removing any of the references to the link between man, nature and civilization.This movie is definitely a tough one. Not something you take your girlfriend to, unless you have the ideal relationship and are able to sink into philosophy. Brilliant, but the aftereffect is more one of slight puzzlement than that of a changed or refreshed attitude towards war. However, if you have not yet reached the "condemn" state and it catches you at the right time in your life, it can be a turning point.Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Ryan gave the senses a workout with the fantastic opening sequence, Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' sets out in completely the different direction. His flawed masterpiece instead opens with voice-over, nature and natives in a 15 minute sequence exploring the parallels and difference war brings the land and man.The Thin Red Line does contain thrilling battle sequences (the attempt to take a hilltop bunker standout) that can certainly compare with Spielburg's opus. Ryan was filming in a gritty, grainy docu-style; here we view the battle in living colour. The light as it sweeps over the battlefield is brilliantly filmed and brings an extra dimension to the men's futile attempt.The effects of war both on the men and on how nature can teach us, the violent tendency, is continually explored. Both in voice-over and epic camera moves Malick gives the audience substance to think about and consider.The film certainly has more 'depth' in its message and its meaning than Ryan. For this reason it will do worse commercially. It is a masterpiece - yet a flawed one. The narrative, broken up (characters appear and disappear) by Malick having to trim his original six hour cut, does slow the film down in places and certainly some minds will wonder.Quite easily the best film so far of 1999. With all the crap that they have shovelled out so far this year this picture should be a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine that I will appreciate this movie more and more as it sits with me, as its images come and go, when I see it again in a year or two, knowing better what to expect.There is no question that this is a brilliant, rich film which delves far below the simplistic and easy emotions usually triggered by war movies. It is a meditation more than an action film. It deals with the emotional/existential experience of war, as much as with its physical challenges and terrors. It invited me - one who has never experienced war - to imagine what it is, not only to be IN the war, but to be OF it; to be passionatly and fearfully clinging to LIFE, while at the same time willfully serving as a cog in the relentless machine to destroy LIFE, all the while wondering why.The film wonderfully depicts the dualities of Beauty and Death, Generosity and Evil, Lovingness and Numbness. It depicts, in a way rarely seen, that the gamut of experiences is the same, whatever side of the battle you are on. On top of that, the acting is strong, and the cinematography is luminous!But I sure wish this film had been shorter. I was just not prepared for the slow pace; the repetitiveness of the voice overs; the long,lingering build ups to emotional states that are revealed and left exposed for seemingly minutes at a time. Had I known what to expect, as I will the next time I see this - and there will be a next time - I would not have been waiting for what was not coming, not anytime soon at least. It's hard to appreciate a solo piano when you're expecting the rhythm section to jump in ANY SECOND NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, people ask me what the difference between "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Thin Red Line." I tell them simply this: "Ryan" is a narrative, "Red Line" is a poem. Truly, a poem with wonderfully beautiful cinematography. It's almost as though Emerson or Thoreau, or another Transcendentalist of the old days, wrote this movie as a poem where they finally admit that yes, there IS evil in the world. Man's oneness with nature is apparent here in many images. It wonderfully displayes the films true cruelty: The Melanesian people, so beautiful and peaceful, are having their world torn apart by two sides they never knew existed, and frankly don't care about. These antagonists are very much part of nature, as well, and represent the evils that hurt this beautiful world. I can't stand the people who are saying: Man, they were using the wrong kind of rifle; Man, I heard that you don't really think about your WIFE while on combat patrol. This movie isn't about accuracy, as the setting is not as important to the plot as "Ryan." It asks the big question: Why, in a world as beautiful as ours, does war exist?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who gave this movie a 1 is out of their minds. I assume that most people would score this movie low because they did not understand it. One person actually said to me, "I don't like those Vietnam movies". Some Armegeddon fan type people are too eager or used to action to appreciate this masterpiece. This is not your typical "war" movie. It does not attempt to be "Saving Private Ryan." What it does do is explore man's inner being, and attempt to show what we all fear, love, or hate, and how we all are human, even if not all the same. This movie was incredibly moving. The artistic way in which it was directed may have turned off some "mind in neutral" movie goers, but if you really just watch, you can learn about yourself, and your fellow man. It shows that in the end, beneath the surface, we are all weak and unsure, and essentially alike. So, if you didn't understand it totally, fine. Just at least appreciate the beauty of the film.

Basically a lot of Americans were fighting the Japanese over a hill, and it took one and a half hours of filming for them to get about ten Japanese soldiers out of a hole! After that it got even more tedious and it was unclear which character was speaking in the voice-overs, I did cry at the end though. I am a film fanatic, and I will sit down and watch anything but this was the only film that I have ever seen that made me want to walk out.

		<shortDescription>Badly made, Boring, but the philosophy is there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie industry of the 90's will be famous for one thing: Making novels look bad on screen. Unfortunately this is yet another novel whose on screen much hyped version fails to impress or entertain. A very hollywoodine aspect of war is presented, with bad acting, no realism, and empty scenes and deadly boring dialogs, which even manage to bury the great philosophy behind the film. Although calling itself a war drama, war scenes are actually a small portion of this movie. Furthermore, it has absolutely no plot whatsoever - it's much too slow-paced and lasts too long while saying little.The music is something weird... Although the score is great, one would often find it misplaced - double bass as a background to a battle? That's a good one.We're also being shown to a couple of birds or the nearby nature every couple of minutes... Can't say, it's beautiful, but considering those parrots stayed on screen more than Travolta and Clooney, we could as well give it a Best Documentary Oscar nomination too.If you have seen Saving Private Ryan (SPR), do not expect to be impressed; both the realism of war as well as the extent of emotions triggered by watching SPR exceed what the Thin Red Line manages to give even with such a wonderful cast.What disturbs me the most, is that the potential had been there all along... the idea is great! The promises of another parallel world, which he finds destroyed before his own world is destroyed as well through his death - it's definitely good grounds for drama. But... bad approach. Instead it was such a bore that half the theater fled before an hour had passed.Make no mistake - this is the critic wannabe's and the pseudo-intellectual's feast, as one other reviewer said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen "The Thin Red Line" this afternoon left me with memories of the beautiful nature on Guadalcanal - but not a lot more. Centered on the american invasion of Guadalcanal during WWII the movie provides the viewer with looks into the hearts and minds of a group of american armymen.There is really no plot while the movie tries to ram some commonplace ethics and philosophy lessons down the unsuspecting moviegoers throat. Main points are about the duality of human nature and the absurdity of war. Nothing new, but the movie nevertheless runs for almost three hours. In lack of an original view on the perils of war (and a decent story) the movie regrettably fails to capture your attention.On the upside are three items: 1. The photography and sound. The pictures and sound are top notch. Part of the movie takes place on the slopes of a hill, the americans are trying to conquer from the japanese opponents. During this segment you actually feel, as if you were there - in Guadalcanal, in WWII. The magnificient pictures and the sound of the wind sweeping through the tall, green grass makes you want to lie down on your back and look dreamingly at the clouds passing by. 2. The actors All parts seem to be cast with the best of breed Hollywood actors. Lead by Nick Nolte and Sean Penn the whole cast plays impeccable. Even in very small parts we see actors like John Travolta and George Clooney. 3. The music Couldn't be better.In my view the director should have made a National Geographics kind of film, and this way have concentrated on what he does best.</fullReview>

The inevitable comparisons between this and "Saving Private Ryan" will probably lean in favour of the latter. At least by most people.

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was quite boring at times and I did have some concentration problems when the flashbacks came in the movie. My opinion is that this film does not deserve an Oscar for best film and the only Oscar it could get is the most overrated one. So see it once and no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I don't really know what to say about this movie. It's easily one of the best I've seen. but I can't really express why. So I'll just address some criticisms. first: no characters. This one's easy. There aren't supposed to be any. All the characters just represent a human. They are all just parts of our human psyche (for instance Nolte is frustration and Kotias is humanity in my opinion). Two: there is no plot. Yes there is. Just look a bit further. It's about the development of a man in the front of war (and I don't mean just caviezel, remember, the whole cast represents one man) third: it's pseudo-philosophy. This is utter nonsense. I study philosophy, and Malick used to teach it. He knows what he's talking about. And read Nietzsche and compare him to sgt. West (Penn). Fourth: It's boring. Look at 1-3 and watch the movie again with them in mind. Now I've so far seen it twice and I have to admit, the first time I saw it (at 22.30h) I didn't really get it either and I got one nagging feeling, which I get every now and then after seeing a movie. So I went to see it again at a more decent hour, and I realized there was nothing wrong with the film but with the way I had looked at it the first time. How much I'd missed.And if you still don't like it now. Then I guess it just wasn't for you. This is just like any art not for everybody. Remember, there's still lots of people who say picasso's work is ugly.</fullReview>

Other cameos from Woody Harrelson and George Clooney help to give an extra lift to the film, making it a thoroughly enjoyable watch spanning 3 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has read the original book (which was much more entertaining), will realize that it and the film based upon is not a true story. But this doesn't matter, because it is what Gudalcanal stands for, for Americans. Just like Saving Private Ryan, the fact that this is not a true story does not take away from the film's overall message, which is the most important thing when you watch a film. Also, a more satisfying film has to be Saving Private Ryan, although this one is very good in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The odd glimpse of excitement in an otherwise dull production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be a big disappointment. I spent the first hour waiting for it to move up a gear (from almost standstill), only for the hour of excitement to be capped off with yet another hour of scenery shots. Artistic, maybe. Perhaps it even conveys the grim realities of warfare. But I found sitting in a hot cinema for 3 hours watching this film to be one of the more uncomfortable experiences I've ever had. Despite the time taken to build up the atmosphere and characters, I ultimately never really cared because there were too many of them and by the time the story actually moved along I'd lost interest. The only upside was the taking of the hill, which itself relied on some characters that we'd never seen. Oh, and leaving at the end for some air.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not sit here and say "this film sucks", but I will advise against losing three hours of your life if you have no desire to see a film with too many characters, not enough plot, and useless cameo appearances that are less than enhancing. I settled into my seat with a hopeful attitude: hoping that philosophical perspectives would not ruin the film, and hoping that my friend and I would not have to take Vivarin to stay focused on the screen.Well, I was wrong on both counts. I simply could not muster up any sort of feelings about any of the characters in the film, nor did I care much when they died. At times, the battle seemed more pathetic than anything, a group of whiny, spacey young men being dictated over by the tyrant of Nick Nolte. Nick Nolte was probably the only person I had any feelings toward in the whole film. I HATED his character; this was good, because it kept me awake. Nick Nolte should not have wasted his talent on this film. Sean Penn allowed himself to slip into the cracks, and what I had hoped would be a memorable role for him all but disintegrated. It was scene after scene of men having flashbacks and drifting off into dreamland. Beautiful shots of flowers and nature...not as though that helped.Every man in my family has fought in war, and I do not feel this film does justice or provides any clarification as to what is suffered. People criticize Saving Private Ryan for having "too much blood and guts", "too many explosions", etc. Well, I hate to break it to you guys: that's what war is. Go see Saving Private Ryan instead, and if you still want to go see this film, bring a pillow.</fullReview>

It is not the battle scenes that stick in your mind, but the performances of an incredibly talented ensemble cast - especially Jim Cavaziel and Sean Penn. The cinematography was simply breathtaking, and the script was superb! Unlike Saving Private Ryan, this film focused on humanising the characters, and made them seem more realistic, rather than some cheesy male bonding scenes (Private Ryan). The film also took an unbiased point of view of the war, rather than simply portraying the men in terms of good and bad. See it and be AMAZED - Malick definitely deserves an Oscar!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does TRL necessarily have to have a plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see how you can criticise TRL for having no plot. It's intended to show a small slice of one part of a campaign to take a hill on one island in the Pacific during a war which lasted 6 years. Depicting the war in this way is far more realistic than an action packed extravaganza of explosions and heroism (like Saving Private Ryan or something like The Guns of Navarone). For the average soldier the war would have been remembered in terms of vivid images of small battles, not as any particular timeline of larger events.In any case, TRL is the best movie I've seen for a long, long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art that transcends genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick has managed to create something with few parallels in the film industry, a piece of visual and narrative poetry that will leave an indelible impression on the industry in years to come. He brilliantly interweaves tragic images of nature's inexorable brutality with almost spiritual views of the jungle canopy, leaving the viewer simultaneously stunned by nature's beauty and aghast at its violence. At the same time, the ebb and flow of the poetic narrative gives character to the universal themes and forces one to introspect and to contemplate the very nature of existence. The philosophical undercurrents of the film are made doubly apparent through such vivid symbolism as the alligator, the bird, the snake, and the seed, all of which touch upon topics ranging from the intrinsic evil in nature to the nature of the soul, war, and God. Malick incorporates incredible cinematography to reinforce his claim that man and nature are organically interrelated and this gives the film a thematic depth that is far too rare in American cinema.Some have criticized the film for its lack of character development, but this is unjustified, Welsh learns the value of selflessness, Doll matures (moving from such lines as "I got one!" to his final monologue), and others such as Bell and Tall undergo even more subtle changes. More importantly, however, are the vivid characterizations of some of the more static, even archetypal characters, including the Christ-figure Witt (who ministers to the dying, clings to a seed of hope and keeps his distance from the evil surrounding him) and Staros.As to the plot, one could argue it's entirely unnecessary for a film such as this, but, as others have pointed out, there is indeed a plot, but the details are hidden behind their deeper ramifications and the movie's incessant symbolism. For some this will be disorienting, even frustrating, but it's a trend I would love to see continue, truly turning cinema into an art form.Many movies make us feel, think, cry, and laugh, but the last movie that made me reflect to the extent that this movie has was Apocalypse Now. Like that film, underappreciated in its time, The Thin Red Line will, in the years to come, be viewed as one of the apogees of American cinema; a film that exploits the medium and asks us to do one of the most subversive and frightening things of all, to look within.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful, if flawed, film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line, based on a novel by James Jones, is an epic story about a US Army attack on the Japanese held island of Guadalcanal during World War II. It is the first film directed by Terrence Malick since 1978. The Thin Red Line is a long (170 minutes), slow moving film that focuses on the philosophical aspects of war and man's relationship with nature more than on plot and character development. It is visually stunning with an emphasis on breathtaking imagery. The film boasts an impressive cast that includes Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrleson, John Cusack, John Travolta, and George Clooney even though unknown actor Jim Caviezel plays the main character, Private Witt. The film begins with Witt hiding on an island paradise while AWOL from his unit, Charlie Company. One of the film's key themes, nature's inherent violence and cruelty, is presented here. After Witt gets picked up, the film shifts to the actual fighting that takes place as Witt's Charlie Company makes the bloody and nearly impossible attack on the Japanese base on top of the island. The film's major characters drift in and out of the story line and are often indistinguishable due to the mud and blood covering the battlefield. The only regular soldier that stands out of this is Witt whose philosophical voice-overs present the soul of the film. Witt's voice-overs are matched by Sean Penn's great performance as the leader of Charlie Company, Sgt. Welsh. Nick Nolte gives the best performance of the film as the highly driven Lt. Col. Toll who forces the soldiers to continue the deadly campaign despite all setbacks. Toll, a life-long military man who is experiencing his first ever combat, is an interesting character who is solely a commanding officer and is detatched from the regular fighting men. Although the acting in the film is superb, the characters often fade into the background. The scenes of anonymous soldiers fighting and dying in battle and still shots of nature's beauty dominate the film. The driving force behind the film becomes the progression of these wonderful images that are only linked by the narration of the few main characters. Nominated for 7 Oscars including best director and best cinematography, The Thin Red Line is intensely thought provoking and a joy to watch. The film occasionally gets bogged down in the scale and number of the beautiful images that it presents. However, it is an interesting and beautiful film that should be seen by everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a critics dream: a boring, pretentious, artful mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in to this movie, I promised myself that I would not compare it to Saving Private Ryan. Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made. But I found myself doing it throughout the whole movie. This movie is so incoherent that I lost interest the last hour. Yes it is well made, and some images are truly memorable but the movie has no focus. It is content in being so "un-hollywood" that it loses the audience completely. I'm sure that Terrence Malick wanted to make a different type of war film, but the movie is too pretentious. the voice overs try to be so deep that they become a distraction. No characters are well drawn, the actors are just scenery really. I believe it was a mistake to have so many cameos by such known actors,they are also a distraction. I know that Private Ryan is more "commercial" but it at least presents a story that involves the viewer. I know that this is the type of movie that critics love,because the public at large doesn't, they back a film because of its "artfulness". I also believe that Oscar voters were completely wrong to nominate this film, The Truman Show was left out, A Simple Plan was ignored, why they would shut these movies out and nominate this piece of pseudo-intellectual garbage is a total injustice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Malick finds poetry even in war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is inevitable to compare The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan. The Malick film is thirty minutes too long, because the battle for the hill is complete in itself and the rest of the picture tries to give us practically the complete story of Guadalcanal. But it has a better story than the Spielberg film: the search for Private Ryan is too cute for the purposes of the director. Anyhow, the "war is hell" message is clear in both films. In "The Thin Red Line", Tarrence Malick has achieved the same wonderful poetry of his two previous films, even with a theme that is anything but poetic. His unfailing eye for details and beauty is there all the time. When I read the name of George Stevens Jr in the final credits, I realizad what I had been searching for all through the projection: Malick is a disciple of George Stevens, the successor of the Stevens of "The Talk of the Town", "A Place in the Sun" and "Shane", not of the self-indulgent Stevens of the deplorable "Giant", and his return to movie making the best news of 1998. The music of Hans Zimmer has absolutely no competition as the best of the year and of many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I had little or no expectation entering the theatre for ?The Thin Red Line' For my money (and it seems I'm in the minority here) Saving Private Ryan (this year's other entry into the war-time, memory lane, and Oscar scrounging, sweepstakes) was without merit. And in that instance, probably because of Tom Hanks, at least I'd held high expectations.Anyway, I'd attempted to read one version of Terrence Malick's script sometime last year. To begin with it was 240 pages, with no thread that I could immediately identify, anywhere, to carry me through this volume. Many, many non-descript characters coming, leaving, dying, complaining. I couldn't keep it at all straight, so I put it down. I picked it up, no luck. I put it down. I picked it up. I put it down.John Sayles wrote a book called ?Thinking in Pictures'. The primary thrust of the book seemed to identify that a film's role (as different from a book) is to tell the story not merely through the text, the dialogue, but to use the pictures every bit as effectively in conveying the message to the viewer.Okay, now we're getting somewhere, I'm thinking. Terry Malick is an auteur, I tell myself. He has a vision. It is HIS vision and it is clear to him I say. Forget that what is on these pages is tedious, confusing, without story. He'll tell it with the pictures!And the pictures in The Thin Red Line are beautiful. When you put John Toll on the case, that's pretty much what you expect, and always what you get. He is a true craftsman.But there's still no story. And the movie does nothing.Maybe it's casting voodoo. For all his talent, Sean Penn continues to give more and more forgettable performances. For all his lack of talent, John Cusack is lucky to be able to give any performances at all. All the rest look like a line waiting for a cab outside the Viper Room at closing time: muscular, vacant, tepid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another way of seeing "Apocalypse now"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best war movies I have ever watched, and I really watched many war movies. There's a close resemblance with "Apocalypse Now" in the way the war is treated. While most movies show stupid plots and a lot of graphical violence, this movie is very intimate and shows how one feels war in one's soul. This movie, unlike most war movies protagonized by Americans, does not talk about "patriotism", "honor" and other nonsense idiots often relate to war. Actually, this movie is about humankind, it does not condemn war, nor does it condemn the United States's eternal search for war. The reasons for WWII are not even mentioned. This is a generic movie about humankind and evil, not WWII, and it's very good at that. The Japanese are not treated as devils against the good American boys: both sides are equal. You will probably be a bit confused about the characters, who is who, etc. I think this is totally intentional, and further enhances this terrific war movie - war is horror. The movie is long, but it could have been twice as long and it would still be great. If you care about the effects of war in human mind and humankind, watch this movie. If you are proud of war, go watch some of the several blockbuster movies that treat war as tolerable and treat the assassins human become as heroes. You know what blockbusters I'm talking about.</fullReview>

This film simply does not hold up under its own pretentions. Yes, there are some beautifully done sequences - unfortunately, there is so much movie that you simply can't stay interested. Nolte is wonderful. Travolta is embarrassing. Clooney has to choke on some of the most ridiculous dialogue (and he delivers it with his usual "we have a collect call from . . ." style). There are too many characters - there are WAY too many voiceovers.

		<fullReview>This is an incredibly beautiful film full of amazing images. It is told in a complex way, not focusing on one particular character but passing through the lives of many soldiers. It's set in WW2, particularly the battle in the Pacific. The film covers everything a film possibly can; at points it is incredibly tense (the run up to the beach landing and particular battles through out the film), it is horrific in its depiction of soldiers being maimed and killed, and then the next moment you are presented with the startling beauty of the environment in which the killing takes place. We constantly are taken back to the "natives" of these islands who at one point an awol soldier interviews in an almost documentary style (reminiscent of the style of Badlands and Days of Heaven, also by Terrence Malick - the director). Some critics have said his depiction of the islanders as pure and unspoilt to contrast with the US soldiers is naive to say the least - but they have failed to spot the fact that the islanders sing Christian songs brought by missionaries (they parade the Bible through their village) and have therefore already been "spoilt" by the outside world. TRL is a brilliant film which will be seen eventually as (one of ) the highpoint(s) in cinema of this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I must admit that the general beauty of the film really overwhelmed me: beauty of light, colors, subtle details, the emotions in the eyes of the protagonists, beauty of nature, the quietness before the storm of war, the hero, the soldier's wife, the music, the children swimming under water, etc etc...beauty almost everywhere even though death is omnipresent throughout the film. For that reason, the Thin Red Line is definitely worth seeing on a big screen. However, the movie is much too long (about an hour) and repetitive, and the pseudo-philosophy it vehiculates is not very new: I mean, 3 hours to convince you of something you already know (which is that war really is a terrible thing and that men should love each other) is a bit long don't you think? The worst part of the movie certainly has to do with the casting of Box office stars such as Travolta or George Clooney in two useless twenty seconds scenes that totally discredit the movie in terms of realism and credibility. Terrence Malick for sure is a real poet but his movie is too beautiful to be true.</fullReview>

And thank God it isn't !The main audience didn't really get to notice the plenty quotes taken from Homer (Odysee, Ilias) ; Nolte names him once ! But the most important thing is that this movie is not about war because war is just a device to prove how important the world is and so are the human beings living in this world (human beings = soldiers) .But in war we're just dirt, that's what the earth is made of - and so are the human beings / soldiers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How boring can a movie really get? I thought that the upper top of that scale had been reached many years ago, but then this movie hit the local cinema. When I first saw the trailer I thought that this would be a movie like "Saving Private Ryan" but I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I left the cinema. This movie is 3h long - The length good movies of today have - but somehow it felt like 6h. Like in Saving Private Ryan the acting is very good, especially Sean Penn, but unlike S.P.R the director isn't satisfying. I think I've heard a movie-journalist say, that Malick once said after he had made two big movies in the end of the 70'th that "just because one has made some great movies he doesn't have to continue doing only that" - so why not do something else - like collecting butterflies perhaps. So my advice to both Malick and everybody who is planning to watch this movie; start collecting butterflies instead - I can assure you it will not be more boring than this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So far, The Thin Red Line is the most INTIMATE war film I have ever seen and I liked it very much. I have to admit that this film is not for everyone. It is so abstract, poetic and philosophical in nature. Some of my interpretations goes like: not only people are destroying themselves but they are also ruining nature. It shows the evil that war brings. It was fortunate for me that I 'enjoyed' this film. This movie can't be compared with Saving Private Ryan. If Saving Private Ryan showed us the cruelty of war, The Thin Red Line made us venture into the consciousness/conscience of the soldiers who were directly in it. This movie is SO INTIMATE and thought provoking. Some will even argue how can a war movie can be so SLOW like The Thin Red Line. On this, I have to tell them that they have missed the point. This movie in its entirety tried to convey to the audience how some of those soldiers were thinking, feeling and acting during those unforgiving times. Saving Private Ryan made us abhor the war while The Thin Red Line will not only make you hate and feel the war but will also make you symphatize and emphatize with the victims of war - be it humans or nature. It will give you a glimpse on different points of views of soldiers while in war. I liked the visuals very much and the short battle scene on the hill - it was very tense and scary indeed. The sonics was not on par with Saving Private Ryan while the battle scene reminded me of Forrest Gump. I will not venture into the technicalities as I am not very good at it. The actors are convincing specially caviezel (pvt witt) whose face I really admired. He looked like very 'resolved' and it seems that he knows that he is in a war but can't really justify WHY he and the rest are in it! His thoughts were very philosophical. Chaplin as pvt bell also did a great acting. I felt the sorrow and the anguish that the pvt bell felt upon knowing that his wife wanted a divorce. The other actors did a wonderful job as well. I also liked Penn's welsh who said 'now, where's you spark' on witt's grave. Despite it's melodramatic nature, there are some whimsical moments in the film like a tribesman walking towards them and the barefooted tribesman who went with them through the jungle. True, funny but sad - depends on which perspective you look at it. I felt that most of the people who was in the movie theater with us last night didn't actually liked the movie (because of the phase) based on their reactions in the middle and after the film. We only saw the movie last night and I have to admit that I am still perplexed as to what the Thin Red Line is...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note: This post should be taken as a public-service announcement. It's intended as a guideline for any who have heard such mixed or negative things that they aren't sure, or who are afraid of finding it too disturbing. It was a movie _for me_ -- but then my tastes differ from many people's, so I'm not simply going to say "See it" because I don't think that's any more helpful than saying "It sux--" (If it isn't for you, this will help you decide that too; but this is not a put-down.) ==================================================== Isn't The Thin Red Line a film for the artistic, the critics, the cognoscenti and the literati who know, or think they know more about everything than the rest of us?No.It is a movie for anyone who has ever loved deeply, lost love or loved ones, feared dying or Death's power, struggled to comprehend how the world and rituals of childhood could be so deeply betrayed by life, and how the truths that seemed so clear as children could turn so murky and horrific -- has ever been struck mute with wonder at the beauty of sunset gleaming on a broken bottle, or mute with horror that rape could happen on a day that the world is silver-pure with snow --who has tried and failed and tried again to make some sense of what is happening within and without, in the world at large and in the secret heart -- who has asked questions that have no answers, or has gotten answers that failed to heal--who has learned terrible truths about the past, about Dachau and Katyn Forest and Prague Spring and Andersonville, and about the present as well --who has known love of family and friends and welcome and happiness, and has seen all these things fade -- who has tried to explain or sought explanation from one's peers, and received only blank incomprending stares in answer . . . who has been beaten down by the certainty of evil, and yet refused to give up utterly that spark of hope that there is meaning, there is love, there is truth in these things still ---- Is it for you? I don't know.It is an uncompromising movie -- relentlessly so, in many ways. We are used to movies that tell us "what to think," that cue us as definitely as though we were actors as to how we should react -- what emotion, what attitude, what judgment for each and every instant, each character, each event. We are used to "infodumps" -- explanatory sections wherein the main characters explain to each other things they would already know, explain how the technology works, what the bad guys' plans are, and how we will counteract them so that when things begin to get hot, we won't be left trying to puzzle out what is going on. This is utterly implausible, of course, for if these characters were, say, commandos, they would not have to explain to each other what their various weapons did or the strategic value of holding the high ground; sometimes this is overcome by the forcible placing of a symbolic "newbie" who stands in for us, (as the interpreter in Saving Private Ryan) and is told the information which is thus vicariously relayed to us with a semblance of plausibility. The classic example of the infodump is the James Bond movie, which begins with a bang, and then pauses the action long enough to explain to us, along with 007, the nature of the mission, the problems and all the components of the story which we will then watch unfold and fall together as inevitably as a Rube Goldberg machine's many parts. There is a real delight in watching a Rube Goldberg machine work out its routine (as with the beloved device at Logan Airport in Boston) and the infodump is the only practical way of conveying such necessary aspects to the audience on screen or stage -- unlike the printed page, where the authorial voice may explain anything in any way to the audience in the course of telling the story. (This is why Hunt for Red October the book was so much more suspenseful and satisfying than Hunt for Red October, the film: Clancy was free to give us all the needed setup of the blind groping chase of deadly monsters in a deadly darkness, so that when the final anticlimactic smash comes it is both a surprise and utterly perfectly in place.) However, there is no reality whatsoever in the style of film which tells us who to cheer for, who to boo at, who will die and when and where, and why, and what principles we all ought embrace -- or rather assumes them, assumes overpoweringly that we hold them and carries us along with image and music as though being dragged along by a loud and charismatic friend before we have time to decide if we want to go or not. But ironically enough, we are so used to it that we almost cannot deal with a film that does not explain and reveal its whole plot, ahead of time, and again and again throughout, repeating the basic notes so that we will not have time to forget anything important. Ronin is a good example of that: the plot was indeed tight and complex, the characters well-drawn -- but it was so unlike any contemporary "spy movie" that few moviegoers felt that this was so. (It was, in fact, an _espionage_ movie, in the line of that classic, The Third Man or a John LeCarre novel.) Thin Red Line is thus uncompromisng: from the moment that the title sequence darkens -- itself a clear reminder that this is a work of art with its swirling imagery of fire and immortality -- to open again on the sinister yet impressive image of a primordial monster, eye level to Leviathan in the impenetrable jungle, there is nothing which breaks the integrity of the story except the fact that it is, indeed, on-screen. All but two brief instants are shot from eye-level -- yet one does not notice this at all; it is simply that one is thrust into this world of horror and weird beauty to make ones way through it, figuring out who these people are that we are with, what their relations are to each other, to themselves, what is going on about them -- forced sometimes to revise our estimations, even as the world around them is rushing past without consideration for their individual troubles and conditions.

The only voices are those of the characters, who speak to each other and to themselves, reflecting with depth or utter shallowness on the situations they find themselves in, posturing to each other in dominance struggles or nakedly revealing their souls to trusted friends. The only visual violations of "reality" are the mental images that they see in the mind's eye, which break in -- without any of the conventional cues -- upon the world that they are physically seeing, even as such images intrude upon us -- memories, fancies, dreams -- without so much as a by-your-leave or an invitation. And more challengingly, we are left to work out whose visions each are, whose minds' eye we are seeing through -- be it the eyes of a village child of an occupied island, a wistful wife looking out over the same sea that washes her West Coast beachfront as the bloody shores of the Slot, a man remembering a personal tragedy as a surreal drama, or a man whose concrete reality has become a surreal drama of slowed time and meaningless sound as every sense, every sensation is ravaged in a contradiction of known reality in what is so blandly-termed "shell- shock" Nor is there for us, any more than for the people who were there, a convenient deus-ex- machina to place before us on the air the translation of our enemies' words; this fact, the absence of subtitles, seems to elicit more baffled irritation from viewers than it would deserve -- especially considering that it is a truism that "Americans won't watch movies with subtitles"! It is amusing that we expect that foreigners' words will be translated for us on screen, as natural and realistic -- even though if white words were to appear in public at such an occasion, surely the most sober journals would speedily resemble the Inquirer and Star! So this is not an easy movie to watch, in some ways -- it does not cue us in any of the conventional ways we have subconsciously come to expect. It is also challenging, uncompromising, in terms of dramatic structure: like a Shakespeare play, each line is simultaneously important in the momentary context, and in terms of the wider story that so carefully unfolds from a single, unified beginning. The first time I saw it I missed four minutes in the middle -- and missed a scene which then both explained and was explained by other scenes later on. But the first time I saw it, I thought for the first two thirds of it that it was a series of lyrically-brutal vignettes, poignant images as in a stage-play, and I simply appreciated it as that . .. and then suddenly, horrifically, I realized that all that had come before was now working to a fulfillment -- that everything that had been said or done or shown was leading with an inexorability -- not the logic of the Rube Goldberg machine, but the logic of a murder after twenty-years' hate, or the logic of a marriage after long unspoken devotion -- to some terrible and magnificent conclusion that I dared not anticipate. (And so it was, and proved to be better than I could have hoped for, without disappointment in the trivializing of it.)It is also an audacious play in that it utterly defies all movie conventions, all modern and many classical dramatic traditions of portrayal and structure by showing us characters who are at once sharply drawn and shadowy, like a swiftly-sketched charcoal portrait by a master hand. We are not told who these people are, even as they must work out for themselves who each one is, who he or she chooses to be, so we too must work it out with them. They have histories, they have personalities, they have places in their souls and lives that are hidden even to themselves; they change and flux in relation to their situations and the people around them. They are not carved in stone, and placed in front of us with little defining labels, to remain one thing for the whole story -- for they are as complex, contradictory, and unique as any of us, our friends or enemies. And as in the real world, they each view things differently, from the facts of a personal relationship to the nature of the universe. But far worse than that is the fact that none of these people is a "type" -- not one fits into the niche which drama has prepared us to look for, whether it be Evil Overlord or Rebel Hero, Impudent Child or Spunky Heroine, Bumbling Sidekick or Pathetic Little Person, Mysterious Prophet or Obtuse Authority Figure, Suave Cad or Sneering Beauty, or the Stupid and Obnoxious Person Who Must Die Horribly To Cue Us To The Danger That Lies Ahead. Some of them are smart, some shallow and clever, some solidly- conventional, others utterly oblivious to the rules of society. They are scared when any reasonable, sane human being would be scared utterly out of his mind; when they are heroic, they stammer and stumble over words, instead of declaiming them ringingly; they repeat themselves; they die as easily as any other man -- or as hard and painfully. Just deserts and poetic justice do not happen to them, any more than they happen to us in everyday life (usually) and random dumb luck plays a part in things, but so does deliberate malice and the kindness of not-total-strangers as well as friends. Some of them think a lot; others of them hardly think at all. Those who think also do, and those who do without thinking may come to regret it. Friendship is there, but the friendship and enmity of those who have known each other so long that relations are assumed more than talked about, and we who are outsiders must figure out what is not being said...[to be continued]</fullReview>

It was a movie _for me_ -- but then my tastes differ from many people's, so I'm not simply going to say "See it" because I don't think that's any more helpful than saying "It sux--" (If it isn't for you, this will help you decide that too; but this is not a put-down.) ===================================================&gt; Is it for men? -- No.Is it for military history buffs? --- Again, no.It is for anyone who ever dreamed with Heyerdahl on Kon Tiki and Mowgli in the jungle ... for anyone who finds a strange echo in the soul at names like Kwajalein and Enewitok, Tulagi and Leyte and Wake Island and Truk Lagoon, Rangoon and Rabaul and Port Moresby and the Marianas -- for anyone who dreams of travel to far-off lands where strange people and stranger customs hold sway... where like any traveler what you bring away will depend upon what gifts you bring with you.As those who favor trial dramas will undoubtedly know, there is an element of unreliabiity in every witness -- our challenge is to find out what our own witness's unreliability is, and see past it. If you "know" that war is about the destruction of nature and man's depradations, then that is what you will see -- even though there plainly shown is the jungle's inexorability to swallow up men and machinery without a trace (it requires millions of civilians with motor-cars to overthrow a rain-forest, not a few thousand infantrymen with guns: in two days an entire B-24 could be swallowed up in the Pacific jungles after a crash.) If you come knowing what a revetment is, and why the high ground must be held or taken, whence the need for air superiority and what, exactly, is a siege -- well, you will not realize that you know these things already, since you will not have them pressed upon you over and over again via infodump. If on the other hand you do not know what a BAR is or a DC-3/C47 or the several meanings of "flank" or how far a Zero can fly before refueling or what range a fixed 70 mm machine-gun can cover -- well, you don't really need to know, because things come and are as they are, and the world does not accommodate us to our lack of information but we must adapt to it, and what you know or don't know doesn't change some things. (But you can, if you wish, easily find out about these things, and more, in a few hours reading or a few weeks.) If you already know that Rank Has Its Privileges but you Salute The Uniform, Not The Man -- that No Battle Plan Survives Contact With The Enemy, and how to Hurry Up And Wait -- then you will likely find little surprising; appalling perhaps, but not terribly surprising. If on the other hand your view of the Military Industrial Complex is born of Dr. Strangelove or Wargames, then you may not be surprised either -- but you should be. If names like Bataan and Corregidor mean nothing to you, then you may or may not be surprised (but certainly appalled, one hopes) but even if they do, unless the code-name Cactus rings a bell, you will still be astonished and probably dubious about certain things -- but they are all true, and documented, in one form or another, for though TRL calls itself fiction, there is more fact in it than in many purported docudramas.Isn't it slow?-- boring? --pretensious?"Only the boring are bored--" --or as the French phrase it , "I bore myself."It is measured. Deliberate. Except in nightmares, when are we ever thrown into the midst of a raging battle (unless so unfortunate as to experience an air-raid) without warning, without packing, without much carrying of _stuff_ and unpacking of _stuff_ and putting up of tents and so forth and so on? There is a time that must be lived before any event, and there is a time that must be lived after it, unless one dies; one does not in life have the liberty of fast-forwarding any more than rewinding, however we wish it were otherwise. But it is not boring to those who do not choose to be bored, any more than life itself is necessarily boring as we live it, even when we are not being shot at or chased by sinister foes for mysterious reasons--But -- is it not too horrible? Too gore-stricken? Too awful?--Yes.--Not at all.It doesn't allow you to _look away_ from what happens to people when sharp or hot or suddenly-projected things encounter them with abruptness -- yet it doesn't insist on plunging you into the depths of such carnage without companionship, without mercy. There is shocking horror, but there is also mercy, the mercy of smoke that hides the naked frame from the enemy's eye as from the eye of command; the mercy of a kind hand guiding a friend through the field of hell, the mercy of brotherhood, brotherhood of blood indeed; "things must get worse before they get better," and that is the truth. The suffering, the shame, the raw torture are not cruelly displayed for a gloating voyeur: they are suffered by those with whom we are, with whom we travel and tremble and weep ---- But is it not anti-war? --anti-military? --propaganda?No. That is not it at all. Those questions are simply immaterial. We are in hell, and we must endure. It does not matter how we got here, or why, or what cause or command put us here; we must do as we can, as best we can, however much or little that may be. The enemy we face is not this man or that, our own commander or the other sides -- the Enemy here is Death, and that which is behind Death, whether we believe it to be blind unknowing Chaos or a dark and lonely Power opposed to light and Life----Is it for you?--It is for anyone who has been in hell and longed for heaven-- --Whoever does not study history is doomed to repeat its errors.

		<shortDescription>Total directorial self-indulgence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that the photography was marvelous. The voice-overs gave us insight into what the characters were thinking, feeling, etc. The acting was superb, particularly Nolte and Penn. The nature shots were insightful and beautiful. The metaphors also gave meaning to this film and gave us a link between humanity and the cruelty of war. The cutaways to the natives too gave us additional insight, but until the end of the movie, left me confused as to time and place and relevance to what appeared to be the central story.These were all great things. But sometimes more is not better, it is just more, and in this case, the good things were overdone to the point of frustrating the viewer. This movie reeks of excess and directorial self-indulgence ad nauseum.Had Malick used a portion of all of these good things instead of beating us to death with them, and cut this film by about 1 hour +, the film might have left me a lot less frustrated.The best part of this film was the insight it gave into the horrors of war, for all. The Japanese (the enemy) were just as sympathetic, and we realized they too, were human beings caught up in the cruelties of war.I am not quite sure why people compare this with Private Ryan, other than that they were both WWII movies. Private Ryan had a definitive storyline, which this movie lacked. The beginning could have been the end, it mattered not. The juxtopposition that Thin Red Line is unclear totally as to time in history, (and now, having read that these men were for the most part, cleanup after the main invasion, is totally unbeknownst to the viewer) to the excesses is an enigma. Other than the obvious "horrors of war" message, this movie totally lacked a storyline, and I found myself wondering, what was the point? On the other hand, what should have been subtlety was rammed down one's throat. I wanted to scream, "All right already, we get it! Enough!!" It was over-everything'd to death and I must say that I am extremely frustrated because Malick took what started out to be inventive and creative and turned it into a vehicle for directorial self-indulgence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent, and extremely thought-provoking war movie with fine performances by all the cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being someone who does not often get (or make) the opportunities to see more thought-provoking, cerebral, philosophical type of movies, I found this movie extremely refreshing after a constant diet of the run-of-the-mill cliched Hollywood action-movies. I enjoyed the performances of all the cast, particularly James Caviezel as Witt, a soldier who contemplates the contradictions of war. Terrence Malick manages to use the action only as a vehicle to explore the emotions and thoughts of the numerous characters who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances for which no one can prepare.Probably the thing that grabbed me the most (admittedly speaking as someone who has not seen many war movies) was the fear portrayed by the soldiers. It's nice to see that soldiers aren't the Arnie, Bruce Willis' or Jean Claudes Hollywood likes us to believe they are. All the soldiers were s***-scared, just as they should be!Well worth seeing (esp. if you like to think), and the type of movie worth seeing again and again in order to fully appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Flow? Not in this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like a movie to flow onwards, so you can be caught up in the story, don't go expecting it from this one. The movie starts off very slowly, gets slower &amp; by the time the action starts is the time you are about to fall asleep. The action will catch your attention &amp; wake you up, but after the short piece of action the story will fall back into its slow moving pace &amp; drag on again for another eternity until a little more action at the end. The characters are never built up correctly &amp; there is plenty of time in the movie for this to have happened.One of the worst casting decisions of the decade has to go to the person who put John Travolta in the role he was in. Mr Travolta can play numerous characters &amp; is generally very good at portraying them. I'm not sure if it was the poor makeup job on him, but he really wasn't believable at all to me in the role cast.Nick Nolte put in a good effort, as did Sean Penn who was probably the standout of all the major stars.Overall not a very good attempt at creating the atmosphere of the time, with too many big name stars which I feel took away from the attempt to make this lifelike. How this movie was ever nominated for any Academy award is beyond me. This was not a visually stimulating movie, as it tried too hard to be one. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary meditation on good, evil and the meaning of violence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A voice over at the beginning of this extraordinary three hour photo essay and filmic poem poses a question. Witt, a mystical embodiment of the light of the human spirit, asks why nature contends with itself? Does this contention exemplify two forces, good and evil? The film goes onto answer these ruminations with a depth of poetic imagination and intellectual rigour rarely found in the cinema and especially Hollywood cinema.Showing a number of men from C company battling for control of a hill on the small Melanesian island of Guadalcanal a number of possible answers to the intial questions are played out and tested. Cleverly the director shys away from involvement with either character or narrative. He doesn't want us to think that everything will be ok in the end because we won the war (something the participants were not so sure about), nor does he want us to be horrified at the sight of violence simply because we identify with one or another of the characters. He wants to see what the range of possible responses the human spirit develops when placed in an appalling situation.Nick Nolte, a tyrannical Zeus of a commander represents the ends justifies the means argument. Sean Penn's character tries to turn himself to stone, without feelings, without fear. Another draws on the love he has for his wife for spiritual strength. Witt is the one closest to an idea of God and he passes through the film like Christ on the road to Emmaus, only ever partially recognized by his comrades. Ironically it is the tough Sean Penn character who understands him best.Interestingly, as so many people seem to be comparing Saving Private Ryan with this film, the central question of Private Ryan is posed by the commander, Nolte, to his second in command, Koteas, about halfway through the Thin Red Line. Nolte asks what is the value of a human life in relation to the war and its objectives overall? How many lives are worth losing for a particular hill? Koteas dismisses the question, regarding it as unanswerable. This profoundly moral response deals with Spielberg's rather juvenile question in about 2 minutes. (Matt Damon might be worth the effort but what if it was the neurotic Jewish map reader the platoon were looking for?)So the Thin Red Line answers its own intial questions in two ways. It refuses the notion that there are two forces, good and evil, in nature. There is however life and death, but these are not opposites as death leads to new life. That makes the problem of good and evil a distinctly human one to which a number of responses are possible.It is difficult to say that one is superior to another. I don't think Mallick is running a single argument like that. He is more interested in the breadth of human response. This breadth spoke to me about compassion for humanity and the character who embodied that most was Witt. As he walked through the chaos of the conquered Japanese camp I felt compassion for the vanquished as well as the victors. What is sacrificed in war is humanity itself and to a lesser extent innocence, yet compassion can redeem both of these things.War does not enoble men, as the film says, it makes them into beasts. What the Thin Red Line offers is a way to think about both nature (life and death) and compassion as powerful redemptive forces which can and do exist in the most depraved of circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sort of film seems out of place today. When we walk away from movies, week after week, knowing exactly what to think and feel. The strength of this film is that it doesn't tell us how to react. It doesn't push all of our buttons for us. The problem with Saving Private Ryan, while I did like it, is that it held our hand through every emotion. The Thin Red Line is more layered and ambiguous. With the cacophony of voices and the seemingly plotless progression, it captured the spiritual and emotional chaos of war. The monotonous absurdity of it all. The Thin Red Line is a very personal movie. In that it works in a fluid way with the viewer. Everyone can walk away with their own interpretation. After I saw this film I felt as if someone was finally showing a world I could believe in, a world I could feel. I had a shock of recognition: I too have looked at life this way. I have asked these questions. At the end, I felt a sense of wonder that has stayed with me even a month after seeing it.Audiences today should applaud this kind of film. Art should disturb us, move us, and force us to reevaluate our preconceptions. To examine our lives and our world. It's art and film like The Thin Red Line that truly respect the audience, by even allowing their possible dissent. This is what films should strive for. To challenge us and to invite us to enter a world of wonder. Even if that means that some won't get it or won't like it.Looking at the other comments I am struck by what a vital work this film is. The range of opinion shows what a living and breathing work it is. Films that everyone can love are too easy. The Thin Red Line is challenging and yet inviting. Asking us for three hours to sit and view life as a dream. A dream that is both beautiful and terrifying. After all of the Hollywood formulas hurled at us year after year it is time for cinema to truly rise to its potential as the purest form of poetry there is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Experience is something that you and I can share. I can tell you I had a cheese bagel for lunch. I can get into explicit details of the flavor, texture, colours, smells even how it sounded when I bit into it. With all of these experiences working together, you may be able to understand the experience of eating a cheese bagel even if you have never tried one. This is what the movie did to tell it's story.This film gave me the flavor, texture, colours, smells and sounds of its story. But it did it using experiences I am used to. Experiences like dealing with irony, being dumped, bliss, calm, fear, trying to figure out my role in the world, how humans relate to nature, and so on. Therefore, I was told a story using my own experiences so I can completely understand what is going on in the context of its subject matter.But how did they know? How did they know what I was thinking? Most American films will condescend you. They will tell you questions to ask, tell you what to think, and then finally answer the questions for you. This film respects what you are thinking, asks you some questions, and then asks you to answer them for yourself. That is absolutely mastering this medium.Unfortunately, this is where it lost some of the audience. Likely because the modern "American Film" audience does not expect to have to think while being entertained. There's certainly room for "entertainment for entertainment's sake", however it's all too common place. This makes "The Thin Red Line" shine even more."The Thin Red Line" allows us to experience experience.That makes it nothing short of brilliant.</fullReview>

It was like that bouncing ball of Mitch Miller's.I give it no stars but am eternally grateful for the theater since it had REAL BUTTER.And by the way: In case you should forget.

		<fullReview>Problem Number One : When writing a screenplay, one should at least attempt to make it possible for the audience to relate to at least one character. In this film, so many shallow and disoriented characters came and went that I was left grasping for someone to like. Ok, so maybe that's very Hollywood of me. Well, then how about - Problem Number Two : - an intriguing plot. I'm not sure this film had a plot. A message, yes. In fact, a very well contructed and beautifully presented message. However, that is not enough to fill a three hour film. Problem Number Three : The excessive and unnecessary cameos. John Travolta and George Clooney were not needed and distracting. Unfortunate is the word that comes to mind. Problem Number Four : The voiceovers and "memory" sequences. Again, excessive and distracting. Perhaps if we were allowed to be sure who we were rooting for, the memories would have been more effective. But, the focus switched seemingly randomly, and so they didn't work. Nick Nolte was excellent, and the cinemetography was fantastic. Perhaps Malick should watch a few Fellini films before his next attempt at "art".</fullReview>

The movie could need his acting-style to break the boringness of this movie. Nick Nolte and Sean Penn are both good in this movie but sometimes you could think this is a swedish film with staring faces and poetic language. George Clooney said maybe 2 lines. I don't think that this movie should be nominated for best picture. Perhaps for best photography. Now I hope that Travolta can show his talent in Primary Colors and A Civil Action. Hes one of the best actors ever and Im really disappointed tonight. I mean they could really give him more than 2 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About an hour after settling into my nice comfy high-back chair, I began fiddling in my left ear and discovered a rogue hair growing far out away from its pals. I tugged on it and found it rather tenacious. The pain this tugging caused was mildly pleasurable, but after a while I gave the hair a good yank and its short life was over My nose hairs need plucking more regularly too.Later on, the cinema whisperer who is always behind me on my right (4 o'clock high), started up. This time he was a young lad, continually asking his father questions like, ?Why did that man fall over?', ?What's that red stuff he's holding? Why does he keep staring?Why indeed does Private Witt keep staring? And staring. For once I was not irritated by such dumb cinema noise. I had finally given up caring after two hours that seemed like five, yet this crashing bore of a movie droned on for nearly another hour in much the same manner.To be honest I was suspicious from the early scenes which were un-involving and documentary like. But this was Terrence Malick I said, who had given us two superb films in the seventies, he knows what he's doing, so sit back and enjoy the lovely scenery. Well it was nice and we saw lots of it, again and again; Lots of fabulous shots of light streaming through the tree-tops; Little story mind. Little characterisation though as we are introduced to many characters in a fleeting manner, all rather numb and one-paced.When the action finally kicks in it is very effective and gruesome. However having had such a brief introduction to the characters we don't know how to relate and can't feel for them. They're just Grunts. Some with stomachs, some without.Nolte gives us the strongest performance as the pushy colonel, but it is also the most physical. The performances of the other actors take place behind the eyes, we see what they feel, what they are thinking. Voice-over after voice-over relate some grunt's philosophical mumblings. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so repetitive and half the time I couldn't distinguish one grunt from another, they were all so similar.The central performance of Jim Caviezel as the human AWOL was the most tedious of all. A face to get fed up with.It is Malick who is seriously at fault here, over-doing the beautiful haunting imagery, the flashbacks and the voice-overs, and under-doing the story. He re-visits the well dug trenches of Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Parts - War is hell, men become savages, generals are morons, doesn't this little scenario sum up the stupidity of war etc etc. Only this time it's shot like some new age nature documentary where a bit of David Attenborough's clearer diction would have certainly been of help.Only David would have cut better. A good hour could have been sliced out with little loss to the story. What would have been far better though would have been better dialogue and more rounded characterisations.I bet they were there in the book.The music score matched the visual proceedings perfectly, being one-noted and always straining toward a point of finality without ever reaching it. When I found out it was from Hans Zimmer whose scores never fail to bore me, it all made sense. The cinematography however was superb throughout,the images were stunning, the action set pieces, exceptional and gruesome.Be poetic and haunting Mr. Malick but please get on with it next time; and I sincerely hope there'll be a next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Red Line asks that we...glimpse this baffling opera of poems, visions, lost ways and recovered footholds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The swell of negative reviews regarding The Thin Red Line was to be expected. It is not the film that is at fault but the viewers' expectation of what modern filmmaking should be. Moreover, the negative reviews are a symptom of a much larger complex moving virtually unrecognized in the hearts of post-industrial, information-wrangling men and women, because it is so fundamental and abstract. Luckily, we have language to betray this complex, and human behavior, and the ways in which we respond to such works of art as Malick's film to provide a symptomatology of what this complex is like, underneath.First of all, life is changing shape at a pace that is too fast, like clay breaking apart on a sculpting wheel. Fast is better, right? Mankind isn't sure where it is going, but it takes great confidence in the fact that it is getting there quickly and efficiently. Malick's film does not proceed in accordance with this pace, striking its own boundaries and seeping where it will. It is in fact a truer cadence which his film follows . . . the cadence of dreams. The Thin Red Line not only defies this pace but asks the question, "Man, where wills he and how does he go?" From the lush scenery to the expanding clouds of smoke and cloud cover, Malick's film is sublimely organic and at times seems to have a life of its own, much as life itself. Stripped of a mold, temporarily deprived of the nine-to-five authority of structure, another structure takes over--that of the spirit--the true subject of Malick's film.Second, men and women have come to expect less and less from movies, as their lives quicken and their attention is drawn out, making them victims rather than apprentices of their dreams . . . dreaming, that annoying stuff that wakes us in terror and confounds our waking selves. Now, modern cinema is sought not as a source of growth but a perpetuation of one's inattention to himself. Men and women want entertainment, not more of that cryptic stuff that addles us and draws us back in, away from the comfort of our worldly structure. Here again, The Thin Red Line defies the outward norm. It teaches as much as it entertains.Amorphous and lacking prominent personal characterizations, Malick's film assumes the perspective of the detached observer. His film is like a dream, and every person, every blade of grass--in fact every living thing--plays a part in this dream. Part of Malick's genius lies in objectifying the film almost to ambiguity, then challenging the viewer to feel unbiased compassion, not just for its characters, but for everything contained within the four borders of the screen--ultimately the world outside the screen itself! It challenges the viewer to engage in the highest of all practices: a tolerance of judgment and an abolishment of phony, man-made boundaries, at the same time seeking to resurrect those emotional allegiances which would have their way with our petty elitism, our fraternizing, and our contrived disputes; love and compassion forged selflessly if but for a moment in time--one-hundred and seventy of them to be exact.Third, mankind no longer believes in the usefulness of its dreams, in the wisdom of the self and of the individual. That is to say, dreams make no "sense" in the typical meaning of the word. And once again, it would go against the pace set by organized society to plunge into a realm which exists outside of time, is in no hurry to get where it is going, and appears to have entirely forsaken cause-and-effect. Few would suggest a serious interpretation of those dreamy artifacts, using conventional modes of thinking. But it is exactly this that Malick's Red Line wishes the viewer to do. It would not have him abandon his daily life but welcome it into it, unearthing something heretofore unknown to him and his reason.Yes, finally, The Thin Red Line asks that we step out of the mainstream, briefly, to glimpse its oftentimes baffling opera of poems, visions, lost ways and recovered footholds. And here is the secret to Malick's film: The Thin Red Line is an example of what one would get if he were to arrange all the routine-shattering moments of day-to-day living according to his desire to find meaning in them, in a way that brought him peace, tolerance and understanding. It is a lucky person who finds himself, despite breakneck scheduling and deadlines, capable of assembling similar operas out of his dreams.In conclusion, perhaps it is not Malick's pretentiousness that gets people most about his movie, but the pretentiousness of the viewer. At least with Saving Private Ryan humans are cast starring roles. But must we still after all these centuries succumb to the outright self-importance that once made humans believe that their Sun revolved around the Earth? The Thin Red Line is not a bad film; simply, a method of critiquing it does not exist today. Rather it should be judged on its own merits, making use of impressions the viewer gets toward it, months down the line. Could a better film have been made? It is likely, but not until after another twenty years of development, and even then probably by those who have studied Malick's works at length and struggled to perfect those within a similar vein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wings of Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line represents Terrence Malick's return to movie making after a twenty year hiatus. For his subject he chose James Jones autobiographical novel telling the story of a platoon of army grunts during WWII, sent into Guadalcanal just after the Marine invasion, to clean up the remnants of Japanese resistance from that island. Little did they know that this clean up operation would last more than six months and take the lives of many.IMHO, the best part of this movie are the looks. Visually, this movie is stunning. The cinematography really shows us a paradise on earth, one which we know and fear will soon be despoiled by war. The story line can best be described as a long, sometimes rambling philosophical discussion on war, men, and their internal conflicts as they are asked to kill or be killed, sometimes in the most seemingly senseless way. Most of the movie contains voice over narrations of the characters thoughts. In this the movie resembles closely Wim Wenders classic art-house flick "Wings of Desire", where the angels in the movie can hear the humans' thoughts (this film was very poorly remade as "City of Love" last year; do yourself a favor and rent the original). TRL uses the same narrative technique, except the characters (and there are quite a number of them) are even less clearly defined, thereby giving us the sense that these soldiers are nameless and faceless, just more cannon fodder attempting to stay sane in an incredibly insane situation. Before the second reel, several of them have already lost their sanity, and it is questionable whether the more-or-less lead character himself is sane.Many people have commented that this is not a war movie, which is partially true. Comparisons to the other recent war flick, "Private Ryan", are also inevitable. To be fair, the battle scenes in this movie, though not very extensive, are among the best ever filmed, the equal or perhaps superior to the famous "Private Ryan" scenes. But the narrative is different. This movie is more of an artsy movie, albeit an artsy war movie.Great performances by Nick Nolte as the aging coronel who wants as much glory as he can muster from his one and only big war. Although the pic is chock full of some of the best male actors in the businees (Sean Penn, John Cusack, Ben Chaplin, Jon Savage), their roles are not really juicy enough to warrant a lot of attention. For exmaple George Clooney appears in the movie for one scene, and John Travolta for a scene and half; it's hard to give either a good or a very bad performance in 20 seconds. From what I understand, Malick actually shot something like 100 hours worth of footage, which he had to pare down to only 3. I'm curious whether some of the footage left on the cutting room floor would've fleshed out the characters or focused the film better. As it is, it's difficult to ask anyone to sit through three hours of ruminations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Mallick came out of his Kubrickesque hibernation to make this fascinating, yet flawed, war picture which is anything but conventional. People will love it or hate it, however I fall somewhere in between. It could have been great had it not been for the film's snail-like pace. It is very good because it is a meditation on war with some strong performances and it is one of the most beautifully-shot color films I have ever seen. I also admire Malllick for not ending it with an apocalyptic battle scene which seems essential in modern-day filmmaking (although the film could have contained more substance over style for the final 1/2 hour).By now, anyone reading knows the backdrop for this WWII epic, so we'll cut to the performances, none of which stand out with the exception of the main character, who's name still escapes me, Ben Chaplin, and Nick Nolte as a crazed General. The big-name performances are basically showcases to keep a sleepy viewer awake and its reputation high. None really give to the film's 'story' or relate to the characters we even care about in the slightest way. Obviously, Mallick is well-respected within the industry and no matter what you think, I would not be surprised if it won the Oscar (really). Mallick may not tell a great story here or focus enough, but it is technically brilliant.The movie lingers like a dream, especially because of its look. The swaying weeds and grass are reminiscent of Mallick's previous efforts, "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven". If only he was able to project more of a pulse, we would care more about the brutality of the battle scenes and the consequences of what happens in the film. Anyone can blow people up in battle pictures, but you need emotional connection with the characters for it to be effective. Again, I must say the film did effect me in some odd way because of its beauty and originality. This will undoubtedly go down as a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was worthwhile waiting for 20 years for Terrence Malick to make another movie after brilliant pieces "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven". This time he has done a World War II saga based on the classic autobiographical novel of James Jones from 1963, "The Thin Red Line". Anyone who has read the novel knows how difficult it is to display the thoughts of the soldiers in war on the big screen. Malick did that beautifully, with such grace, and completely realistic. I know that, because I was a soldier in war for four years.When you leave the theatre you will have inserted in your mind questions of the dying soldiers "Why are you killing us?", and you will understand that the war is complete waste of human lives. In few words, Terrence Malick has made another masterpiece.</fullReview>

I'll be the first to admit that USA saved us europeans from Hitlers terror, and we are forever grateful for that. But that last shot ruined everything, because what Spielberg told us was in fact this; The only ones who paid the great price on the "altar of freedom" were americans. The 20 million russians or the 6 million french and the countless brits (and germans) that did the same are, by that ending, reduced to nothing. So only american parents lost someone they loved? Frankly, it's an insult.And that's why The Thin Red Line is such a masterful film. Because it tells that whoever dies, we all lose. There's no winning in war. So what's new, you might ask? We all know war is hell. Yeah, but this is the first war movie I've ever seen where that's made the sole point. All the other ones SHOW you war is hell, but ultimately TELLS you that it's "worth the sacrifice in the end". No such thing here. And that is why people are going to keep talking about this masterpiece long after the negative to SPR is lost.Do I have to add that there isn't a single bad performance in the film?

		<fullReview>I think this film has been misunderstood, and the poetic elements and or themes have been missed. I found it very analytical, very alone and breathing with the human condition. It seemed to touch every emotion, the fear in Men, the passion in Men, the Bloodlust in Men, and the Chaos in Man.I think more films should be more like this, not neccesarily the story, but using the same poetic symbolism and technique. It shows War being a crime for being itself, no one prevails, no one basks in glory, everyone seems to be ripped apart in the chaos. I found this War epic much more informant on the emotional complex of these men then I did in Saving Private Ryan.Many friends of mine said they became restless and just wanted to get on with it and for it to end already, but isn't that how Men felt in this war. I thank Terrence Malick for making such a brilliant piece of Art and hopefully one day I will do the same. Pure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never knew I could care so little...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie with a good buddy of mine one fine afternoon a few weeks back, and left the theater feeling ripped-off and ticked-off. How this movie could be called "brilliant" is beyond me. Smaller movie company and artsy director DOES NOT equal brilliant. I see that many supporters of the film say that people like myself are too "shallow" to truly "get it". Well, I can't really say what I want to, because that would violate this fine site's guidelines. First off, a movie is supposed to make you care about the main characters. I didn't care about ANY of them. Sean Penn? Nope. John Cusack? Nope. Nick Nolte? Great performance, but no. John Travolta? George Clooney? They were in the movie? Someone died? Great! Less people to not care about. Second, end the stupid movie, already! I thought the danged thing was over after the bunker scene! Guess not! Also, a plot would've been nice. I know it's "artsy" and "brilliant" not to have one, but it kinda helps explain what's happening at a given point. As it was after Saving Private Ryan, the theater was dead quiet after the movie, but this time, it was a "what the...?" kind of quiet. One guy even stood up and said "What the hell was THAT!?!?", and everybody clapped. Now, I'm a junior in college, and I consider myself a pretty smart guy, but I guess it takes a certain type of person to "get" this movie. It's pretty easy to assign a meaning to something after the fact, but not every single piece of art is worthy of the title "genius". Especially not this atrocity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bastardization of James Jones' classic novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did we get to this god-awful place? What the hell has happened to the world we once knew? These are questions audience members of The Thin Red Line asked themselves as the lights went up in the theater, and they soon went on to rail against the prices of movie tickets and popcorn and the abysmally long lines in theater restrooms. Hell, they may never see a movie again after watching this travesty.The Thin Red Line, a classic novel by James Jones, told the story of real men in war. It's a story about the primary battles soldiers face--the fight against cowardice and the bureaucracy of their own army--more than the secondary battle against the enemy. You learn that war isn't about heroes; it's about mistakes, meaningless death, and misplaced priorities.Starting from the strong base of a brilliant novel and an able cast (including a wonderful performance by Nick Nolte), it must have been hard work indeed to make such a horrible film. If you must see The Thin Red Line, wait until afterward to read the novel. It's the only way to get through a screenplay that makes a sow's ear out of a silk purse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliance is often misunderstood when it's a far cry from the familiar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of war movies, it was refreshing to finally see a new perspective on it all. While films like "Saving Private Ryan", which is a decent film as far as realism is concerned, capitalize on violence and tend to be weak on heart and philosophy, "The Thin Red Line" is able to meld a number of different people's experience of the war into a single, Zen-like throughline which is as brilliantly poetic as it is realistic.Unlike most typical 'Hollywood' stylized films, "The Thin Red Line" is not single-character driven. Many of director Terrence Malick's lengthy and sweeping camera shots are more like european cinema, with its shot driven scene driven action which is an uncommon phenomenon among the average audience at a typically 'Hollywood' film.By no means am I suggesting that people who didn't like the movie just "didn't get it." Everyone is entitled to an opinion and I can understand why a lot of people wouldn't like this film. It is very different from the usually fodder Hollywood sends us. Those in the know, however, can appreciate a film that isn't afraid to tell a story in a new way, and isn't afraid to take chances to let it's poetic brilliance lead it into the history books as one of the greatest (and at least a lot more oscar worthy than "Saving Private Ryan") war movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A (mostly) beautifully shot film with uneven acting and terrible editing, plenty of boredom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it disturbing that so many people are comparing this film favorably to such masterpieces as 2001 and Apocalypse Now. While some of the images and concepts of TTRL are as beautiful and mesmerizing, it is horribly ruined by extremely bad editing and extreme pretentiousness. In 2001 and Apocalypse Now the scenes had rhythm and timing- images and thought flow like waves on a beach. The Thin Red Line has none of this- scene cuts are poorly timed in a way that ruined the movie for me. It's too bad- this could have been an excellent film. I expect this is one of the reasons why so many people find the film so tedious and boring. Furthermore, the acting was very uneven. Nolte was ok at times, downright dopey at others. Cusack seemed to be the only one who gave an even performance that fit the story. Some of the scenes managed to somehow work despite the poor film craft- the final taking of the bunker and the river patrol come to mind. Too often poor scene planning/composition got in the way. The whole attack on the lower part of the hill seemed incredibly botched to me. None of the shots of the various squad locations, command center, enemy bunkers, and the mission objective seemed to match each other and made no sense in direction or distance. The final assault along the ridge could have been halfway around the world for all the film showed. I don't understand how there are so many people who gush over this movie. All of the wonderful cinematography and symbolic imagery in the world can't save a movie that is so poorly constructed that it detracts from the film's message. In my opinion, Malick ruined a great opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no Saving Pvt. Ryan----it's more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I saw this film twice. Once before and once after the Oscar nominations. The nomination was NOT the reason I went to see it a second time. I had already decided to because of the film's uniqueness, thoughtfulness, and, yes, the confusion which I felt while watching the film. First I thought that the film treated the Japanese, the enemy, evenhandedly showing them no better or worse than the oft times confused American GI's. In fact most of the post battle violence was American. The movie is presented in narration by personal thoughts was an interesting aspect and featured unusual and compelling flashbacks. The movie seemed to more about psychology, personality, and philosophy more than war, but the war with its inherent graphic violence is very much present. What I thought was outstanding and very unusual about this war film was the cinematography ---not the battle scenes but nature. It is every featured in this film. Whether it is the beautiful tropical grasses the soldiers are crawling thru or the water scenes including the ocean, a waterfall, and a stream all shot in captivating ways or and animals from tropical birds to fruit bats to lizards making appearances unexpectedly, nature is everywhere evident. I'm sure there is a symbolic element here and I have my opinions but I'll let you draw your own conclusions. Lastly (and not in importance) there were many outstanding performances. Mr. Penn as the straight arrow sergeant, Mr. Koteas as the independent captain, Mr. Nolte as the ambitious Lt. Colonel, Mr. Harrelson as an emotional gut driven sergeant, and Mr. Caviezel as the sensitive off-center (I don't know if that's the right word) foot soldier, all were great characters and played superbly. Personally I thought Mr. Caviezel was the best of the best but it is a close call. There are countless other great characters and performances as well. This movie was worth seeing twice. There is so much offered by this film that I absorbed more and appreciated it even the second time. Please do not consider this a criticism. It is great one time experience. FOUR STARS!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gotta agree with the detractors here. The philosophical undercurrent of this film was merely a trickle. Besides, philosophy delivered with a southern accent just loses something with me. I didn't feel this film said anything new or particularly revealing. Some of the battle scenes were interesting, and I liked the way Malick treated the Japanese soldiers as humans rather than monsters as in Private Ryan. I also found the parade of grimy faces intriguing. I'd imagine that in real war, soldiers don't stick around long and are either reassigned, killed, or sent home, so I guess this was Malicks attempt at capturing that aspect. Kinda neat, but it doesn't make up for the other shortcomings. The most positive feature of TRL was the beauty of the filmmaking. The scenery was quite surreal in juxtaposition with the ugliness of war. However, and with all due respect for Malick and his crew, if you film on a tropical island, you're going to get a lot of beautiful footage. Beautiful is pretty much the default setting for tropical islands. So, much of the credit there goes to mother nature.I'm going to see this again tomorrow to see if I feel any different about it. Maybe my viewpoint will change after that.</fullReview>

Terrence Malick has made a film that is like a fine wine that will be appreciated with time. It's long, engaging, well written, beautifully shot, great acting, etc. Most people won't have the patience to stick with it. The numbers at the box reflect the American public (audience) and their lack of attention. Most people today don't want to be engaged, they want to escape. They don't want to think or make the effort. Now having said this let me say to the rest of you that get tired of the same old formula movies, be well rested, in a good frame of mind, and give this movie a look. It is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few comments regarding criticisms labelled at TTRL:- Complaint No.1: The movie is not an accurate description of any aspect of the campaign for Guadalcanal - It's not supposed to be...Too often in standard war movies the study of the battle overshadows the study of the combatants which is what the book and hence the movie are basically about. As James Jones (the author) was careful to point out in the Special Note at the beginning of the book "...naturally, any resemblance to anything anywhere is certainly not intended." Guadalcanal is nevertheless used because "[t]o have used a completely made up island would have been to lose all of these special qualities which the name Guadalcanal evoked for my generation."- Complaint No.2: People in war aren't like that - The final sentence of the book: "One day one of their number would write a book about all this, but none of them would believe it, because none of them would remember it that way." Our view of war has been shaped, not only by traditional, hero-worshipping war movies, but also by the general portrayal of inconsequential and unemotional violence in film and television as a whole. Let's leave it up to those who were there and don't have a hero complex about their involvement to tell the story.- Complaint No.3: It's boring, disjointed and plotless - War is boring, disjointed and plotless. So many authors who have experienced war have commented on this (one of the best is Norman Mailer's "The Naked and the Dead". Unfortunately, the media and the film industry have hidden this fact in the name of entertainment. And what about the stories of the average insignificant veteran? Ask yourself, how many of the soldiers in TTRL are going to go home and tell everyone how boring it was and how little difference they as an individual made. "One day one of their number would write a book about all this, but none of them would believe it, because none of them would remember it that way."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viewers of this movie are overcomplicating it -- it is a straight-forward tale of young men from peaceful homes in battle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that few people who have seen this movie and who have commented on it understand the meaning of the title: "The Thin Red Line." James Jones is simply alluding to "the thin red line" of British Imperial Infantry that stood between the civilized world and the overwhelming forces of ignorance and savagery in colonial lands, then controlled by Imperial Britain. Jones draws on this notion to draw attention to "the thin line" between modern civilized man and the savagery which he faces in 20th Century war, specifically in WWII on Guadalcanal. The film succeeds in presenting Jones' idea magnificently. To overanalyze this idea is to do injustice to the film. Think back on the first few minutes of the film and the image of the crocodile sliding into the water. This ancient beast is the metaphor for all that is savage in nature and in man. This metaphor runs through the entire film and is at the basis of the horror facing civilized men in modern war. It is "the thin line" of civilized men who must confront this savagery. It is the great irony of "The Thin Red Line" that in facing and ending this savagery, 20th century man must, for a time, become bestial himself. It is a puzzle within a riddle, within a conundrum, within a mystery; that is what this film so starkly depicts.</fullReview>

I can understand how many people have walked out saying "What the hell was that?" For me, however, it was quite powerful. I've never seen a Terrence Malick film before, but I was overcome by a lot of the images here. Not just the war ones either; the image I most remember from the film is the shot of Miranda Otto(as Ben Chaplin's wife) on a swing. This is not a linear plot movie, which always drives people crazy. Rather, it's a mood piece, and a reflection on man's relation to nature (and how war violates that relationship). This, of course, brings it to the land of "nothingness of being" movies, which normally drives me crazy, but I found it worked here.The voice-overs were a little over-used, but other than that, I have no complaints, not even of the rather large cast.

		<fullReview>I expected a lot from The Thin Red Line, and what the screen put before me exceeded any anticipations or preconceptions I entered the theater with. The poor audience reception hardly surprises me, since the masses rarely appreciate high art upon its initial release--this is a proven fact throughout history, from Mozart to Citizen Kane to 2001: A Space Odyssey.It was a stunning examination of humanity and emotion, as well as a decent expression of war; since Malick refused to create a distinct good and a defined evil, it is only logical that many would feel a sense of detachment. That, however, was the idea: by watching this, you should think about who you are and the feelings you have, instead of living vicariously for a few hours.Where Saving Private Ryan force-feeds the viewer its message (a message of ultra-nationalism, among other simplistic things), The Thin Red Line gently asks "why?" And it provides no answer. Beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most amazing, profound films of all time. No joke!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, all the bad reviews and the befuddled viewers confuses and saddens me. This film is one of the most original, profound films ever made, an experimental art house film on an epic canvas and it's a tragedy that people don't like it. I think, however, that the strong opinions of some is a testament to the film's power. I don't like to hear of "dime store variety philosophy." Terrence Malick was a Rhode scholar, Harvard-Oxford educated, MIT philosophy professor who at 21, went to Germany and actually helped Hiedegger (perhaps the most important philosopher since Kant) translate his works. The people who say the symbolism (dying bird, et al.) is hackneyed and cheesy, but these are the same people who think that Scorsese's steaming manhole at the begging of Taxi Driver is a profound visual symbol. Come on! The Thin Red Line subverts our expectations and crosses the boundaries of genre and narrative. You really do get to know the characters, understand their feelings in the insantiy of war. Thing is, war is a buddy, buddy situation. When you're there, you don't get to know anyone very well because anyone can die at any given moment, and part of being a soldier is coming to an understanding of this. Emotions are internalized, held back. Not like Saving Private Ryan, where everyone has a story to tell, a memory to share. Of course Tom Hanks is a school teacher, of course the bible totting sharp-shooter is a southerner (think the University of Texas at Austin tower killings). To make him from Chicago would have been original!!! We know these characters as well as they know each other, and their love is unconditional, they are all in it together. Malick creates a new cinematic vocabulary , and in the process attempts to do something that no filmmaker has ever done....that is change the world, change the way we think, the way we understand our place, being, and time. Indeed, as Bell says of love, "who lit this flame in us." Taken superficially, as an action/war film Malick displays rare talents. We see bullets wizzing by for crying out loud. The scene where every soldier is obscured by fog is genius. Spielburg turns war into Indiana Jones (Spielburg's gun on gun stand off between Nazi and GI Joe is insulting givin the seriousness of the situation and cliche when you think of the fact that Tarrentino and all his disciples have done it a thousand and one times). There is none of that in Thin Red Line. Look at the facial expressions in Thin Red Line, the memories, how these beautiful souls are trying to stay pure in Hell. I'm thinking of John Cusak's face before the attack, of Witt's face, of Jared Leto's face as he realizes he has just sent two men to their deaths. This is power. The music, the cinematography, the writing are perfect.....and despite what they say, it is very, very close to the novel, right down to moments of dialgoue....."Worse thing you can do, worse than rape," is word for word James Jones. It is also the first war film where the "enemy" is portrayed in a way as to suggest that in an alternate universe, there is a movie about the Japanese holding up in their bunker, watching thousands of Americans approach them - and the two films meet. Note how there is not one flag in the film, and only cursory mention of "japs." My thoughts race when I think of this film and I don't know where to begin. I've seen it 3 times already since it came out and I want to see it again. This film will not be forgotten. Everyone should see it to realize there are no "good wars," "just wars." War is a crime against civilization, a crime against nature, and a crime against being itself. Only Malick has ever really said that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I raise my glass to non-convention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I enjoyed this film was because it was so unlike any other war movie I had ever seen. For me, the subtlety and non-conventional approach in "The Thin Red Line" worked, and worked well. I liked the fact that I had to strain my ears to hear what some of the characters were mumbling. I liked the fact that there were many moments on screen where there was hardly any dialogue at all. I liked the fact that sometimes, much of the time, the story being told strayed erratically and bounced all around. War is so completely alien an experience to practically all of us - I can't imagine why we somehow expect a war movie to be completely rational and easy to comprehend. As far as I am concerned, the more surreal and incomprehensible to me, the more realistic. People have complained of the long, boring moments of inaction throughout the film. Unfortunately for many movie-goers, much of the common soldier's daily existence is just like the film showed. One veteran of the American Civil War once described the soldier's life as "countless hours of profound boredom broken up by short instances of sheer terror. Yes, Saving Private Ryan was a great film in its own right, but I couldn't help but cheer for "The Thin Red Line" with its fly in the face of Hollywood/weirdo approach. Sometimes I felt like some of the dialogue in SPR was too rehearsed, too staged. When I heard through the grapevine that many of the scenes in TTRL were completely ad-libbed, (John Cusack's and Nolte's conversation on top of the hill after the successful attack, and Jim Caviezel's conversation with the native island woman and her baby at the start of the film), it made me realize why so much of the dialogue seemed so natural. Many have complained that soldiers wouldn't ever have philosophized like TTRL's characters - but come on, Ernest Hemingway was on the battlefields in WWI and the Spanish Civil War, and Wilfred Owen (who wrote some of the most spaced out WWI poetry from British trenches) was present too. Who are we to say what goes on in the heads of men facing death everyday? This was not the greatest war movie I have ever seen. Yes, it was too long. Yes, it could have used a ton of editing to make it flow more smoothly. People have trashed TTRL because subconciously they are programmed to the cookie-cutter Hollywood movie style. When something comes along that doesn't quite fit - even into the "artsy film category" - folks don't know how to deal with it. That frustrates some to the point of rage which would explain the amazing amount of lengthy, angry comments. But it intrigues others. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but I was one of the strangely intrigued.</fullReview>

It's too bad that from what I'm hearing that the general public is going to stay away from the movie that I feel should probably win the Oscar for best picture, but hey, the majority of the population just wouldn't get the deepness of Malick's film.

		<fullReview>This seems to have become a forum for the most rabid admirers of the Spielberg/SPR camp directing their antipathy towards TTRL with a vengeance &amp; vehemence &amp; venom I've never encountered directed toward another film before. Personally, I don't see how the two films can be compared. They need not be mutually exclusive, either; in fact, I think they complement each other. Whereas one aimed for a realistic depiction of war, the other strove for an IMPRESSIONISTIC look at war. Whereas Spielberg meant his film to be tribute to the American veterans of WWII, Malick's film wanted to explore what war does to men.(The film suggests that it turns most men "into dogs". The vignette showing two stray dogs feasting on corpses of fallen soldiers --"dog eat dog", as it were--is brilliant.)Of course, one can argue there are more evil things in this world than war itself(Genocide &amp; the possibility of the world being ruled by the Axis powers, to name a couple.). Although the film differs from the book in many details, Malick was faithful to the latter's overall message. As Jones states in his bitterly sacastic Dedication:"This book is cheerfully dedicated to those greatest and most heroic of human endeavors, WAR and WARFARE; may they never cease to give us pleasure, excitement and adrenal stimulation that we need, or provide us with the heroes, the presidents and leaders, the monuments and museums which we erect to them in the name ofPEACE."As Kaylie Jones, the author's surviving daughter said of TTRL:"It's not a movie that you walk away from thinking, 'Isn't it nice that those heroic soldiers died for a good cause.' You walk away with a hole in your stomach that stays for days. In that sense, it's true to the book.There is bravery and heroism, but the whole idea that it is for a great cause is not there at all."Contrast that to what she thinks her father would think of SPR:"He would have been, I think, very happy with that first 25 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. After that, I think he would have been very disappointed with the rest of the film. I think it is the antithesis of what he believed war films should be about. His notion of war films in general was that they were phony. The public wants to believe that war is valor and that individual human sacrifice is not for naught. He believed the opposite. I think that Saving Private Ryan is just the same thing as all those other films.That is why Malick's film has no real heroes(although some characters did perform feats of heroism.). Which is also why Malick's film(despite big studio backing) is perhaps the most anti-Hollywood war film ever made.Although TTRL does have several explicit messages, it is es- sentially a cinematic Rorschash where you get out of it as much as you put into it. Obviously, reading a poem requires more from the reader than, say, reading a comic book. Both are examples of the print medium, but each requires a different level of reading. Same thing with movies. SPR worked on one level, TTRL worked on another.If TTRL wasn't for you, then it wasn't for you. Yet I find it interesting that many of the major complaints directed at TTRL were also the very ones directed at an earlier cinematic Ror- schash--Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest films in the history of the medium. How much "character development" is in THAT film?...How much "plot"? Both a commercial &amp; critical failure when it first premiered, how many people do you suppose walked out of THAT film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a haunting, evocative masterpiece. The battle scenes (when they finally arrive) are vivid and brutal, but they are presented in the context of a philosophical meditation on war. Although war may seem to alienate man from nature, it is actually a manifestation nature. Beauty and horror are one--two sides of one great mystery.</fullReview>

The narrations provide great insights into the characters, and the flashbacks make there backgrounds seem real. The best war movie since Das Boot in my mind.

		<fullReview>After reading reviews here of this, Lost Highway, and Eraserhead, I have come to a conclusion: people assume that if they don't personally see the significance of certain elements of a movie, they must not have any meaning to begin with.For example, people often complain about the "nature photography" of Thin Red Line. Well, then, you shouldn't bother with a Malick film, because they are filled with it. And this movie, like his others, is twice as brilliant for it.People like to see what they expect to see. Here, they expected to see a movie about war whose thesis was "war is hell." Well, no kidding. That is what nearly EVERY war movie is about. Instead, Malick gave us a movie about the unbelievably complex relationship of war, man, and nature, in an originally complex way.Because it is impossible to sum up individual characters (the hearty sarge, the baptist sniper) in a few words, and likewise for the movie itself (the mission is the man, but war is hell), people assume that nothing is going on. For some people, there is.Next time, open your mind a little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A war film of many beautiful images.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's first film since his classic "Days of Heaven" proves that he is still a master of the medium. This is not the typical war movie. Malick is an artist and his art is film. Each frame of this film is beautifully framed, designed, and rendered. The color and lighting design are like paintings.The battle sequences are very different than "Saving Private Ryan". There is much use of slow motion, voice overs and music with sound effects. The performances are uniformly fine. Elias Koteas must be singled out for his performance as the most fleshed out of the characters.The only fault is the film's length. It's just too much of a good thing. The lack of a clearly drawn plot line definitely hurts the last third. There are also just too many characters. Some just come and then disappear never to be seen or heard from again. George Clooney just pops up in the last few minutes for no discernible reason than to add another star's name to the cast. They did the same thing with "The Longest Day" thirty years ago.But enough carping. "The Thin Red Line" will be remembered as one of the landmark war films for its original artistic approach. It's innumerable painting-like images will long linger in memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listen to the critics... but as a guide to watching this brilliant and haunting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing a screening of "The Thin Red Line," of which I entered with more than a modicum of fear. Fear that the movie would be just what other reviewers and friends have described it as: beautiful, but a swirling mess of inner dialogue, meandering camera work, and nearly non-existent plot. Well... it was all true. I'm glad I didn't let it scare me away from seeing it in the theater... it's definitely one of the best films of 1998, if not the best.If you are planning on seeing this film, but are wary.. I urge you to go. Just prepare yourself by clicking your heels together three times, and chant "It's not Saving Private Ryan.. It's not Saving Private Ryan.. It's not Saving Private Ryan..." If you walk in knowing that any battle scenes will be few and far between, that this is much more of an "internal" movie than "external," and that you will be forced to see the world from a higher viewpoint.. you'll do just fine.No.. there is no real plot to this movie. But you have to remember.. for the men who fought in the war, many felt it would go on forever. Yes... there were objectives, but every Joe knew that there wouldn't be a climatic ending like in the cliffhangers. You get your job done, and you move on, finding some way to survive and while attempting to keep some meaning in your life. Whether you do that by thinking of your girl, pondering over the nature of mankind, or going insane... everyone copes in a different way. Malick understands his objective and hits it right on the head, giving us an emotionally wrenching glance into the minds of various soldiers in different roles at Guadalcanal.I almost am in disbelief at those who say this movie isn't "realistic." Granted, there are only a handful of dismembered corpses, but one doesn't need naked violence to prove realism. Sure, Saving Private Ryan (the new "benchmark" for battle realism) showed us the brutal physical side of war to disquiet our stomachs for conflict (and isn't that the point of that film? To frighten us from letting it happen again?). But it never gets close to the raw (and ultimately more damaging) psychological and philosophical consequences of war, where we suddenly realize our capacity for destruction, cruelty, egotism, and remorse over our actions.Saving Private Ryan is a trip through lands we've seen and traveled through before, just in more vivid, visceral detail: Europe, damaged buildings, war, and heroics/patriotism (Spielberg may like to think the latter are muted in his movie, in an vain attempt to be more "cynical" about war... but he's kidding himself). The Thin Red Line takes us into a different world: a pristine land of innocence cut by a swath of violence, where every man is equal in the cool eyes of nature, and it is up to each individual to find their own salvation, or lack thereof.While Saving Private Ryan is about our blood (both literally and figuratively), The Thin Red Line looks through into our souls. And that can be more humbling than any bullet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came out this movie, along with the majority of the audience, with an air of stunned disbelief. This movie definitely did not deliver on the hype. The narration throughout the movie took the form of a stream of "poetic" ramblings. I thought this element detracted from the movie and left you wondering what what the purpose of this was. The plot was very weak and for the most part strong character development was nonexistent. I had a hard time feeling sympathetic for the characters in this movie and the situation the found themselves in. The film was very disjointed and was never able to build up any momentum and hold my attention for extended periods. I got the impression that the casting was based on drawing as much impact from the stars as possible without really giving them all meaningful roles in the film. Just when I thought that the movie was going to build upon a theme it was quickly forgotten about and vanished. Once was enough for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "The Thin Red Line" once, yet I know that I haven't seen it all. Terrence Malick's masterful war epic is a triumph of art, an existential exploration of the effects and realities of war. Mostly without plot and relying on a stream of character structure, the film is a dense and finely acted marvel that will only make sense if you take the effort to put all of the pieces together. It is true that the film is messy, jarring, and somewhat disjointed, but the scope and daring of Malick's vision keep the film together even as it threatens to come apart at the seams. Vibrant, honest, and lacking in the forced patriotic fervor and melodramatic contrivities that marred the otherwise powerful "Saving Private Ryan", this is a film that pushes boundaries and truly succeeds.Special mention should be made of Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas, who all give amazing performances, as well as the fine score by Hans Zimmer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most irritating aspect of The Thin Red Line is the narration in the background. The narrator has more lines than the characters themselves!!! The Thin Red Line is a long, intricately detailed and the most well-acted movie I have seen in close to a year. The quality of the script and the performances of the actors (especially Nolte) is far superior to anything Private Ryan can offer. In Saving Private Ryan, the first 30 minutes made the entire movie (and Tom Hanks of course), but in The Thin Red Line every scene, dialogue, and character is so well defined that it makes us wonder how superficially we choose to lead our own lives a times. In my opinion, Malick's got the Oscar in the bag for Best Director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that grows on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the fair share of comments on here, always happy to see those people who like it, quite confused at the people who seem to miss the point. I come from the angle of haven't seen any of Malick's work, but this movie was hugely powerful in a very unHollywoodian manner. I read much about this movie before I saw it, so some of the best parts were spoiled (against my will), but still didn't fail to move me.Since Saving Private Ryan and this movie have been compared so often, I will say that when I first saw Saving Private Ryan I thought it was quite good. Now its message has been blown to bits: it seems that the message of that movie, very conventional, was completely hollow compared to Thin Red Line. Thin Red Line's point is not to blow things up or make the viewer cry, though both happened to me. I believe it is to show the very nature of man in times of extreme distress, and how some regress, some are transfigured, and some remain unchanged (or try to remain unchanged). There were also elements of mother earth versus man's futility/cruelty, but I think that was to underpin the character of the man.Many movies try to reveal the nature of the man, but most rely on that linear Hollywoodian sentimentality (try "Patch Adams," which appears to have a higher rating than this movie), which uses conventions that are bound to detract or in my case, disgust. Malick here combines snatches of personal drama with that great psychological profundity portrayed with that universally praised cinematography, but also the monologues, which showed every man, perhaps even just the surface, but every man nonetheless.About the "lack of plot" - the plot can be contained in the characters in their environment, not the characters themselves but the combined result of their personalities. But each man still remains an unmistakable individual - much like the war they were fighting.This movie is purely abstract. It made me think about many things, and great emotions came from that. It's a movie that takes effort to understand, but is well worth it. It's a movie that will grow on an individual.My vote for best movie of the year.(e-mail: havergal@yahoo.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Thin Red Line" is a powerful and haunting film. This film explores the psychology and spirituality of soldiers in the most extreme of human environments, combat. In combat, there is a thin red line separating heros from cowards, sanity from madness, life from death, and love from hate. The film is a study of juxtapositions: water &amp; fire, idealism &amp; pragmatism, evil &amp; good, appearances &amp; reality. Although there are several visually stunning combat scenes, this film is MUCH more than a war movie. Pvt. Witt is deeply spiritual and idealistic, caring for all men (comrades &amp; enemy alike). Sgt. Welsh is more pragmatic, believing that each soldier's ultimate responsibility is keeping himself alive. Witt and Welsh are contrasted throughout the film. While a soldier steals teeth from dead and dying Japanese, Witt comforts and emphathizes with the Japanese. While some are indifferent to the death and agony of their comrades, Witt eases the pain of their transition from life to death. Col. Tall, concerned only with advancing his career and viewing the lives of his men as expendable, is contrasted with the CO of C Company whose primary concern is keeping his men alive and who is ultimately willing to sacrifice his command for the betterment of his "sons." The film juxtaposes scenes of horror and death during combat with the beauty of nature and the indigenous people. While soldiers are being killed, baby birds are born nearby, suggesting that nature is indifferent to the follies of men. The dialogue is sparse. The most moving aspects of the film are the narrative voice-overs. While all the acting is good, the performances of Caviezel, Penn, and Nolte are truly outstanding. The cinematography and directing are superb. Mallick has created a jewel.</fullReview>

The passage of time in the theatre I attended was marked by the incessant glow of Indiglo wrist watches belonging to all the people wondering when the movie was going to be over. At least I only paid matinee prices.The phrase "The horror... The horror..." did run through my mind as I watched, but it was in reference to the disjointed direction shown in this film. I've seen "Apocalypse Now," and Mr. Malick, this wasn't it.The attention to detail was non-existent. An example is the lighting of the scene between Nick Nolte and John Cusack after the bunker is knocked out. Look at the sun angles and shadows on Nolte's face then on Cusack's face as the camera angle is reversed. We look at Nolte and he has the sun on the left side of his face. When Cusack replies, the left side of Nolte's face is in shadow and Cusack is in the sun. It's as distracting as turning the lights on and off, so what happened to continuity?Somebody needs to call for an audit of the books, because the money did NOT make it into the film. The only smart thing that was done in this film was to not release it against "Saving Private Ryan." I predict this will be one movie the actors would rather leave off their resumes.P.S. - I would like to thank the director for the extra sleep I got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to offer my humble rebuttal on some of the biggest critical complaints that I've read about The Thin Red Line.1) "The movie contained no plot" - And I ask you, must a film contain a plot to be entertaining and thought-provoking? Most moviegoers have been trained by the Hollywood system to accept the three-act structure as gospel. Fortunately, there are a handful of filmmakers such as Malick who are talented enough to side-step this "rule" and rely on other, equally effective devices to power their films.2) "The characters seemed to blend together" - I never had a problem with recognizing every soldier as an individual. At times, putting the names to the faces was a challenge, but not a nuisance. It's important to keep in mind that often times we the viewer are meant to be a soldier on that tour of duty. Watch how the men look at us on the ship heading home at the end of the film. They are not looking into a camera lens. They are looking at a fellow soldier who's just had a shared experience.3) "The film was better than/worse than Saving Private Ryan" - I don't understand why The Thin Red Line is constantly getting compared to Saving Private Ryan. I mean, you might as well compare it to every other war film out there, or perhaps just every other film in general. I guess because SPR is still fresh in everyone's memory (and a darling of the critics) that it is held up against TTRL. They are two completely different experiences (thank God for that).4) "The Thin Red Line is a weak war film" - Well, which "war" are you talking about? If you're talking about man's struggle to define himself within nature and the role he plays on this planet, then you'd be on the right track to the essence of this film. Granted, it doesn't take much talent and vision to show people being killed by grenades and bullets, but it does take a lot of insight to accurately portray the real war going on WITHIN the soldiers. And Malick successfully does just that.5) "When the Japanese spoke, there were no subtitles" - Again, WE are on that tour of duty. How many of those American soldiers could actually understand and speak Japanese? Do you "get it" now?6) "John Travolta and George Clooney hardly get any screen time" - Yeah, and you have a problem with that?!I could (should?) go on, but I won't. My quick review: **** (out of ****). It's not exclusively about the taking of Guadalcanal, but more about the battle within each soldier as they fight over the thin red line between life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>highly recommended for anyone who's ever thought about life, love, beauty, or evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is about the incredible paradox of life, the surpassing beauty of the world, and our exalted ability to both appreciate and to destroy. Where does the beauty come from? Where does the evil come from? How should we respond to the beauty of life, of nature, of love? Director Terrence Malick responded by giving us a movie about trees and leaves, stems and seas of grass, a war film set in paradise.There is no plot or story in the ordinary, manipulative sense: only life. A handful of dirty twenty year old soldiers begin looking and sounding alike, but only simple-minded critics would complain that the characters weren't clearly delineated. It didn't really matter who thought what, only what they thought. There is nothing overt about this film, no "star", no easy payoff. Perhaps all great art is subtle, and this is great art.Apologies to Sean Penn's reputation, but I expected carnage and vulgarity, and there was very little (only a fraction of, say, Private Ryan's bloodshed). I saw it last night, and my only regret is that I didn't bring my (pre-teen) children, because everybody should be so lucky as to see Terrence Malick's work on the big screen. (Fortunately my wife will be able to bring them later this week.) This film is worth seeing for the Nature in it alone, even if you aren't blown away by impossibly beautiful cinematography, poignant writing, and GREAT acting. We see through Jim Caviezel's eyes, much as we saw through Omar Sharif's eyes in Dr. Zhivago. Pacifists and poets both, forced to observe a war in which they want no part.The "message" of the film is anti-war, but the bigger message of the film is: why isn't life itself message enough? </fullReview>

Self-conscious and pretentious are not descriptions I would disagree with.As I left the theater after Saving Private Ryan, I remarked to my wife that as much as I liked the movie, I couldn't imagine what would compel me to see it again---simply because it was such a draining experience.

		<fullReview>The human condition analyzed on war's bloody slab. Die and there is nothing. Nature lives on. And on. And on. Ok I got the picture. We become lesser animals and each must fight and win the war within us. The mountain of death we all must challenge. That `stuff' is all well and good to cinematically portray the savagery of war, but war must also have a practical side. Animals tho' we may be, we can't all be as dumb as those soldiers paraded before us in TTRL.Specifically I refer to the `take the hill' pivotal action as the catalyst for warriors facing up to their courage. The problem I had was that from an officers perspective, Company C found the right most limits of the Japanese lines. Why charge up the damn hill when a flank attack was the called for strategy. Lee &amp; Jackson proved that move 80 years earlier. The Captain was stupid for disobeying a direct order, he should have told the Colonel the situation. I mean this wasn't some dumb ass horror flick where everybody screams don't go in the basement. If realism is the vehicle, keep it realistic. Ok the Colonel gave some lame ass excuse why he couldn't, but it was obvious if they were receiving no enfilade fire, or interlocking fire in depth, which they weren't, Mr. Nip had his unprotected flank in the air. Now put Co. C in the middle of the regimental assault, and it makes a little more sense, but not much. I appreciate what was being attempted, I guess I am too practical to go with the flow. There were no Jap troops in force to the right or behind that bunker. None. Yeah I know the hill and all that was symbolic and all that gooey abstractionism, but it has to make some basic common sense. It was just too obvious to ignore. Even cowards aren't that damn dumb.At the end, the company, or a platoon, it isn't clear, is in a stream bed and supposedly they lose communication contact. If it is the company, one would think, with 4 platoons, there would be more than a string and tin can involved. This is the `car won't start' routine. I felt insulted. C'mon. They didn't even have a simple walkie-talkie for comm back up? They went that far out in the bush stringing commo wire? You don't have to have a degree in military science to figure out the bad guys cut the wire and are following it. Which was pretty dumb (to cut it) on the Japs' part. But no, we'll stay in this stream bed and wait for'em to come up our rear and shoot us. Ok they wanted us to see how men react to the unexpected. But combat veterans, as these were, aren't that naive. None of it made any sense.So now we have a reinforced battalion doing some Greek tactics on our brave group, well what happened to them? Sure would have been nice to know. And the poor wounded guy, they had him float DOWN the stream. To where. The three man patrol went up the stream to find the cut wire. How the hell many streams were involved in this mess? I think continuity got lost about as badly as I did.Ok it was just a movie and sometimes things get confused out there and it aint perfect. We lose control as some of the grunts did when they over ran the base/hospital center. If the idea was to make the American soldiers and officers dumb asses and the enemy and nature just a couple of noble creations in the way of the white animal Yankee, the movie succeeded. From my perspective, some common sense has to play into this. Death is defeated many ways other than raw courage. Some of us think our way through problems, and outflank them, instead of charging into the center of a decision gone wrong. We do that only when we are out of options.Sir, we sent out patrols, the center is defended by a platoon. The flanks have 900 armies covering them. Aw hell let's charge the flanks.It isn't always what it seems to be, though, is it?</fullReview>

I felt the writing tried too hard to be "deep" and was simply confusing.One more pet peeve, some war movies, especially colors ones ("Hamburger Hill being the worst) make the mistake of casting too many average build, average complexion dark-haired men in leading roles and sometimes it's just hard to know who's who.Nolte was brilliant as was the company commander.

		<fullReview>I'd like to offer my humble rebuttal on some of the biggest critical complaints that I've read about The Thin Red Line.1) "The movie contained no plot" - And I ask you, must a film contain a plot to be entertaining and thought-provoking? Most moviegoers have been trained by the Hollywood system to accept the three-act structure as gospel. Fortunately, there are a handful of filmmakers such as Malick who are talented enough to side-step this "rule" and rely on other, equally effective devices to power their films.2) "The characters seemed to blend together" - I never had a problem with recognizing every soldier as an individual. At times, putting the names to the faces was a challenge, but not a nuisance. It's important to keep in mind that often times we the viewer are meant to be a soldier on that tour of duty. Watch how the men look at us on the ship heading home at the end of the film. They are not looking into a camera lens. They are looking at a fellow soldier who's just had a shared experience.3) "The film was better than/worse than Saving Private Ryan" - I don't understand why The Thin Red Line is constantly getting compared to Saving Private Ryan. I mean, you might as well compare it to every other war film out there, or perhaps just every other film in general. I guess because SPR is still fresh in everyone's memory (and a darling of the critics) that it is held up against TTRL. They are two completely different experiences (thank God for that).4) "The Thin Red Line is a weak war film" - Well, which "war" are you talking about? If you're talking about man's struggle to define himself within nature and the role he plays on this planet, then you'd be on the right track to the essence of this film. Granted, it doesn't take much talent and vision to show people being killed by grenades and bullets, but it does take a lot of insight to accurately portray the real war going on WITHIN the soldiers. And Malick successfully does just that.5) "When the Japanese spoke, there were no subtitles" - Again, WE are on that tour of duty. How many of those American soldiers could actually understand and speak Japanese? Do you "get it" now?6) "John Travolta and George Clooney hardly get any screen time" - Yeah, and you have a problem with that?!I could (should?) go on, but I won't. My quick review: **** (out of ****). It's not exclusively about the taking of Guadalcanal, but more about the battle within each soldier as they fight over the thin red line between life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>highly recommended for anyone who's ever thought about life, love, beauty, or evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is about the incredible paradox of life, the surpassing beauty of the world, and our exalted ability to both appreciate and to destroy. Where does the beauty come from? Where does the evil come from? How should we respond to the beauty of life, of nature, of love? Director Terrence Malick responded by giving us a movie about trees and leaves, stems and seas of grass, a war film set in paradise.There is no plot or story in the ordinary, manipulative sense: only life. A handful of dirty twenty year old soldiers begin looking and sounding alike, but only simple-minded critics would complain that the characters weren't clearly delineated. It didn't really matter who thought what, only what they thought. There is nothing overt about this film, no "star", no easy payoff. Perhaps all great art is subtle, and this is great art.Apologies to Sean Penn's reputation, but I expected carnage and vulgarity, and there was very little (only a fraction of, say, Private Ryan's bloodshed). I saw it last night, and my only regret is that I didn't bring my (pre-teen) children, because everybody should be so lucky as to see Terrence Malick's work on the big screen. (Fortunately my wife will be able to bring them later this week.) This film is worth seeing for the Nature in it alone, even if you aren't blown away by impossibly beautiful cinematography, poignant writing, and GREAT acting. We see through Jim Caviezel's eyes, much as we saw through Omar Sharif's eyes in Dr. Zhivago. Pacifists and poets both, forced to observe a war in which they want no part.The "message" of the film is anti-war, but the bigger message of the film is: why isn't life itself message enough? </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was no Apocalypse Now. It was long-winded and not engaging in the least. Beneath all the poetic narrative mumbo-jumbo, Malick obviously had good intentions. But let's be realistic. Once you tap too deep into the reaches of a director's mind, the movie's punch becomes lost to the masses. The screenplay becomes disjointed and only fragments are comprehendible. Like with every great movie, the audience is supposed to enjoy the film at every level. But Malick has made The Thin Red Line so unintelligible that most people cannot conceptualize the meaning behind the movie. The few movie-goers who do enjoy deciphering movies may find this one a fine challenge. Otherwise, I don't recommend it.One thing I do wonder is if anyone else thought Elias Koteas struck an uncanny resemblance to Robert de Niro...he even had the same trademark front teeth. Very weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you're expecting saving private ryan II don't bother seeing the thin red line. but, if you keep an open mind and approach the film accepting that it's long, disjointed and sometimes confusing, you might just enjoy it.two of the best things about it are: 1. unlike saving private ryan, it doesn't impose such a contrived plot upon the characters. the story is about people, about humanity and the inanity of violence and war. just because it doesn't have a traditional plot structure (... raising action, climax, falling action ...)doesn't mean there isn't a plot. it's just a glimpse of the horrors and events that happened throughout the war.2. the images, as many have said, are intense and harrowing. i'll never forget the scene where the company captured the japanese camp and the looks on the soldiers' (american &amp; japanese) faces.yes, the film is too long and it seems like there is something missing sometimes. (if some of the nature and swimming scenes were shorter, i would have liked it A LOT better.) if you have the slightest desire to see this film, wait for video if you must, but definitely see it -- it's worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read a number of other comments I find myself resonating with both positive and negative aspects. I left the movie theatre disappointed, but it stuck in my mind. This movie takes concentration because it's not frivolous entertainment - and it leaves an after-taste. It's a strange mixture of Ryan (landing craft scene, bunker attack, leadership issues), Platoon (insubordination &amp; dehumanization) and Apocalypse now (imagery, horror of war).Like Private Ryan, it puts us in the action and into the minds of the men in the action, and reminds us of the ugliness of war. I found it humbling because it shows the sacrifice the men who fought the battle made. I found myself wondering what would I do if I was ordered to be the first to go up the hill knowing a bullet was waiting. Wondering if I would be maimed and in tremendous pain, left to die in a strange place alone. How would I behave with split seconds to make decisions and the noise of war going on all around and body parts in flight.How devastating that a man would cling to a memory of a loved one for his sanity only to get a 'Dear John' letter in his hour of need.My initial reaction was negative because of the poor continuity in parts, but there's a lot to this movie if you are willing to put the effort in. I may go and see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a "war" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To view "The Thin Red Line" as a war film, misses the point, at least the one I got. Malick uses the backdrop of the battle for Guadalcanal as a means to examine the inherent nature of man. Unlike most viewers, I don't think he has a pie-eyed, new age theory.We are taught from an early age that all men are created equal and the basic nature of man is good. That belief is shown in the beginning as Private Witt lives among the "peaceful natives". I didn't take these scenes literally, but as Witt's interpretation of them. Witt is a naive and simple young man. He only sees the good, the beautiful and the idyllic. When he is returned to his company, he professes a love for his fellow soldiers because they are his people.As he, and the movie, gets deeper into battle, he/we see the other forces that work within all of us. There's desperation (Lt. Col. Tall), compassion (Capt. Staros), desire (Bell) and fear (Fife). When Witt returns to a Melanesian village, he can no longer overlook the other natural forces at work in all men. He is now able to see the conflict and strife as well as the beauty.He is also constantly interacting with Welsh, who signifies "Everyman". Welsh is capable of heroism as well as hatred, compassion and dispassion. The two men balance one another. One is what we aspire to, the other is who we are. To survive, the characters must be able to accept both sides of their nature.Malick also uses the nature scenes (so ridiculed in many reviews) as a metaphor for the natural forces that work within us. They are not just pretty pictures of the flora and fauna, but a visual emphasis that man does not exist separate from nature, but is an intrinsic part of it. A crocodile lazily sinks into the water. A tree is slowly being killed by the vines wrapped around it. Beauty, violence and destruction are not the creation of man, but of nature.Was this a great, or even good, movie? In my opinion, yes, but only time will resolve that issue. This film did move me, and make me think about the images that were presented, and that's more than I can say for anything else I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading other people's comments about this movie, and I'm not surprised by how polarized opinions are. I saw it with an audience of maybe 100 people, and I'd say around 20 walked out early. I found myself very emotionally involved for most of the film, then bored and impatient with the last hour.I agree with those who say the movie would have been stronger if the characters had been better differentiated. I wasn't always sure whose thoughts I was hearing in voice-over, and I also had trouble making out some of the words in the voice-overs. I felt that it would have been OK to have poetic, thoughtful voice-overs for one character, but they all blurred together after a while. What seemed poetic at first eventually seemed redundant.Still, I was emotionally involved as the characters attempted to take control of a hill held by unseen Japanese. I loved the use of the camera moving through the tall grass from the soldiers' point of view. Maybe even more than "Saving Private Ryan," this film puts you right in the battle.Jim Caviezel, who is unfamiliar to me, gives a memorable performance and is really the character we follow from beginning to end. He seems like an old soul -- like he sees beyond the madness around him and knows that there's something larger, more lasting. Caviezel was perfectly cast -- his eyes convey tremendous depth.Sean Penn, Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas are the other actors that stand out in my mind. Of the "big name" actors in small parts, Woody Harrelson makes the largest impression and has one great scene.Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven" is one of my favorite movies. One of its strengths was an economy in its storytelling that is unfortunately lacking in "The Thin Red Line." Still, I'm very, very happy that this extraordinarily talented man is back making movies. I'll take a flawed "Thin Red Line" over 99% of the Hollywood schlock being churned out. I think this film will be discussed and debated for decades to come. He may have missed by a bit, but Malick aimed very high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is one of the most original directors out there. True, this is only his 3rd film. But it really showcases his love for the unconventional narrative and inner monologues that work so well. In many ways, it's very Robert Altmanesque in the way he goes from character to character. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line doesn't settle in cliche plot development and over-sentimentality. The characters and acting are far better. Sean Penn is still one of the finest actors of all time, and his subtleness is a welcome change of pace from the insanity he displayed in She's So Lovely. Nolte is brilliant as well. I think The Thin Red Line brings something new to the now tiresome war genre. It doesn't cop out from the darkness and brutality. Saving Private Ryan, although a very good film as well, is just Spielberg doing Spielberg with the exception of the battle scenes. In The Thin Red Line, Malick doesn't candy coat or present any flaws in this remarkable picture that, despite its slow pace, must be seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is better than Saving Private Ryan.Director Terrence Mallick has managed to do Spielberg's film one better in nearly every respect. Sure, Mallick doesn't give us a single stars and stripes close-up, but war is not about fighting for one's country. It is about fighting for one's sanity. The top brass are not interested in saving anyone, they are intent on killing everyone. In Saving Private Ryan I felt everyone was fighting the same battle. There were very few characters who were distinct beyond the typical realms of cliche (you have your bulky dumb-dumb, religous sharp shooter, pessimistic New Yorker, vengeful Jew, and a host of middle America good-ole-boys). Each character in Red Line had a unique history lurking beneath his face. No one had it all figured out, no one was convinced of why he was there. I felt more tension, more horror, more exhilaration, more sadness in Thin Red Line than in any other war movie I have seen. Thin Red Line also features a number of kick-ass action sequences - my favourite being the scene where John Cusack and company take a Japenese bunker.Enough chatter - see this movie and be amazed at how fast 170 minutes can pass.</fullReview>

Complete Lack of Characterization. I knew who the characters were, from reading the book, however, I still couldn't connect with them. I couldn't feel their thoughts or motives, and found myself not really inspired. The book was a conflict between Sgt. Welsh and Private Witt. Between Lt. Stein (Staros) and Col. Tall. Between Sgt. Storm and Charlie Dale. It was the maturing of Witt, Dale, and Fife. NONE of this was in the film. The film portrayed Charlie Company as a whole, whose only conflict was with the faceless Japanese. Although the raid on the Small Japanese base was excellent, and the bunker scene phenomenal (on the money too, I still couldn't connect to their plight. Unfortunately, it seemed to me, that the characters were already less than innocent when they hit the beach, the heroes were already molded, and the enemy, well the enemy was just there to catch bullets. Hats off to the cinematography though, I wouldn't want to charge that hill. Also for those that read the book, you may have felt like I did, that the climax was the bunker and the taking of the hill. Everything else was just mopping up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess it was to be expected of Terrence Malick, the man who brought us the visual-style-over-narrative-substance "Days of Heaven," that "The Thin Red Line" would be somewhat lacking in the plot department. However, I feel - unlike some critics that cried "poetic brilliance" - that Malick's long-awaited film is a sprawling mess. The photography, as demonstrated years before, is brilliant. Yet that cannot sustain the complete structural mess at the film's core. Characters appear suddenly and disappear, plot lines do the same, and whatever narrative development - in terms of characters, theme and otherwise - is rather crudely attempted through voice-over narration. There are absolutely no plot points to speak of, and the action is never advanced (except maybe for the soldiers landing on the beach and capturing a military stronghold early on). When the characters fail to convey multiple dimensionality (beyond typage), Malick's camera cuts to a National Geographic-esque close up of various specimens of wildlife. Real pretty Terrence, but what does it have to do with anything? And don't give me the Garden of Eden allegory - because this film fails miserably to sustain any clear message, or convey it to the audience. Give me "Days of Heaven" anytime, but when you're dealing with a character roster of dozens, and the broad topic of the Battle of Guadalcanal, Malick's obviously unqualified. He should do lunch with Robert Altman sometime.</fullReview>

The trauma and success of "Private Ryan" may have had something to do with it, but it was a bad call on the part of the money people.Too long, too disoriented and too many token parts for crowd pleasing names like Travolta and Clooney.I couldn't recommend it to a friend to see, I am sorry to say. Especially since I liked Nick Nolte's performance and good jobs by other main players. It's one I would have been disappointed in even if I had waited for video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line was not a bad movie. In fact, if you have over three hours to spare, and you huge attention span, you should take it in some afternoon. However, on a scale of 1-10 I would only give it a six and a half. The reason being that this movie was made as a collection of poetry, not a war movie. Perhaps this is what other say made it good, but the film doesn't follow the simple pattern that can keep an audience interested. You must have a goal, and by the end of the movie the characters have progressed toward or away from this goal. Each scene must have some significance to the overall point, and when a movie like this is made, the point is lost in too many characters and labored story flow. However, I do commend the poetic lines that occur whenever a character's inner thoughts are being heard. But, the reality of the situation is that you will like this movie if you are not looking for a war film. If you want a lyric depiction of thought and feelings, then this is your movie. If you are a little more reality based, then save it for video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as good as Saving Private Ryan, but completely different.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost every review for The Thin Red Line which I have read has compared it to another recently released WW2 movie, Saving Private Ryan. I feel it is unfair to compare the two movies, both are about the second World War that is about the only connection they share. Besides Ryan's horrific first 20 minutes (a brutal and realistic recreation of D-Day), Ryan was more of a conventional film with the set storyline (find a missing soldier). The Thin Red Line has it's battle scenes (the whole middle), but goes more for imagery and symbolism. There is no set story line just a team of soldiers you follow around. If you have looked at the papers or seen the previews for The Thin Red Line you have probably been amazed at the cast it has. This is misleading since only two of the big names have big roles, Sean Penn (Dead Man Walking, At Close Range) and Nick Nolte (Affliction, Blue Chips). Although these two have big roles, the main two roles are given to newcomers Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin. Both are superb, Caviezel playing a soldier who has gone AWOl a couple of times, but seems to have something special about him and Chaplin as a soldier who has an incredible devotion to his wife back home. Penn plays a tough soldier who seems to like Caviezel despite his tough attitude toward him. Penn is one of the best actors in Hollywood and continues that with another strong performance. Nolte is extremely good as a Patton-type leader who wants his military glory no matter the cost. John Travolta (Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction) and George Clooney (Out of Sight, One Fine Day) both appear briefly (less than a minute each) and leave no effect, except for the poor timing of Clooney's cameo. Woody Harrelson (The Cowboy Way, Indecent Proposal) has a slightly bigger part as one of the leaders during a battle and has a fairly powerful scene. John Cusack also has a small role, but plsys it perfectly. Also, Elias Koteas (Fallen, The Prophecy) beautifully plays the role of a leader who has to make a difficult decision during the battle. John C. Reilly (The River Wild, Out on a Limb) and Adrien Brody (Solo, Angels in the Outfield) are in the whole movie but have little to do, but do it well. Not a standard war film, but still a powerful and outstanding film from writer and director Terrence Malick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i can't even begin to describe how great this movie was. i waited for a long time for it to come to my town, and saw it opening night when it finally did. i place it as my number one movie of the year. i know some people who didn't like it, and its quite obvious that they simply didn't get it - it was over their heads. i think they would have been more comfortable in something more intellectually devoid, such as varsity blues.this movie had some of the best imagery i have ever seen. for instance, when the narration is talking about the family of man and how did we end up fighting each other, while the camera is following a mother hen whose diffeernt colored chicks are all running in different directions.the dialogue was very effective, especially the lack of dialogue in certain scenes. for instance - the scenes where nic nolte is yelling at john cusack, and when sean penn is questioning whit. rather than have whit or john cusack ramble on in a stereotypical way, both say absolutely nothing - very effective.when i saw it with several friends, we all liked it, but some complained that too many characters looked and sounded alike, and they couldn't tell the difference. i thought that this was one of the best things about it. it put the whole man and nature thing together. instead of individual men, it was "man" in general.in comaparison with private ryan, red line was better. to me, private ryan was just a great war movie that didn't affect me in any personal way. the great thing about red line is that it was a war movie that is really not about the war, but its effect on man and nature.this is definately a must see. terrence malick is a genius. i urge everyone to see this. if you don't get it, it's your loss - go see it again till you do get it.4 stars, 10, 2 thumbs up, whatever. it was great. go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What it is to be a soldier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really shouldn't have liked this film as much as I did. After all, it had no plot to speak of, was much too long at three hours, used voice-overs speaking poetry and tried too hard to be arty. However, it was the only war film I've ever seen that defined the experience of war in a way that I felt it to my bones. It put me, personally in the action. I felt the fear, the fatigue and the hard questions that each man had to deal with, and left me with an appreciation of what it is to be a soldier as well as a total disgust at the futility of it all.The director, Terrence Malick, did an outstanding job of conveying all this. He used nature in a way I have never see in a war film. The beauty of Guadacanal from the trees and birds to the native people is shown over and over again in stark contrast to the slaughter of both the Japanese and Americans. The tagline of this movie is "every man fights his own war" and the close-ups of the men's faces manage to show their inner struggles by the use of lighting and perhaps a leaf against the backdrop of nature.There is star power in the cast - Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harelson, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, and George Clooney. They all have small parts and, with the exception of Nolte as the aging Lt. Col. who has been passed over for promotion too many times and must prove himself on the battlefield, they all blend into the composite of soldiers at war that the director was trying to achieve.I didn't like The Search for Private Ryan. I thought it was a rehash of every war cliche I ever heard in a predictable story. I feel completely differently about The Thin Red Line, which rings true from its very core. So deeply did I sink into the movie, that I wasn't bored for one moment. Instead I was there, in the trenches, waiting for the next bullet and captured in the experience. This kind of movie, of course is not for everyone. But for those of us who look for the emotional catharsis that is possible in a work of art, I recommend The Thin Red Line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Though Incoherent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few times that I have seen a film as packed with visual splendors as Terence Malick's "The Thin Red Line". The beauty of the cinematography is unmatched by any other film this year as far as this reviewer is concerned. At the same time I must admit that this must have also been the hardest film to follow all year. Some praise this, most especially the current film enthusiasts of the day. Personally I have to be able to at least semi-understand about at least 50 percent of the movie the first time I see it, or much of the power that could have been is lost.I have not read the novel upon which this film was based, though I assume that Malick was floored by certain ideas in the book and when it came to the making of the drama it became a whole new emotional odyssey for the director. It shows in the film. One of the worst flaws in the film is Malick's ill decision to showcase so many superstar actors in such small parts. If they played larger and more important roles they may have made an impact on me, but as it is they are just plain distracting. In order for films such as this you almost have to make up a cast of unknowns in order for their characters to have any lasting effect on you. If you don't do that, you find yourself always recalling that was just Woody Harrelson dying, not his character. It is OK to have maybe one or two prominent stars in the film, but to basically send a casting call that says "Attention, all superstar actors, play a minor role along with five or six others in a WW II film", well, it really can hurt the film.Just look at the performance Jim Caviezel put in as the soldier whom the story focuses most on. As of now he is still the only character I can even remember caring about. And along with Nick Nolte, the only major star in a truly exceptional role, he gave the only performance that really registered with me. And nobody knows this guy!! Sean Penn was good too, though I wished they could have put a little more development into his character.I think the main flaw of the film, aside from the odd (!) editing style as employed by Malick, is the fact that this movie could really have been about any other war and you would not have known it. True, a war film should be able to represent more than the just the war it is about with it's message, but in "The Thin Red Line" there is not much of anything as far as historical value is concerned. I watched this with a close friend who also happens to be a Vietnam War veteran, and he complained of the same thing. Where did this take place again? Oh yeah, Guadalcanal... What importance did that have?We do see a few impressive battle scenes, and this is partly where Malick's editing becomes a bit too noticeable. While watching a film, you should not be thinking about the editing. Some of this did work, don't get me wrong: I came out knowing that one of the statements in the film was most certainly that war affects all creatures, no matter how small. A particularly effective scene occurred where a poor bird was bleeding to death and was struggling to regain its footing. The problem is, that is all I can remember from that scene. I remember there being machine gun fire, explosions, people dying (though on few occasions were deaths graphic).Is this about the sacrifice made by soldiers in the war, as in "Saving Private Ryan" (a very different and more conventional WW II film- which is thankfully also a lot more coherent)? Or is this about stray bullets hitting birds in the sky? (I know it is all meant to symbolize a whole lot more than what I just said.)So perhaps the biggest problem with the film is that it was just too ambitious.I do recommend "The Thin Red Line" to win an Oscar for best cinematography, and perhaps even a screenplay Oscar to Mr. Malick simply for coming out of retirement from movies after 20 years to make something that undoubtedly took so much heart and energy to create. I just wish I could understand what the heck it was all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terence Malick's hypnotic, visionary film The Thin Red Line will likely frustrate and confuse most mainstream cineplex audiences, but it is a work that should not be dismissed or taken lightly. Arguments have been made that the reduction and combination of characters and a clearer narrative drive would have improved the picture, but it is clear that Malick's intentions lie elsewhere. I was hypnotized and mesmerized by the beautiful images (many of them captured with a gliding, soldier's eye-level Steadicam) and the juxtaposition of the lush, natural world against man's intrusive, incomprehensible carnage. The Thin Red Line will forever suffer from the inevitable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan (a much more conventional film), but this is terribly unfortunate, since the two movies are so fundamentally different.</fullReview>

If this movie was in the run for the Oscars right now it would clearly beat Saving Private Ryan, Truman Show, and all categories. My only problem with the film was that it was cut so much! We only get to see half of the film. The orignal version of this film was six hours long and it has Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and probably more time for the rest of the cast.

		<fullReview>The thin Red line, I'll admit, was my second choice. It was a great movie that showed the love of your fellow soldier. It was not graphic like Saving Private Ryan. Rather, it got inside you with the fear and the insanity of battle and the loss of the soldiers' friends. The character Witt was seemingly the main character and he sort of becomes a reluctant hero to the scared soldiers. The Thin Red Line runs into a problem in that it has so many stars and not enough dialog to go around. Of course if Malick had shared the wealth with the lines, this film would have been an hour and a half too long.Overall it was a good movie but when the movie seems like it's over, leave then because you're not going to miss anything.

		<shortDescription>This movies poses profound questions which are difficult to express, but it is worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an ineffable quality about this movie. It leaves you feeling awed, drained, lonely, and sad. But none of these adjectives conveys the emotional punch to the solar plexus it renders.On the surface, the movie is about all the things that most war movies are about: fear, death, man's inhumanity to man, violence, brutality, love, obsession, the yearning for home. But it seems like there is something more.In part, this has to do with the way the activity of war is set against the natural world of the South Pacific. It is haunting and almost frightening. Nature is neutral to all of this. The tropical breeze ripples the grass of the rolling hills as the men seek out the enemy to do the most violent of things man can do. The breeze has gently and peacefully stroked these hills for ages, and will continue to do so long after these men have done their worst. The sun warms the land against a blue sky, pelicans glide above the palms, brightly colored tropical birds watch from the jungle. All of this goes on in the face of thundering fire, smoke and destruction. It is as if nature is saying, "This is but a momentary distraction. It will pass and leave little memory".And isn't that true about individual lives? They are so damned important to us, but in the face of the endless cycles of nature and the eternal sweep of time, they matter little. That is what the movie says that is so chilling and so sad. Because like the men of Charlie Company, who came here and sweated, and died, we fear our time in the grand scheme will mean as little.The final image of the film is a new palm sprouting from a coconut seed on the shore, as the ships of war fade in the distance.Fundamentally, the movie is about profoundly religious questions to which there are no easy answers. In this, it reminds me of two other films: "2001" and "Apocalypse Now". Like them, "The Thin Red Line" presents us with themes and images the meaning of which we cannot fully grasp, but in some way we sense inexpressible and haunting shadows of truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the entire James Jones WWII trilogy, especially "From Here to Eternity" and "The Thin Red Line" several times over the last 20 years. "The Thin Red Line" remains my favorite book about combat in World War II. I eagerly anticipated this movie. I understand that directors will often take a story in different directions than an author intended in order to make a comfortable shift between written and film media. But somehow the James Jones is gone from this movie. There is certainly some thoughtfulness and hidden depth in the characters in the novel, but his characters were first real and human. Sgt Welsh would have laughed and wanted to kick that frightened private in the ass to send him on his way. Under no circumstances would he have pontificated and spouted all this mumbo-jumbo in front of the men, unless of course he was completely drunk.Technically speaking the film is beautiful. Some of the combat scenes really came close, but the whole thing is completely derailed by these random philosophical ramblings and interminable digressions to hammer the "man and nature" theme into the audiences heads. I'm annoyed at Malick because he blew it, and we won't see anybody else make this story again, and that means it will never be done right, and this book really deserved it. I'll have to try and catch the 1964 version. Bad as it might be, it can't be as lousy as this one. My advice is, pretend you never saw the movie and read the book, don't let this movie turn you off to the novel, it is truly an infantryman's novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line, Terrance Malick's first film in over 20 years, is not nearly as good as Saving Private Ryan. The story of The Thin Red Line is confusing. Malick is overly symbolic. Some shots, like that of a bird dying, are vivid, but others are pointless. Too many symbols defeats the purpose of symbolism. The narration is also confusing, as sometimes it is hard to tell who is talking. Most performances are great. Sean Penn is excellent. I wish the story revolved around him more. He offers an honest performance and the story behind his character is the most interesting of the many stories. Nick Nolte has his moments, but he is for the most part overly melodramatic. John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are great in their roles, as are many of the lesser name actors who have good sized parts, such as Private Witt. The film drags along, unlike Private Ryan, this film felt longer than it was. The symbolism surrounding the tribe in the beginning is too vague. The battles scenes are well done though and I can appreciate the shots of Malick. He would be well advised to become a director for hire. He is a fine director, but his writing leaves a lot to be desired. Give us more of Sean Penn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will preface this by saying that this, more than likely, will not be accepted by 1999 mainstream moviegoers, which I suppose is fine. Many people are not interested in doing the amount of analysis and thinking that The Thin Red Line might possibly require to understand the film and everything it achieves. No big deal; the last thing I wish to do is pass judgement on those who don't. However, in my mind though, The Thin Red Line is an absolute work of art; and possibly one of the deepest films I've ever seen.Consider the beginning... A man (Cpl. Fife, played magnificently by Adrian Brody), in a paradise, surrounded by children, nature, and more beauty than one could ever imagine. He is in his heaven. He is in the very place of escape that Sgt. Edward Welsh's (Sean Penn) lines of dialogue speak against. Sgt. Welsh claims there is no place, but rather there is only this world that he lives in, on this rock. And then we see that this man's heaven, and the war he is fighting in, hell, exist in the same place. The genious in the conflict is awe inspiring, to say the least.As the movie progresses, "voice-overs," which I generally associate with elementary filmmaking, give the audience insight as to the thoughts that run through a soldier's head as he struggles in his attempt to understand the world and the war around him.The acting, for the most part is top-notch, and only a little jarring in the end when chin-down, eyes-up George Clooney makes his appearance, which in all honesty was not as bad as it might seem. The cinematography is as good as I have ever seen and brings about those feelings one gets while watching Discovery channel when one asks, "How did they film that?" but it is the story that makes the film a success. I have always written that all great films are one of two combinations, a good movie (in terms of the production itself) and a great story (It's A Wonderful Life), or a good story and a great movie (Saving Private Ryan); the comparison brings me to my conclusion.The Thin Red Line is about as close to a great story AND a great movie. WARNING: Do not go to see The Thin Red Line expecting to see anything close to Saving Private Ryan- I'm sick of being asked to compare the two films. They are about as different as any two films can be about the same subject, that being WWII. This is a thinking person's film about inherent nature of man, the bonds of men in war, and the struggle to balance the desires of both. An amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was more than a little disappointed by this film. After the exceeding media hype around it, I was pleased to see other commentors on this site who saw through the "correct" response to this movie to the "truthful" response: it failed.I've enjoyed the wartime film genre for many years. You won't find any "Kantian" interpretations here (who *was* that guy!?), but you will find an "academically informed" response. To start, the adaptation was horrific. Consider the precursor interpretation: *From Here to Eternity.* In a word: incredible. What discovery of character was present in that film, while still capturing that mood that is utterly James Jones...*The Thin Red Line* to say it briefly, commits the pathetic fallacy: in trying to "do justice" to a disjointed and detached situation (war), it presents us with a disjointed and detached film. The result: we are no closer to understanding the pressures these men felt; their stories have not been told; the enigma of military service has not been illuminated.There are literally millions of stories about World War II: stories of cowardice, bravery, standing-up, betrayal, detachment, horror, patriotism, foolishness, homesickness, wanderlust--the list is as long as our lexicon. The trick is, you HAVE TO TELL A STORY.*The Thin Red Line* tells no story. Its characters come and go, with some modicum of individuality, and we never know how any of the events impact them as individuals, or the men around them. And even if that was the case in Guadalcanal, or if that is the point of the film, that point could have--should have--been driven home to the audience through something more than, indeed, vacuous, stream-of-consciousness-wannabe poetry.I was left worse than cold--I was left numb to an event that, for all of the psychological trauma it left on those men, is somehow diminished by this film. It must win a dubious achievement award for that!Just for the record, it failed in every conceivable way for me: the camera work, the editing, the soundtrack, the dialogue, the character development, "plot" inconsistencies, the casting... I could go on, but what's the point...Read the book. Skip this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe my expectations of this film were too high as a result of Malick's previous films "Days of Heaven" and particularly "Badlands," but "The Thin Red Line," while obviously more ambitious than your usual Hollywood dreck, was a big letdown. The photography and conception of the battle scenes were amazing, the score was better than any Hans Zimmer score I've ever heard, and there were many scenes of unbelievable beauty. But that overly-arty-poetic narration was like fingernails across a chalkboard after a while. I guess Malick was trying for a "haunting" quality akin to that of his former films, but it just wasn't working in this film. The narration of his previous two films worked because the content was more fleshed out, more grounded, rather than pie-in-the-sky like this time around. And the character who might possibly be considered the central figure, Witt, was frustratingly impossible to identify with or even care about. And just for the record, I'm not comparing this film to "Saving Private Ryan" because I have not seen "Saving Private Ryan."</fullReview>

However, I'd describe the movie as subtle, rather than dragging or confusing. I think it all has to do with expectations. It is not an action film. And it is not Saving Private Ryan (which I didn't really like too much, btw). But I think if you take it for what it is, you'll find it's very good. I've been agitated by boredom in movies before, expecting something to happen. But somehow in this movie I was strangely relaxed with the pacing.There are 2 things about the film that I think are unquestionable, though. The visuals are stunning. It's hard not to notice. Another, and in my mind equally as impressive, was the soundtrack. I thought the acting and dialogue was very good, too. With all these things, I was locked into the movie from the beginning.There were only 2 points where concentration was broken. One - half an hour till the end, power in the whole building went out. ! Slightly distracting. Two - I caught myself thinking, "Hey, that's Vinny Barbarino."Anyway, I thought the movie was great. Definitely a better way to spend 3 hours rather than watching that piece of crap Titanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just a little disappointed with this film. I suppose the usual media hyped high expectations were at work, but aside from that I have to say that a few things troubled me.I could attempt to critique the film with the usual attention to artistic merits that everyone else has already done a fine job of, and I could do the inevitable comparisons to Saving Private Ryan, using a point by point comparison.What I'll do instead is resort to a much more visceral approach and simply point out that at the end of this movie I found that I was glad to have seen it but would not care to go to either the trouble or the expense to see it again on the big screen. I can try to disect a film 'till I'm blue in the face, but I've found that my final indication of any films worth to me is my desire to revisit it. I would run out to see Citizen Kane again in a second if it were re-released, I went to the theatre to see the re-release of The Wizard of Oz and I would like the opportunity to see Saving Private Ryan again on the big screen.I will probably see this film again at some point in the future on video, but I can wait a long, long time. Enough said. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before you can sit down and watch about this movie, you must ask yourself what it is that you are expecting.Those expecting Saving Private Ryan (which came out the same year) will find themselves lost and flailing in Malick's unconventional movie-making. Those expecting Platoon will find a whole different kind of grittiness, and a different kind of atmosphere. Apocalypse Now is the closest of the greats, but a wholly unfair comparison; The Thin Red Line can not share company with those movies.There are many things to praise about TRL, but the most evident and obvious is the power of the cinemetography. TRL is beautiful and vast and the sense of overwhelming immersion in the scenery is breathtaking. That immersion, unfortunately, has trouble carrying over to the movie itself.It is arguable that Malick does not create movies for the masses, and indeed, the masses seem to congregate in large crowds at the exits. Some find tremendous art in TRL, but while I recognize the effort, I fault the workmanship.The poetry of TRL is in the cinemetography, and unfortunately, the voice overs and curiously jumpy plot line detract from the overall experience instead of adding to it, as was surely the intention. The characters melt into one another, each a drama all his own, and while that may be the makings for greatness, the formula was wrong.Instead of feeling submerged in a vast war or many internal wars, the staccato movement from character to character eventually numbs the viewer in a way that removes from the emotional commitment which would have been the difference between this and an aweing movie.Instead, with no emotional investment, when the end (finally) comes, the viewer is left with very little they did not take in themselves. Even at the end, Malick continually teases us, as it appears that the movie will end but yet drags on many times before it does. It got to the point that I was afraid after the credits were rolling that another scene would sneak its way into the movie.Sure, the pretext is simple enough to grasp. Man vs. Man. What is the nature of man? Why war? Nature is beautiful: Man destroys it. All these, I got within the first twenty minutes. The beautiful island, the natives, the gator slinking back into the mud...The poetry is there, but between the lines are travesty. A movie that might have been. In its beauty, TRL holds too much ugliness and detachment. I could not submit myself to the greatness of the movie because its failings were too many. Some may be able to dredge the meaning from the quagmire of TRL, but I could not come up without the mud covering it.TRL is a movie that, perhaps, if viewed again, one might find some gem that escaped unsullied. Unfortunately (for me?), I couldn't stomach another session of its failed promises.</fullReview>

Does he shriek with fear and panic? Does he get fired up? Does he crack jokes to lighten the tension inside of him? The film is a brilliant character study....

		<fullReview>This is Justin Hall from Justin Hall's Saving Private Ryan Homepage and I must say that I do highly recommend this film. Though not as good as Saving Private Ryan, Terrance Malick has done a wonderful job with The Thin Red Line. The movie goes into the lives of the soldiers at a place that Spielberg didn't in SPR. Though you can't tell who is narrating at times, the overall message does not need a known voice. Wonderful acting from Nolte, James Caviezel, and Ben Chaplin, along with Sean Penn the movie is a perfect 10.</fullReview>

Worse, you don't even care about the victims as they're paper thin and their suffering is anything but heroic.

		<fullReview>The Emperor isn't wearing any clothes. And his name is Terrence Malick.This is a three hour movie that seems as if two more movies have been edited out of it. The result is a mishmash of a film with big name stars wandering in and out (mostly out) of the meandering narrative, while new faces contribute artsy-fartsy philsophical voice-overs of which their characters hardly seem capable. There is much to like, especially visually, but some stunning cinematography and beautiful nature shots strung together do not a film make.Sean Penn gives a dignified performance as a war-weary sarge, and Nick Nolte is impressive as a gruff colonel. Other than that, the big name performances seem oddly truncated (George Clooney literally has about 30 seconds screen time.) And the newcomers, all with dark hair, dirty faces, and twangy accents, are undistinguishable.Malick's films never seem to be about what they're really *about.* _Days of Heaven_, for example, seems to be less about a tragic love triangle than the loss of innocence and the destruction of an idyllic world. Great, but the depiction of the brutality and insanity of war is strong enough without beating us over the head with symbolism.There are some beautiful visuals in the film that are pure poetry: heavenly light filters in through the lush jungle canopy onto a dying soldier, a brilliant, blue butterfly flits across the battlefield carnage. They are stunning moments, to be sure, but how many of these juxtapositions do we really need to see? Yeah, we get it, Terrence.I found myself far more involved with the less "brilliant" _Saving Private Ryan_. Malick's film is often more stunning and poetic than Spielberg's, but for a film about war to be uninvolving is unforgivable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose this movie would be appreciated by cinema professors, Ivory League poets and those who sell celluloid by the foot. For the rest of us, it is an exercise (a long exercise) in boredom.First of all, nothing happens for the first 45 minutes, and even after some (very good) battle scenes, I had a difficult time figuring out where the movie was going and exactly what it was about. The director attempted to involve us in the lives of a number of characters, but in the end I really didn't care about any of them. There was no weaving of sub-plots, no good character development, nothing but a mishmash of scenes and narrative pretending to be profound. The cameo appearances by big-name actors were totally out of place, which made the movie even more off-putting.If you loved the Vietnam War movie "Apocalypse Now" you might like this one. I didn't and I don't. Both appear to be attempts by the director to be artsy and profound. But as far as I'm concerned, both movies are on the weird side. My wife and I looked at our watches a number of times during this movie, a good indication of how little the film captivated us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see plenty of movies. I'm not a film buff. Arty pictures don't enthrall me, or even interest me generally. That said, comments about ponderous, pretentious movies don't really wash when they're made by people with too short an attention span to be able to tell one character from the next. It's like complaining that I, Claudius was a lousy TV show because everyone was dressed in those Roman robes.The comparisons between The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan, are, I suppose, inevitable. Here's mine: while both have their strong points and weak points, The Thin Red Line is an infinitely better picture than Saving Private Ryan. In particular, Terence Malick's direction and John Toll's cinematography show a lot more of the turmoil, the guts, and the gruesomeness of what war is all about. In Saving Private Ryan, you know from the moment you buy your popcorn that the good guys are going prevail and that Private Ryan is going to be saved. In The Thin Red Line, you don't know what's going to happen next -- and as many have pointed out, you're often confused from moment to moment as to what's happening. Many of the comments on this film (both in IMDB and elsewhere) see that as a weakness of this picture; I see it as a strength. Life is chaotic and confusing sometimes. I presume that war is even more chaotic and confusing.Terence Malick's films all use FILM -- not books, not dialogue, and most assuredly not TV -- to tell their stories. He gets great performances out his actors while shooting beautiful pictures of them and the settings through which they move. If that offends or bores or confuses you, or if you're annoyed because John Travolta wasn't onscreen for long enough, please feel free to choose those other media for your entertainment. If instead you want a wonderfully acted, spectacularly shot, and compellingly directed movie, this is as good as you're likely to see in a long while.---Michael B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason I saw Apocalypse Now in half of this movie (somehow I wouldn't call it a film). Nick Nolte's first voice-over is highly reminiscent of Captain Willard's bitter ponderings; the jungle scenes could have been Cambodian; and the whole Rousseauean "noble savage" bit was done to death by Coppola -- and with much better success (and isn't it also a big part of Papillon with Steve McQueen?). Not to mention that I seemed to hear that weird kind of Vangelis-style music in a lot of the battle scenes.Where the movie isn't derivative, it's just plain bad. The amateurish John Boy soliloquizing ("What is love?" &amp;c.) becomes quickly annoying, as does the needless parade of cameos, the quantity of which tend to thin out the already-weak storyline. Potentially interesting characters (Travolta, Cusack) seem to appear and quickly vanish. While this may be in keeping with the random progression of war, it makes for poor storytelling. Movies overly mimetic of the dumb chance and fragmented character of real life are usually bad ones, and TRL is no exception. Like Spielberg in his sub-par war effort, Malick was going after a kind of documentary-quality realism in this story; what he wound up with was an overcrowded, poorly structured marathon, not even worth the free pass I surrendered to see it.And I'd really like to know why the woman with the baby at the beginning speaks english...</fullReview>

Seeing this is striking, and as horrific as watching American soldiers get killed.*It has a lot more to say about war in a much deeper way than SPR. SPR proved war is terrible, and sometimes pointless, but wrapped it up in a nice, taught, Hollywood package. The Thin Red Line does nothing of the sort. It meanders in confusion, violence, beauty, love, loss, and other issues that are barely discussed in SPR.*It uses its marquee actors for a much better, overall, effect. I didn't know who any of the big names were (save Nick Nolte) 'til about half way through the film and this was great because you could really get into the characters and accept them. When I finally realized who John Cusacks characer was, I could barely believe it.*The film FEELS long. I think TRL and SPR are about comparable in length, but Malick's film makes you feel the length, the time, the waiting, the anticipation, the disorder, in much better ways than can be imagined. SPR was a taught war film, TRL is a sprawling,human, epic.That is all I can contribute right now. I am sure people are going to freak out and that, in the end, SPR will do much better than TRL, but for the intelligent, discriminating film viewer, there is no better film about war(not "war film").

		<fullReview>After seeing The Thin Red Line I see why some reviewers have compared it to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both films are alike in that they transcend their respective genres. Many who saw 2001 back in 1968 where expecting to a science fiction film, but what they saw was so much more than just a space opera. What they got instead was as a meditation on the nature and destiny of mankind. It was a highly intellectual work of art that challenged its viewers to come up to its level of understanding. Many where not up to the challenge and where either confused or where alright hostile to the film. The same appears to be true of The Thin Red Line. It is much, much more than just a war movie. It is a meditation on the nature of human existence and of good and evil. It is a visually beautiful and intellectually challenging film, which is also being greated with confusion and outright hostiltiy. Some of the comments that are being made here on the IMDB are excellent examples of this confusion and hostility. As the years go by and the dust settles, I believe that The Thin Red Line will take its place alongside of 2001 and a handful of other films as being the best examples of the art form in the latter half of the 20th century.If you just want to see a war movie, do not go see The Thin Red Line. If you believe that movies should be entertainment and not works of art, do not go see The Thin Red Line. If you do not like being intellectually challenged while watching a movie, do not go see The Thin Red Line. There are legions of other movies that will be more to your taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt the entire audience around me squirming waiting for A Thin Red Line to end. However, after having read the book myself, I kept wanting the movie to go into more detail. I wanted to see the characters progress, see them change, but that would have doubled the length of the film.I can see how viewers who have not read the book could become lost, it took me a while to figure out which face belonged to each character. Knowing the details of the book helped to keep my interest throughout the film, I found myself constantly comparing the way I had envisioned James Jones' novel to the way Terrance Malick portrayed the events.The colors and images of the film were a pleasure to watch. I pictured a much darker setting reading the novel, while the film is often bright and colorful.The casting was great in some areas, strange in others. The main problems I saw in the casting were apparent cameos by some big Hollywood names. I did hear that many of those roles were much larger in the screenplay, but cropped in the final product. I honestly never saw either Bill Pullman or Mickey Rourke.Making this film was a huge undertaking and I am glad Malick did. I would steer anyone expecting a mainstream movie far clear of the film. I suggest reading the novel first, and then again after as well.</fullReview>

There were scenes of blood and guts, which is the reality of war. The scene where a squad of men first went out on scout.

Nick Nolte gave an extraordinary performance of a West Point grad that would do anything to have a "win" so he could climb the ranks. He was willing to sacrifice any number of men to get it.Sean Penn was fantastic. He portrayed a man that had a very soft heart, but wasn't going to let anyone (or himself) know it. Keeping the hard exterior was going to keep him safe and sane.There are too many actors in this film to go on about.

		<shortDescription>Still trying to figure it out...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's frustrating coming out of a movie thinking "Well, that SEEMED deep, but I must have missed most of it." That's how I felt coming out of The Thin Red Line.There are some definite positive as well as negative points: as many have pointed out, it was a beautifully shot movie, with incredible vibrant color, and striking imagery. Every frame was worth a photographic still. But there are some serious technical flaws as well. Given the number of characters that appear it is simple impossible to keep them apart -- I found I could not even remember any names as I walked out of the theater. There is certainly no cohesive narrative, and no climax that I can ascertain.But then, perhaps I am wrong to insist on such details. Many of the reviewers here have called this movie "poetry", and I would agree wholeheartedly. It is poetry in that it gives you a series of images, moods, colors and then tells you to piece them up yourself. Just as in written poetry where word connotation and atmosphere are often more important than message, so Mallick's vocabulary is light and color and mumbled dialogue.I would be wary then, of any attempts to impose a "meaning" or a "point" to this movie. I don't know what this movie is about, but I know what it is NOT about:-- It is not about the man/nature relationship, although frequent man/nature imagery recurs. Yet I find this imagery ambiguous, and at times contradictory. The opening sequence with the soldier living among the natives seems to forward "harmony with nature" message, while subsequent images refer to nature as inherently violent and cruel. So who's in harmony with nature, us or the natives?-- It is NOT a "the enemy is just like us" message. Little attempt was made to humanize this adversary. A few scenes showed some Japanese soldiers crying and wringing their hair in utter despair, while others prayed feverishly -- while these suggest human emotion and human weakness, they don't speak as mush as it would if one of them -- indeed if anyone in this movie -- just cracked a smile, or showed some other emotional state besides hysteria. This theme gets a total of perhaps 3 minutes of screen time.-- It is DEFINITELY not about the realities of war. One review on this site which I greatly enjoyed pointed numerous military/factual errors. Aside from these, the behaviour displayed by most of these characters is HIGHLY questionable. "Saving Private Ryan" went to extraordinary lengths to place the audience on Omaha beach, using a great deal of eye-level shots in a kind of first-person perspective. The point of view of TTRL is ultimately detatched. Besides which if Mallick were to be trusted, then the entire US army consists entirely of philosophers from the South, with one or two guys from Brooklyn thrown in.In the end the themes of this movie are just as fleeting as the characterization -- great introduction but gone before we could get to know them. This in the end is one of the greatest problems of the movie, and probably is what makes the 2.5 hours seem like 2.5 weeks. By the end, it seems like Mallick isn't even into it anymore. At the beginning of the movie, the voice-over dialogue is mysterious and intriguing. Two hours later, lines like "What is love?" and "Where does evil come from?" sound like philosophy for 9 year olds. And, unfortunately, shooting light streaming through trees, or birds perching on branches DON'T necessarily make it deep philosophical material.Nevertheless, as can be seen from the viewer comments, one either loves this movie or despises it. If you're considering seeing it, just consider that you might fall into the former category. As I say above, I'm still trying to figure out where I stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with potential that fails miserably.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited about THE THIN RED LINE when I first heard about its release. However, after seeing it, I've come to the conclusion that it is not a film. It's not even a collection of images. It's nothing. This film, for its three hour length, and countless random "poetic," shots eventually failed to install anything in me. I didn't even know if it was anti-war or not. For those of you familiar with the writer James Joyce, THE THIN RED LINE reminded me of something that Joyce would have come up with if he was on acid! The only award that this film should even BEGIN to be considered for is Best Cinematography. If it wins any other award, than I am dropping out of film school and becoming a bum on the streets...better that than be caught up in an industry that doesn't understand the difference between quality and garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Torture. Sheer torture. Don't get me wrong, it was beautifully filmed (although poorly edited)--Malick certainly has an eye...but he can't tell a story. I know what you're saying--he wasn't trying to tell a story, he was trying to convey a mood... Well, he certainly put ME in a mood. I was so tempted to stand up in the theatre, while some anonymous voice-over is saying something flowery and oblique about the nature of man and shout "OK, we get it! War is bad, people are messed up and can't we all get along...can we go home now?" Instead, I just checked my watch and realized I still had over an hour to go... There are some great moments and some memorable scenes, but by the end I was so bludgeoned and uninvolved that those moments and scenes didn't make up for the time spent. Nolte is good--although his inner dialogue (which is interchangable with every other inner dialogue in the film) is laughable. Penn is...well, Penn... No one else makes an impression (unless you count Travolta's poor cameo.) It's criminal that Malick chose to change Elias Koteas' character from being Jewish to being Greek. You could tell there was a sub-plot straining to burst free from Malick's dreamlike imagery--something that might have maintained my interest for the interminable length of this film...but Malick successfully undercuts the dramatic impact offered in the book.Overall...this is as flawed of a movie as "Dune" was... And some people loved "Dune"--so many will love "The Thin Red Line."Not me, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the voices of rage and chagrin that has plagued this film, I, along with a small group of others, sing out in favor of this masterpiece. Masterpiece, you might ask? But of course. Terrance Malick has directed a beautiful, poetic, and paean of a film that strongly, and courageously, follows the artful appeal of APOCALYPSE NOW.Malick has strewn the film with an anger so sound that it literally pours from the screen with every cry from a wounded soldier, with every image of dying man, and with every word narrated throughout the film. Malick, as with the picture itself, is more than deserving of many nominations at this years Academy Awards, however, Spielbergs SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did do a slightly finer job at portraying the negative aspects of war.Americans have been spoon-fed entertaining films for nearly one-hundred years now. Maybe this is why many dislike THE THIN RED LINE. It is foreign to us. Like a Federico Fellini film, it has character, art, and symbolism packed within its walls. It is a pity that more films like this are not made. We have only been given cheap action thrillers that simply throw a story at as that requires no thought or common knowledge. That is a pity. Maybe some day the intellectual film, THE THIN RED LINE, will earn the respect that it clearly deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as good as Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will be short. Let me start by saying that I have seen Saving Private Ryan and I enjoyed that film more than this one for a few reasons. Thin Red Line dragged on in quite a few places sometimes I thought the movie was over and then another battle would start. The movie seemed like it was a lot longer than it really was. The acting was really great in it especially Sean Penn and a lot of the newer actors also did well. The movie also had George Clooney in it's trailers and you see him in the last 5 minutes of the movie where he says a minute long speech and you never see him again. I am a fan of his so I was expecting a little more screen time for him. Other than that it was a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting to see an amazing film about a WWII battle, and frankly I was bored. As a soldier myself I was moved by the fear of going into battle and the portrayal of friends formed by intense situations. What I did not understand was the rest of the movie. The first 20 minutes I was so confused as to what was going on, and the situation didn't improve much. The characters, while intertwined, were so detached during there narratives and it jumped around too much. Again probably a good statement about the confusion of war, but I could not follow. Unfortunately this film will be compared to Saving Private Ryan, (an excellent movie) when it should not be, but even I found myself wishing for the amazing camera angles and plot that Speilberg brought to the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was anxious to see "the Thin Red Line" because of what I had read about it, but was glad that I went in prepared. I enjoyed many aspects of this movie. It tells a sweeping story: the American attack on the Japanese-held island of Guadalcanal, over a period of days. It swings between the big picture and powerful vignettes in which the thoughts of individual soldiers are shown and told to the viewer. Some of these performances are brilliant, particularly those of Ben Chaplin, Woody Harrelson and John Cusack. Others seem stupid, like that of John Travolta. The movie shows aspects of war that I had never seen before: the beauty of the landscape before the human violence begins, the combination of training and chaos that is an attack, and the emotional aftermath, when the enemy has surrendered and some soldiers cry while others explode into violence. There were scenes that I will not soon forget. But overall, someone should have edited this movie so that it was shorter, less wandering and generally more focused. I do recommend the film - but be prepared for its length.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think this is going to be "Saving Private Ryan" on Guadalcanal, do yourself a favor and wait for it on video. At the very least, do the rest of us a favor and refrain from comparing it to "Ryan" on this board. Spielberg and Malick are vastly different directors; Spielberg's movies are able to capture the America's collective consciousness (the Public to a large degree) and thus easily enjoy critical and commercial success. Malick is anything but a commercial director. He possesses artistic and creative abilities that Spielberg does not (or chooses not use) and we, the audience, see this demonstrated in "Thin Red Line". The morality of war is ambiguous in "Line", the lines between good and evil are blurred, and "the mission" is not "a man." In short, "Line" is a very complicated movie in the sense that is not a clear cut war movie of the sort that have been produced by the Hollywood machine and that is part of what makes it so wonderful. The characters are extremely developed and unique people, but realize that to understand them one must see them through james jones' (the author) lens in the context of how they interact with the war, the battles, and each other. This lens may have been somewhat blurred by Malick in the sense that we are not exposed to all of the character's feelings, emotions, and dialogue (indeed in a film this would be impossible), but Malick's overall interpretation, vision, and artistic translation of the book into a movie, if understood, can compensate for this. A brilliant director made a brilliant film that does not go looking for everyone to understand it, or even enjoy it, but, with luck, when you see it maybe you will understand something of Jone's message...And Malick's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like war movies because I hate to see violence, so I would have thought a film purporting to examine the psychological impact of the horrors of war would be right up my alley. But I hated this film as I have not hated a film in a long time. Having read the comments of the film's supporters, I get the impression that I'm just not smart enough or film-savvy enough to get the beauty of this film. Sorry, kids, although I acknowledge that it was pretty to look at, I refuse to believe that the film's inaccessibility makes it great art.I found absolutely nothing to anchor me in tnis movie. I turned to my companion 30 minutes into it and asked him, "Did we miss the first reel?" I didn't have the first idea who the characters were. When the captain tells some of his men after the big battle, "you are like my sons" I thought, "who are these guys?" Was I supposed to know how he felt about them from his behavior or from any of the action of the film? Because I didn't. The whole scene came out of nowhere and went nowhere. Take that one complaint and apply it to every character and every scene (except the climaxes of the various battles) and you have my experience of the film.I haven't read the book, but I did check out the reader comments on it in Amazon.com. Apparently THE THIN RED LINE is a very gritty, realistic take on Guadalcanal told from multiple viewpoints of C-company's soldiers. It would seem that this film is trying to be faithful the floating viewpoint, but I can hardly believe that the book's use of this device was as confusing as the movie's. Aside from not being able to distinguish one voice from another, my main problem is that the film kept an aesthetic distance from all of the characters so that when someone's voice-over was giving you his point of view it all melded together and seemed universally banal. Doesn't the judicious use of specificity make the universal more meaningful? Maybe the ultimate point of the film is that we will all end up dead and nothing matters, but I hardly think that boring me to death is the most effective way to make the point.I couldn't wait for this film to end. It was all I could do to restrain myself from standing up in the theatre and screaming, "Is anyone else here as bored as I am?" Weirdly enough, as much as I hate violence, I kept longing for some to relieve the tedium.I have sat through a 4 hour film about Mongolian women warriors (Johanna D'Arc of Mongolia) and loved it. I have also sat through an 11-hour play (Peter Brook's THE MAHABHARATA) with no trouble. I can't believe that my negative experience of this movie is entirely my fault.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping, moving, poetic vision of war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Mallick has delivered his third film in the director's chair and it delivers with a powerful punch. The film's centerpiece is the Japanese invasion of Guadalcanal Island, one of the worst battles in the pacific of WWII. The dynamic scope of the film is breathtaking and the imagery is beyond compare, and it's in the poetic verse and hypnotic images of war where the film soars very high. The film unfolds through the eyes and thoughts of the men who fought and died on Guadalcanal. These images are spliced and sewn together, as if Mallick is making a giant quilt of war images.However, when the film sores, it soars high, but when it lands it seems to lose connective tissue. Many characters come in and out of the film without any real meaning or substance. The promotional campaign for the film touted its long list of Hollywood heavy-weights, and it's here where the film flounders. Cameos from John Travolta, John Cusack, George Clooney, and Woody Harrelson are forced in and out of the picture without any real meaning or purpose. Sean Penn, at times, looks and acts as if this were a squeal to "Casualties of War". Perhaps the saddest part of this whole experience was the fact that after almost three hours I felt that I didn't really know the two lead characters. I felt cheated.I personally wish Mallick had given the audience more substance and confined the action more on the two central characters rather than introducing fragments of many characters. My biggest fear is that audiences are expecting another "Saving Private Ryan" with a lot of star power and they will be hugely disappointed. While "Ryan" follows the standard, straight-forward rules for unfolding a story, "Red Line" relies heavily on the abstract, philosophical images of war, and it is through these images that audiences will be introduced to the slaughter that occurred on Guadalcanal. Cinematographer John Toll (Legends of the Fall, Braveheart) uses breathtaking, beautiful images of an island in the Pacific as a backdrop to the ugly, brutal, and often savage images of war, and it is in these images where "Red Line" soars higher and farther than "Ryan" could hope to.If audiences grasp these images and take them to heart, then this is a three-hour journey well worth the time. This film will be talked about and dissected long after other WWII dramas are forgotten. I recommend this film, giving it 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

How the camera moved through the grasses, lingered on the lace curtains, spoke to the buried Japanese face - all this summed up perfectly the futility of war, adding that even our so called enemy has family and friends and he too is loved by all.

		<shortDescription>The best film anyone has done in years and years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though The Thin Red Line has some serious narrative faults, it is one of the greatest movies of the past decade. A few years from now when the critics won't be thinking about Private Ryan so much, they'll maybe let this film happen to them the way it is intended to. Malick is unparalleled in using film images as poetry, as metaphor, as suggestion . . . and his is a subtle art that is lost on many people. Though Malick relies heavily on voice-overs, it is imperative to WATCH his films to understand what is happening and where the characters are. During Malick's insufferable absence from the film scene, audiences (and a hell of a lot of critics) have been conditioned to watch movies on TV screens, a change in viewing habits that has proved to be more deleterious to the quality of American films than anything else ever has. One of the most obvious problems this has created is the way widescreens have been wasted on films that are really designed to be cropped for TV screen aspect -- the very language of film, the picture, has been limited. But The Thin Red Line is almost defiant in its magnificent use of widescreen; in its use of pictures to tell stories (not A story), to create atmospheres and environments, to let the characters roam about the frame; and its general use of the ambience of a movie theater to create a sensation that is bigger than any of us. And yet, for such a giant movie, it is so introverted and intimate that its power will creep up on you and stick to you like nothing else, as long as you just let the film happen to you. See it on the big screen, as it will make no sense when the video companies chop the sides off the picture so you can watch it on your 20" TVs with those two ineffectual, tinny speakers squawking out Zimmer's sublime score.</fullReview>

It'd be nice to have original ideas and unique perspectives on war and human nature, blah blah blah, but the ideas are simple and childlike. I think we all already realize that the simplicity of nature is much nobler than human nature, so why repeat it ad nauseam with voiceovers that come out of nowhere and end up where they started?

This movie is not about the war, or even the way war affects individuals. It (to me) is about each person and their relationship with fellow man,and how he/she perceives themselves.The performance given by James Caviezel moved me in so many ways,I can see nothing but good things for this fine actor.I would give praise to each and every person involved in this piece of art but,like I said above, I don't want to write an essay here.

		<fullReview>There's a perfect triptych of scenes between Sergeant Walsh and Private Witt in this film--culminating in the second one on a fern covered hilltop at dusk, a brief reprieve from battle, where Walsh is talking to Witt, but also to himself--gently mocking him for his faith in "something better," asking, "what difference can one man make in all this madness?" The reviews I've read today missed the point of Walsh entirely, calling him an existentialist, oblivious to the fact that he's claiming to reject all meaning just after throwing himself in the direct line of fire in order to administer a bit of morphine to an already mortally wounded man. Every gesture--every expression of Walsh to Witt in that scene conveys...or betrays...love and friendship; I think he speaks in opposition to it--a belated prescription against attachment--a sublime tension between his utterances and actions. Walsh and Witt are a perfect yin-yang of bravery and cowardice, obligation and free will, compassion and aloofness--the most perfect and tender manifestation of Malick's theme of nature in dialogue with itself.</fullReview>

The striking cinematography is evident throughout the movie, and the personal viewpoint of WWII's US-Japan machinations through the eyes of key characters is unique and effective. Combine this with spectacularly realistic battle/fight scenes and a long film appears to be much shorter. Only real downside to me was the often unintelligible dialogue of certain narrative, and a lack of overall cohesion to the movie which denied the audience a real sense of direction or something to pick up and hold on to for the duration.

		<shortDescription>"Thin Red Line" is to war what "Taxi Driver" is to driving a taxi...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about ideas, including the human condition and longings vs. human nature, not about war. War is simply the most effective vehicle with which the classic foil can be illustrated. For this reason, it is unfair to all the Platoon and Priv.Ryan seekers to tout TRL as a war film. The setting of war was almost, but not quite, incidental. I say almost because situations as extreme as those experienced in a ground war are often necessary to draw out the extremes in human behaviour relative to their place in God's world.Any attempt to attach a plot to TRL would have only tethered it down, and convoluted Malick's aim. The idyllic settings specked with pockets of manmade antagonism were all that was needed as a platform for Malick's inquiry into understanding ourselves. Just as DeNiro's driving a taxi put us where we needed to be to really see humanity at that level, so does the beautiful paradox of Guadalcanal put us where we need to be to experience the continuous tragedy of human nature.Malick takes us to this point of the film almost immediately. If you were still looking for a plot or some kind of formulaic storyline by the end of the film, you missed the forest for the trees. If those who didn't appreciate the film could bear to go see it again, you would realize that the film proceeds not as a story to be told, rather as a visual and narrative poetry that bares us open completely in questioning the substance of our souls.The Thin Red Line doesn't just open a spiritual world in a way that very few films in history have attempted to grasp. It does so with such poised reverence for the cinematic medium in its lyrical balance of sound, image and narrative, that it stands as not only the best film of the year, but one of the best film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell. So is this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the 1964 movie of James Jones's combat novel, The Thin Red Line, as a teenager. I liked it so much that I saw it twice. In fact, I liked that original version a lot better than Terrence Malick's 1998 remake. The original was in black-and-white and starred Jack Warden as Sgt. Eddie Welsh and Keir Dullea as Pvt. Don Doll. The original left out many of the characters in Jones's book, but as I recall, it faithfully depicted those characters and scenes from the book that it did use. Doll's stealing a pistol from another company--and being called on it by a sardonic Welsh--was a classic scene straight from the book. So was a gut-shot Tella screaming his head off as he tried to hold in his intestines. The combat was savage, and the use of black-and-white made it seem more real--like the newsreels of World War II combat.Malick's remake suffers from a weak script and very bad casting overall. In the book, Sgt. Welsh had great force of personality--mad was a word Jones used to describe him, just as he used it to describe Sgt. Milton Anthony Warden in Jones's first book, From Here to Eternity, with whom he shared a number of traits. In the 1964 original, Jack Warden portrayed Sgt. Welsh as he was in the book--a supremely competent top sergeant who's tough, abusive, and hard to get along with. Sean Penn's Welsh is a smirking little pussy; he looks like he might cry if you smacked him. Not a forceful type at all, he lacked the screen presence to portray Welsh. And what's with that absurd hairstyle of his--a World War II first sergeant didn't go into combat with a Dairy Queen confection on his head.In the book, Pvt. Witt is a hardheaded, combative--and unabashedly rednecked--little Kentuckian. He had some of the traits of Robert E. Lee Prewitt, the central character in From Here to Eternity. But unlike Prewitt, Witt was not a reflective sort--just a hardbitten, fiercely-proud, impulsive young man given to resolving disputes with his fists. In Malick's treatment, Witt is a sensitive soul much given to introspection and cloudy philosophizing. It's almost as if Malick took the mental confusion and sentimentality that Jones attributed to Corp. Geoffrey Fife--a coward in the book--and gave them to Witt. In the book, Witt was a tough little cookie, and the quintessential combat infantryman. Malick ruined a good strong character.He would have done better to leave out other characters. It's hard to compress a book into a movie, especially a book with so many sharply-drawn characters like Welsh, Doll, Witt, Charlie Dale, John Bell, Capt. Johnny Gaff, Mess Sgt. Storm, Lt. George Band and Capt. Bugger Stein (Malick renames his company commander Staros; why, when Stein's Jewishness was such a big part of the conflict between himself and the Anglo-Saxon Lt. Col. Gordon 'Shorty' Tall?). In the book, you knew who was who; in Malick's movie you often don't. True, there are moments--vignettes like the one with Tills and Mazzi aboard the troop transport--that give you glimpses of what the movie might have been like had Malick been true to the book, but on the whole I was disappointed.The dreamy narration and slow music give the movie a miasmic quality that wasn't in the book. As a writer, James Jones had a very rough edge. He mangled words ('hystericky' to describe Corporal Fife comes to mind), made up others, and disregarded a lot of the niceties we tend to associate with good writing. But he was such a hell of a storyteller and wrote with such authority about the soldier's life that you didn't mind; the sledgehammer force of his writing just swept you along. Malick would have done a lot better to focus on fewer characters and use more of Jones's language in the narration. He should have hired a professional to write the screenplay instead of taking on the job himself. Malick's Thin Red Line is a statement movie. He wants to tell us that war is hell. We already knew that, buddy.I thought some of Malick's combat scenes could have been handled better, especially the attack through the Japanese-held village. In the book, the GIs are edgy and tend to be trigger-happy. Malick opts for an elegiac treatment--combat as ballet. A bad mistake. As a vast body of historical evidence indicates, there was a strong undercurrent of racism in the Pacific War. The GIs and the marines hated the Japanese and regarded them almost as a subhuman species. The Japanese in their turn hated the U.S. troops. That element of racism and the savagery it engendered was very much a part of Jones's book, and it rarely makes an appearance in Malick's ponderous movie.Nick Nolte does a solid job of portraying the overweeningly ambitious Lt. Col. Tall, although he plays him as a rather slovenly, raggedy-ass officer instead of the stern, clean-cut character in Jones's book.Don't know why they needed John Travolta and George Clooney for this movie. Snatches of dialogue in the scene between Nolte and Travolta (as a general officer) aboard a troopship were lifted from the book, From Here to Eternity. Anyone who's read the book will recall the youthful Brig. Gen. Sam Slater ('from Sheyboygan, Wisconsin') making a disparaging comment about the aging Col. Jake Delbert (the regiment's 'Great White Father,' who makes a brief inebriated appearance as the regimental commander 'Old Whitehair' in The Thin Red Line--the book, that is). Slater tells Capt. Dana Holmes that he's old for a captain, but would be young for a major. In effect, Malick makes the cinematic Lt. Col. Gordon M. L. Tall a composite of three characters in two books--Col. Delbert, Capt. Dana Holmes and Tall. The Travlota-Nolte scene has no business being in the movie. Besides, 'General' Travolta would look more believable wearing a UPS uniform. And Clooney as Capt. Bosche? Get outta here.Woody Harrelson is good as Sgt. Keck, but his death scene is a composite of the death scenes Jones wrote for Keck and Big Un Cash, the former taxi driver from Toledo. It was Cash who said, 'Write my old lady I died like a man.' In the book it was Thorne who promised to write Cash's wife, and then--after Cash dies--says, 'I tell them anything when they're like that.' Malick has Doll say that, and that's fine. But that scene happens much later in the book, when Charlie Company has been battle-hardened, and men like Doll have had ample opportunity to see dying men 'get like that.' In Malick1s treatment, Doll goes from scared kid to cynical combat veteran that first morning on the ridge.In the book, Charlie Dale was a mean little bastard, a stocky ex-cook-turned-combat-infantryman who works on Japanese corpses with a pair of electrician's pliers, and collects a Bull Durham sack full of gold teeth. In the movie he looks like he's about to start spouting, 'To Be Or Not To Be.'The one thing I found truly wonderful about the movie was that it was shot on location in Guadalcanal. Truly gorgeous photography. But overall I was bummed. Now I'm going to have to wait another 35 years for someone else to come along and do it right. Too bad the 1964 movie isn't available anywhere. I could watch it again, which is a lot more than I can say for Malick's pretentious picture. My advice? See the movie by all means, if only for the great photography. But make sure you read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As flawed as war itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movie I've seen this year, and I've seen "Pleasantville" /and/ "Something About Mary."If it must be compared to "Saving Private Ryan" -- and I'm not convinced it must -- then it could be said that "A Thin Red Line" is SPR without the happy ending.The leading criticism of SPR was that its storyline was too neat, its characters too stereotypical with its squad culled from war movies past. There's a beginning, a middle and a satisfactory end -- closure, even. It's "Titanic" in mud.Which makes it amazing, then, that SPR has been praised for its realism. I don't know what your life is like, but mine never has closure, and the characters in my life are never as carefully balanced as in SPR. And if reading "A Red Badge of Courage" three times in high school taught me anything, it's that war is never neat or tightly wrapped up in the end.ATRL, on the other hand, is chaotic and claustrophobic, which makes me think it is the more accurate and realistic portrayal of war. The characters fold into each other, and it is sometimes difficult to discern who is talking. There is no clean objective -- find the lost private, save the bridge -- other than don't be the next poor a****** to fall. Unlike SPR, the tension doesn't end after the beach. In SPR, the question was not, "Will they find Ryan?" but "How will they find Ryan?" There was no telling what was coming next in ATRL: The tension persisted throughout.The literary aesthetic to ATRL -- pretentiousness, if you will -- was at times overbearing, but in the end was very satisfying and made SPR resemble the Marvel comic it is. This is achieved through repeated symbols -- the sickness in the aborigines, the captured alligator, the trenches -- and flashbacks, but most effectively through point of view. One moment sticks with me: Pvt. Witt is talking to a wounded soldier in the river, telling him to go downstream to the rest of the company. Witt is talking to the soldier, but he is looking directly at the camera and he is speaking to us when he says, "Go on, you're going to be OK." Go on, he says, humanity will go on. This war will end.SPR tries to rationalize the war by illuminating the triumph of saving one person, leaving it to the audience to magniy that by a million or ten million. ATRL has no such aspiration. It is anti-war at all costs.Yes, it's too long. It literally felt like five hours, not three, and the last 45 minutes or so approaches redundancy. But it is a great accomplishment -- and clearly the best picture of the year.The director originally cut this at eight hours. I hope the other five hours eventually makes it to DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick As Cinematic Storyteller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line is not so much a war movie as it is a nature film, featuring a wider-than-usual variety of wildlife. Current reviews understandably cannot resist the urge to compare it to Saving Private Ryan. Rather than thinking of it as the second major film this year set in World War II, I think it is more appropriate to see it as Terrence Malick's third film. It follows Badlands and Days of Heaven in the way that Casino followed Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence.The Thin Red Line continues the storytelling style of his first two films, and it is every frame a Terrence Malick picture. Malick favors sights, sounds and music over words. He uses composition more than cutting and lighting more than action. He favors, in particular, low-angle side- and front-lighting, and all forms of light diffusion. In this film, as in his others, the pictures not only tell the story, they really are the story. As with 2001: A Space Odyssey, the words are barely captions to the pictures.If you're looking for an action film, skip it. (The trailer is misleading.) If you're looking for a feel-good film, this is not it. If you didn't like Days of Heaven, you probably won't like this one either. If, however, you'd like to see a film that is completely, stunningly cinematic, you could not do better than The Thin Red Line. I found it spellbinding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have so much as a comment on this film as a question. Like a lot of Malick's fans I was a little disappointed by this film. There was too much over-reliance on voice-over and flashbacks and yet so much was truly effective, from the great acting (the dynamics between Nolte/Koteas and Penn/Caviezel were terrific) to the cinematography to Hans Zimmer's perfectly brooding score. I've heard from critics and from actors who were in the film that the version being shown is somewhat cut. Does anyone know if there was a longer or different version intended? I have this hunch that all the pieces exist to make this a truly good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 8 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Spielberg, the world's most popular filmmaker, it's only natural to indulge in fraudulent pomposity and shameless audience manipulation. Terrence Malick, who hasn't yet experienced the pitfalls of fame, is in a way, a direct opposite. In 1998's second WWII epic, TRL (concentrating on the battle for Guadacanal in the Pacific phase of the war) , he proves to be a nonconformist to the bone, delivering a highly personal, uncompromising vision and sacrificing such essential principles as a coherent narrative structure for the sake of his individualism. Many of the world's greatest directors were rebels with a cause , creating masterpieces in their own unique styles, but with Malick, unfortunately, this is not the case. His bending of the rules does not amount to a satisfying whole: never surpassing Saving Private Ryan, the film is often frustrating and downright incomprehensible. TRL seems to completely disobey the laws of cinematic physics: after an excruciating middle sequence, the movie loses momentum and continues for another hour without a climax in sight, alienating and bewildering the viewers, instead of channeling their intensity towards a final, necessary release. The lopsided, barely visible conclusion fails to involve them. What further complicates matters is the often indistinguishable off-camera narrations by at least five different characters: keeping track of all the perspectives is a daunting task, in a film riddled with faces that quickly dissapear from view and from the plot. Famous actors (Travolta, Clooney, Harrelson): appear for as little as a minute each, unnecessarily distracting from the rest of the cast, since they have no time to develop a character that can replace their own public images as big stars. While most of the soldiers are not walking stereotypes, like in SPR all are underdeveloped, leaving us in hopes of a deeper investigation. Finally, the nature of the voice-overs is often banal and is much better left unsaid. The universal questions about the relationship between nature and humanity, good and evil, and the like, should arise in the viewer's mind without additional sonic assistance, since Malick's images speak for themselves. Eventually, his philosophical asides become forced and cliched, much like Spileberg's tearjerking patriotism. The positive aspects of the film cannot, in the long run, overshadow the negative ones, but they do offer us an experience not easily forgotten. TRL is shot from an unseen observer's point of view, constantly zooming in on priceless details: some horryfying and some touching in their realism. The mis-en-scenes and individual frames, depicting men in their primordial surroundings with intricate and violent beauty, can only be likened to those of Kurosawa. Some 100 minutes or so, form a protruded battle scene: the storming of the Japanese hilltop fortification and the pillage of their encampment. This "middle sequnece" is nothing short of absolute brilliance. Often lapsing into an almost "Doom"-like stlyle of some deranged, esoteric videogame, the camera explores the "green hell" that is Malick's vision of war. The incredible tension generated by this assault soon dies down, and never quite regains itself, leaving the audience numb for the remaining hour. Any anticipation of a fitting conclusion, a final cathartic battle, remains unfulfilled. But all flaws aside, the director should be given full credit for making a challenging , unconventional film without any commercial aspirations (except, perhaps, the all-star cast). While Spielberg begins his work with a plot device, overblown and predictable; TRL opens with a single symbolic image: stirring and original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Happily an apples-to-oranges comparison with Saving Private Ryan (though Spielberg's film, which is great in different ways, prepares the zeitgeist for Malick's philosophical ruminations), Thin Red Line sees war in existential/phenomenological/spiritual light, pictures soldiers contemplating death, facing the horizon, experiencing dread--not usually young men's experience. Malick's extraordinary presentation intermixes recognizable motifs (God seeming to observe man through nature, voice-over technique) but with less intended irony than in Badlands and Days of Heaven. It will seem to some viewers curiously detached, reminiscent of Kubrick; they have simply to realize that both Spielberg and Malick are artists with distinct and brilliantly realized visions in which there is truth and beauty for those with eyes to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than "Saving Private Ryan"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With these two movies coming out so close to each other, it's impossible not to compare them. "The Thin Red Line" succeeds where "Saving Private Ryan" failed. How, you ask? Here are the whys:1) Realism. Although heralded as a fictionalistic account, "The Thin Red Line" is based on truths. This is one of the most realistic war films of the last thirty years, in that what happened in this movie actually happened. Yes, there is dramatization, but that is because people in this generation do not understand war because we have not experienced it. "Saving Private Ryan", which Spielberg claims is true, is only true in some pseudo-illusionist world. There is virtually no truth in SPR, except for the realism seen in the war scenes of the first twenty minutes. The other two hours never happened, but because Hollywood says it is so, for years people who have never taken a WWII history class or spoken to a WWII veteran will believe that SPR is the definitive war movie.2) Schmaltziness. Although TTRL falls into the same trap that SPR did in hiring big name actors to play their roles, they kept it more realistic. SPR's cast was full of forty-something actors playing roles that should be played by young men in their late teens and early twenties. TTRL did have their older cast of famous actors, but for the most part, they were either late twenties or looked it. While no one could ever buy Travolta, Clooney, Nolte, or Penn as 25, Cusack, Brody, Mihok, and Haas not only look like they're in their 20's, they ARE. TTRL also has actors that were born after the VietNam War, which is a generation that SPR completely ignores, except for Leonardo DiCaprio look-alike Matt Damon.3) Historical Value. Not only is "The Thin Red Line" completely more realistic than "Saving Private Ryan", it isn't something that took fifty years after the war ended to make. This is a very successful remake of a very hard-hitting war film that was made in 1962, from one man's memoirs about WWII. Malick has succeeded excellently in integrating the novel, the previous movie, and the glamourization needed to create a success with TTRL.4) Characterization. This movie pulls you right into the war and makes you a participant. The characterization is excellent for its brief looks and sketchiness. Life isn't like a Hollywood movie. You don't learn everything from someone's rising sign to the color of their jockey shorts in a few short glimpses. In war, you don't want to get to know your comrades, because you know that there's a good chance that not all of you will make it, and it will hurt a lot more.I don't watch war films as a rule because I hate the way Hollywood butchers and glamorizes the war. "The Thin Red Line" not only portrays an incredibly realistic scene of war, but it also shows why war isn't always the answer. Sure, there are some minor mistakes, but they enhance rather than detract from the movie. This movie is easily an 11, and a must-see for anyone who wants to see a REALISTIC portrayal of war. If you like "Saving Private Ryan", avoid this movie. SPR is a fanciful tale of lie and fallacy. "The Thin Red Line" will knock your socks off by the sheer realism and feeling to be found in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new "Apocalypse Now" it ain't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great, great disappointment! There is no way, that "The Thin Red Line" is deeper and sharper than "Saving Private Ryan", as many people expected. The film itself is very pretentious, wanting to be the "Apocalypse Now" of the 90's. Well, it is not. The movie is very "over-produced", in terms of its extra-aesthetism, if it's possible to say so. I mean, parrots are beautiful birds, but do you really have to show close-ups of them four or five times? And shooting the sunlight, slowly coming through the trees is like reinventing a bicycle.In spite of the interesting characters and well-conducted narration, many of them, including the ones, played by famous actors are not developed enough for the audience to remember them. Pretty important characters, like Nick Nolte's and John Cusack's are lost in the 3rd hour. And if there was a nomination for the most senseless cameo ever - George Clooney could get one.In my opinion the film suffers from the poor editing. Watching the movie, I got an impression, that the production team was under the pressure to put the film in the regular movie-theater time frame (&lt;= 3hours), so a lot of important things got lost. I would be really looking forward to the director's cut of "The Thin Red Line". Otherwise, the film is simply weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosophical look into the psyche of the soldier's thoughts and feelings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line, starring Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte and John C. Reilly is as far away from Saving Private Ryan as any movie could be. Although they both deal with World War II, any critic who pens this movie as a copy-cat of Saving Private Ryan is sadly mistaken. The differences between these two movies are plain as day. Both contain fighting scenes, but The Thin Red Line is so much more philosophical and introspective, I can see no way to compare the two.The Thin Red Line, weighing in at 2 hours 45 minutes is well worth every one. This movie is much better than Saving Private Ryan because this movie is able to express a man's emotions and feelings and conscience. The Thin Red Line deals with the invasion of Guadal Canal, a turning point in World War II. This movie does contain a few war scenes with men being shot and blown up, but it goes beyond that into the psyche of the soldier, the personal misgivings and diffidence included in war. It follows the lives of many men, not just a select few, and delves into the inner thoughts of each and the reflections as they look back on what they have done. The message in this movie is portrayed in a strong way, through the use of voice-overs, and is actually very cogitative as the audience can only remember or imagine as having happened during this awful period in the history of mankind.I just don't know how to put it, but The Thin Red Line leaves you with something to think about and talk about after exiting the theater. It gives you a new outlook on life and death, and, similarly to Saving Private Ryan, portrays war as it was in all of its shame. The Thin Red Line is a spectacular movie with a beautiful backdrop and scenery and is a must see this new year to remind us of the atrocities of war and the pain and suffering these soldiers endured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film far above the vast majority of its viewers (myself included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly exceptional film that is, at times, difficult to watch, and really is not for everyone. I would recommend that viewers think twice about why they want to see it and what they want to see before going.This film differs from Private Ryan in that SPR focused, as Spielberg always does, on the personal stories of a few individuals, whereas this film visits its set of characters here and there, leaving the film about all of them, and war itself. I found this method more effective, as the Speilbergian method leaves me feeling "Well as long as Tom Hanks is okay, I don't care who gets killed." This film also does not glorify war the way SPR did.This film gets very intense at times, and for long periods I had to look away. While SPR's message about war was "wasn't it terrible, there were bullets everywhere! You could get killed!" This film shows large numbers of people made psychotic by what they experience, and if you're following the film, it really is harrowing.The film doesn't focus on many individual characters, but the most finely drawn here is Nick Nolte's, and Nick does a truly incredible job with his part here. The introduction to his character features Travolta is a tiny but necessary cameo, and this scene is played against Nolte's bluster for the rest of the film. Wow, Nick. I would hand him best supporting actor right now, if I thought the academy were that savvy. I hear he's even better in "Affliction." Elias (hot) Koteas is also great, as is Sean Penn and Ben Chaplan. George Clooney shows up for literally 30 seconds, but he's always nice to look at, at least.This is a very complicated film, full of ambiguities and, I would suspect, far above most of the people who will watch it (including myself-- I don't pretend to understand the half of it). So, if you find yourself wanting to say derisive things about its tone, metaphors, symbology, or seeming lack of focus, just remember that it's often better to keep quiet and let people think you're ignorant, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something so significantly different about Spielberg and Malick's takes on the war. And it is in that very distinction that one begins to realize how truly minuscule "Ryan" is in comparison to the far superior "Line."Firstly, it should be noted that what Spielberg achieved in the first and final battle scenes of "Ryan" were nothing less than miraculous. The bravura juggling act of dramatic irony and bloodshed was mesmerizing to behold. There is no battle sequence in "Line" that is as remotely grotesque or technically challenging as those in "Line." But of course, this is not a contest--and "Line's" concern for the war and it's significance is a little bit more profound than that of "Ryan.""Ryan," with it's battle scenes goes for the jugular, where "Line" completely goes for the heart and the mind of the audience, in a nearly three hour meditation on war, violence, love, nature and something "Ryan" could never do--humanity.In Spielberg's fantasy world--or maybe it was his screenwriter's--people exist as mere archetypes. To him, a war can not exist without every main character fitting into a cliched mold. You got to have the religious guy, the idiot, the coward, the ultra-brave guy, the ethnic guy, and so on. This type of character placement is so ridiculously obvious and is the main flaw of "Ryan"--which is further weekend by its trite monologues and awkward moments of humor. The scene where Hank's character tells the wrong Ryan that his brother's were killed was ludicrous--apparently inspired by any of the worst "mistaken identity" episodes of such shows as "Three's Company." (Hey, the audience I saw it with was roaring with laughter.) In Spielberg's world, cemetery scenes merely exist as places for old men to crumble to the ground and scream at graves while family members stand 5 to 6 feet behind them."A Thin Red Line" is about the connection that we have with nature. When the first death's occur in this movie, we get a cut-away to a field of grass, the wind gently caressing it, and the sun shining above it. A man later says that "we are nothing but earth."And that is where the meaning of the film begins to emerge. This is a film that will confuse many, but like some of the greatest poems ever written, this will surely be a film that will need to be seen again and again-interpreted differently by all who "read" it.In "Line" you will see a bird dying next to a human being and the audience realizes that all life is fleeting and we all go back to the same place--the earth.It is a film that cherishes the meaning and unity of life. The relationship that Ben Chaplin has with his wife is of integral importance because it shows the love that two people have for each other is a unifying force, "like water flowing through a stream." It is a unifying force similar to the one that these men have as they lay against grass and observe the snakes and the birds that are around them. (A later twist between Chaplin and his wife is revealed--adding an interesting take on this philosophy).Before these men die we get cut-aways to light seeping through the leaves and we see that these men are looking at that light, cherishing the beauty of nature--the last sight before they go out of this world and into the next.Spielberg's excessive flag waving and ulta-patriotic messages have nothing on Malick's brilliant metaphysical vision.When the American soldier's attack a Japanese camp, you will witness one of the great scenes in movie history. The tears that the Japanese cry, the way they hold their dying friends, and the way that they pray towards the heaven, looking at the vultures that will eventually eat their carcasses is deeply symbolic.Malick is telling us that no matter who the enemy is, we are all part of the same scheme--we are all going to the same place. It is a beautiful Emersonian philosophy--far more sophisticated, complex and relevant than anything Spielberg did in Ryan's technical shadow. In "Ryan" you cheered when the German was killed by the soldiers--in "Line", you sympathize when everyone is killed, for you relate to everyone. And that is a far more interesting and complex achievement.Despite the gawky cameos of Travolta and Clooney (surely due to cutting-floor blues) the refreshing thing about this movie is that the big stars in the movie never upstage the smaller stars. Characters are not introduced in this film the way they are in "Ryan." Here, we see Woody Harrelson in a quick pan--as opposed to Hank's head-on, tilt-up, look-at-camera introduction. Malick knows how to control his big name stars and makes this film a full-fledged ensemble piece--almost as if this were a war film directed by Altman. All the performances are perfectly restrained and nowhere near as dramatic as Tom Hanks' excessive hand-shaking in "Ryan.""Line" has no concrete narrative. It's a meditation on humanity as much as "2001" was a meditation on existence and evolution. The shot compositions, the cinematography, and the score were phenomenal. Where the once great John Williams was more concerned with milking the patriotic cow with his over-the-top score for "Ryan"--Hans Zimmer, in "Line," creates a score that is alternately inspirational and frightening. Drum beats and aural, jungle sounds captivate you in every frame--from the slow crawl of ships to islands, to the endless climbs up the mountains.The first hour of the film is like a horror film as you await for the faceless enemies to appear--enemies whose faces are very much like those of the "heroes." The ships of fearful men all going to the same place, all wondering if they will come out. By the end, they have learned more about life than they care to ever experience again. Some will come back while others will return to the earth a little sooner than the rest. The last 10 minutes are a grim reminder of how all of us, one day, will stare death in the face, and we will realize that we are all islands. John Dunne would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Spiritual for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Got to see THIN RED LINE in one of the best theaters in the country this week (MANN VILLAGE in WESTWOOD, CA). I was disappointed beyond belief. I am a war film fanatic, and the lack of closure and means to an end bothered me. Even the often `too spiritual' Apocalypse Now had closure.Malick's Thin Red line is a spiritual journey. Seen though the eyes of more protagonists than water drops in a lawn sprinkler. More symbolism that Pleasantville and more animal shots than the Discovery Channel. The StediCAM war scenes were interesting but lack of establishing shots made it difficult to figure out what was going on...if that was Malick's plan ,he succeeded. Some spiritual tales work , most recently In Gods Hands, but that was only because it had a beginning a middle and an end. And one protagonist that the viewer could hang on to for guidance. Malick's long emotionless stares that allow the audience to insert his or her own emotions. Half the audience says HUH? while the other half says AH! But it doesn't allow the story to move on. The spiritual journeys need to be left to the Independent film arena. That Arena allows for the cream to rise to the top?and receive recognition and wide release at a later date. So was there any good in the film?...yes....acting and cinematography. But who were the primary and who were the supporting actors?only the screenwriter could tell you. As one of my friends put it `this probably would have been good if we were high.' While Saving Private Ryan gets to join the list of the greatest War films of all time including PATTON,THE LONGEST DAY, and Platoon?..The 1998 version of The Thin Red Line falls near the bottom. Suggestion: See the Keir Dullea/Jack Warden version of the film?you will feel better. And not cheated. And for you IMDB freaks?find the link between `The Longest Day' and Malick. And somebody tell Steven to release SPR on DVD and Laser?it deserves it. Bye for now</fullReview>

The narrative of the battle between American and Japanese troops in 1942 at Guadalcanal is riveting, and even more engrossing than the Normandy Beach invasion of "Saving Private Ryan." Moreover, the camera frequently diverges from the military activities to meditate on the naturalistic phenomena, including crocodiles, monkies, birds, the forest canopy, the jungle landscape, and ocean views. A solid 3-star effort, and definitely worth a big screen visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading Janet Maslin's and Mr. Showbiz's reviews of Terrence Malick's brilliant, haunting new film "The Thin Red Line", it would seem that the point is missed. Where Malick shows us the horror of war, the conflict that seems inevitable in human culture, and the wondrous beauty of our world which we so recklessly, violently destroy, the reviewers are already spinning it as a confusing bit of idiosyncratic work from a reclusive director. At the same time, the Hollywood studio marketing machines are hawking it as a charged-up gore-fest, akin to a dehumanized "Saving Private Ryan." I fear that this may overshadow what Malick has accomplished with his film.Malick, to his credit, denies the public the adreneline shot they usually get from war films. In most films' battle scenes, even the sickeningly powerful "Private Ryan", we are exhilarated by the shooting and explosions -- the electric charge is an expected part of the "entertainment" experience offered by the movies. Not so in "The Thin Red Line," where the sense in battle is of sheer horror at the moment, and, on reflection, a profound pity at our inability to live peacefully. Malick achieves a chilling effect at times by muting the cacophony of battle and instead emphasizing the musical score, itself hauntingly beautiful.What Malick has accomplished is the creation of a deeply troubling anti-war film, one which uses the excuse of the Guadalcanal invasion to meditate on humanity's propensity for conflict and its destruction of the paradise we were born into. This is not about glorious battles, important military objectives, soldiers bonding, or yet another voice saying "War is hell." Malick goes much further than that, questioning, in the poetic narratives of the film's characters, the condition of humans that drives them toward violent conflict.A central scene of the film is Private Witt's experience as an AWOL soldier living with the Melanesian natives. At the beginning of the film we see Witt living with the natives in peace, sharing in the communal responsibilities of the near-primitive Melanesians, accepted by them, loved and loving. Soon, he is arrested for going AWOL and quickly becomes part of the landing group on Guadalcanal -- surely a journey from Heaven to Hell.The bulk of the film is then given over to the battles fought on the island but, more importantly, on the contemplations of how war has turned men into savage beasts. Malick shows how the viciousness of battle forced men into a spiritual destruction of their relationships with other men and with Nature. At once a character in the film, Edenic Nature is reduced at times to scorched earth. As one shell-shocked character observes, "It's all about property," letting the island dirt spill from his hand -- highlighting our lost relationship with the Earth.Later in the film, Private Witt returns to the village where he had been living. The small population is decimated, the children malnourished, and the adult men are engaged in growingly violent argument. What has happened? How did this almost utopian community of Melanesian natives, living in perfect harmony with themselves and their environment on a beautiful Pacific island, fall from grace? I believe Malick is suggesting that humans are perhaps inherently maleficent -- that war is only a short hop from peace. Indeed, it is separated only by a thin red line. Throughout the film, we hear the narratives of the soldiers questioning the insanity of the war and of their condition, but until the end, we are sustained by the belief that someone, somewhere -- in this case, the natives of the Pacific islands -- can live peacefully. When Private Witt returns to the village as it suffers the nascent violent fits that his industrialized society has shown in their full glory, it is as if any hope of redemption is lost.Malick's film is far too important to be interpreted as mere "World War II nostalgia," and far too beautifully made to be debased by chattering over its film technique or its starry cast. Malick confronts some painfully difficult questions about our society: its imbalance with Nature, its penchant for conflict, and the unshakable evil that lurks within us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of my movie-going experience is witnessing greatness I'm not fully able to appreciate. This is the case with "A Thin Red Line." It's a dense, ponderous, other-worldly film that refuses to eschew its fractured narrative in favor of easy interpretation. The heaven/hell theme did hit home, yet Malick didn't make a 170 minute film only to express the overplayed "war is hell" argument Spielberg assiduously made clear in SPR. The voice-over didn't involve me much, and I think therein lies the reason why I wasn't mesmerized. This could have conceivably worked better as a novel, but it's not a failure as cinema either (though I don't think it's art either).It's gorgeously shot, remarkably directed and marvelously cast but somehow I felt uncomfortable with it. Hard to rationalize. I know I will see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If as Alex Iosjpe says "Saving Private Ryan" pre-empts the justification for anyone ever again making a war film (and with specific reference here to the imminent arrival of "The Thin Red Line") because "Saving P.R." tells it all, then "Saving P.R." should never have been made. Because 68 years ago in "All Quiet on the Western Front" (based on the Erich Marie Remarque novel) we had an even more deeply penetrating telling about war; and with not the sentimental patriotism laced into it that with his eye ever more strongly focused on box office receipts than on telling the truth Spielberg could not resist as a hedge on what otherwise could have been his more honest anti-war pitch. So hurrah for Terrence Mallick's having a go at it again, the telling of what can never be told well enough or truly enough for it to ever be fully understood! And if it's a truer go-at-it than Spelberg's then a double hurrah for Mallick!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very flawed and very brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes it's long, bewildering, and often pretentious, but it's also one of the most original and powerful American movies that I've seen in quite some time. Comparisons with "Saving Private Ryan" are pointless since the two movies spring from completely different artistic sensibilities, although I will say that I vastly preferred "The Thin Red Line", flaws and all, to Spielberg's movie. I also suspect that fifty years from now, long after the "Private Ryan" hype-machine has died away, Malick's movie will be seen as the better work. The movie sometimes resembled a strange mix of Sam Fuller and Andrei Tarkovsky (The opening shot is nothing short of brilliant). The spiritual and philosophical underpinnings of the film, and the way they are presented, alternate between the profound and the maddeningly pretentious. Malick seems to have bitten off more than he could chew here, and one can feel him struggling at the end to bring all of his philosophical threads together into some sort of resolution, but he just can't seem to pull it off. Still, the overall effect is both haunting and beautiful. Anthony Lane, writing in The New Yorker, put it nicely when he rattled off all the problems he had with it and then concluded, "But, a week after seeing 'The Thin Red Line,' I am starting to be spooked by it, and already I need to see it again." Same here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see it as an impossibility for "The Thin Red Line" to become better than "Saving Private Ryan". I will explain why.In "Saving Private Ryan", Steven Spielberg has shown us all the aspects of war: how war affects people, what they really had to go through, what happened at home, who fought the war and how they did it.All this is presented to us in blood and horror.All this makes "Saving Private Ryan" not only the best and the most realistic war-films ever made, but simply one of the best films ever made by anyone.Because "Saving Private Ryan" tells everything there is to know about war, the other upcoming war-films are no longer necessary.Of course you can make a very good war-movie, it's not that. It's simply that it's nothing more to say, it's nothing more to learn, there is nothing more to see.And I'm sure that many great war-films will be made in the future, and "The Thin Red Line" is one of them, but it will not serve its original purpose, because we already know what war is like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What might have been an epic film was cut until it lacks cohesion, and the hammy ensemble cast doesn't help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The circumstances around Terence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE are sometimes more talked about than the film itself. The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.THE THIN RED LINE tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sergeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who sees the infantry as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese.For most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.While the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and it's hard to knock any World War II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very "Hollywood" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Brilliance. Better Than Saving Private Ryan In Some Light. But Not For Everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of movies that are not for everyone. There's movies with disturbing content and brutality that will make the viewer uneasy. Saving Private Ryan is a good example of that. Then there's extremely complex movies that require full attention and lots of analyzing in order to comprehend. The Thin Red Line is an excellent example of that. Overly complex movies are often well liked, but Red Line caught a bad rap since it came out at the wrong time.The Thin Red Line is overshadowed by Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan. Both Private Ryan and Red Line are phenomenal works, but in different perspectives. I actually prefer this to Private Ryan, (ever so slightly more) as it is a thinking man's movie. But my opinion may change. I would actually call this my second favourite war movie ever (behind Apocalypse Now). Spielberg's directing of Saving Private Ryan is nothing short of majestic. He makes the battles look like first person points of view and makes the viewer feel like they are in it themselves. The horrors of war are shown very well, but the general story is absurd and the emotional factor is clichd. Red Line's battles are inferior to Private Ryan's, but the emotional factor and many other plot and filming devices surpass Private Ryan's.The Thin Red Line provides different narrations to gives an inside look at these soldiers. That is a brilliant move. They are forced to go to war and must face the horrors. Private Ryan is by far the scariest war film ever, but it is patriotic. Red Line goes back to basics and uses the same formula as Apocalypse Now and Platoon do: how war can change people. But Red Line distinguishes itself from those by using more symbolism and philosophy. Jim Caviezel is our main character who is AWOL living in a peaceful Indian village who is taken by Sean Penn to partake in the Battle of Guadalcanal. There is a scene later on in the film where he is back with the tribe and there is tension among everyone. I never understood if the whole experience with the tribe was a hallucination or not, but they do symbolize the negativity that the world has. The battle starts with them getting up a hill battling the Japanese. The higher they get on the hill, the worse everything gets for them. While this movie is going on, there's lots of lovely shots of nature. Nature provides a relationship to the soldiers, both comparing and contrasting. There's nice imaging of the nature-filled areas and the nice sunlight, and there's a crocodile that enters a pond (pretty much a threshold) then we see just its head later on. This is one of the most philosophical movies ever that can easily be misunderstood. if you get it, you will love it. It not, you will be bored to death.</fullReview>

The Thin Red Line is a beautiful looking movie that is so muddled in the artsy whims of Terrence Malick that it seems to have no real narrative or much semblance of a plot. The cast is huge and talented, but no amount of talent can fix a broken narrative. In fact the original script centered the movie around Jim Caviezel's character, only to have Malick decide to change the main character to Adrien Brody's character instead during editing, and then he didn't tell anyone, including Caviezel, who showed up to the premier to find he was hardly in the film. I really wish Terrence Malick would either allow a real writer to shape the narrative or just become a cinematographer, because he is very talented at putting stunning images on the screen, but can not tell a good story to save his life.3.5 Beards Out Of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Man Fights His Own War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released at about the same time of the patriotic flag-waving "Saving Private Ryan" Terence Mallick delivers a perfect opposite - the ultimate anti-war movie. Set in the II World War during the Pacific Campaign, particularly the Guadalcanal battles, "The Thin Red Line" (of Heroes) tells a story of courage and bravery of single people, soldiers, but still manages to deliver a poignant message on the pointless savagery of war.The battles themselves, blood and death, is juxtaposed to the beauty of nature, its godly emanation. Nature's tranquillity is all-engulfing peace saturating the senses - dominant over the trivial faults of human kind and their pointless wars. The soldiers are invariably overpowered by its force, its dreamy tranquillity, speechless towards the captivating power, as if imbued by the touch of God. Conversely the bloody carnage seems trivial, detrimental and almost like a rot on the earth, which destroys the harmony, introduced a scourge. When the gunfire and blasts blast through the area god's creation is not left untouched and you can almost feel the jungle and wildlife bleeding due to the ongoing war, watching on as the devastation occurs leaving the surrounding innocence tainted.This does not mean that heroism and valour is non-existent, but each man fights and wins by his own strengths. Honour is not found in victory - highlighted brilliantly when the American forces capture Japanese fortifications only to come across an undernourished and sickly opposing army, which surrenders without much quarrel. The enormous strategic victory rings hollow to the individual as Americans observe the protruding bones of captured enemy soldiers, finding little glory or honour in conquer. The decedents themselves - generals, politicians - come about in the form of Lt. Col. Gordon Tall (Nick Nolte), who is ruthless and goal-oriented, with little interest in the well-being of his pawns (American soldiers), instead focused on tactical and strategic aims. This is a brutal campaign, where both sides of the divide were lacking in supplies, thus giving way to dehumanisation.War is exposed here as something truly banal. Heroism is present, irregardless of whether it is misconceived or pointless, glory is only found in actions of single men, when they conquer there own frailties and are capable to sacrifice their lives for fellow soldiers. Naturally the big picture of the II World War is that American were fighting for a just cause. But that still does not change the matter-of-fact reality for simple soldiers. Hence Terence Mallick walks away from exposition of the battle of Guadalcanal, instead introvertly pointing his camera towards the thin red line of heroes (the soldiers). Amongst the blood-shed we hear them speak of their fear, longings, doubts and perceptions. Thankfully avoiding over-narrating as in the abysmally prolonged "The New World", typical Terence Mallick touches are easily distinguished, such as spacious encapsulating shots by John Toll and whispered voice-overs. His typical whispering narrative is also present, but during fights a more sombre brutal reality overpowers the dreamy focus. The voice-over is aptly more suitable and thus more purposeful than in most Malick movies, functioning as something of a diary for soldiers who spill their emotions through the camera lens. This leads to diverting attention from the battle itself and focusing on the war which occurs within each human being, when they try to make sense of it all, combat the encapsulating insanity, fight their own fears and ultimately decide their fate.Featuring a star-studded cast of James Cavaziel, Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, John Travolta, George Clooney, Nick Stahl, Thomas Jane... and a host of other big name actors, which role in the movie was cut during editing. Despite the latter the movie still clocks in at over three hours. With almost every minute of the experience worth the time and effort.A brilliant movie by the beloved American director, which is in no way trivialised by the pretentious and oblivious ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are moments when greatness is immediately apparent. When I first watched Terrence Malick's 1998 film, The Thin Red Line, over a decade ago, it was clear that the film was great, and so was its director. Perhaps it was the opening shot of the film, wherein a crocodile slithers into muck as a rising fugue intones, that invoked a poetic realism that the rest of the nearly three hour film sustains. Or, perhaps, it was within the first 5 or 10 minutes, when the voice-over narration and watery images mixed into something rarely seen on screen. Nonetheless, I immediately felt that sort of pleasure seep into one, knowing that this artist knows exactly what he is doing, and it will be something very good, or even better. And every time I've watched it since it reveals nuances not noticed before. That's a surefire marker of greatness. Oddly, the people I saw the film with disagreed, yet they had no real definitive reasons save the usual emotional response, or its lack. Upon rewatching the film, nothing has changed from my initial opinion. And given that this film was often spoken of in the same breath as Steven Spielberg's schlocksterpiece, Saving Private Ryan, shows how utterly clueless most critics, much less layfolk, are, for while both films were released in the same year, and cover the same war, the qualitative difference is immense.The Thin Red Line ranks with Paths Of Glory and Apocalypse Now as amongst the greatest American war films ever made. It is a masterpiece that really has no flaws. And like Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, released a year after this film, I was amongst the very few critics to immediately recognize its greatness, despite massive critical scorn (although the critical tide has belatedly turned in the correct favor). Sometimes prescience has its benefits. After all, as the film recognizes, sometimes it's all about the little moments, or just the little thoughts of bigger ones, that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet sensual pleasure without strong thematic backbone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were some comments that the movie tries a new form of storytelling. I mapped the scenes along the common 3 act structure, based on the character development steps by Truby, Hauge, McKee, Campbell.I couldn't find a new style of storytelling up until 40 minutes before end. Up to that point the scenes can be dropped into a typical structure with a normal characters set up, inciting incident as the boats hit the sand, into the storming-the-hill act 2, then act 3 battle, theme revelation at the "water discussion" and moral conclusion as the enemy is finally shown as hurting, scared, naked individuals. The inhumanity has come full circle. The soldier's celebration marks a new equilibrium in which nobody is a winner because "this turns a man into a dog, poisons the soul"And then, as the story is told, the booze is drunk and the film makers, ?.ah, soldiers get a week off, sober up and sit around, ideas creep up, like, what about all those beautiful leftover scenes. There's enough material for the film to grow a whole new 40 minute story limb. In it, we see what the character do after the actual movie is over. It artificially extends a story that was basically told at the false victory point. But I'm glad they picked those scenes off the editing floor room. It's like getting that second pot of ice cream from the fridge at 11 at night. The feast for the senses continues, that painful and beautiful lingering in the story moment, that not wanting to let go of the characters after the curtain has already fallen. It's a movie with it's own mini sequel attached, going nowhere but loving every second of the aimless wandering. Like ice cream, this film is delicious, but the intellectual and artistic messages are a sugar rush, not a substantial nutrition, because structure, story and character development are not as equally sensually pleasing. Lost potential but still an enjoyable viewing sensation with a beautiful, multicolored explosion of symbols and ideas on what it means to be human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did We Lose The Good That Was Given To Us?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"So you shall come to look at the world with new eyes" Ralph Waldo EmersonThe above quote pretty much sums up my reaction to Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line. Is this a war movie from the perspective of an Emersonian philosopher or a film exploring the duality of man in a war setting? Let's just say it's a thinking man's war film that also has some of the most barbaric scenes of battle I have seen in a film. The film opens with Pvt. Witt (Caviezel) AWOL on a tropical Eden. He is among the native peoples, unconcerned about war while they frolic in the ocean and catch fish or sing songs as they pick up fallen fruit to eat. More philosopher than warrior Witt longs to escape from the madness of war and become one with his idyllic paradise. That is not to be as he is soon found out and returned to his ship for the assault on Guadalcanal.The assault on Guadalcanal is going to be led by bombastic Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte). As we hear inside Talls stream of consciousness we learn he is a career soldier passed over for promotion and itching to prove himself in battle. Nolte is stellar in this role his, manic blood lusting turn as Lt. Col. Tall is amazing in its earnestness.The storming of the beach is anti-climactic. It has the same run up and tension to the landing and assault as another great war film released that year Saving Private Ryan. However, where the pitched battle in Spielberg's film sets the table for the rest of the film, Malick's assault gives us little clue about the horror that is about to unfold. As the troops move inland they come under machine gun fire from entrenched Japanese positions on the hills above. Capt. Staros (Koteas) is reluctant to lead his men in a frontal assault of the defended position after his troops suffer tremendous losses. His superior officer Lt. Col. Tall explodes in glorious fury as he orders a direct assault. How this all plays out I will leave for you to find out for yourself. I will say that the footage of combat is amazing. The craziness of the combat, the heroism, banality and horror is laid out before the watcher in stunning fashion. At the same time Malick interjects stream of conciseness thoughts of a few of the men most notably Witt and Tall. Some may find these thoughts out of place in the picture. I found that they only enhanced the film in that we get to see the motivations and thoughts behind the actions.The Thin Red Line is also a beautiful picture. The lush tropical jungle with its blades of grass gently blowing in the wind and drops of dew glittering on the leaves is juxtaposed with shots of Woody Harrelson jumping on a live grenade and a man screaming for mercy with his entrails hanging out. "How did we lose the good that was given to us, let it slip away scattered and careless?" Pvt WittI can see why some war movie traditionalists might not care for this picture. We are all used to seeing the war is hell and we had to do our duty type of film that is a Hollywood standard. Malick does not take that approach with this film. Instead he presents us with a complex canvas where war is indeed hell, but we are left to confront our motivations for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is one of the best war movies to be released by Hollywood, along with Saving Private Ryan. This is a very underrated movie and is not easy to understand at times. Most people dismissed this movie as just the other WWII movie of 1998. But this is actually different kind of film. Saving Private Ryan portrayed the Second World War in a very realistic, very gritty way. But this movie is more philosophical. It the destructive side of human nature and the contradiction between nature and beauty. And unlike Saving Private Ryan, their is no sign of patriotism. The soldiers do not fight for freedom or democracy. They fight because they have to. And the soldiers are frightened, lost and scared. This movie also shows the affects it can leave on the people who survive. The Thin Red Line is a very gripping film that sends a very powerful message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid, Thought Provoking Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a powerful war drama that features stars such as Sean Penn, and can only be bolstered by the all around experience of theaters like that of Garden Cinemas in Norwalk, Connecticut. Upon entering the smaller theater of Garden Cinemas, it is easy to get a sense that you are about to view an art film rather than a Hollywood motion picture. On this night specifically, the audience was a bit older, most over the age of 50. Garden Cinemas features two big screen theaters, but also offers a caf viewing room with old chairs and tables that present a totally different atmosphere for whomever desires. The seating in the theater is comfortable, visually appealing, and has a certain sense of authenticity.I watched this film with my mother and brother and we found virtually no line for tickets that night. The movie was preceded with trailers that were geared toward independent films. At the time, I was most likely the youngest audience member and I felt the eyes of judgment as I walked to my seat. When the film began, the audience was consumed and all noise and the sense of judgment I had felt were diminished. Terrence Malick, the director, is known for his supreme cinematography. The images alone were enough to stir emotion inside any human being. Terror, sadness, happiness, and despair all vibrated in my brain at various points. The overarching theme is presented visually before you are even able to pick up on it through the words and actions of the characters. Malick questions why the beauty of everyday life must be stomped out by the atrocities of war. In this sense, I believe this is the best anti-war film I have seen. There are many characters that each, in their own personality, touch upon the cruelty and futility of war. If there is a protagonist, it is played by James Caviezel. We first find him living with the Melanesian natives of the South Pacific island that they are fighting on. He later recalls this experience as a different world than anyone in the army has ever known. There is something comforting in this spiritual man, and although he does not agree with battle, he fights side by side his comrades upon his return. You get to know the men of Charlie Company as individuals and as one unit; a family. In between images of exotic birds and the crystal clear ocean, are scenes of young men being torn apart and fields being reduced to ash. As a World War II film you may find yourself comparing it to Saving Private Ryan. However, there is something deeply spiritual about this film that is not touched on in Saving Private Ryan. Yes, the coming together of men amongst the horrors they are experiencing and causing is seen in both films. The difference, is Terrence Malick's unique ability to blend thought provoking narratives and spectacularly vivid images to bring about emotions that only each individual viewer can truly understand for themselves. Thus, making it an almost purely individualistic experience that cannot be deciphered by others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd combination of war, philosophy, poetry, and mysticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, ostensibly about the battle for Guadalcanal in WWII, changed gears so often that it often left me baffled. There is the "war is hell" aspect, and that was well done. I don't think I have ever seen a better presentation of the absolute fear that combat troops can experience; the scenes that had the soldiers packed into landing craft heading for the beach were terrifying. Everyone involved deserves praise for their work on the war part of the movie.Some opening scenes have a couple of AWOL soldiers living a blissful existence on a Pacific island. The native islanders are in tune with nature and each other. It's a real Garden of Eden they have got going there. Malick appears to have some fascination with the idea that such a paradise is possible, or he would like to think so. There is a similar scene in the Indian camps in his "The New World." There he explicitly remarks on the perfection of the Indians and their culture. Here the peaceable initial scenes set up a contrast with what the two soldiers are to experience after they are discovered and forced to participate in the battles to come. Concluding scenes that show that the earlier paradise has been shattered are summarized with the voice-over, "How did we lose the good that was given to us?" If you find such commentary penetrating, then you may like this movie better than I.As is true in four other Malick films I have seen, this one is beautifully filmed. Malick has the eye of an artist. I had some difficulty with the mixing of visual poetry with the horror of war. The beauty of nature is on display and, again, I assume the idea is to contrast that with the ugly battle scenes. This mixing of the sacred and profane does lend power to the comment, "What's keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory."For every bit of philosophizing that resonated with me there were many others that seemed rather trivial, such as: "This great evil, where does it come from?"; "Nature's cruel"; "War doesn't ennoble men, it turns them into dogs"; "Love, where does it come from?" While I realize it is the intent of the movie to bring up such questions, in the context of the immediate existential threats I doubt if any of the soldiers had any more philosophical thoughts than, "I want out of here," or "What am I doing here?"Then there are the mystical elements like the concept that maybe humans are temporary incarnations of some universal soul.Soft classical music being played over grim happenings on screen again sets up a contrast, one that some may find more potent than I did. In any case, I think this effect has run its course, having been used in previous films such as "The Deer Hunter," and "Gallipoli." The use of such music as Arvo Prt's "Annum per Annum," and Faur's "Requiem" can be seen either as pretentious or as adding appropriate gravitas.This is an interesting movie and is certainly not your typical war movie. It was well worth watching but a bit of a mixed bag for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly ambitious, but difficult...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thin Red line is the 2nd Malick film I have watched, and I am already getting familiar with his film style.The Thin Red Line is probably the most difficult war film to really grasp. I don't want to make it sound as if it's one of those films that is hard to get, because that sounds pretentious, but in all honesty, it was for me. The action scenes are easy to admire, and they are full of tension and are directed with great force. There are moments of real transcendence in the story that give the film real texture and beauty. This is one of those films hat one has to concentrate on and give their full attention to. I feel like I did, or tried to, for the most part. This is how I see it. I know that a film like this deserves my 100% attention, but when I don't, then when I end up admiring it a lot but not really enjoying it, I feel like then it's my fault and so a rewatch is in store. But why should I? If the film didn't grab me enough for me to be invested in it's storyline (unlike Badlands) then why should I say that this criticism in part is because of me? It sounds like I didn't like the film, but I did. I do recommend it, but I will say that what is probably it's biggest problem is the running time. Maybe in the future I can rewatch it, but not to try and like it more, just to see how it fares. However, just driven by it's ambition and for some really great moments scattered around, I will settle on a final score of 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A supreme meditation on war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a 20 year absence, writer director Terrence Malick makes a triumphant return with a film that is an evolution of the style we saw in his first two films, Badlands and Days of Heaven. Where these two films were specific stories told in a surreal and subjective way, this movie is a much more of a meditation of war, with no real climax, just a series of interconnecting events.The focus of the story shifts across a series of characters, but starts and finishes with Private Witt, played in an understated, subtle and totally captivating way by James Caviezel. There are also good performances from various characters that move in and out of the story, the most notable being yet more impressively understated performances by Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas. Other characters come and go, with a Nick Nolte offering a more visceral, aggressive but still absorbing performance as Major Tall. Other characters have nothing more than extended cameos, coming and going briefly, the most obvious ones being John Cusack, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Adrian Brody(who doesn't utter a word of dialogue in the movie!) and George Clooney. It is impressive to see Malick working with these actors to keep their performances very grounded and subtle, but totally absorbing. This is mainly due to Malick's supreme skills as a visual storyteller, and it is clear that he has lost none of his skill despite this 20 year break. He composes scenes with long duration shots that involve a lot of improvisation, and he requires his actors to tell a lot of the story with expressions, using significant amounts of voice-over that is clearly added later and also improvised. The telling of this very emotionally and psychologically involving story is hugely assisted by some tremendous technical contributions. John Toll's photography, Jack Fisk's production design and Hans Zimmer's score (which seems to have been composed as a series of suites rather that to specific cues in the action) all have huge positive impacts on the film, and take the experience of watching it to another level. While the film deals with war, Malick's approach to the violence is tactful and diplomatic, but still visceral. While the film has long stretches of characters mediating, philosophising and reflecting on their experiences these sequences never drag and the action sequences, when they come, are brilliantly directed, technically amazing, and hugely involving emotionally, making you feel what the characters are going through, rather than a more detached view of 'that was a big explosion!'. There is some tremendous crane and Steadicam work ( the latter by Brad Shield), and it shows that Malick is one of those few directors who understand how to use these camera processes in a way that integrates it into the storytelling, rather than as a problem solving tool to shoot certain sequences, or to show off to the audience. The only other director who uses these approaches this effectively was the late Stanley Kubrick.There are some interesting inferences made in the film. There seems to be this subtext of the spirituality of life, as shown by the capacity of the wonderfully created natural environment to create harmony and peace, the more caring characters' appreciation of the natural environment, and the care of that some of the characters have for each other, including Captain Staros(played by Elias Koteas), and most notably the Private Witt character, who undergoes a transcendental experience through the story - there seems to a spiritual parallel here; and the questioning of the reason for this nonsensical violence by the some of the characters. Fascinatingly this is contrasted with the more brutal aspects of nature such as the fact that humankind is instigating violence on its own species. The selfish, personal motivations of Lt Colonel Tall's determination to achieve (who is driving the instigation of the violence, and points out his prospective brutal interpretation of nature during the film), the selfish barbarism of some of the US soldiers on their Japanese prisoners, and the individualistic motivation of the Mirando Otto's character towards her husband, played by Ben Chaplin, while he is bravely battling at the front. These 'Ying' and 'Yang' elements in the story seem to balance out very well, but even the characters who survive this story, all have scars to bear at the end. The only character who reaches inner peace and enlightenment is Witt, who of course despite his bravery and calm in the face of battle is essentially a compassionate pacifist. These subtexts, as well as the tremendous polished nature of the filmmaking, means that providing you are patient, you will have a terrific experience watching this film. Furthermore you will still be thinking about the themes raised in this film long after you have finished watching it.Overall, a wonderful experience from a genius of a filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, poetic, just lagging a bit sometimes. But thanks God, no Saving Private Witt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb piece of cinematographic art. But a rather complex one, you need to see it at least three times to start getting into it, even if it gets into you at first sight with its gorgeous cinematography, its straight--from--the--heart poetry, its subjective mood. Al what it needs is a little bit of scissor work here and there and better articulated voice overs.Malick's here is an incredibly subjective camera. So much so, sometimes it doesn't simply show you what a particular character sees, but what he PREFERS to see. The best ex. is the native village, as seen by Witt's eyes. At the beginning it looks as an earthly paradise, because he wants to see it that way. But that's unreal and the best proof of it lies in his dialog with the woman, when she corrects him: the children do fight--and the adults, we may add. It is only in this 2nd visit that he sees the real thing. What we see then through his eyes is not dark, only normal (dark, if we compared it to his initial daydreaming.) If you apply this to the whole film you'll understand it better and see how some of its "flaws" are really strokes of genius. Travolta's character, for ex., which is pivotal in the plot. He's perfect in his role: cocky, more of a playboy than a BG, he has no place there, even less wearing that uniform. But that's the point! That's how Tall sees him and that's salt in his wounded pride. And that pushes him to force C Company to launch a suicidal assault on the hill. That scene on the ship deck is crucial to understand what follows, as it gives the needed emotional push for the next hour of non stop, bloody, action.(But the subjectivity of the camera goes even further, to what characters feel; for ex. it shows Bell still feeding his romantic love while his couple has already bitten the dust. And what about Witt's stranded AWOL mate, whom he meets after visiting the village. Is he real, a dream, a ghost, a memory? Who knows). But Toll push for the hill is really more of a sub-plot. The real plot goes far deeper here and it's far more philosophical, encompassing and--as it was the case in AN--it comes synthesized in a simple image at the beginning, that of the submerging croc. Everything is there: the beauty of Nature, but also its deadliness. Life and death. Light and darkness. Movement &amp; stillness. Someone here mentioned Quantum Mechanics and by coincidence the same idea came to me while watching TTRL. Some kind of fluid, amorphous, indefinable emptiness, matter, from which everything originates at a given moment. That's the plot of the film, simply put. Life itself with all what it contains--and on which vast canvas a big painting is being created out of our everyday actions, misfortunes, sorrows; and in which ample wholeness war is only a singularity, as physicists say: a small zone, a spot, on which the things happening all over also occur, but faster, more violently, deadly. (see, given enough time all these guys will be dead, won't they? And some will die as violently as here).When you watch the movie with this in mind, everything starts making sense. Life, Nature, War, are not logical, they rarely follow clear and well defined paths; paths satisfying our rational mind, with meanings, purposes, coherence. Instead they are usually random, nonsensical. One thing that irked James about war films is how their plots gen. unfold as if everything happening in them was logical, well thought--main characters rarely die, for ex.--and it's obvious Malick was listening. In TTRL nobody is untouchable, except Welsh, Witt, Bell, just because they have points to make. Others, privates, captains, colonels, come and go. And the action moves from one place to another with no clear blueprint, no defined outline. And the film itself appears as being conceived on the go, with the war still going, even if we imagine that somewhere a plan must exist. Of course, for this war they called that mysterious place the Pentagon; But for life itself we call that place Providence, or Destiny, Fate. We want to believe there's is a sense, a purpose for all this odyssey, somewhere. We just don't know where that place may be and who could be there, just like in a Kafka novel. That's why the film meanders from beginning to end in no particular direction, like a drunkard in a back alley. TTRL is not given to us so we can make sense of it, but as a sensual, spiritual gift so we may explore it, experience it.What I liked most in TTRL, besides its cinematography &amp; score, is the acting. But not mainly in action sequences, or when characters are left alone with their own thoughts, but in dialogs. I found most dialogs great, some of them little gems by their own right, specially when Welsh talks with Witt and Tall with Staros. I had not seen Penn before, but I found his work superb here. I enjoyed each one of his lines, even more when some are great: "die, but with less noise! It's all about property!" Even if Chaplin and Caviezel were the pivots, Penn chew ever bit of available scenery while on camera, closely followed at that by Nolte. They were the emotional foundations of the whole film--I'd say its extroverted part--while the other two played its introverted part: dreams, memories, thoughts. 10/10.As someone said here, if you are a checkers players instead of one of chess don't bother watching TTRL, as it may be well over your head. Just go watch SPR...and enjoy that popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best War Movies ever - true masterpiece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a true masterpiece of cinema. When I watched it in theaters in 1998 I absolutely fell in love with it. I recently purchased the Criterion Blu ray release and realized that after 13 years, I am still very much in love with this movie.The Thin Red Line is not a typical war movie. It is not driven by action alone. It explores the duality of nature and draws parallelism between the struggle within nature and the struggle within each man. It achieves this through poetic cinematography, philosophical narration voice-overs, great battle scenes and great casting from the best actors in the business.The duality of nature is presented from the opening shot. A crocodile leaves the shore and moves into the water. The setting is a beautiful island. There is something about watching the most horrible event in all humanity, war, within a setting so beautiful, it touches your soul. Where the nature lives in harmony, soldiers are fighting a war. This duality continues all throughout the movie and never ceases to amaze. One of my favorite scenes is when the soldiers are walking through the grass, an aboriginal Indian is walking the other way, and when they are in the same frame, soldiers look like the alien element and the Indian seems to perfectly mesh with nature.The other unique aspect of The Thin Red Line is that it gives us the inner thoughts and feelings of the characters. Often, people put up a facade and keep their feelings inside. This is another duality the film presents through voice-overs. Soldiers do not always think about winning. They are human beings and they often dream about being home, going home, and they fear. In that regard, the movie is very realistic.The Thin Red Line also explores the morality in times of war, and the difficulty of making the right decision under extra-ordinary circumstances where the given objective (a military order) could compromise the sacredness of human life. This struggle is presented through the conflicts of colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) with captain James Staros (Elias Koteas) and sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn) with private Witt (Jim Caviezel).One indisputable fact is cinematography of the film is absolutely fantastic. The trees, the water, the hills, birds, all the colors of the island come alive (even more so on the Blu ray). The casting is one of the greatest ones you will witness. Two-times academy winner Sean Penn is here, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, James Caviezel, John Travolta and George Clooney make brief appearances as well (also academy award winner Adrien Brody has brief appearance and John C. Reiley and Jared Leto)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is simply too little emotional payoff for a war film of this scale and uniqueness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is one of American cinema's great ironies. After two decades out in the filmmaking wilderness, director Terrence Malick popped up from nowhere to deliver one of the most unique war films ever made. Only his third feature after Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978), The Thin Red Line received numerous acclaims, the highlight of which was the prestigious Golden Bear award from Berlin.The film went on to be nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director ? the former ignominiously given to John Madden's overrated period drama Shakespeare in Love (1998), and the latter rightly given to Steven Spielberg's more superior WWII drama Saving Private Ryan. Herein lies the irony. In any other year, Malick's film would have at least secured an Oscar, but fate seems to have charted a less glorious path for his film. Twelve years on, The Thin Red Line still lives in the shadow of "the other great WWII film" of 1998. Is it a cinematic tragedy, or is Malick's film really not as great as it seems.Very obviously, The Thin Red Line features extraordinary cinematography and camera-work by John Toll. He employs crane and steadicam shots that seem to glide effortlessly over the landscape, especially that of the grassy hills as soldiers make their ascent. Even in scenes of frantic action, the camera weaves past explosions and gunfire like a flying bat avoiding rock walls. Such is the artistry of the camera language that it sometimes feel like poetry in motion.The Thin Red Line stars a killer A-list cast including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and Jim Caviezel. However, it also features, to the film's detriment, redundant cameo roles by John Travolta and George Clooney. The film follows a company of American soldiers as they trudge up a grassy hill in Japanese-occupied Guadalcanal, and later, their attack on a small makeshift camp built by the enemy. This is essentially the main, driving plot of the film, but Malick deviates from it by introducing a pointless romance subplot that adds nothing of significance to the overall viewing experience.The periodic intercutting of the aforementioned romantic subplot with the main narrative is at best draggy, and at worst, a total distraction. I feel that the pacing of the film could be improved by removing the subplot completely. The film is already quite slow to begin with, and although the war action presents a change of pace (albeit only slightly), it takes some endurance to sit through three hours of what is mostly philosophical meandering by a narrator that is exclusively Malickian.On a more praiseworthy note, Malick's trademark intercutting of tranquil scenes of nature allows a fair amount of symbolic juxtaposition with chaotic scenes of warfare. The startling irony of war is laid bare here. Soldiers do battle with each other on the hills and in the jungles; these are huge environments that appear to swallow the men who fight in them. Does nature, at any moment, care about the actions of these men? Does the death of a young soldier on foreign land amount to anything nobler than a writhing baby bird on the ground waiting to die, as shown by Malick? The Thin Red Line lacks the urgency of Saving Private Ryan, or for that matter, of any other great war film out there. It is lackluster in parts where the action dies down. In the area of characters and their development, Malick has also made the misjudgment of being too inclusive rather than focus-centered. There are far too many characters in the film, each receiving either too much unnecessary screen time or too little development. As a result, there is no character to root for or to identify with. There is simply too little emotional payoff for a war film of this scale and uniqueness.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine what it is like to wake up every morning knowing it could be your last. I saw a young man on 60 MInutes last night who has become the first recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor in a great many years. He struck me as one of those incredibly thoughtful, self-sacrificial young people who have trouble saying it was I who did this. He considered himself a mediocre soldier. I could also see that this guy is damaged goods. He is going to carry some demons around for a long time from being in this horrible valley in Afghanistan, perhaps the deadliest location of the war. So when we see this movie that deals with Guadalcanal and the horrible situations these men find themselves facing, we have to realize that war is a cerebral as well as a physical event. That's why soldiers are dehumanized in basic training because if they really thought deeply about the killing of other humans, it would be a hard sell. As brave as the men in the movie are, we seldom get to hear their true thoughts. This is a really cerebral movie. Unfortunately, at times it does get pretty tepid. Yes, there is a lot of grass blowing and people pressed to the ground. Nonetheless, it gets at the deep horror of war. There are anti-war movies superior to this one, but it still holds up quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A schizophrenic, sprawling picture that disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of this film promises much; obviously improvised sequences with no cynicism and plenty of relaxed laughter. Jim Caviezel's private Witt asks of the Polynesian children 'Why don't they fight?' If only the whole film could have maintained such freshness (and the unaffected joy of the children's mother Polyn Leona - a tiny diamond in this salt mine).Instead the film Malick is trying to produce is tethered to another that the actors have no choice but to populate; realist, melodramatic and, consequently, at odds with the dreamscape Malick has in mind.The acting is OK. Nolte is particularly good in repeatedly capitulating in his failure to make an impression on his men. Elias Koteas manages nobility in always trying to do the right thing but being punished for not achieving the heroic. Above all Caviezel, the arguable principal, is ideal for Malick. An aloof private whose Zen-attitude gets eroded by his first-hand experience of the battlefield he remains still and engaged in front of the patient camera.A quick comparison with the contemporaneous Saving Private Ryan (a success). Malick has tried something quite different but has found himself hamstrung by 50 years of war movie conventions asserting themselves. Spielberg took this rich cinematic history but paid great attention to the detail of it, tweaking the vernacular and thus giving a, frankly, familiar story fresh voice. Of course neither did it help the former that the latter was released at the same time... 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line, Normally I wait quite some time to write a review about a film that I have seen. But in this case I happen to love this film. The best film I have seen so far this summer on DVD. I wait because I want to think about what the true meaning behind the film and really to see if the film is any good. But in this case I know this film is so well done that one doesn't have to think about it for too long. If I try to start talking about all the great qualities this film possess' it would be impossible to stop. Let me just illustrate what I feel is the most redeeming quality this film contains that sets it above all the rest. It has "true" meaning, and I say that with all sincerity. Most films pretend that they mean something but truth of the matter is that they only pretend, and hide behind they're big visuals. Many people compare this film to Saving Private Ryan, and say that Ryan is superior. Let me just dispel that rumor right now, no it isn't. Ryan has redeeming qualities, but that is a film that hides behind it big expansive visuals. Yes, that deals with brother ship and understanding during war, as well as other themes. But this film is different, it touches on all themes of war and also why war is killing force digging itself into the heart of everyman. From the beginning you know that you aren't simply watching another WWII film, but a masterpiece that transcends all genres. Terrence Malick is now on my list of director in which I respect heavily. He can weave beautiful images in with a beautiful meaning. That is that war is hell. I'm not going to say anything else about the meaning of this film, except that anyone and everyone should watch it. The opening is beautifully composed as it glides throughout this beautiful island in the Pacific to show two soldiers, who have gone AWOL living a peaceful life. The music suits the film too, because it doesn't treat it like a war movie soundtrack but rather a wonderful film that happens to take place during war. The narration that accompanies the actors in the film is so well done that I think it might even be better that Apocalypse Now's narration by Martin Sheen. It speaks volumes into what the men who fought the war thought about at the time. How sympathetic they are toward one another. And in this film each character is different, as well as there being no centralized main character, so pick and choose. The ending is dramatic, and deep. Leaving the audience with a sense for what it was like to be in any war and not just WWII. This film will hopefully transcend generations of people who see it. Hopefully it will leave a scar in their brains as to what "good" film-making is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Saved Only By The Excellent Acting Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in 2000 and remember finding it confusing. As I had watched it in 10/15 minute snippets, I attributed this to be the primary reason and promised myself to watch it again in one go, to have a more fairer impression. Although the film was considered commercially a box-office failure, it divided critics and moviegoers into a hate-it-or-love-it situation, and until today remains so. I eventually had the chance to see this all in one go last night, and the end conclusion was that the film was not only confusing, it was also overlong and had no particular direction.My feeling is that the Director could have taken it in a better direction, especially with the Capt Staros demotion and the death of Pvt Witt. The demotion could have had more repercussions, especially onto Lt Col Tall, as from the Capts, troops, and moviegoers opinion, the disobey of orders was the right decision. Witt's death was a testament of his own personal battle and his eventual escape from the horrors of war, and his ultimate sacrifice for his troops, and should therefore have been better handled, if not been made the ending of the film itself.The confusing and numerous narrations also deserves question, as we all know the proverb 'too many cooks spoil the broth'.What ultimately saved the film for me were the excellent performances of the actors, in spite of the sometimes short appearances. I wish I had seen this film properly those last few years back, as I would have noticed Caviezel earlier than the 'snuff film' Passion of the Christ.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best World War II Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is the best World War II movie. This movie is better than Saving Private Ryan. I think this is one of Nick Nolte's best performances. This movie has great acting, great script, great cinematography, great sets, and great directing. This movie has an all star cast including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, Jim Cavisal, Dash Minock, Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly. I think Terrence Malick should have won for Best Director instead of Steven Spielberg. This movie is not stupid like Saving Private Ryan is. I hope Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima are as good as The Thin Red Line. This movie is similar to Saving Private Ryan but it is better. It must be similar because it is about World War II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beautiful War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line (1998) ****I first saw Terrence Malick's take on James Jones Novel, The Thin Red Line, the year that it came out. I didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps it was my age, I was younger then and could not understand it. It wasn't full of battle scenes and gore like Saving Private Ryan. I would even say that I ended up being bored.Since then I've seen the film numerous times; what made me go back and give it another shot I do not know. What I do know, is that The Thin Red Line is the film that turned me onto film. Over the years since the films release I've fell into love with it. In my mind, there is no movie of the 90s that has matched its greatness. The Thin Red line is frankly a modern masterpiece.Like most masterpieces, it is bound to be misunderstood. I can think of very few other films that are filled with such depth and beauty. Like Malick's other films, what you see isn't necessarily what you get. There is an abundance of underlying messages and meaning in the film, making it very difficult to grasp. Also, the films style is strange, having an almost total lack of narrative, making it as Martin Scorcese put it, an endless picture. The names and voice overs are difficult to distinguish and often indifferent to what is happening on screen, but it's all done for a reason. War has faces and names dropped on you out of nowhere with recruits and the chaotic nature of it all; often people disappear amid the bullets and the carnage, and new faces replace them.It has been said that the movie has no main character. This could be true, but there are multiple main characters, similar to the book. Witt, Tall, Welsh, Staros, Bell; all main characters. Perhaps the best way to describe it is to call the whole company, C company, the main character.The film follows the company through Guadalcanal, dropping into the lives of various characters here and there, all trying to deal with the war in their own way. It is difficult to get into a descriptive plot outline simply because the film is almost plot less. Those who've read the book will recognize the machinations, but the film was more inspired by the novel, rather than a film version of it. It would be virtually impossible to film the book.War is chaos, and the film clearly displays this, and recognizes that war does not ennoble men, it "turns them into dogs. Poisons the Soul." The film focuses more on how those men that are thrust into it try to cope with the dehumanization, all looking for inner peace. The Thin Red Line is filled with beautiful images and beautiful poetry; starkly contrasting the horror of reality. The film also contains one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen. The scene involves the company charging through the woods looking to attack a Japanse bivouac. They walk through the fog carpeted forest as you hear only the whiz of bullets passing by from seemingly out of nowhere. When they finally reach the site of the attack, the camera moves frantically, chasing soldiers here and there, from the viewpoint of both American and Japanese soldiers. The music in this scene is quite possibly the key to why it becomes so powerful. Everything in the Thin Red Line clicks, especially the music and the cinematography.The Thin Red Line evokes a sense of tranquility in the middle of chaos, and begs questions that may possibly never be answered, but need to be asked nonetheless. The late Gene Siskel called the film on its release "the finest contemporary war film." The film is still misunderstood years later, but its popularity is growing and its finally becoming regarded as a masterpiece. Martin Scorcese has called this the second best film of the 90s- it should be noted that the film he chose as number 1, was made in the 80s, it just never gained popularity in North America until the 90s.Unlike films like Saving Private Ryan, who's repeat viewings offer nothing new, you can watch The Thin Red Line time after time after time, and see a different film every time. It is my belief that in the years to come, The Thin Red Line will gain wide recognition as a masterpiece. 4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Ensemble Cast For a War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cast of many B-grade actors (or at least no Cruises or Pitts or Hankses) tries to overtake a hill in the Battle of Guadalcanal. There is fighting, death and explosions, much as you'd expect from a war movie.I will first say that Netflix lied to me because it said the stars were Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn and John Cusack. A fair warning for you: Penn appears, but Woody has a very small role and Cusack does not even show up until over halfway through the film. So calling these the stars is a bit misleading. Even John Travolta appears almost as much as Woody Harrelson.The two main stars are Elias Koteas (Casey Jones from the ninja turtle movies) and Nick Nolte, regardless of what the packaging says. And both of them are wonderful. Nolte is the hard-nosed commanding officer and Koteas is the man in the field who refuses to let his men die for nothing.The film is powerful, with the conflict between Koteas and Nolte really dividing the audience into those who want to see action and those who want to save lives. And where they infiltrate a Japanese camp, the compassion the Americans show the Japanese is a very interesting spin. Whether it is historically accurate or not, I can't say.But the film is not perfect. It's biggest problem, easily, is the length. Three hours of trying to get up one hill? I've seen "Hamburger Hill" and this drags even more than that, if I may say so. Cut an hour out of it, or at least a half hour and you'd have an engaging film. But I found myself wanting to pace back and forth a few too many times, and that's certainly not the way to make a movie.I have no plans of watching this one a second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosophical discourse set against the one of the bloodiest battles of World War Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The novel by James Jones has already been put to the screen in a 1964 version. That film followed a more or less traditional war story, loosely based upon the novel. I have yet to see it and will, at some time in the future, post my assessment.In the meantime, this version from Terrence Malick does not disappoint his fans, but it's a war film that has, in a very real sense, a very active role: it engages the viewer in a philosophical discourse about the Big Questions in life. So, if you're looking for an all-action movie, then this is not for you ? although the action that is portrayed is probably the best you'll see for a long time to come.On the other hand, if you've often wondered about the finitude of existence, the thought of your own death, the relationship between enemies in combat and our intimate symbiosis with nature, then you'll be well rewarded. Visually, the film is stunning with some of the most sublimely tranquil scenes of natural splendor ever put on film, and in keeping with Malick's prior masterpiece, Days of Heaven, it brings the viewer to confront what it truly means to be human. Dialogue is sparse, for the most part, but Malick makes great use of voice-overs ? the private thoughts of various characters as they lay bare their fears and doubts when they come face-to-face with the imminence of their own death.The history concerns the invasion of Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, in 1942 ? a very important step by American forces to push back the Japanese empire. The personal story, however, concerns three individuals: Capt. Staros, a good man thrown into war who wants to make sure that he protects his men at all costs, even to the point of defying a valid order from Col. Tall; Private Bell, whose only way to hold on to his sanity is to keep the thoughts of his wife alive in his mind, as much as he can; and Private Witt, the rebel, who often goes AWOL, but who is the bravest of the brave and the only one who can and does transcend the nihilism and dehumanizing gore of war.With an Academy Award winning musical score that will haunt you, set against the natural splendour of a pristine paradise that is totally indifferent to the savagery and cruelty that is played out, this is a film that you won't forget. The final battle scene is arguably the finest on film: using hand-held cameras to force the viewer into the battle, running with the combatants of both sides as they maim, shoot, kill and murder each other, the sense of being part of the slaughter is almost too much. But you watch it, as you must, to try to understand what it means to be in a war.War is not a pleasant topic, but this is a film that should be seen. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally good but not as great as the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some, it's simply a matter of placing a war in a context of moral equivalence, angst, and adding the always asked and never answered (by such films), What is war? What is it's purpose? What is right and wrong?, and the war film becomes and instant classic according to those who call themselves anti-war advocates. These questions are asked here in a variety of ways and a multitude of juxtaposed images. Had everyone in WWII been as involved with the soul searching of the several combatants here, it's possible that we might have had a different outcome, or the same outcome in a different way, if you can imagine the leaders of the Allies doing the same sort of ruminating. The best points of this whole exercise are made in two scenes. One, when the Colonel, Nick Nolte, relieves the Lt. of command, and it's clear that the Lt. would have saved his men yet lost the battle, and Nolte is the type of officer that won this war in both the Pacific and in Europe. The other is the scene of the men prodding the crocodile to get it to open it's mouth, and it just stares with it's terrifying eyes. That one shot contrasted with all of the beautiful shots of other natural creatures and scenery is enough to show in visuals what was said by the colonel about nature when he described the vines winding around all of the trees, and choking them. But the film's low point is it's portrayal of most of the Japanese soldiers as being without much courage nor strength of character, a total falsehood and a sadly bigoted point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War is hell. War is hell. War is hell. Repeat 1,000 times and you've got the Thin Red Line. Terrence Malick doesn't understand the 'show don't tell' ethos of good filmaking. I watched Cross of Iron, All is Quiet on the Western Front and Das Boot and definitely got the feeling that being at war was pointless, wasteful and, er, hellish. But old Tel thinks those great films completely missed the point. What they needed was endless voice overs and slow-mos of people looking unhappy to get the message across. Unable to get the overall feeling that warfare isn't mankind's greatest hour across? What you need to do is just get the prettiest young actors around to look tortured for about three+ hours. OK I'll declare an interest. I hate voice-overs. I think they just show a director that has panicked in the editing room and lost confidence in his film. To sum up: the Thin Red Line stinks. It's beautifully shot, got some great actors in it, and has a lauded director at the helm. It sets itself up as an overwhelming indictment of war. I just found it tedious, preaching, nonsense and a massive disappointment. And it was up itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't say whether or not I "liked" or "disliked" this film, because I'm not sure I really understood the motives behind it well enough to give a judgment on it... But I do have one suggestion, if you have yet to see the film and are reading these comments to get an idea of what the movie might be about. If you are tired of watching gore, constant action, and meaningless violence, this is your war movie (rather than "We Were Soldiers" or "Saving Private Ryan"). If you dislike long extradiagetic monologues, meaningful (but also long) periods of nonaction, and but little plot, this is NOT your war movie. This movie contains many (almost too many to count) main characters, only half of whom are remembered by the end of the film, and an extensive amount of beautiful, artistic cinematography that ALMOST doesn't work in contrast with the action shots. I agree with the previous posters who named it as beautiful, but I also agree with some others that its plot is lacking. Your appreciation of "The Thin Red Line" all depends on what you're looking for in an action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected a great deal more from this film than it delivered, and I can only be thankful that it was free to watch, since a friend loaned the DVD.There are several things I'd like to set straight: long movies don't need to be boring, and neither is a slow-paced film bad. The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly and 2001 are examples of this. But this movie just plain sucked. I can only posit two theories: One, I do not understand "art films" and thus am incapable of appreciating this movie; or two: The Thin Red Line was poorly written, directed, and edited.What struck me first and foremost about the story was the totally disjointed manner in which it was presented. I've read stories told by men who fought on Guadalcanal, and while they tend to jump temporally, the reasons are explained. This film felt as though someone simply decided to cut each and every last transition scene out entirely, and leave it up to the audience to guess at what happened in the interval. Perhaps this was cover for the fact that a great number of events didn't seem to have any logical connection between them, in fact, nearly none of the movie made sense on even a basic level. The number of gaping holes in the plot was one of the hardest things to accept about this film, in my opinion. For instance:*SPOILERS* 1: How did those seven men walk all the way up the hill to the machinegun position, without being spotted or shot, after being torn to pieces the day before by the very same guns?2: Where exactly WAS this Melanesian village? How was Witt found originally by the Navy if he was hiding out in the middle of nowhere? And how did he return to it later in the film, if we clearly see him get on a boat, travel, and then land onto Guadalcanal? Was the village on Guadalcanal, or another island? How did he manage to just walk away from his company for a few days, then walk back?3: In the "cleaning-up action" against the Japanese bivouac, the behavior they showed was very strange. Historically it seems extremely unlikely that a large percentage of their troops would just throw up their hands and surrender. It also doesn't make sense why none of the soldiers seemed to be expecting to be attacked by the Americans.4: Towards the very end of the film, how did the company find Witt's body (and why did they bury him next to the stream)? Where were the Japanese who shot him? Why on earth was there a manicured lawn full of graves with SPRINKLERS in the middle of freaking Guadalcanal!? *END SPOILERS*I understand symbolism. Life, death, rebirth, yada yada. The symbolism throughout the film of water. The connection of man and nature. Etc. But this movie showed no understanding of these underlying concepts. There was no dialogue, no consideration, no exploration of these ideas, only gratuitous repetition of imagery without explanation or thought. Honestly, I'm not sure whether the director intended to criticize war or not, because it doesn't seem like he had any real idea himself of what he felt. There are other films that capture what combat was like, or war as a whole. And there are yet others that discuss meaningful issues through symbolism. But The Thin Red Line failed on both counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Examination of Man's Inner Dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most powerfully introspective large budget films I've seen, largely due to the masterful artistic direction and screen writing of Terrence Malick and the incredibly cinematography of John Toll who has worked on many of the more beautifully scenic large budget films in the past two decades. Undeniably, the film was cast with great attention to how each actor would bring strength to the film, particularly the two main protagonists, Witt and Welsh. There are many who dismiss the film as less than Saving Private Ryan which was released at the same time, but it seems odd to compare the two as films as each has a significant, yet different story to tell. Weaving together this tale of voices from the perspective of several points of view must not have been an easy process, yet as we balance the whole of the film, it's an incredible accomplishment for such complexity.While juxtaposed against the backdrop of a particular scope of time of war, the film reaches inward to examine the human psyche and the duality of man's nature. While some critique as an inward spiral that does little justice to war films, this is much more than a film about the war of good and evil, it is the complex examination of war within the soul of man.One of the reason I'm intrinsically drawn to this film is my own struggle with search for self and good in humanity, and the indelible moment that I recognize myself in these words...Private Witt: Do you ever feel lonely? Sgt. Welsh: Only around people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to not give high marks to a film so beautifully photographed, yet I found this film self-indulgent, overwrought, and dull. If you have never had the thought that war sucks and that soldiers are people and are frightened, then I suppose this film might make you think. This script is trite without being clich, so that's something, I suppose. The photography, as I have said, is absolutely beautiful, but combined with this script and the director's choices for the actors, it was like watching a high school play shot by National Geographic. Lines like "War doesn't enoble men - it makes them dogs" and showing one second of a fist fight that has no reason at all is not deeply moving or thought provoking - it is just lame. Maybe the book is better. I would give it even lower marks if the cinematography wasn't so outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ars poetica</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to use a word like "intentionality" in commenting on a movie, but it seems necessary in this case. It means something like the "reality" that is constructed between one person and another, shaped by the desires of the main actor. (I hate to use the word because (1) hardly anybody understands it completely, and (2) I don't understand it completely either.) What Terrence Malick has done in "The Thin Red Line" is to ask the audience to participate in his construction of the experience of combat. To appreciate what he's done is to see it partly through his eyes, his point of view, and that point of view is a combination (not always a perfect solution) of realism and poetry. It reminds one of another war movie, from 1945, I think, Lewis Milestone's "A Walk in the Sun." And to a lesser extent John Huston's "The Red Badge of Courage." Malick's movie, like Milestone's, has a narrator with a penchant for humanistic comments. (Huston's narrator was a lot more matter of fact about war.) Malick doesn't use narration often and that's a good thing because a little of these elliptical lines goes a long way in this context. There is none of the usual banter about the chow. And the voiceovers aren't used for their usual purpose -- telling us about events without having to show them. ("After I slapped her around, she told me what had happened back at the hotel. Malloy had slipped the fat man a mickey, then Thelma put two holes through Skinny Jackson and betrayed the old lush.") And there's not a wisecrack in a cartload. A GI daydreams about the wife he left behind. "We are together. We come together. We are like water." That sort of thing. Makes you feel like you're back in college, sitting on the floor and trying to seduce a girl by candlelight. It isn't bad by itself, but as James Jones showed us in his novel, these are not the kinds of guys who are likely to think in anapestic trimeter. They're not going to have flashbacks to undressing their wives, not while crawling towards an enemy bunker. They're just ordinary goons, most of them, rednecks from Tuscaloosa or factory stiffs from Gary, who are attacked by the Japanese while moving their bowels, or have situational homosexual encounters, or who deliberately take a sitting position and fire single shots from their M1s at an overwhelming horde of approaching enemy until they are inevitably cut down.But Malick is intent on taking us beyond that kind of ordinariness. He interpolates shots of nature. The hazy tropical sun shining through a raggedy leaf with holes. The hills are covered with tall emerald grass that waves smoothly as the breezes wash over it. A naked soldier swims underwater with the naked native kids. A bird, newly hatched, still blind, feebly moves its limbs in the rank and blackish mud, dying. Dozens of flying foxes hang upside down from the branches, peering at the soldiers, as if trying to figure out why these guys are all upside down.It's an intense film and an expression of a very personal vision. I wouldn't be surprised if some simply gave up trying to play the game.But it has some very good action scenes, which I won't go into, and the Japanese are human beings rather than "bandy-legged baboons" ("Bataan," with Robert Taylor).The acting is very good too. In some cases very good indeed. The soldiers are all dressed alike, regardless of role or rank, in fatigues dark with perspiration. It's difficult to tell one from another. In compensation Malick uses a lot of closeups so that we can see the men's faces. Elias Koteas, who plays Staros, a lawyer in civilian life, has the wide open eyes of a man who is scared to death of doing his duty but brave enough to not do it. It may be Nick Nolte's best role as the fustian, shouting, ambitious, savvy, ego-maniacal commanding officer. He desperately needs success in combat as a means to promotion. "The old guys, they've HAD their war. This is MINE!" I will take the liberty of directing your attention to his performance during a particularly dramatic moment. He orders Captain Staros over the phone to make a suicidal frontal attack. Staros respectfully refuses. Nolte makes it clear that this is an ORDER. Staros refuses. And it finally becomes clear to Nolte that Staros is telling him to take his order and shove it. Nolte's head jerks back in a spasm, his jaw drops in awe, and he is utterly speechless, awed by a situation he'd never anticipated. He wipes his nose, blinks, spits, looks around. I've never witnessed him in a better scene.A shame that this came out at the same time as "Saving Private Ryan." Spielberg wants us to look at the external realities of combat, the gore, the bullets clanking on armor, the injustice of it all. Malick on the other hand invites us to look inside the men. Brutality there surely is, but when a GI is waiting for a wounded Japanese to die before he pulls out his gold teeth with a pair of pliers, he lectures him softly on how little it means. That's an intentionality of a different color.It's understandable that some viewers might be turned off by this. It's a depressing, original, thoughtful, and deeply disturbing film. I wonder if Malick has ever considered making a documentary about nature -- habitat destruction or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is, quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made. It is astonishing - and I can't believe it isn't on more people's cinematic radars.I was looking at the beginning of the film last night on DVD and it is just so beautiful. I think The Thin Red Line is one of the most gorgeously photographed films I've ever seen (along with Apocalypse Now, Tess, The Conformist and The Virgin Suicides) - cinematographer John Toll truly deserved an Oscar for his work. So many images haunt the mind afterwards; the shots of the soldiers creeping through the grass as they try and take the hill, all of the scenes at the beginning of the film, where Jim Caviezel seems to have found paradise on the Pacific Island, the scenes where the American soldiers are silently passed by the indigenous people of the Pacific Islands.If you have no interest in the movie, see it anyway for the beautiful cinematography.The themes of the film are amazing - the violence inherent in man and nature, the destruction we wreck upon our planet, nature and each other - all these ideas are explored. The cumulative effect is stunning.I find it very interesting that this film polarizes so many viewers: some find it boring, elusive and pretentious. Others say that Saving Private Ryan (released around the same time) is the better film. Well, I'm the biggest Steven Spielberg fan in the world and I love Ryan - but the two films couldn't really be more different. It's like comparing the Beatles to Mozart. Both make music, but the results are markedly different. Also, I think the comparisons are lazy - people only compared the two because both are World War 2 films. The directors could not be more different.Ryan is a more immediate, commentary-style, narrative-driven film. The Thin Red Line is often described by people who have seen it as a meditation on war - and i think that is completely accurate. There isn't a single strong narrative thread in the film, characters come in and out of focus, as does the use of voice-over, but if you just let this film flow over and into you, you'll enjoy an intensely rich experience.The use of music is also wonderful - particularly Faure's Requiem, which is gorgeously deployed at the start of the film, where Jim Cavizel and and his buddy are AWOL on the Pacific Island.Terrence Malick is, undoubtedly, a genius. I'm a huge fan of both Badlands and Days of Heaven, but The Thin Red Line is my favourite of all his films. His new movie, The New World, also looks wonderful - and judging by the trailer, it revisits many of the themes explored in The Thin Red Line - nature, destruction, war, love and the primal violence of man.The Thin Red Line is a ravishing, haunting film, loaded with meaning. Like Kubrick's 2001, it is endlessly open to debate. If you haven't seen it, then get your hands on the DVD, the biggest widescreen TV you can find and enjoy. Better still, see it on the big screen.A gorgeous work of genius.</fullReview>

I adored Badlands, I loved Days of Heaven but Thin Red Line... Ohh my freaking god...It's so warm and dirty at the same time... It's dark but sunny... It's untouchable but deep down in mud as well... Don't know how many actors were looking for Malick as soon as they heard his movie will be shot... Heard loads of stories bout cast and how did they get "job" in this film... Sean Penn literary begged, and Bill Pulman cried once he learned his scene was lost in editing...Thin Red Line is the movie which was human is previous life and Terrence Malick is god and every time he's feeling bored he pics up a camera and show him self to the world...I WOULD KILL MY UNBORN SON TO SEE THAT 6,5 HOUR LONG FIRST EDITING VERSION OF THIS GOD ACT MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average war film and well worth seeing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is no comparisons with SPR except simplistic observations of the WW2 setting, and that the characters were soldiers. SPR was like a war version of Titanic, it may have been cute, popular and profitable, but it was far from art and hardly a film to inspired further thought, however that said, 'further thought' may not be the thing you look for in a film which of course is fine.The first thing to consider is that the disorientation of characters both in their portrayal and the audience interaction with them is very deliberate. War is indiscriminate, characters regardless of status are culled, nameless, and faceless and with no regard for the individual. The cameo roles of big names arrive unannounced, portray small seemingly insignificant characters only to exit just as unannounced. This juxtaposes our movie audience concept of vanity and popularism and with the dirt, *beep* and blood and death of the events portrayed.The viewer is drawn in to the character development only to have the character snatched away, thus we are prevented from building a comforting relationship of perspective, we fail to know the individual and their deaths seem all the more pointless, we feel jilted like the death of a relative we hardly knew but wish we had spent more time with.The characters I suspect are meant to be confused because in wars confusion and death are the only constant, we see the soldiers as slabs of meat, lambs to the slaughter, victims of militarism and hierarchy, sacrificed to ego and vainglorious patriotic pride. "This great evil--where's it come from? How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doing this? Who's killing us" The cut away to the helpless naked bird fallen from the nest?? we wonder did it fall? Was it pushed from the nest??..are we are all pushed from the nest?? In our empathy we feel the certainty of all death and the pathetic nature of living existence.This film also comments on our perceptions of god, nation and race. Religion seems a vain and self-indulgent luxury, oddly out of place amid the aimless killing, the mayhem and futility. The grassy slope (shot near Port Douglas in OZ BTW) becomes a canvass on which all our preconceptions of war and humanity are put to the sword, the bunker merely an object of temporary ambition and conquest, a hole in the ground on a desolate hill on a remote island that in time will wash away to become still again but for the wind in the grass i.e. "he marched them up the to top of the hill and he marched them down again". And when at last we reach the climatic conquest of the hill, we seek an enemy on whom to vent your rage?. And instead we feel their hopelessness, their suffering, loss and grief All of them stripped of nationalism and race as pathetic pawns in some meaningless game, what is a hero, what is an enemy? What really is the difference between us and them?The disembodied buried face of the dead Japanese soldier staring up into space, "Are you righteous, kind? Does your confidence lie in this? Are you loved by all? Know that I was, too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness, truth?" the shell-shocked youth crying in a fetal position, what we held as our hero's committing acts of senseless killing, summary execution and the wrenching gold teeth from the dead and dying.For all the stark elements of the TTRL, all the stripping bare of our preconceptions and prejudice, it is a story of renewal and hope. In the cutting down of artificial difference, the dismembering of the hollow constructs of religious belief, of race, ideology, nation and rank, the ultimate message is that our fragile mortality is the great leveler and that death knows no ideology. The cutaway at the end to the coconut somehow managing to put down roots on a desolate beach, the sound of the singing of island children and the panoramic shots of nature and it's timeless persistence.Visually the cinematography was fantastic, though I felt some parts were overly drawn out and could afford to have trimmed, if only because some of it seeming to languish without reason or significance, but the rich color, the framing and the film stock were a stand out. Well worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Philosophical War Movie, or a Warlike Philosophy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, which takes place in Quadalcanal during the 2nd World War, is Terrance Malick's third time out after "Badlands" (a pretty good debut with Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek) and "Days of Heaven". This film showcases the man's talents as a director of significant movies and strong actors. Numerous "name" stars, all young men (except Nick Nolte, John Savage and John Travolta, who manages to look like a young general) act well ensemble to show different reactions to and ways of coping with their gruesomely deadly yet stunningly beautiful and exotic situation and surroundings. Radically different philosophies about life clash in the attitudes of frequently-AWOL Private Witt, empathetic and anti-authoritarian lover of life, and Sergeant Welsh the uncaringly brave, cynical, every-man-for-himself existentialist.This lyrical, beautifully-photographed and steadily-paced story about Life vs. Death takes place as Captain Staros, the paternal and caring leader of the men must follow his ambitious Colonel's orders to take a heavily-defended, nearly-impregnable strongpoint at all costs, yet keep his men alive. Great action sequences are interspersed with gorgeous scenic or dream cutaways with reflective voice-overs. This is a movie of quality.</fullReview>

Each is featured in advertising, and each has a minor role. I felt manipulated, just as the soldiers themselves were manipulated.It would have been art if I believed that the producers were callous enough to have done this on purpose.

		<fullReview>This is a powerful movie, beautifully filmed and acted. It's easy to see why Mel Gibson chose Jim Cavaziel to play Christ in the Passion, which I have not and will not see. I didn't know it was Cavaziel until the end credits, but he was mesmerizing as the sometimes awol private. There's a lot of spiritual depth in this movie, which appears to be influenced by Hindu ideas, especially in the Bhagavad Gita, with Arjuna and Vishnu. Which may explain why my father in law, who is Catholic, and who fought with the Marines at Guadacanal, hated this movie, and said "it wasn't like that at all." Maybe too much on the inner thoughts and philosophy, and non-Christian. I think the Marines were a tighter knit, harder ass kicking outfit than the Army soldiers portrayed in the movie, too concerned with staying alive when they were outnumbered and cut off from the outside, to have been as self reflective as the men in this movie. I think it's a great movie, but I have to defer to him and the other brave men who were really there on the accuracy. Great performances by Cavaziel, Nolte, Sean Penn, and many others.</fullReview>

You know a film is good when it really touches you.I felt that a movie dealing with the soldiers state of mind was a very refreshing approach to the typical Hollywood nonsense we see everyday.Don't get me wrong i loved movies like Saving Private Ryan, is just i need to see something unique in its own right. TRL not only deals with soldiers state of mind, but it reminds us of who we are, and that life is no fair tale, we must appreciate everything we have: our wives, ourselves, our lives. The performances from 'Witt'and 'Staros' were both excellent, not to mention Nick Nolte and Sean Penns outstanding roles. I have never read the book, but i intend to, as this movies will go down as one of my favourite of all time.Of course people have the freedom to disagree with me, but i think if a person really watches and looks deep into this movie, they will reveal something out about themselves.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could be a great film, but it doesn't fullfil espectatives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film contains some of the greatest moments among war films but the whole movie fails for many reasons. First of all, we should remember the fact that the real runtime was about 6 hours, and afterwards was reduced to 3 hours film, that was finally released. In my opinion, these cut shots make the film weaken. I mean that the film is spineless, without main character and with discontinuous "tempo". Moreover, maybe, the voice-over (the weakest point in the actoral work)was included to make clear some segments of the film (however, some interviews ensure that there was voice-over in the director's cut). And we cannot say with no doubt that the former intention of the director wasn't developing war horror using secondary actors on the background instead of a main character. On the other hand, we can find a dispassionate and realistic snapshot of war. If the voice-over has never been included, we could have found a pretty good film with a cool style such as that we can find on Kubrcik's Full Metal Jacket. What else could we say? Great actors, great photography, great score music... It's a shame that the released edit (forced by commercial reasons) and the voice-over make impossible appreciate the great film that "The Thin Red Line" should have been.</fullReview>

Most of the high-ranking officials in this movie seem very unrealistically single-minded. Many of the main characters seem believable, but the way they react to situations is just strange... which I guess was the writer's intention since they tried to get us inside the soldier's heads and make us feel depressed or scared at the same time.It didn't work for me, though.

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is a mix between poetic peace and World War II. The poetic scenes do get very dull after a while, but the view is beautiful. In the movie, we are lead by Pvt. Witt (James Caviezel) in the battle at the island Guadalcanal lead by Sgt. Fife (Sean Penn) and Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte). They seize many of the Japanese from the island, and one of the members of the platoon tries to ignore the situation and think of his peaceful life at home. The Thin Red Line is not a bad movie by any means, but is somewhat dull and runs on empty formula. Saving Private Ryan was a much better look at World War II and the much more fateful conflict of D-Day. This has an excellent choice of a cast and an impressive direction by Terrance Malick. Even though it is vivid and poetic, some of it is frustrating and too hard to digest as a war film. The Thin Red Line is a good war movie, but not exactly what I expected.7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the time to watch it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that many people look at how well a movie is made in order to grade it. This movie was well made, beautiful, thoughtful, but finally, horrible and boring.There was just too much stupidity and shallowness in this movie for it to be enjoyable. Big headliner actors with less than three minutes in the movie, specifically John Travolta, George Clooney, and John Cusack. They were there just for star attraction. They add nothing to the movie at all. Any no-name bit player could have handled their parts.Even if you liked the movie's style, the soldiers were portrayed as either stupid morons, war-crazed psychos, or crying babies. The main character spent his time looking at birds, light filtering through the trees, and the natives while dreaming of his wife and thinking about life, death, and some unspecified afterlife with lots of slow motion video and unrelated images edited together.For example, at one point, a private (played by Woody Harrelson) goes to throw a grenade and grabs just the pin, pulling it and leaving the grenade on his belt (which is very hard to believe in the first place). But, instead of realizing his blunder and making a second grab for the grenade to toss it before it detonates (and he has plenty of time to try), he just sits there looking at the pin and the other soldiers around him with an idiotic look on his face, until finally the grenade explodes fatally wounding him. Then we watch for three minutes while he dies and makes bizarre demands of his friends to write and tell his wife he died heroically instead of by stupidly blowing off his own back side.The higher brass are portrayed as cold, stupid, war-crazed maniacs interested only in getting their own way for glory sake as they issue orders that make no sense at all. The primary Lt. Colonel of the story tells the leadership under him that they have to take this hill by charging the Japanese with a direct, frontal approach. He says there is no way to flank their positions. They have to go straight up the front. Then you look at the hill and it's just a large, wide, rolling hill with nothing preventing a flank from either side! No cliffs, no steep rock faces, nothing. It's about fifty-fifty between a frontal attack or a flank attack. Made no sense at all.Maybe I'm naive, but it's my opinion that the soldiers who fought in World War II were brave men, who did what they did because it needed to be done. I don't believe that 95% of them were idiots, fools, crybabies, maniacs, or introverted writers. I also know better than to believe that our purpose for taking the Pacific islands like Guadalcanal was for "property" as one character states in the film. It was a major, strategic base for the Japanese in that part of the Pacific.The Thin Red Line is a beautifully made film that portrays war as stupid and soldiers as morons or psychos. I think that is a slap in the face of the hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers who fought for and achieved the freedom of world at that time. Many of them died for that goal and we all own them a debt we can never repay. Movies such as this, while beautifully made, do a great disservice to the reputations and heroism of these fine men.Do yourself a favor and find another movie to watch. Saving Private Ryan or Tora, Tora, Tora are much better choices. The Thin Red Line simply doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as these other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was great when this came out because Saving Private Ryan was released the same time and it was sparking a comparison war between both films as they were set around World War 2. I went to see Red Line at the cinema and like everyone else was expecting an explosive war movie like Private Ryan but that wasn't what I got. What we all saw was a human story about men who were in a place and fighting a war that didn't really believe in. The casting was over done and people probably saw it because of John Travolta and George Clooney's names on the front of the poster, that's why I went to see it because I thought `How can you go wrong' but after a while you realised that these two huge actors did not even get 3 minutes on screen and that was great because it paved the way to have some new fresh talent taking the lead roles like the underrated and very talented Ben Chaplin and Jim Cavizel. They held this film along with others to make it what it is and that the best war movie since Apocalypse Now in my opinion. There were many flaws in Private Ryan that could have been foreseen but The Thin Red Line is something else because as well as dealing with the horrors of war it deals with the spiritual side of it. Sean Penn must be putting the performance of his life in this because the scene when he runs to the soldier who has been hit bad in the middle of the battlefield and tries to give him morphine and the young soldier just realises that it's better to die rather than to feel the pain and he asks Penn's character for more morphine to end it , it just brings you to tears because it brings in the normality of how real it was. A lot of people say it is boring but they are not watching it for it's story, they are watching it for the action and after I came out of the cinema everybody was like `It should have had one more battle at the end' but I am glad it didn't because that the easy way to Finnish off a war movie but Terence Malick kept his eye on the story to Finnish it off not the action. Again this is a film and a director who has been criminally ignored by the Academy and I know I should have the attitude of to hell with the Oscar's but it's the Oscars for a lot of people who get remembered and to give Spielberg an Oscar and not Malick then I think it's quite sad as it shows that Hollywood don't really look at a film for what it is, just the success, and I know by now that that's the way it is but it shouldn't be because it's not what you put into the computer to edit it's what your imagination and camerawork can put in the editing process. This is not Apocalypse Now, it's not the Deer Hunter, it is a film that can hold itself without stereotyping any other film and becoming the most original and beautiful war movie in decades.</fullReview>

With a cast that includes George Clooney, Nick Nolte, John Cusack and John Travolta, one would expect more. I think I understand that the point of the movie is having the characters display their inner struggle with war and in one good case, authority. Not that there is anything wrong with that; its just that I didn't expect all three hours to be devoted to that theme.****POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE****************Very little is mentioned on the location of the film with the exception of the map of Guadacanal. It seems that this theme would have been much better done in a Vietnam type of setting. The scene where a body is split into two by a possible land mine is isolated from the rest of the movie.In summary, it seems like a waste of time with the great cast of characters and the length of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst war movies ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thin Red Line is without a doubt one of the worst war movies ever. Why? Because of WHEN it was set, using the story that was used. The whole problem can be summed up by "why are we here?" In short, the main charachters felt that they are in a horrible situation that no one should have to be in. And they question why. This plot would do very well in a Vietnam era film. But this was World War Two. The "good war." No war is good, and I'm sure that the soldiers on Guadalcanal hated being there, but I don't think any of them EVER questioned WHY they were there. They were there because the US had been attacked. They were there because of the Japanese and Pearl Harbor. Though unrelated, one could even say that They were there because Hitler had declared war on the US. World War two was the last war that the US fought that REALLY had a sense of purpose. We were in the right and we knew it. People don't want to see a move about the greatest generation questioning their worth and values. It just isn't realistic. Even though it is a bit hokey and doesn't reflect the reality of the last mission, Memphis Belle is what people want, and reflects more the reality of the war and the men's attitudes toward it, I think. Do yourself a favor and leave this miserable piece of revisionist propaganda on the shelf.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So... lots of grass, and war is a bad thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I appreciate this film as a sincere attempt, I must say that it completely escaped me.I saw it lately with the highest expectations after it had received quite a lot of good reviews, but I found it lacked virtually everything. Everything was drawn out into length, from the exposition on the native island to the closing credits, and even the battle scenes got you bored quite quickly -- not to mention the endless grassy hills on the pacific islands.Characters? Hm. Not a whole lot of characters around, to be honest, not to mention any development. We don't get to see a whole lot of people _before_ the battle, and as soon as the battle starts, everybody gets hysteric and is reduced to screaming and crying. (And the screaming goes quickly on your nerves, as does the tedious voice-over poetry... it's a film, for Christ's sake, not a poetry slam!) Travolta and Clooney could have been fun characters, but their cameos obviously were introduced only to lure a few more people into the cinemas...And the plot? I don't think there was one, neither was there a story being told. After the storming of the Japanese camp, I sincerely thought the film was over, and was quite surprised to see another story line unfold (the assault on the creek) -- which was a completely pointless addition, IMHO.All in all, it felt like a two-hour something snapshot of war, designed to tell me that war is bad. Okay, I knew that before, and the snapshot concept simply doesn't work here: Pitching the audience into battle like the soldiers, and exposing them to the same confusion, just leads to different effects: Soldiers will fear for their lifes, but the audience will just get bored and lose interest.Although I was very well inclined to the movie in the first place, it simply failed to catch me, and I sat through the two hours dutifully, but without real interest in the people or the story. (Story? Which story?)P.S.: Trying to avoid having goodies and baddies was a nice idea. But the explanation and "justification" of Nolte's character was a bit too much (like the whole film was "too much" of everything)... pleading too verbosely for his innocence will only make him look guilty...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully shot but boring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line aims to be the most beautiful war epic ever shot, and considering that this film was once originally 6 hours in length, I can certainly believe it. What this film has in spades is reflections of how horrible war is and many frames of the beauty of nature, trampled by man's horrid conflict. What this movie lacks is the money shots. What I mean by money shots is the combat sequences are for the most part short and sterile. If you're looking for violent and thrilling combat scenes look elsewhere.The first battle scene when the troops try a frontal assault up the hill is the best scene in terms of combat. An arguement between Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte is a well acted and dynamic scene. It just doesn't get your blood rushing though. The battle sequence is so long that it loses some of it's momentum and energy. The cast of this movie is one of the biggest and most accomplished ever assembled. The fact that some of the biggest names are onscreen for only a few minutes is pretty misleading to the viewer. George Clooney and John Travolta's scenes might have been bigger but what we see is what you could loosely refer to as a cameo. Plenty of great actors fill the ranks. You just don't see most of them for very long. The way this movie is filmed is very scenic and beautiful. You get the feeling that shots of grass blowing in the wind and flowers floating in gentle streams and the waves of the ocean at dusk shouldn't really be in a war movie. You would be right and wrong. On one hand, these shots show how important and wonderful life and nature is and how ironic it is that there is such slaughter and suffering in so beautiful a place. The other hand though, is that when audiences go to a war movie, they want to see combat. The Thin Red Line is sorely lacking that critical component.Bottom Line: A well done, finely crafted film. Failing to deliver on the action and it's sometimes brain numbing 3 hour length are things you might want to consider before viewing. We can only pray for a Special Edition DVD to show us all those cut scenes.</fullReview>

Well, understand me right: From earlyblack/white to arthouse and from John Woo to Woody Allen - I likea big range of films. I'm a friend of looong epic movies and I do notneed hammer action at all to call a good movie a good movie, but Ineed more than 5 or 6 good written scenes to fill such a long filmwith REAL drama. As some guys mentioned before, I too could notcare much for the characters - although the acting was fine asexpected (Koteas! Nolte! Penn). It's badly written (perfect for enemies of meaningful off-voices!). Butit's up to you to give it a try anyway. Do NOT expect a classicmasterpiece (like Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket). 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Agony</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard very little about this movie when I walked into the dollar theater, so I decided it was worth a shot. 3 agonizing hours later, I walked out of the theater wishing I had spent my dollar on something useful- like a single hollow point bullet I could have put through my brain.This movie is so uninteresting on so many levels, I can hardly decide where to start a critique. The acting is probably the worst facet of this movie. Not one performer gave me a reason to hope that they would survive an ambush. In fact, I was hoping for one throughout the movie.TTRL has no plot. Nothing of any significance happens. It could have just as easily been depicted as a bunch of poets sitting in a coffee house reading their works about war.The narrative is disjointed, and often insipid. If it were associated with more interesting characters, it might be tolerable. But it comes off as heavy handed at best.However, the imagery supported the philosophical meanderings of the characters and the cinematography was good, so the movie does have one redeeming quality. I haven't tried watching the movie with the sound off... it might be somewhat watchable that way.If you want to see a war movie, skip this one. If you want to see an artsy movie, there are better ones. Any Kubrick movie comes to mind. Even "Eyes Wide Shut" scored lower on the agony meter than this piece of rubbish.**/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different from SPR</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I asked my grandfather who was an infantry sergeant part of the checkerboard division and fought both in the battle of the bulge and in the pacific and asked him which movie was better, Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line.He said SPR was more realistic to war sound and picture wise and what the soldiers went through, but it never showed the mental anguish the men suffered that TTRL portrayed. The Pacific was a different kind of war, fighting a determined enemy on unfamiliar ground. He had friends come out of guadalcanal that were never the same mentally and refuse to talk about their experiences. TTRL goes more into politics and mental thought. Sean Penn talks about how insignificant men were and that the whole war was about property. This is quite true when you look at the fact that we still have thousands of soldiers in the pacific and Japan protecting the empire of the USASPR showed War but it made it seem like it was something of an adventure and great heroics. TTRL showed what war mainly is, death, confusion, and horror.</fullReview>

And if you do, dont come in hereabusing it because you couldnt have a good time with it!!! This is aphilosophical movie, a thinking movie. Right from the beginningas the crocodile slowly sinks into the water you know this is notthe usual war kind of movie... this movie is kind of like a paintingin an art gallery - you see it, study it, think about it....

		<shortDescription>War is not about glory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing to learn from this movie, its that war is not pretty. Some have taken it upon themselves to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan-a motion, in my opinion, that makes absolutely no sense. If Saving Private Ryan is exemplifies the heroics and glory of war, this movie showed the pain, horror, courage and the madness of war. The numerous actors were probably not so brilliant in their performance but the idea of casting such major clean cut personas like Clooney (and others) in certain roles just seemed to underscore the madness of war when it is influenced so heavily on personal politics.Unfortunately any undulating praise for the movie ends there. I have not read the book so perhaps I do not appreciate the movie as much as I could-but does a person have to know the book to enjoy a movie? I don't think so. This movie suffered from the dreaded `Earnest Whisper' where throughout the film a whispered voice over would babble profound phrases that in many cases delve into the realm of death, God, chaos, and nature leaving the movie watcher puzzled as to what's going on. The movie therefore becomes not so much a war movie but more a mystical space in time where the viewer feels besmirched by this harsh reality.Usually I would really enjoy this type of poetic meanderings, but it severely slowed the pacing of the already long movie and many times these phrases just didn't impact me at all. Thank heavens I didn't see this in the movie theater or I would have fallen asleep-at least at home I had the luxury of writing down the scene number and coming back to the movie the next day!Apocalypse Now did a much better job of pacing and mysticism and it seemed to me that the crew for this movie was trying to reach that level of diving into the darkness. In their obvious trying they failed and we're left with a long, depressing mystical film that has some war shots. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated watching it but I'm not going to buy it. If you're into that type of flick, enjoy, if you would rather have a movie that goes somewhere, rent Apocalypse Now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a movie about the taking of Guadalcanal be so boring? The film takes about 30 minutes worth of interesting material and stretches it out over more than 2.5 hours. Potentially interesting characters are rendered impotent by the fact that they don't do ANYTHING - so how can you care what happens to them? - while others are only present long enough for you to go "wasn't that...?"By the end of the film I wanted to shoot Private Witt myself just to get him to stop remembering the (totally uninteresting) past.I give this film 2/10, for the twenty or so minutes where Captain Gaff (John Cusack) leads a team of men to take the bunker &amp; his conversation with Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) afterwards - it was the only point in the film where I felt any connection to the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully candid account of warfare and soldiers's internal struggles during WWII.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fail to understand the large amounts of negative criticism this film has recieved. Upon my fifth viewing of the film, which I find, though somewhat lengthy, to be a candid and beautiful depiction of the battle of Guadalcanal, as well as a unique illustration of soldiers's internal battles during warfare, I have decided that these criticisms can only be due to misunderstanding, lack of clarity regarding the film's depth perhaps, and impatience. Granted, The Thin Red Line is not a film for the casual observer. Many of its unique details-those in fact, which make it such an accurate and acutely moving depiction of warfare, are subtle. Yet, it portrays not only the true emotions that soldiers must face throughout their battles, but gives meaning to seemingly random action. Many viewers seem to have found the voice overs "corny", overly emotional, but these glimpses into the inner workings of the soldiers's minds are what create the true drama and meaning behind this work of art. If anyone has read Tim O'Brien's "The Things They cinematography (which in my opinion, adds significant value to the Carried," they become aware that each solder, whether in WWII or Vietnam, relies heavily on beliefs, memories, images of their former world, to survive. Nowhere have I seen this truth depicted so well as in The Thin Red Line. Though many complain of the film's plotlessness, its endless plotline, juxtaposing the extreme beauty of the South Pacific with horrific images of war and death), those viewers fail to capture the film's intricate subplots, and its acutely candid depiction of warfare. I must also add that Jim Caviezel's depiction of Private Witt is nothing short of astounding. Never have I seen an actor portray a character such as Witt's so believably, casting such naivety and beauty in his actions, making the character's haunting faith truly come alive.Negative critique of this film mystifies me. It remains,for me, an amazing and very truthful portrayal of the WWII generation, finally escaping the propagandic illustrations of patriotism and valor and illuminating the true horror and emotion involved in all warfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is one of those rare masterpeices that come along once every decade or so. I can honestly say that simply by watching this movie, you will gain the wisdom that would otherwise take many years to acquire. At the very least, you will leave the theatre a better person. Although this movie is set during World War 2 in the Pacific Theatre of operations, this is not a war movie. It explores the very humanistic side of every person. What drives us to do what we do? Why do we do it? Why does our soul hurt when war rages? These are some of the questions raised by the characters in the movie. Along with providing answers to these questions, this movie brings out the very best humanity has to offer. The soundtrack that accompanies the visually stunning cinematography is absolutely haunting. Micronesian choirs bring you a sound that is all but forgotten in our societies. It is a sound that each of us carries in our hearts, bringing out the pure innocence and love that war corrupts. As the famous quote goes- "Only the very young and the very old know best the song the angels sing." Watch this movie, buy the VHS or DVD, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic poetic yawn about guadalcanal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: cinematography, acting, directing, script.Cons: Dull, unrealistic action sequences.The Thin Red line tries to show the horrors of war using the poetic side. This is a good idea but it is executed rather badly because you have tough U.S soilders spewwing poetry as good as Lord Byron. This film is a masterpiece, because it is better than most of the films out there so it deserves some kudos trying to bring originality into our boring miserable lives, or that's what the director likes to think. It basically pay no respects to war veterans and is extremely anti-war. A film like Das Boot is anti-war but at least it pays respect to veterans by showing realistic submarine combat. The explosions in this movie look very fake and it glorifies a combat-dodger (James Cavaziel). Critics who think this movie is a classic either 1) have never seen combat in a war, or 2) too respectful of Mr Terrence Malick to actually tell him he made a bad movie. Look out for lots of cameos. Premise: Soilders and Captains ponder the significance of war.The Thin Red Line was nominated for seven Academy awards.Grade: 5/10 (Awful).</fullReview>

His adaptation of James Jones novel is excellent.The story of the battle for Guadalcanal has been told many times before but never as beautifully or as movingly. The characters are real people faced with incredible obstacles. They reflect on their roles in the war and try to understand the human need, it seems, for bloodshed.Many have criticized this movie because they did not think the thoughts of the characters were realistic. How are we to know what someone in that situation would be thinking.The cinematography, as in all Malick films, is top notch, as is the score.

This film is so much more. This is the first film I have seen from Malick and I must say he is an outstanding visionary. It is maginficently shot with its long sweeping shots and panoramic views. Expect a certain stillness and beautiful calmness to the cinematography, which complements the somewhat philosophical nature of the film. Do not expect the fast cutting, speeded camera of the MTV generation. Clearly Malick put his heart and soul into this film (his first for 20 years) to craft a profound, unforgettable and dreamlike piece of poetic art. Those who yearn something a little different, something with a little more intelligence will find that it is a film which resonates a sense of euphoria through the mind and soul.A confident 9/10 PS I think Nick Nolte is a poor mans Jack Nicolson - who would have been better for the role (if he was slimmer)</fullReview>

This film is a work of art. It is flawless and ingenious. The photography and music are impeccable - and the direction and story justify both completely.I have a feeling that the same reason others bash this film for being pretentious and boring, is the same reason Terrence Malick took a 20 year hiatus from film-making. Its a dying art form, but endlessly growing industry. His 2 films in the 70's (Badlands, and Days of Heaven) are equal testiments to a man who could have revolutionized film-making over the last two decades. I'm glad to see that there are a few others throughout these reviews who see this also.This film will be remembered.</fullReview>

Because it is deep !!! Now you will say : f*** you, this movie is not deep, it is boring...there are no principal character, useless cameo by Clooney or Travolta, etc...First you will agree with me that TTRL is different. Now most people are not accustom to see something different (because the Hollywood industry only produced pre-masticated consomation products (because that is what it is). So most of the people didn't like it because it was different , but also because it was too deep for them, so they didn't understand it!But what I would not mind to see in a review is : "This is a terrific movie, but I didn't like it, because I am too sentimental and ...

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is one of my least favorite war films (though there are only a handful I found to be worthwhile). But there is one good quality, which unfortunately is part of its downfall; and that quality is its ensemble of characters. The men here are guys you could get to know, and vividly portrayed. However, the film makes a critical mistake when going too deep into the personalities of these characters--they all seem to have a unanimous attitude towards war, and a similar emotional disfigurement because of it. The fact is, it is impossible to determine a general reaction (dare I use a made-up word "aftershock feeling") among a group of soldiers in war. You just can't guess, "Here, you all felt this way, right?", because it's usually wrong, not to mention naive. War affects each man and woman involved in a different way and, though two feelings about it may seem in the same vein, no two experiences are the same, whether you've served in the same platoon, squad, or not. I can't be sure if "The Thin Red Line" attempts to generalize a personal feeling intentionally or unintentionally, but whatever the situation, the film fails to bring any realism to its subject.</fullReview>

The film is just incredibly great from the first minute to the last.The film is so philosophical a piece of work that I dare say it is the most insightful movie that I have ever seen. Though having no protagonists, all 'main' characters are vividly delineated however short the time they were on the screen: Private Witt went AWOL and discovered an unpolluted world with people living peacefully together. After months of war, he returned to the village only to find himself totally foreign to that place, and eventually discover the dark side of his 'Utopia'. Captain Staros had a volition of protecting his men and refused to push them on to battlefields for certain death. Colonel Tall cared nothing about his men, and simply used them as a tool for his success so that he could forget all about his loss of his family. Private Bell had his wife as his only aim of his life; he wanted to stay changeless so that he could go back to his wife 'as the man he was before'...The film is so brightly illuminated by these stories, and just leaves you sobbing when the end titles roll. In fact, the film is not just about entertainment but it actually means something; it gives you philosophical simulation that you cannot just get from any films.So watch the film yourself, pals. Don't see Saving Private Ryan as everything. After all, the Oscar nominations it receives DO mean something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The battle for the vital island of Guadalcanal. If the American marines can take this strategic island they will have control of thousands of miles of air and sea territory! But first they must overcome the fierce enemy without - and the painful enemy within!Please don't compare this with Saving Private Ryan. Not if you think you have the first idea about cinema. This is a totally different style and mood and historically different environment of film. So don't make yourself look overly naive by making empty comparisons. Ta.The Thin Red Line is an occasionally moving, consistently tedious, curiously uninvolving, overlong and over earnest film which stands as a confusion of performance art video and action picture. The pithy score suggests a consistent profundity which is - ironically - battled against by a frighteningly flowery narrative and a plot which leaps far higher and more manically than the scores of possessed Japanese soldiers do when under close-arms attack! (E.g. Whatever happens to the limelight characters of John's: Savage and Cussack &amp; how did we get from that meaningless jungle camp to the vitally strategic airfield - &amp; many, many more...). The action scenes are handled solidly enough and the performances (before they disappear without explanation!) are uniformly (!) superb. (Nolte is spot on! But what happens to him...!!! Please!!!). But, all in all, this is an uneven mess of a film which constantly forgets where it's going; what it's trying to say and - most importantly of all - who it's trying to save. (Should we fight? Should we flight? Are animals better than us because they're not the warring type? Are the locals not the prime example of a perfect world in their constant summer bliss? Could northern hemisphere people live like that despite the fact that they live in frozen climbs and it's not as idyllic and as verdant and a search for more fertile territory might lead to... but no! This is about a war based on power and not survival so.. so.. how can I justify the constant close-ups of nature in peace. Because nature is peaceful. And universal. And if people don't agree with, erm.. OK. This, of course is not a perfect example of the entire world. But it's representative. Isn't it? I got a very good degree you know...). A case of: 'Why say one important thing clearly when you can attempt ten with little clarity?'. An unfortunate prognosis of a director who had what he thought was a good thing - and attempted to feed us far too much of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do the Oscars ever get it right ?????????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in the cinema when it first came out. Whilst I thought it was excellent ( Saving Private Who ? ) I never went back to it once it was on home rental. Until last night. I watched the film on DVD for the first time since the cinema and I was simply in awe.I found the film very non-linear when I saw it in the cinema. Its possible that watching it in the cinema you are simply carried by the visuals, by the performances, by the sound, and not by the actual story. However, sitting down to it a second time I realise that the film is perfectly linear. The story is well told, never rushed, the wide range of characters ( who all represent different perspectives of war ) are each given just enough time for you to emote with them, and by the end I was almost willing a nearly 3 hour film to have at least another 3 hours of the same for me.Visually, the film is remarkable ( as mentioned above, it can actually pull you away from the narrative if you let it ). Malick never lets you forget that the destruction and waste of war is taking place in amongst the beauty of nature.There are two many individual performances to go into ( and all are uniformly excellent ), but Jim Caveizel is a revelation. Most of his performance is done without words, but with his face, his eyes, his complete detachment from the chaos around him. Hollywood should have sat up and taken note. There is a real talent here. Alas, his most high profile work since was the cheesy " Frequency. " We live in hope.There is far too much in this film to compress it into a short review. If I gave time to one aspect, I would feel I had sold out another. Just sit down, take the phone out the wall, lock the door and tell your friends &amp; neighbours they will be in BIG trouble if they interupt you in the next three hours, and watch one of the best films of recent years.*** Footnote to the Acadamey: You are useless ! If ever a film was deserving of the big two ( Best Film / Best Director ) this was it. It was put in your lap, and you went for the melodrama of Saving Private Ryan ( which had a great opening 30 minutes, but after that......... come on ), and.....Im almost to embarrassed to say it....

		<fullReview>Perhaps one of the greatest films ever made. The camera moving through the grass, the yearning voice-overs, the haunting music... It is impossible to describe, and words cannot really do it justice. It has to be seen to be believed, as writer/director Terrence Malick takes his film to a spiritual level never before achieved in the history of cinema. (Near perfect, but not perfect. One drawback: a little too long, it could have been edited down a bit to improve pacing, but the film triumphs nonetheless.) A transcendent masterpiece. My vote? 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The war deletes humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good war film, well plaid and narrated. Differently from many movies that use violence only to earn at the box-office, in this work the main theme is the war that eliminate all of the better things of the human race, such as love in general. In this context, the horrible scenes and the cruel situations are shown in opposition with the soldiers' humanity of both battle arrays, who are men first of all. So, there's not free violence."The thin red line" is a good film for that. It is a masterpiece such as "Full metal jacket" and "Bridge on the river Kwai", better than "Platoon", "Apocalypse now" and "Paths of Glory" (of the great Kubrick!!). Nothing to do with "Saving Private Ryan"!</fullReview>

Thin Red Line has an impressive cast and was filmed beautifully. But most importantly, it has a good story. My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nature Vying With Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left the theater, after watching The Thin Red Line, in a completeDAZE. My mind was over-filled with the sights and sounds, eventhe smells, of a masterpiece of cinematic virtuosity unlike any I'dexperienced before. I walked home four miles in the bitter cold,completely unaware of anything out-side my own mind, my innerbeing, or the radiance of my renewed spirit.This movie is not for the person who is unaware of themselves, orhas NO desire to see a film about characters who are, or become,aware of the LIFE that surrounds them. It is a film about war. Twowars. The war within as well as with-out the human spirit. It isslow, deliberate, emotionally and narratively driven, visuallybreathtaking with each individual frame, and NOT about the gunsand bombs and machinations of war, but about the true "engines"that drive the men behind a war: the body, the mind, the heart, andthe soul. Inner-conflict over outer-resolution.Every performance by an actor in this film is mesmerizing, EVERYone. The orchestral score and Malaysian choir songs permeatethe ear and haunt the mind to the point that they brand themselvesinto the listener's very soul. Each scene, setting, shot, or frame offilm is rich with the colors, textures, weight and framing of thecontrasts between life and war. Every character's thought, gesture,line of dialogue, personal subplot, drop of sweat or blood, andcontribution to the over-all story-line, the very film itself, ringscompletely TRUE to the audience. And all of these elements,when combined, wash over the right viewer, filling every pore, everyfiber of their being, COMPLETELY. You WILL feel.There is a line in the film, delivered by James Caviezel, as PrivateWitt, in which he asks, "Why does nature vie with itself?" And inturn I ask (myself), how often do we look at a beautiful garden, amajestic forest, or even our own front lawn, and not see thestruggles for life being fought there everyday, and then reflectthose same struggles within ourselves, within our own growingspirits? We CHOOSE not to until thrown into battle, into war, or apersonal danger so immanent we are forced to. This is just onequestion that The Thin Red Line posed to me and dared me toanswer....... long after I'd left the theater.11/10 A beautiful and horrific masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have overveiwed the coments of this film and i am not suprised some people thought it boring.I love the movie!Most people here that said the movie to be bad or boring where probebly MAJOR action movie fans.This movie is simpley about a war being faught by people not by action hero's.It's about how they felt(the troops) about the war,what they missed,who they missed,fear of geting shot,scaring the crap out of themsels wondering if they would die or who would die even whos arms would they die in or would they die alone.Once you see the movie you think of what happens.if you go see it agin you pay attention to the people and what they think.Some people are so obsessed with bombs exploding and people dieing,geting shot and unreal hero posabillitys like rambo(i mean really how could 1 man take that many people down.?) that they forget that people are dieing.what if that person was drafted and they didn't belive in war.what if they had a family?How would you feel if it was you out there in the thin red line?Read the book you will understand the point James Jonse(writer of "the thin red line) is trying to send out.All of the charactors are well potrayed and acted.Matt doran was Awsome.It's not just about the war it's also about the people.

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this rubbish was nominated for Best Film alongside "Saving Private Ryan". It must have been good politicking because there is nothing to this film. Maybe the book was good, but I won't read it because the film was so disappointing. For a 3-hour war film, there certainly was not any battle scenes that typically make up successful war flicks. There was just artsy-fartsy dream sequences that go on and on and bore you to tears. Nick Nolte stands out however, so see it if you like him. All the other Hollywood names add nothing, and the main character is so bland I didn't care a whit about him. Check out the classic War films such as: "Cromwell", "Zulu", "Waterloo", "Braveheart", "Tora Tora Tora", "Charge of the Light Brigade", etc...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People do not like this movie because it isn't a story. There is no climax, there is no "plot." Instead it's simply reality. It's simply what really happened. Reality doesn't have the cute compact little story where everything falls into place along with the cliched "war is hell" bit of every other war movie.If you expect an nemesis, a problem and a climax you will be disappointed. If you truly want to know what war is about, and not that cutesy hollywood picture of war, where funningly enough, war is hell, but in the end, the "good guys" always win. Then you will be disappointed. The spiritual impact this film had on me is immense, never before have I thought so much about meaning, existence, why. it did more for me than any bible or any church ever did. It's like an amazing moving song, like No Woman, No Cry by Bob Marley, or Imagine by John Lennon, or Jerusalem by Masizakhe Christian Soldiers, or Amazing Grace. If you have attention deficit disorder, or are high on drugs do not watch this film, you will need every ounce of your mental strength to tackle the intellectual enormity of it. 11/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably superior to Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era where war film plots have become subordinate to effects, Terrence Malick has brought us a refreshing perspective on WWII. Set in Guadalcanal, Malick (and John Toll) initially give us a vision of Paradise, only to destroy it with the coming of battle. While I'll leave the rest of the plot alone, I just want to point out how much better of a film this was than its counterpart in 1998, Saving Private Ryan. WHile 'Ryan' is a good film, its character development, conflicts, camerawork, and overall plot are inferior to 'Red Line's'.First, Private Witt is one of the better characters to grace a movie in recent memory and the dichotomy of him and Welsh (played with great sneer by Sean Penn) sets up the conflict between Paradise and Earth. Witt, for all his foolishness in Welsh's eyes, is practically clairvoyant in that he gets it: he understands Paradise, where it is, and how it is lost. One of my favorite scenes is when he watches his own troops behave like animals and you can tell he's crushed inside because of its ugliness. This is just one example of how Malick's characters often play a bigger role than what they seem to at first. The conflicts in TTRL are wonderfully portrayed. Besides Welsh and Witt there is every man's conflict within himself (the Freudian id v. super-ego), best exemplified by Elias Koteas. Also, the viewer is never told what to think, unlike Private Ryan where Germans=Bad, Malick paints a more realistic picture, showing Japanese troops to be near the point of insanity and starvation, as though they too are victims of a much more catastrophic reality. Camerawork: John Toll and Malick create Paradise with the lens and this film is probably one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. And finally the overall plot in LIne is just better. Ryan is dependent on an ending, closure of some kind (the mission) but TTRL is never over much like its beginning is unclear, and you get the sense that the war will never be over in the minds of the characters. Also, it throws together Paradse Lost and the inner conflict of a Freudian type and mixes them to show how man can destroy himself as well as save himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't Saving Private Ryan, a "fun to watch action movie". Its not about a character, its not about a battle, its not about a love story. Its about the evil of man and war. Definately not a movie for simple-minded idiots. From some of the reviews I've read, I've come to the conclusion that a lot of people thought this was Saving Private Ryan part 2. This is the movie SPR wishes it could have been. Thats why so many big names are in it. Because its about something bigger than explosions and heroes. Its a very deep movie. If you don't have the patience or intelligence to understand it, don't even speak. On the other hand, if you want a beautiful, original, thought provoking, piece of art, watch this movie. Think about what its trying to say. Comparing this movie to Saving Private Ryan is like comparing Backstreet boys to Bob Dylan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand that a movie philosophical like this would not win much appreciation. However, I must say that 'The Thin Red Line' is a brilliant war film unparalleled. When compared with 'Saving Private Ryan', which was shown in the same year as Thin, 'The Thin Red Line' is of much higher standard, not only in terms of the story but also the meaning it carries. While 'Saving' stressed on war scenes, 'Thin' was flushed with insightful criticism on war. And the terror the soldiers faced was so vividly depicted that the time you finish the film, you will be left stunned and haunted - it may even make you hate war deeply or more deeply.For those who like silly films like 'Scary Movie' or 'Me, Myself and Irene', don't see it, and don't leave any negative comments for this film, as you think it is boring ONLY because you don't understand the underlying meanings and the ideas the film conveyed. 'The Thin Red Line' - the best film at its most compelling!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent World War II drama about the war inside and outside of a soldiers mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might be one of the best war movies I've ever seen. I love war movies, and look for war movies with tons of battle action. But the Thin Red Line is one of the best movies I've ever seen. After the fall of Hitler, the last side of the Axis was Japan, who were already building some of their Pacific Empire. The Allies now send in troops to reclaim the Pacific. The troops that were sent fights the war and the war inside them. The Thin Red Line shows the hauntingly realistic drama of the emotional breakdowns of the soldiers in World War II.However, there are still flaws in this movie. First of all, it is PRETTY BORING sometimes. Especially the first 30 minutes which nothing happens. The first 30 minutes is Shakespeare in Love compared to the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. Most of the movie is talk of how feelings change inside each soldiers minds, as they realize these Japs aren't killing because they want to, they kill because they are ordered to. This makes the movie pretty boring to action seeking viewers, so I recommend to those people to not watch this movie, because they will love to hate this movie. But I still liked it because I long to watch a movie with an accurate view of how the soldier thought during World War II.Another is the clothing and weapons are kind of inaccurate. Most of the World War II movies you see have clothing and weapons all nearly similar to each other. However, the Thin Red Line showed clothing and weapons nothing like others. Especially the Thompson Submachine gun, or it supposedly is. the little thing on the cannon could be a silencer but it looks weird. However, it isn't really much of a flaw.What p***es me off real bad is WHY IS GEORGE CLOONEY POSTED AS A MAJOR CHARACTER??!!! Hes in the movie for only 2 minutes! If Terrence Malick spent some million dollars of their $52 million budget to put George Clooney in the movie for 2 minutes and posting him as a major character, then he should have just said "GET THE F*** OUT OF MY STUDIO!"Anyway, the Thin Red Line is a good World War II movie with some good action and an excellent view of the soldier's mind in the war. It is my 2nd favorite war movie, 1st is Saving Private Ryan, for I do seek action in war movies.Give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crystalline, organically conceived film that depicts the unlikely and intolerant balance between nature, war and man .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Thin Red Line" director Terrence Mallick has chosen a well-known war novel by James Jones and given us a brilliant vision that combines the interaction of war and nature along with the thoughts and actions of man in a crystalline organic drama. This may sound verbose but much in the way Frank Lloyd Wright created his "organic architecture", a confluence of the site, native building materials and utilitarian form and structure that defined the style, Mallick has graced his audience with an amoebic creation containing the unlikely and intolerant elements of nature, war and man.Much of the criticism of the film's content and style seems to stem from the opinion that war movies must be realistic, faithful to historic review and in this case, loyal to the writings of the author of "The Thin Red Line", James Jones. Mallick is an artist of film-making and if this is the form we seeking to understand, it would appear that he has triumphed beyond the highest zenith of this time-honored genre.By contrasting the natural cinematic beauty of the landscape and people of Guadalcanal against the hellish realism of war, Mallick has successfully fused the emotions of, about and between men caught in this impossible situation with the use of narrative voice-overs, a technique he previously mastered in his two other films, "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven". With the main characters thoughts being shared and shaped gradually throughout the film, the actors and the audience experience the growth of emotions simultaneously. This can be viewed by skeptics as manipulative or it can be viewed as powerfully soulful and heartfelt while building magnificent character studies that transcend war itself. This is the risk and daring that sets Mallick apart from his more popular counterpart, Steven Spielberg and his sentimental saga, "Saving Private Ryan".The viewer must either jump aboard for this thrilling, gut-wrenching ride of insightful fulfillment or emotionally abandon ship in favor of the memory of logically safe and realistic dramas that are recognized as the hallmarks of our treasured war film library. I would suggest that most viewers seem to take the easy way out and reject Mallick's art as frivolous and ill-conceived. I would, however, recommend that you whole-heartedly sign on without turning back to experience Mallick's tour of brilliance. It's the only way to discover the true greatness of this war film and to be able to possibly consider it as one of the finest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If we Just show the world how soft we are, maybe they will all go soft too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being reluctant to go to war is universal. That is one way that we know not everyone is capable of bravery. This is part of what marks the hero as distinct from the ordinary man.Who amongst us does not agree that war is hell? We can safely consign those who do not think it a monsterous terror to the any number of of debilitating mental disorders.It is a common ritual for north american, and european males to denounce it. To be clear, this sort of wallpaper must be distinct from true sensitivity. True sensitivity involves an appreciation of colour, form, emotion, art the weather...etc. It permits one to imagine the feelings, and suffering of others. True sensitivity is what causes us to create.The sort that makes drunken boys declare war to be uncool at parties is to be mistrusted.We may forgive a man, or film director who in the name of getting some female attention goes a bit too soft. It is with this falsetto voice The Thin Red Line is narrated. Not that the movie does not have a sense of beauty. But, beauty is not truth. Nor, is it philosophy. Often it tugs at our hearts, while fogging our minds.The Thin Red Line has certain other problems. One is dialogue. Many times the soldiers's words do not strike one as belonging to 1945 mainly rural GIs.Their attitudes are contemporary, and lack the formality of the class, and rank divisions that were prevalent at the time. One simply did not mouth off to the "Top" Sgt, and expect nothing to come of it. The captain was not your buddy.Even the hairstyles are out of place. Either that or, this particular unit had a brigade of stylists and a vat of hair gel at their disposal.But, it is the little-boy-don't-wanna-go-to-war message that weighs it down most.Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad movie. I am on my 3rd viewing.But it is not a deep philosophical work, either.</fullReview>

Hans Zimmer's score was mesmerising and the actors have all performed splendidly.This film stands far above all war films in sublime supremacy. Comparing Private Ryan to it, is inane. SPR which is no doubt, a terrific film,isreplete with hackneyed melodrama and popcorn patriotism primarily to pander to the sentiments of mass audiences.The Thin Red Line is for the few people who have compassion, who love the earth, who still reason, who have humanity and a vision of the world beyond petty divides of race and nationality and those who cherish goodness and peace.It is for poets and philosophers and spiritual seekers.Its message cannot be grasped by the common herd and by those whose mental faculties lack compassion,an aesthetic sense and spiritual yearning for goodness.Its greatness ironically is proven by the crass and scurrilous criticism directed at it whether by critics or by many on this website. Those who lack the intellectual capacity to appreciate this masterpiece fulminate against the picture and its admirers,proving in the process that it is way beyond their mediocre mental and moral standard.The film is sheer magic and poetry, though at a terrible time.The photography of the jungle splendour interspersed with the terrible march of war is nothing but ethereal.The Thin Red Line deserved many Oscars.Mr. Mallick we salute your magnificient work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Number 2 of my All-Time Top Five War Flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... Behind only Apocalypse Now.This was just an outstanding film that I believe hit the big screen at an inopportune time. This one came out in the fall of 98, after Saving Private Ryan had torn apart the box office all that summer. For that reason, I fear that the two movies will be sewn together and compared to one another for longer than they should. This movie WAS NOT Saving Private Ryan. They dealt with very different, very specific issues about war.The Thin Red Line, unlike Spielberg's "war hero" epic, was more about the personal, specific struggles of the men in combat. It was much more clearly a novel adaptation, with a number of moving, introspective monologues. Whereas SPR made you *feel* the reality of being in the infantry, TRL moved you to tears with a glimpse inside the minds of the men and the boys.Terrence Malick brilliantly directed an intriguing ensemble which featured America's first real look at James Caviezel. The only thing I disliked about the casting was that some of the bigger-name actors appeared to be typecast (Nick Nolte, George Clooney come to mind right away). On par or perhaps even beyond the accomplishment of the director was that of cinematographer John Toll, who painted a very beautiful and very real picture of the South Pacific in WWII.If you, like me, consider yourself to be "war movie buff," you've probably already seen and enjoyed this picture. If you're just getting into them, you should definitely take a look at a film I'd consider to be not only one of the best, but one of the most important war movies of the last 20 years.ps - The rest of my Top Five War Movies? 1.

		<shortDescription>The best war movie not about war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit my war movie experience is somewhat limited, but I have seen the more recent films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Saving Private Ryan. I think for people out to compare this to Saving Private Ryan will be severely dissapointed: this is not an action movie. I would hesitate to even call it a war movie. The mere fact that a war takes place during this movie doesn't make it a war movie. The movie just uses war, more specifically, soldier's thoughts about war, to launch into an analysis of those things that make up the fibre of every human being. It's a very slow paced, philosophical movie, and like all movies of its type, if you're not in the mindset to watch it, you'll miss a lot of the intricate meanings behind it. If you do concentrate, you'll find an astonishing reward at the end.And for the record, I think this is better than Saving Private Ryan, although not as good as Apocalypse Now (which is also another war movie that doesn't concern itself much with realism or battle tactics yet succeeds).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is definitely not the most plentiful director. He hasn't been directed for 20 years. This is his third movie: Badlands (1973), Days of Heaven (1978) and now The Thin Red Line. The source is fantastic: James Jones' novel. The cinematography is superb (John Toll should have won an Academy Award) and the cast is fine. The film is full of major film stars, but they play only the small parts (John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack). They come and go and an hour later appear again somewhere among the stunts. You can't guess who will survive (Woody Harrelson dies very soon). And that's why 'The Thin Red Line' is a fantastic film. In war you can't guess who would survive. If someone makes a mistake, he dies. No matter how important person he is (like Woody). And your life depends on a second. And this second is the difference between life and death. After this second it is decided that you are a survivor or a hero. So, this film is the reality itself. Comparing with the 'Saving Private Ryan' it's definitely more sensitive, more understandable and more interested in the chaos of war and the people in war. To be honest, 'Saving Private Ryan' after the really fantastic opening scene continues as an average, usual and sentimental war movie. But in Malick's masterpiece the human brutality is set against the beauty and peace of nature. Those eye-popping, peaceful nature shots! And the unforgettable moment: the intruders meet the native islander. In my opinion that moment is the essence of the whole film and makes this movie one of best anti-war dramas of all time. I think only Stanley Kubrick's 'The Paths of Glory' (1957) can be compared to it. And don't forget the fantastic performance by Nick Nolte. MAD!!! (Nolte has been deserved an Oscar for a long time.) Very long movie but worth seeing. The most underrated movie of 1998 and the 90's. Should have won several Academy Awards, but 'Shakespeare in Love' and 'Saving Private Ryan' were the major successes of the year (unfortunately). It will become an all-time classic soon. That's for sure. A question: Will Mr. Malick wait 20 years again until he directs his fourth film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for thinkers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely brilliant. some of the reviews are very insightful and thoughtful, while others are mindless and weak. it is pretty easy to see that only people who enjoy being stimulated intellectually can appreciate this movie. most of the population just wants immediate gratification and constant action. if this is you, i'm sorry that you don't have the capacity to enjoy cinematic masterpieces. the thin red line was probably the best movie ever made. it is no private ryan, because private ryan was typical, predictable, and full of eye-candy action scenes. i'll admit that private ryan was entertaining, but did nothing to really stimulate emotions or deeper thoughts; the thin red line did. meatheads; go watch armageddon. thinkers; sit back relax and enjoy the best cinematic experience to date,CJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Case closed on the great debate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to a huge debate on the merits of TTRL and SPR which I think it absolutely ridiculous. To engage either film as a dramatist is a futile venture. While TTRL cannot be looked upon as a traditional movie, SPR fails at the very center of its dramatic intention. While TTRL trades in feeling and emotion, SPR trades in well-worn cliche and sentimentality. While TTRL is quiet and contemplative, SPR is loud and brash. While TTRL is profound and complex and thoughtful, SPR is simple and really has nothing truly new to say. The two movies simply cannot be compared so let's just stop this petty arguing just stop it. Clearly, as you might be able to tell, I think TTRL is a far superior film to SPR. TTRL may have been the best film of the late 90's, certainly one of the best of the past 20 years; SPR is just a flick that made a lot of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting and horrible bad and boring movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really sucks. One of the most boring movies ever. It is a war-movie without any action. The idea was probably to make a very weird movie that has no real beginning or end or plot so that critics would like it. It looks like it should have been an intellectuel non-comercial movie. But it is just terrible! And people who compare it with Saving Private Ryan are crazy. They both are about World War II and released in 1998 but that's it. Saving Private Ryan has some great action and is excellent to watch. Maybe the plot about the Ryan-brothers is a bit thin, but so what. The opening scene is briliant and so is the final fight. Do not watch The Thin Red Line, it's just horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film questions the destruction of our world, our humanity and the effects the war has on soldiers.The film's methodical approach is rather interesting. Look at the beauty that nature has given us, yet we decide to fight and kill our own existence. The film offers a lot, but you must be prepared to watch and listen. The film will reward you if you give it a chance, and I doubt very much that you'll understand it in the first viewing. Give it 2 or 3 chances. I've yet to understand all of the picture but I do think that the director wanted us to distinguish humanity and horror.The direction is stunning as is the photography. The jungle looks alive. It's one of the best looking pictures in recent years, amazing!The performances are excellent.The film doesn't have a strong plot, it's very poetic. There are flaws, I didn't think the picture featured a strong core and the screenplay could've been stronger in parts.Overall, a fascinating picture which requires a lot of attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I explain why I love this movie it will take pages. This movie is about life, love, death,...It tells you what's in the heart of every soldier during the war, it shows you that they still human beings despite of what they have to do. Terence Malik shows us the tiny spark of hope that still shine in the darkness of the human soul. The voices that we hear during the movie aren't from one character in particular, it is the humanity that is speaking, all the men are put together in one and same voice: the voice of life. This movie also shows us that the world goes on in the middle of the WWII. The pictures are a beautiful witness of how the nature, in all the meanings, survives under the killing machine (a WWII soldier). Terence Malik has done an excellent work and those who haven't understand they're really missing something!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie greatly. It looks absolutely gorgeous - those lingering landscape shots are almost indescribable. I am gushing a little, but the photography here is truly special. Hans Zimmer's haunting musical score fits the mood perfectly - I'd rate it on par with his work on Gladiator.As others have noted, this is a poetic, though-provoking movie. Some may describe it as boring - if you're looking for guns and action, go see Starship Troopers. Regarding the narrative, I'm fortunate enough never to have fought in battle, so I honestly can't say whether these soldiers' thoughts and feelings are 'realistic' or not. But the philosophical musings fit the mood of the film perfectly, and I'm glad they were included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did I miss something??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I may have missed something about this film. Some critics thought that this was a "Poetic Masterpiece". A movie once in a generation, something we can learn by. Some of these same critics would also say that Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo was a masterpiece too. So needless to say I don't have a whole lot of faith in what they say.I tended to find that this film was a bit boring. The first 10 minutes I was trying to figure out where the hell this movie was going to go, and once there I still couldn't figure out what was going on. All I could say about that first 10 minutes is that I wanted the narrator to shut the hell up cause his monotone voice was putting me to sleep. I thought that the acting was a bit overdone, and there was nothing there that was too gripping.For those who wonder why this movie did not win any awards was because the movie sucked, and the people who decides who wins the awards thought the same thing (well maybe not that it sucked, but because the other movies out there were better).I won't compare this film to Saving Private Ryan because that WAS a better movie and the awards it won proved it.</fullReview>

I was able to slow down and open my mind to the past pain of the soldiers in WWII and it made me feel apart of those wars that MY forefathers bled in.It told me that sometimes even heros feel lost and alone.I recomend that anyone with a brain watch this movie,those with half of one or none..I wouldn't watch this,just go torture your already smoking brain with"Saving Private IDEAT"!</fullReview>

He show us, not only the death and horror of war, but also the life who surrounds the soldiers and the hope of a better future. Where the hate comes from? Where the love come from? I'm not realized until today how much "Saving Private Ryan" sucks. That movie told _nothing_ about real war. Just and start scene and an end scene to show how "good" Spielberg is filming a battle, and in the middle, a lot of nonsense garbage. "The Thin Red Line" is really a war movie, i mean, THE war movie. No american propaganda, but a movie about the people who fighted in the WWII, their thoughts, hopes and lifes. All those things masterly shaped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly superior to Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saving Private Ryan got all the hype, received all the nominations and won all the awards yet somehow this masterpiece slipped through the net virtually undetected. This is a trip through the minds of a collection of increasingly desperate and maddening men as they fight for a hill on an island in the middle of nowhere. This is done cleverly as a voice over, a film making technique that can often be difficult to fit with the rest of the film. The director here submits a perfect example of how to use the voice over to your best advantage. The setting is beautiful and peaceful and yet manages to be both ugly and lethal as well. The acting from all corners of this massive cast is never less than impressive and judging by the number of minor roles filled by A list actors I'd say that it's a script a lot of actors wanted to get in on that a lot of Hollywood studios did not. Woody Harrelson is worthy of a particular mention in the minor role department. Nick Nolte is nothing short of excellent as the desperate commanding officer charged with a virtual suicide mission. Elias Koteas, Jim Caviezal, John C Reilly, John Cusack, etc... everyone excels in their parts helping to make this a far more human drama than Private Ryan could ever pretend to be. The camera angles are frequently chosen to place you as one of the men fighting for their lives making this an exhilarating watch, I only wish I'd seen it in a dark movie theatre and not at home on DVD.</fullReview>

Since I was watching a DVD, I saw the movie again in the original language, but this was even worse since the dubbing had taken out some of the shallowness of American patriotism.Unbelievable. A movie full of war-glorification. Hard to believe that US soldiers are either heroes or philosophers.The movie contains some fairly good acting, unfortunately completely wasted...Go and see "Life is beautiful" for a movie that combines bitter experience of Nazi crimes and war with well formulated and well expressed philosophy.This movie is not good at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having seen this film in the spring of 1999, it remains my favourite film of all time (that I have seen anyway).The acting in this movie is superb, a fine mix of new talent such as the wonderful Jim Caviezel, to the more established names of Sean Penn and Nick Nolte, providing cameo parts to other great actors, such as John Cusack, and George Clooney. The horror of what is going on around them, and the profound effect it is having on them is shown, not only in their lines, but in the way they say them, and the looks on their faces.Another part of this film that stands out, is the scores and chants put to the film by the ever amazing Hans Zimmer. To close your eyes during one of the many battles and hear the horrors through music is a powerful feeling.There is so much more I could say about this film, its imagery, directing, the way it shows the key battles on the way to Hill 210 and the Airfield. The emotion given out at the horror of it.This is definitely a film to buy on DVD, people say extras are light, but who cares, the film is the important bit, its only a shame the BBFC cut 6 minutes off the American version.</fullReview>

The movie goes into the soldiers mind and what he is thinking. I thought this movie was brilliant because the movie had great acting and the directing by Terence Malick was spectacular. This is Malick come back film from 20 years. Malick also directed Badlands and Days of Heaven.The acting in The Thin Red Line was also brilliant. There were many actors in the movie, I thought the best actor in the movie was James Cavietzel(Witt). I thought hi s role was great and he portrayed the character great. I thought this movie deserved the academy award nominations but its ashame it didn't win any. The Thin Red Line also had beautiful cinematography and setting.I recommend you see this great movie.

Unless you are in the mood for hours and hours of internal monologue while looking at waving sawgrass and a few explosions, avoid this movie. It appeals to the artsy types, from what I've seen, so if you aren't among that number, avoid this film, unless you suffer from insomnia. The LONG LONG LONG self reflections are enough to make a normal guy vomit. I wasn't impressed with the battle scenes either.

		<shortDescription>The Hero's Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficulties that show what men are. -Epictetus DiscoursesTerrence Malick's epic film TRL uses the WWII South Pacific battle at Guadalcanal to reveal the powerful interplay between emotional conflicts encountered by the human pysche. It is this harsh yet magnificently sublime backdrop where uninitiated young men struggle with the trials of FEAR, DESIRE, and SOCIAL DUTY that Transformation Consciousness.Malick meets this abstract challenge by employing poetic metaphors such as WATER (The Sea) representing the Unconscious mind and LAND representing the Conscious mind. The dynamics between the conscious and unconscious are revealed through the Hero's Adventure.EXAMPLES: PRIVATE WITT's TRANSFORMATION OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe Conflict --- Fear of Death Vs Social Duty to Serve ...the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - FDR First Inaugural AddressHow dreadful knowledge of the truth can be when there's no help in truth!-Sophoceles' Oedipus RexThe Hero's Adventure- Witt is a compassionate fellow who isn't interested in the war into which he was drafted, having gone AWOL several times. He isn't quite ready to face death. Yet he recognizes his pressing social duty to serve in the military system. He reflects on the last moments of his mother's death, fearing the death he saw in her, but intrigued by her "strange calm". What was her secret? How does one transform consciousness to achieve inner peace at the time of death? How does one get rid of fear, those overwhelming, unwelcome feelings emanating from one's "vestigial" limbic system, the crocodile brain? Can CONSCIOUS willpower triumph in a battle with this UNCONSCIOUS "crocodile"? Is everything in nature conflicted, pairs of opposites?The Symbolism of Water-- Witt comments to a Melanesian mother that the child she is holding looks tired. The Melanesian mother replies, " If he swims, he will sleep"--- This is NOT small talk; Instead, it cues the metaphor --- WATER in the film represents the UNCONSCIOUS MIND; afterall, we are unconscious when we sleep. (Hmm!)At this point we know why Malick began the film with a crocodile crawling into the water.... one topic of this film deals with the powerful, dangerous, primitive emotions of the human unconsciousness which reside in the reptilian remnants of our brains. Are we at their mercy? What happens when we fail to live out of our unconscious nature? Does War ensue?Witt gets the adventure he is ready for.....along comes a patrol ship scouting the waters..... and Witt allows himself to get caught. Metaphorically speaking, Witt and the patrol ship IS Jonah and the Whale. Witt's consciousness is about to be transformed through such an encounter. In the (brig) Belly of the Whale, Witt meets up with Welsh, his commanding officer. We hear a bell tolling.... how strange, in a ship?.... For Whom does this bell toll? Witt's back in the war as a stretcher bearer.Through the film we see Witt compassionately tending to the wounded, in one case pouring water over a soldier's head, as if to acknowledge his Baptism By Fire. It is through these acts of compassion that Witt experiences something quite unexpected.....a peek at beauty or radiance in death; a concept not obvious to the intellect but known only through the heart. Death is a necessary part of life---it is not to be rejected.Welsh advises Witt a couple times to just look out for himself; don't try to save anyone else. But surprise! -Welsh is NOT an egoist afterall. Later in the film, Welsh risks life and limb to deliver morphine to an agonizing soldier in the heat of battle. Why? Well, it isn't for a medal. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, suggests this heroism of a person risking everything for a total stranger occurs because in that instant, on an unconscious level, the hero recognizes that he and the stranger really are ONE. Hence we get implications throughout the film that although we appear as individuals, on a deeper, unconscious level we are One Spirit......a bit Buddhist. Furthermore, once we intuitively grasp this concept, our view of the world and how we behave in it, will change.Witt tries to crack Welsh's tightly clenched Ego with personal chats, getting him to OPEN UP; in their final talk, the open bird cage symbolizes the opening of one's ego to another. Welsh's cigarette (as well as flames, sparks or camp fires etc.elsewhere in the film) is employed to symbolize radiance, this bond of love and care. Welsh questions Witt's maverick style -- "Who you makin' trouble for today.......well, isn't that what you like to do, turn left when they say go right?"Welsh didn't understand that Witt accepted social duty, but only on Witt's terms---- by serving responsibly and with compassion, even for the supposed enemy.(Offering gum to Japanese soldiers) Witt would not let a System such as the Military deny his humanity. It takes a very evolved person to attain this level of interpersonal sophistication......a level not readily appreciated by the character, Tall, who lived his life according to "THE SYSTEM" which denied his humanity. (See corporate ladder climbers of today)Shortly later, Witt is surrounded by gun toting Japanese. After summing up his predicament, he CALMLY accepts his death. His consciousness had been transformed...... a hero, indeed......paid for with his life ..BUT NOT "HIS" END.... soon we see images of Witt swimming in Water... and children, the hint of reincarnation.... innocence reborn.Captain Staros is another hero who transcended his social duty to obey a command thereby saving his "sons" from almost certain death---he paid for it by losing his command, but he had been true to himself and protective of the men who relied on his direction. Water is again used metaphorically when Captain Staros leaves the soldiers to fly home. He says the soldiers will always be with him, where ever he goes... The film then shows soldiers jumping around in the ocean......i.e. Staros will always have memories of the soldiers.....memories stored in his unconscious mind.</fullReview>

Never has anyone dared to go so deep into the paradoxal coexistence of beauty within war, life within destruction .Although an all-star cast participated in this movie , all the credit goes to the awesome Terence Malick , who invested so much in this movie .This is the best "war" movie ever ; it makes Saving Private Ryan look like an ULTRA superficial , ULTRA imperialist waste of time (which it is ) . A perfect 10 .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had overlooked this film until I found out that Terrance Malick was the director. Since "Days of Heaven" is one of my all time favorite movies, I had to check this one out. Once again, Mr. Malick has created a spectacular work of art, not to mention an emotionally wrenching and intensely soulful depiction of aspects of war,love and human personalities. As with "Days of Heaven" the natural world around the human world plays an important part in the story. So much depth is conveyed (without script)just in the way this interaction has been filmed and edited. This movie is nothing less than spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Saving Private Ryan Last year A "BloodLust" fell upon Me like a plague. I thought the thin red line would be the same.So I convinced my dad to hire it.....167 mins later I thought What was that, that's the stupidest load of garbage I've ever seen. But the more I thought about it the more I liked it. So I convinced my dad to borrow it again for my sister who hadn't seen it, One hour through the movie she left, and there was I sitting alone in a darkened room with a movie I hardly even liked. Then came Witt's final moments the most brilliantly shot scene I have ever seen and I Cried My Heart Out. Never Have I been so affected by a movie. All Other War movies pale in comparison (except maybe glory). Alot of people say in this movie you don't get connected with the characters enough but Witt is just so Nice I don't see how you cant like him, thats why my e-mail is named after him. Well all I can say 1 year on, THIS IS MY FAVOURITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME.Over and Out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though there are some fine performances (especially from Ben Chaplin), I found this film rather boring and very manipulative. It is sad to say that with all the death in this film, the most wrenching moment for me was when Chaplin's character answered mail call. His and Koteas' characters were the only ones I cared about. I did like the use of the different narratives, but c'mon...did everyone who fought (and whose minds we were allowed to enter) have a Texan or southern drawl? Sometimes, it was difficult to distinguish between the actor's voices during narratives. Personally, I don't like a film that doesn't give me a sense of space. During battle scenes, I wasn't sure who was who and where everyone was. This can add to the feeling of what it is like to really fight in a war, but, to me (a simple viewer) it was only an annoyance.I also don't respond well to films which are obviously trying to convey messages, as this film did in its war/nature/death themes. Flashing to images of nature destroyed, nature beautiful in moments of chaos....the filmmakers tried too hard. It was overkill. Characters also seemed to "get lost" during the film. A character would be in a scene, have a dramatic moment, then I wouldn't see him again until 20 minutes (just an estimate) later. That's why I didn't care for many characters...I didn't get time to know them, even though I was in some of their heads! Some people like these kinds of "artsy" films; they're not my cup of cocoa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful movie, but not for short attention spans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems all the critics of this film cite "Saving Private Ryan" as being a superior war movie. Fine, but there's simply no sense in comparing the two. Yes, they're both WWII dramas and, yes, they were both released in 1998. But the similarities end there. In short, if you're in the mood for a quick glimpse into the horrors of war driven by a routine Hollywood storyline, rent "Saving Private Ryan." It's a fine little movie and wraps everything up neatly with a tidy, spoon-fed ending that drives the film's point home in case you didn't feel like thinking for yourself during the preceding 169 minutes. I don't mean that disrespectfully - lord knows I get tired of using my noggin about as often as anyone, and I thoroughly enjoyed "Saving Private Ryan." But if you're in a more thoughtful state of mind, or you're simply a fan of cerebral war movies ("Platoon," "Bridge On the River Kwai," "Apocalypse Now," for instance), then you'll likely enjoy "The Thin Red Line" at least as much, if not more than that probably overrated Tom Hanks/Matt Damon vehicle. "The Thin Red Line" is filled with superb acting, powerful imagery and some of the most beautiful cinematography I can remember. The story? Sure, it's thin, too - almost nonexistent, but that's beside the point. "The Thin Red Line" is not a movie that was made to be easily digested or fully, immediately understood. Rather it's something to _experience_, something that will engage your mind, provoke you, frustrate you, evade you and occasionally lead you to a rare, transcendent moment. Kind of like real life. No doubt, this is a challenging movie and not for the insensitive or casual moviegoer. But, for your own sake, pay no mind to the sad, Attention Deficit Disorder-afflicted detractors who say "The Thin Red Line" is dull and boring. Nothing could be further from the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film just blew me away. It had me captivated for three hours, which really shocked me.Don't get me wrong, it's not a flawless picture. It has too many characters and putting stars in small roles just so they can put their names on the poster is kind of annoying. But I am willing to forgive the film, for the poetic narrative and the beyond-all-superlative cinematography. For the performances of the lesser known actors. For the wonderful score. For the fact that it doesn't reek with repulsive patriotism like most other war films. And because it's almost three hours and I didn't get bored for one second.The film reminds of a lot of Coppola's masterpiece "Apocalypse Now", in that way in which it gives an almost dreamlike feel to war (and by that I mean it's like a surreal nightmare). It shows that there is NOTHING glamorous about war, and that no good can come from it.It's really hard to describe the film, it's a film that you have to experience to understand. But be forewarned that this film, like almost all good films, is NOT for everyone. If you think "Saving Private Ryan" was the best war film of all time, you'll hate this film, for it actually makes you think on your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spiritual quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful film with a spiritual quality that comes together like a requiem for those who died at war, not only at Guadalcanal, but in all wars. The contrast between horrific slaughter, terror and futility of war and the beauty of nature in this tropical paradise captured on film in thrilling close-up has tremendous emotional impact. The soliloquies of Witt (James Caviezel) bring one almost to tears, "Where do wars come from?" he asks. Two scenes are particularly memorable - one scene where the company of soldiers under heavy fire struggle up a hillside covered in ribbon grass to take a Japanese bunker on top of the hill - and another where three soldiers as an advance party wade up a river to seek out the exact position of approaching Japanese infantry. One gets the feeling, it's kill or get killed on both occasions. All the characters are well played, especially the portrayal of constant fear on their faces on their first combat duty, The make-up department does a wonderful job recreating the tired, dirty, sweating bodies of the soldiers as they push on through the tropical heat without adequate water supplies. The casualties, too, all bloodied and mutilated lying in the grass create an awful impact. Against all odds the commanding officer (Nick Nolte) drives the men forward though most question the wisdom of his commands and doubtful tactics. A great piece of acting here by Nick Nolte as the half-crazed obstinate officer. For me the most emotional scene in the whole film was where a soldier kept alive and active by thoughts of his loved one receives a letter from home. The message is devastating. There are no winners in war. The final scene where Witt is surrounded on every side by Japanese soldiers with guns raised is unforgettable as his steady gaze is directed down the barrel of a gun. No words are spoken, but we feel every second of this moment. Great drama. Great acting. I believe this is a well-constructed, well directed, well photographed film. Everyone should see it and learn from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT Saving Private Ryan.....Even Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start let me say that this movie is only for SERIOUS drama fans. The fact that the plot is thin is not the point. Saving Private Ryan explained the physical pain of war and scratched the surface of the emotional agony. The Thin Red Line dove deep into the mental torment and retrieved a film of horror, not beauty. Wonderful food for thought that includes excellent acting, a moving score (by the great Hanz Zimmer), and an incredible story of the real horrors of war. The Thin Red Line is not for people who want another shoot'em up war movie that makes you want to join the army right away; this is a continuation of 1998's WWII classics that exceeds the standards of Saving Private Ryan. Watch it and understand that movies are for thinking, not just entertainment. An intense characterization that is a 5 star masterpiece.</fullReview>

The most significiant point he succeeded is to be able to create a theatral atmosphere, which also stands as a courteous greeting to Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET. The Thin Red Line with its wordy meaning represents the border between smartness and madness; consequently all the characters stand on a critical line between Heaven and Hell... In my opinion, it simply is the best movie of 1998.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best movie about the Pacific Theater during WWII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is possibly the best movie anyone has made yet which shows what World War II in the Pacific Theater was like for those who actually fought there. Having recently read the book "With The Old Breed...at Peleliu and Okinawa," by E.B. Sledge, I wanted to watch TRL. However, I put off watching it because I heard from someone that it should have been named The Thin Red Plot Line. With The Old Breed told of some pretty disturbing scenes and battles in that portion of WWII. Watching TRL, I saw many of the elements noted in WTOB. I really feel that reading this book helped me to understand TRL better. Those who saw the movie and "don't get it" might want to read WTOB (or even the book which TRL is based on) to get a better understanding of this movie. The incredible scenery shots of plants, birds, etc, in the movie serve to remind the viewer that this beautiful view of life could be noted even in the midst of the madness of a battlefield and also that a soldier might not see it again at any moment. The fact that the movie does not seem to have a plot line from beginning to end is most likely due to the fact that this is actually what fighting a war was really like. Nothing made sense, nothing seemed in order and all seemed senseless. Hence the milieu feeling of this movie. War is like that.My grandfather fought at Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Okinawa, and other areas throughout the Pacific and he knows well what it was like to be there. He would be the first to agree that TRL shows what this portion of WWII was like and how realistic it's hectic milieu feeling is portrayed. If someone were to ask me to recommend one movie that portrays WWII in the Pacific Theater in the most realistic, true-to-life manner, I would recommend TRL without a doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is mesmorising...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realised at the start of the film that it was not going to be about a story of a group of people in a war, or even a story at all. The film transports you by way of a disembodied voice to a place where all the profound contradictions of life are brought to our attention. It asks questions which films rarely dare to ask. The film is not really about war, or what happened on a little island in the Pacific, but it is about us - humans. War is the perfect setting for this kind of pensive observation of a number of people reacting to several events, but Malick does not allow combat scenes or even a simple plot to rule the movie. It allows you to therefore observe what is happening to the characters, their emotions, questions, and relationships with others.The film confronts you with the raw nature of this earth. And it does not let up. I was still asking for more ... all the questions were left unanswered, left for us to ask, and find answers to (hopefully).The best touch of the film was linking the Japanese to the Americans, i.e. linking what we may consider the 'good guys' with the 'bad guys'. The enemy are not faceless, evil animals, but people. And this film says it better than any other. This may not be your kind of film, but if you are sick of the glitzy, superficial and unneccessary films which have engulfed today's cinemas, it is a breath of fresh air.If you are thinking of comparing it to Spielberg's film, please don't. This film is on a completely different (and higher) level, and has no intention of glorifying what happened in WWII. I give this film the highest recommendation I possibly could.</fullReview>

The film is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen along with The Last Emperor. But the film wasn't just all looks. The editing was great, the music effective, the actors convincing, and the voice overs and narrative structure were also a great rest from all those other cookie cutter films being pumped out of studios. Many people compared this film to Saving Private Ryan, but that's just flat out wrong. Sure the opening twenty minutes of the film were terrific but after that it was just war cliche after war cliche. I'm not saying the film was bad, it's just not as great as every one says it is.I recently saw the DVD version and it was the next best thing to seeing it in theaters. The transfer was the best yet of any DVD and the sound was awesome. I had seen the movie almost 4 times on VHS and this DVD is about a million times better. The only complaint I have about the disc is the lack extras, especially theatrical trailers! if you havn't seen this film yet don't listen to any of the negative comments you read. Trust me, this war film ranks right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, and Full Metal Jacket.</fullReview>

A step down when you've seen The Thin Red Line first. Some people expect from TRL, a sort of Saving Private Ryan 2...and many get of course disappointed because it doesn't contain as much action as SPR. They say it's too long and boring and so on. Well you can say it this way: The Thin Red Line is like all other art...you can love it or you can hate it. I love it.You have to understand the philosophy and the limitless fear the soldiers carry in their heads. If philosophy says nothing to you, TRL is nothing for you. Don't pick it for the action, pick it for the experience! I've never ever in my life experienced a movie where you can feel the fear of the soldiers on yourself so powerfully. It's made brilliantly, and especially Hans Zimmer's excellent filmmusics makes the movie worth seeing.This movie is truly of Oscar caliber and I'm so disappointed that the Spielberg guy went off with all the awards.

		<fullReview>I read this book. Along with The Bonfire of the Vanities, this is one of least successful film adaptations I can think of. The book's strength was the development of many characters - their inner fears, weaknesses, quirks &amp; complexities as they were forced through the cauldron of this experience.Terrence Malick seems to have tried to do too much with the book and lost his way. Character development and plot are totally lost. The movie wanders between disjointed voice over thoughts of various characters , largely a philosophical meditation, which provides some great visuals, but doesn't sustain a 170 minute movie. For me, there's a about 1/2 hour of footage here that is pretty cool to see on a big screen, but it's a failure as a movie.I recently saw a re-release of Badlands at a revival theater. I really like that movie. Malick's style, blending in a lot of visuals of character's physical environment, setting atmosphere, seems better suited to a film where there are only two characters and a more basic plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is with out a doubt the best film ever made. Terrance Malik has created the ultimate film of all time, there is not one single problem with this film it is straight A's all the way. The problem is people can't understand it, because they link it to Saving Private Ryan, (which was a good film, no doubt about it). But The Thin Red Line has everything Private Ryan didn't have plus a whole lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely beautiful--how can people NOT like this movie???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never understand why "Saving Private Ryan" is ranked so highly while "The Thin Red Line" is so underrated. I heard bad things about this movie before I saw it. Some people said it was boring, or too long. Yet, this is a movie that's just as long as "Saving Private Ryan". I guess what a director has to do in order for the general public to like a film is to throw in a lot of blood and gore, have a lame plot, and show the United States flag at the beginning and ending of the movie. Terrence Malick did none of those things with "The Thin Red Line", and that's why this film was not admired and respected the way it should've been. Also, this film was released in the same year as the overhyped "Saving Private Ryan". I could go on and on about the things that affected this movie's chances for success. Nevertheless, I was completely mesmerized while watching this film. I was basically glued to the screen. This is the first war movie I personally have seen where you truly witness the psychological aspect of war, beyond the typical cliche of seeing a soldier about to go into combat and his main thought is: "oh, I'm so nervous!" or "I'm gonna die, I just know it!" The soldiers in this film question the validity of life and death, and wonder if killing the enemy has improved their own lives. This film shows that soldiers in combat situations have more than just mechanical thoughts. Some comments have been made about the many symbols and metaphors that can be seen in this movie. I really didn't focus on that, but what I can say about the visuals is that the cinematography was astonishing. Beautiful use of colors, particularly of the color green. Also, the score was magnificent. And, of course, I was impressed by the performances, which were both natural and touching. This movie, to me, was a remarkable movie, and I will not forget it. I consider "The Thin Red Line" to be one of the greatest war movies I have seen. I cannot believe that notable movies like "The Thin Red Line", "Titanic", "The Color Purple" and "Casino" are not even on the IMDB Top 250 films, while ridiculous movies like "Fargo", "Blade Runner", "South Park", and "Shakespeare in Love" are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly remarkable assault on the senses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line," is a stunning film which enriches the viewer through its remarkable assault on the eyes, ears, and mind. Filled with breathtaking cinematography and powerful music, this film forgoes traditional "plot" in favor of lyricism. Essentially this is poetry that is not written but seen and heard. Malick is known for his two previous films, "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven." This is his first film in 20 years. It takes place in World War 2 in Guadalcanal, but its focus and its point is not on the mechanics of war, but of man's place in nature, and his struggle to find meaning on earth. The film is filled with voice-overs of soldiers struggling with thier innermost thoughts and the dialogue is filled with philosophical musings. It is a movie that, if you have any poetic bone in your body, will stick with you long after you see it. Those expecting an action-packed traditional war film should steer clear of it. This is a difficult, unique, powerful, poetic and brilliant motion picture. That enough adjectives for you? Turn all the lights off, turn the sound up, rent the widescreen version if you can, and watch it with a good sound system. Sit back and let this film envelop you. And if possible, see this film in the theater, because if any film was meant to be seen on the silver screen and not the boob-tube then is it!!! 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the kind of movie that Hollywood loves because they think it's DEEP.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was b-a-d. I can see why the movie industry liked this movie -- it was full of symbolism which makes them feel smart and sophisticated if they "get it." But showing a worm eaten leaf as someone dies from a gun shot wound is not deep, it's out of place. If they were going to show it the camera should have panned or zoomed in on it, not cut to it and back.Then there was the fact that you could hear the soldiers' thoughts which were all flowery drivel. I know no men who think in flowery prose. If one character thought that way they might have pulled it off but not all of them. Give me a break. Oh this movie was deep all right--give me a shovel.Now lets get to the story line---whoops there wasn't one. So much for that.There was also anachronisms such as WWII soldiers wearing Viet Nam era jungle boots and use of WWI era .303 Enfield Rifles and one soldier was using a M1 carbine which was only used in training issued to paratroopers. Let's get it right folks. DUH! And why would they bury someone in the field? If they were able to send someone to a field hospital they obviously were not so cut off that they could not retrieve the body and send it home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIN RED LINE/ SEE WORKS BY JOSEPH CAMPBELL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Cinematic masterpiece using a war setting to portray the human condition.CAUTION: THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS REVEAL CRITICAL SYMBOLISM WHICH THE READER MAY NOT WISH TO KNOW PRIOR TO VIEWING THE FILM.THUMBS UP---TRL is a film about you. It is not a War film although it effectively uses this extreme setting to portray the state of the "Human Condition". Specifically, TRL ponders DUALISM (Pairs of Opposites or Dimensions) which, congruent with quantum physics, seems to be the basis of reality. The character, Pvt. Witt, discovers that a deep understanding of these unavoidable pairs of opposites changes the way one reacts to adversity. He shares these insights via a monologue scattered throughout the film.THUMBS DOWN?--This film IS NOT a work of PROSE , where water is water and a crocodile is a reptile. It is a POETIC work, where WATER is universally symbolic for the UNCONSCIOUS mind and the crocodile is symbolic for our deep dynamic set of primitive human emotions. These savage emotions are often difficult to control because they are rooted in the unconscious. Hence, the intro to the film....a crocodile crawling into water with an ominous musical background, conveying the topic of the film and setting a serious tone. If symbolism is not recognized, the movie can be boring...the film has no real plot. In this sense, it is like a magnificent painting in a museum. The producer also uses other unfamiliar devices such as showing soldiers with similar features in quick shots. This doesn't allow the viewer to know which actor it is!---I suspect this is to encourage you NOT to form attachments (another Buddhist theme) and coaxes you to generalize what is happening to anyone. Remember, this film is about you! Viewer complaints about this movie device is ironically a subject of the film--Attachment!! :-)Buddhism is strongly threaded through this film. TRL uses Buddhism's 3 TEMPTATIONS and these are as follows:#1 LUST (for gold/money, territory without regard to consequences to others etc.)#2 FEAR (of death, pain, suffering, or loss etc.), and#3 SOCIAL DUTY (basically doing what you are told by authority; mindless living; allowing others to direct your decisions instead of following your own truths)THE FILM'S MAIN SYMBOLISM:WATER - The UnconsciousCROCODILE- clearly refer to DRAGONS". In European mythology, the dragon represents GREED for territory, property/food etc., hence the term, "slaying your dragons." Later in the film we see the powerful crocodile tethered on land after soldiers learn and gain a new appreciation about the ugly dynamics of war--get it?CHILDREN - Innocence. In the film, we see what exposure to conflict between people does to children -it changes the openness to others.BIRDS - extensively and superbly used in this film.Hawks- represents alertness to opportunity. (Ready to pounce on you).New Hatchling on the war field -Depicts the fearless BECOMING of life (another Buddhist term), as fragile as it may be, despite adversity-- like grass growing between the cracks in the sidewalk.Vultures- Opportunists of death or misfortune (As an allied soldier collects fillings from the mouths of dead Japanese soldiers- greed)Birdcage - Limitation (The binding of your ego) Later in the film, the birdcage door is open -- Witt's deep understanding of reality, the one flame in each person is part of the larger whole (Buddhism again), has freed his spirit. It also represents the openness of the conversation at hand.Bat--represents death. It's black wings enclose it's body like a coffin.Multicolored Birds--In standard mythology, Prometheus stole fire (power, higher consciousness) from the Gods and gave it to man. Birds flew away with the fire, passing it along to other birds. The fire burned their feathers which accounts for the different coloration of birds we see today.COCONUT TREE - the coconuts in vegetative cultures often were seen as human heads, as the nodules on their surfaces simulated human facial features.BLACK HANDS/WHITE FINGERNAILS - Witt joyously recognizes that we all have the same origin...we are all 'Brothers' in this sense. Witt's tear seems to acknowledge that racism continues to flourish because of ignorance.THE FILM'S PROFOUND MESSAGEMy interpretation of the film's message is largely Buddhist: The Parts and the Whole are ONE- "Maybe all men have one big soul"Death is the paired opposite of Life and we must affirm both --"The other man sees the dying bird and feels the glory"Free yourself from social duty but if you are forced into it, act responsibly on your terms (Witt offering a piece of gum to the Japanese prisoners) (Staros refusing orders from Lt. Col. Gordon Tall) (Witt going AWOL)("Why are you such a trouble maker, Witt? Isn't that what you like to do...turn left when they say go right?")The film hints at a 'Thou' feeling of life when we no longer believe in God; instead, we KNOW God.----See works by Carl Jung. Much of the film's symbolism can be found in a work by Joseph Campbell' The Power of Myth' video series -6 videocassette - Viewing this work may dramatically enrich your appreciation of 'Thin Red Line' .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-war masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot of things about Terrence Malick and I had already seen 'BADLANDS' and been impressed, before visiting the theatre to see 'THE THIN RED LINE'. When I came out of the theatre I was in the same lethargic situation with the soldiers in the movie. I was astonished and that very rarely happens to me. I decided to go and see it again, and that's what I did the day after. And now, six months later I want to experience it again. 'THE THIN RED LINE' isn't a war film. It's every man's attempt to feel the humanity and the kindness under the most terrible circumstances. Terry Malick's adaptation of James Jones' novel is extraordinary, as he adds to the plot the Melanesians' pristine and peaceful environment before the forces of horror come to destroy it. It also describes, the bonds that develop between men fighting together; their feelings and emotions for each other, even for the enemy. Terrence Malick wrote a wonderful screenplay, based on a first-rate, realistic and autobiographical story and his directing work is, at least, great. The ensemble cast is excellent, as excellent are the cinematography, the score, the editing and the sound of the movie. I'll never forget words like: "Property. The hole thing's about property", "Maybe all men got one big soul everybody's part of, all faces are the same man" or " Do you ever feel lonely?', 'Only when I'm around people." I want to mention that I was a soldier in the army for eighteen months and I lived a couple of things that were similar to this movie; things like the never-ending waiting for the training to start, sitting on the ground wondering what I am doing there and being haunted by thoughts about my personal life, or the thing that I made great friends there and the fact that my Captain who, unlike lots of superior officers that cared only for their careers, used to care about the Privates like Captain Stain/Staros did. Of course, I've never experienced a battle, I hope that I never will and no-one will ever experience something like that. I want to thank Mr. Malick for making this masterpiece and giving us the pleasure, to experience it. I'm looking forward for his latest film, 'THE MOVIEGOER'.</fullReview>

It's like a greek tragedy of the 20th century, Malick like a modern Sophocles. It's not a film on war, it's a film on the man's existence, his deepest emotions, his fears, his passions, his moral, ethical and theological questions. In short I never was so touched and impressed, not even reading Shakespeare's poems, or listening to Mozart's symphonies, or admiring Venice at night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I was watching this movie in a theatre, my friend leaned over to me and said " what do you think of this?" I said "well its no private ryan" And he said "thats for damn sure!"First off, the battle sequences pale in comparison to to Private Ryan. I didnt feel any excitement at all.Secondly, the narration was horrible. Soldiers dont think about that stuff. At least not on the front line. They think about whats going to happen next - am i gonna live or die, am i gonna find a good place to sleep tonight. You never hear any of that garbage in saving private ryan. Thats because they are real characters. They talk like real ordinary people. The thin red line is like a big shakespearian play.Third - The acting was terrible. The only good performance in the movie was nick nolte. The cameos were rubbish. In saving private ryan ALL of the performances are excellent. You wont find a shred of lousy acting in that movie.Fourth - Both movies are roughly equal in length - 2:50 min. So why does the thin red line feel like its 10 hours long!!!!!! It just drags on and on. Theres no damned plot!!The only good thig about this movie was the cinematography. But private ryans was still much better.I dont see any genius in the thin red line because there is none. Steven Spielberg is a true genius. Thats why saving private ryan is what it is. Terrance malick is not a genius. That is why the thin red line is what it is.Need I say more??? I dont think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tripe. Utter tripe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It illustrates most effectively the "Steve Martin" syndrome - that is, the syndrome Mr. Martin complained about when he became so famous that all he had to do was stand on stage to get laughs. That's Mr. Malick's problem - everyone has heard what a great "artist" he is, so it is accepted almost without question that any odiferous utterance he emanates will be "art". So if "The Thin Red Line" does anything well, it illustrates how fatally misleading it can be for one to trust the image of a director.The only thing this movie gives the viewer is a sore behind. The "poetic" and "lyrical" thoughts on war are flagrantly and painfully un-original (You will actually cringe when one of the characters says, as the music swells, "Have you ever had a man die in your arms?" How many times has _that_ line been used? How can you expect anyone to gain anything new out of such a tired cliche?). The inarticulate and painfully sophomoric "inner thoughts" of the tired soldiers are painful to listen to, and the action scenes are missing a key ingredient - namely, the action. What we end up with is a furious muddle of bleeding-heart sophistries thrown up on the screen as if they are the king's wisdom, as if Malick has discovered something new. I can just see him running down the street promoting the film - "Hey, war is really bad!" Wow, thanks Mr. Artist, we didn't know that already!The most painful thing about this movie isn't that it's awful. There have been many awful movies before. The most painful thing is watching the faux-intellectuals attempt to defend it, invoking phrases like "It eschews the paradigms of modern cinema". Well, if you consider "entertainment" to be one of the paradigms of modern cinema worth eschewing, I suggest you get a sturdy cushion and rent "The Thin Red Line".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war films of all time...Saving Pvt. who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a film that I looked forward to after seeing the first trailers for it. In the aftermath of the Saving Pvt. Ryan fiasco, this film was left to die in the dust. Although, many missed a truly magic movie about life and war. Frankly, the story does have some ruff spots, but with the top notch acting and beautiful scenery, this film really shines. Unfortunately it has to be compared to Pvt. Ryan. since the films were released months between each other. The main differences between the two are clearly obvious, if you have much of an open mind about these entirely different films. Thin Red Line has substance and glory within it's tomb, while the wonderfuly filmed, yet drab Pvt. Ryan has little story and is mostly praised on it's Normandy war scene (which pails in comparison to the end battle which is much more powerful and exciting). TRL doesn't base it's innards on fighting and gunfire. While there are some scenes where battles ensue, a bulk of the film is told with heart and feeling of the highlighted soldiers. The acting from the many of high profile stars ignites the screen with a lasting presence. I only wish many of the parts of this film wern't cut, even though it would push the running time to almost 5 hours, it would have been nice to see the whole of George Clooney's part and not the 5 mins that was rewarded to him. It was sad to see this movie lost the Oscar race to Pvt. Ryan and Shakspeare in Love (though a good film). But thankfuly we can always enjoy this film on video and hopefully DVD, when it comes out. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Perhaps this is a bit of cliche, but this is truly a movie about people.Terrence Malick's direction is superb, John Toll's cinematography is probably the best I have ever seen in any movie and Hans Zimmer's score is simply unbelievable.In one notable scene when the soldiers are moving through the tall grass heading into battle, you know that at any moment the enemy will open fire, but you don't know when. Malick moves the camera through this grass at the same eye level as the soldiers and prolongs the appearance of the enemy, making this one of the most excruciating scenes I have ever experienced as an audience member.Excellent performances across the board, with Sean Penn in particular standing out. Though why John Travolta, John Cusack and George Clooney needed to be in this movie I don't quite know.I strongly recommend this film. See the movie and definitely buy the score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually read other people comments before I posted mine. It seemed that many people don't like this movie for various reasons. It is perfect fine that people have different opinions.But for those who said *it's terrible movie*, *don't see it!* because they didn't finish the movie or fast-forward through it. It seems irresponsible.The joy of this film is in the process of watching ; Not the story (there is not much plot), not the acting (the actors are just part of prop for the film). I regretted that I didn't get to see this movie on the big screen. (I saw Saving Private Ryan first and did not feel like watching two war films in a row). What a wonderful film experience would it be. It amazes me that two such high quality and different war films were produced in the same year to compete with each other. (different from each other, also from any other war films were made before)All the flaws being said about this film are true: such as overdone, didn't end where it is supposed to end and kept going and going. Those famous movie actors served no purpose to the film but distraction?.But it is such a beautiful and personal film. The director was so truthful to how he wants the film being done. Although I agree that Saving Private Ryan is a much complete and skillful film, there is something about the Thin Red Line surpass the other one in a very artistic and quiet way which can only be *felt*. There is particular one scene at the end where the American soldier was chased by Japanese in the woods, came to stop, long pause (yes, more lush rain forest and innocent wild life to contrast what is going to happen), then the gun went off, and camera jumped into under water scene with the native islanders' singing in the far distance. The execution of that sequence just took my breath away. I will always remember it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend The Thin Red Line, however, while I think it is worth seeing, it has several flaws that should be noted. The movie is too long. Simply put, this epic seems to go on and on like the Energizer Bunny. The characters were developed well enough but I found myself not caring about them. The narration was hard to understand in content and the flash-backs didn't really seem to add to the films overall objective. The photography was stunning and the battle scenes realistic, but you are going to be getting up several times in this movie to do whatever just from sitting too long. Again, I recommend it but don't expect it to be another Saving Private Ryan experience. One thing though it does have in common with Saving Private Ryan. It does not glorify war but rather shows soldiers facing fear as they come up against overwhelming odds in battle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It seems to arouse the most violent emotions, either for it or against it. Personally, I see it as one of the most impressive movies ever. The range and intensity of emotions evoked by the experience of watching this movie is incredible. Mallick is a movie-making genius. It is truly like nothing else I have ever seen. Like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption and a few others, it leaves an indelible mark on the viewer, one that lasts far after the initial viewing.It is unfortunate that this film was released so soon after Saving Private Ryan (which is another great film, though not to my mind on the level of The Thin Red Line), because the comparisons become unavoidable. However, the movies are very different, except for their subject matter. Perhaps the impact that SPR had on audiences made them unreceptive to another war movie, but I don't think that adequately explains the largely negative reception TRL received. I can't explain this reaction, nor why TRL was not awarded a single Oscar, even though it was a far superior movie to anything else that was running against it.The brilliant non-linear narrative of TRL may also have something to do with it, which may be confusing to some viewers. However, if you are willing to look beyond the typical constraints imposed on most movies by unimaginative directors and commercial demands, what you get is a motion picture that is truly unique. It offers insights not only into war but into human nature itself. This is The Thin Red Line. The movie's use of voice-overs and repeated forays into scenes that don't flow like most Hollywood films has been called boring and obtrusive. I found it to be a wonderful technique that is much more along the lines of how the human mind operates. Memory, emotion and experience are conveyed in a way that is probably impossible in the traditional structures of Hollywood movie-making.To put in one way, after viewing both TRL and SPR, I had the feeling that while SPR re-invented the war movie, TRL re-invented the movie itself. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone. Rating: 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. Had this been released a year BEFORE "Saving Private Ryan", there would not have been the inevitable comparisons, of course. In a decade, the timing of the two movies will no longer have any bearing on how they are viewed.2. To say that they are both WWII movies is correct on the surface, but that's like saying Monet and Picasso were both painters. WWII was a vast event and had many levels and components. "Ryan", for example, gave the impression that the war was non stop combat, because it took place over three or four critical days in the European theater.3. WWII was a bizarre event, to say the least. While Europe was being devastated, America stood on the sidelines, perhaps compelled by its isolationist policies. The attack on Pearl Harbor was, of course, carried out by the Japanese, whose war had only marginal connections to that of Germany in the West. [What would Hitler, the ultimate ethnic cleanser, done with the Japanese, if we had lost the war?] We could not declare war in the Pacific without also doing so in Europe. Once in the war, America found itself fighting two different cultures. We understood what was going on in Europe, since most of us originated from there. The East was a society that, if not unknown to us, was certainly not understood.I mention these things because the war in the Pacific was, by nature, more surreal and dream-like than it was in Europe. I think Malick captured the tone of the event there just as well as Spielberg did in "Ryan". This may be much of the reason why audiences were uncomfortable the "Thin Red Line". That area of the world is still exotic to many people here.4. I completely disagree with those who wrote that these "uneducated" soldiers could not have so many philosophical thoughts. The questions asked were pretty basic for anyone could up in such a terrifying and life threatening situation. Through body language, Melick implied that their Japanese counterparts were also thinking the same thoughts. EVERY character was not philosophical. The complaints about this aspect are, I assume, being made by people who know war only as something CNN and other networks occasionally bring to us for our entertainment.There seemed to be a technical problem, however. Listening to the film on my Dolby digital system, I noted that the other sounds were never muted, making it difficult to understand much of the narration. Several times I had to rewind the video to decipher these passages.5. I was especially impressed by the discordant music by Hans Zimmer. As much as I appreciate SOME of the work of John Willams, I should imagine that the average soldier in combat does not hear stirring anthems in his head.6. TTRL is not a paint by numbers or connect the dots production, which is why I found it to be so powerful. For me, I had to work to understand some of it. In the process, I became involved, which made it a very powerful movie.</fullReview>

Truly a great film, reminiscent of 2001 and the novel Grapes of Wrath. An absolutely extraordinary experience in a darkened theater. The score is superb, the dialogue and acting perfect. The narration may seem awkward at first, but you need to listen to what's being said to understand the movie. Like Pvt. Ryan, the movie deals with decency in the face of death and the beauties and horrors of life, just minus the hokey jokes and rather inappropriate reassuring flag waving of Speilberg's monument. The film is under appreciated for it's length and daring. It transcends all typical narrative and structure of storytelling, but it NEEDS to be listened to. Those who claim its philosophies are BS need to listen to it. What it says is true and part of what we are as human beings. The movie illustrates beautifully what heaven and earth mean to us all. As for the overuse of eastern philosophy-there isn't any. Death and what it means and possibly begats is one of the film's many themes, and all bases are covered. There is even a Christ-like character, much like Jim Casey and Tom Joad in Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. The movie doesn't shock us the way 'Ryan did, but that's not what it wants to do. Terrence Malick want's us to think about what warfare does, what we are between 'heaven' and earth, and what death means to men facing it. This is a film maker's art, his expression. You don't need to like it, but you need to respect it. Me- I love it more than any other film, and it deserves more than its gotten. It is well paced, its characters well rounded, it execution beautiful, its ideas lovingly expressed, its editing crisp and rather provokative, and its narrative is different, original and ultimately rewarding. It deals with eternal themes in a new way, and it enthrawled me. Combat was shown frankly violent and gut wrenching. There is love, there is hate, fear, anger, greed, insanity, power, ideas (rare these days), and ultimate beauty. Terrence Malick is a brilliant artist, making HIS films in HIS own unique style, a style that is fresh and ultimately his own. Film is artwork. Malick is the truest artist I have seen working in this medium. This movie is a milestone in film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick a master of poetic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What sets film apart from other media is that it uses moving images to tell a story. Terrence Malick, however, expands film's capabilities by using it to tell multiple sides to one story plus emotion and response in the briefest of moments, continually throughout a masterpiece of a film. This gorgeous commentary on the depth of any human being and the purpose for which life exists is not for the movie-goer who wants to sit back and be entertained. This is a film, not a movie. It is for the serious connoisseur of the art. Many thanks to Mr. Malick for having renewed my faith in the industry. Here's a great example of a film with meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A war movie about people in War, not about battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad to have finally seen this movie at last! To be honest, I was quite confused in the beginning and did get bored, but after about 30 somewhat minutes I was finally able to catch up with the movie.After seeing the movie, I have the feeling that this movie is not really about war, but rather about how people react in war, particularly those on the front line;how they experience life,death, fear, separation, love, friendship, hatred...etc. And this is how the movie capture my mind. I wish I could have seen it on video and then see it in theater, just because the movie does take a while for me to catch on and without the remote control of rewind, I don't know how am I going to achieve it.One more complain(sort of, though I understand the director must be under pressure to use some big name movie stars in this movie)---individual characters in this movie doesn't seem to matter in this movie--so I felt it is a bit of a waste to use excellent actors for roles that only last a few moment-also, you do wonder what happen to them, especially if you happen to recognize most of them; say, what happen to the John Cuscak character after the middle of the movie; or who is George Clooney really playing in the movie?Anyway this is still a very good and heartfelt movie.

		<shortDescription>For the birds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 points out of 10Birds tie this story together. The caged bird singing beautifully in Witt's dying mother's bedroom. The bird cage, now broken and empty, that the destroyed Japanese battalion had kept, showing that they, too, loved life. The owl that watches the Japanese soldiers appear magically from the woods to kill Witt. The toucans that stand and watch, the vultures that wait for soldiers to die, the seagulls that Malick shows whenever the beautiful palm trees sway. The bats, ironically, similar to birds but symbolic of death, that wrap themselves in their leathery wings, like body bags, just before Witt knowingly gets himself killed. The love birds at the end who survive. And, last, but not least, Sargeant Welsh's reference to the dying bird as he speaks of Witt's love for life.Symbolically, metaphorically, it is on par with Citizen Kane. Spiritually, it is the best movie out there. The message is clear. "You can keep your innocence, and, although your innocence won't spare you from suffering, it will make the world heavenly when you're not suffering." The Japanese face in the ground and Welsh's bird soliloquy say it all.This movie has changed my life. But it is a new age, conscientious version of the book. Last night I watched the movie 3 times. Today I checked the book out of the library.There are no references yet to birds! I'm on page 40 something, and the only characters that clearly made it into the movie are Captain Staros (Stein), Welsh (Welsh), and Fife (Bell) and Doll (Doll). Well, the book has 430 pages, and I did notice that Witt shows up later. But there is no incidence of going AWOL at the beginning.I think I'm going to suggest I compare/contrast the book with the movie as my final project for my cinema class. I need to know when Malick first read the book, if ever, and why the whole thing is so changed.Mag</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, poetic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10 stars / 10 starsI settled the house at about 9:45pm, popped the tape into the VCR and went outside for a cigarette during the previews.When the movie came on I settled down in the comfy reclining chair, turned off the lights, and stared. From the first few seconds of the film I knew I'd be hooked.It seemed to me like a big, long poem, narrated by several different characters, but all being "one consciousness," as was said in the movie. Every man talking, one man's consciousness.I was especially floored by the caliber of acting in the movie. Every soldier's eyes told the story, it was almost as if dialogue wasn't necessary. The two young soldiers especially affected me. The fear in each of their eyes was so real.The cinematography was amazing. I remember clearly one scene, right after a bloodbath, where one soldier, shot up with bullets, looks up to a leaf, eaten away by bugs, as full of holes as the man. It was breathtaking.I was worried, reading a lot of comments from people over the last couple days, that the storyline would be hard-to-follow. It wasn't. If you watch the movie as a whole, it made perfect sense. The entire movie, to me, seemed like a metaphor for human emotion. War, and the need to avenge others, is one of the most basic human emotions. One of the narratives said something like "Is there any avenging in nature?" Wow. I was so floored by the whole movie.OK, on to the couple things I didn't like about the movie: I knew about 75% of the actors in the movie, and most of their "public image" didn't even come into play. I was able to see past Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Adrien Brody and Elias Koteas as actors and really get into them being merely soldiers in a battle.On the other hand, there were three actors who's other roles and image that I couldn't get past and, in my opinion, brought me back to reality: John Travolta, Woody Harrelson and George Clooney. I wish they hadn't been in there because my "spell" was broken each time I saw them.Now, as for John Cusack. I saw this movie specifically because he was in it. I probably would not have rented it if it weren't for him. I am *so* glad I did! He was great, but it wasn't his best performance. The "eyes" scene that people are talking about with him was good, but too short to make an impact on me. And I feel the other "eyes" scenes were better. But he was great in the actual battle scene, and his screen time was longer than I thought it would be.Don't see this movie if you're only looking for one thing - war. See it for the whole experience. If you watch it waiting to see blood and gore, you'll miss out on a great movie.It has to easily be the best "war film" I have seen, and quite possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw Saving Private Ryan and when I did, I thought it should have won the Oscar for everything. Then I saw The Thin Red Line.How this movie got snubbed is beyond me. Nominated for the following: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Adaptation, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Dramatic Score, Best Sound. It won NONE! None? Cinematography and Editing should have been no-brainers!BOTTOM LINE: Not a shoot-em-up war film, but a poetic lesson in humanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" contains some of the most dazzling cinematography that I have ever seen in a movie before. John Toll's camera seems to glide into the fighting and death with ease.Malick doesn't seem too concerned with character development. One can, though, draw a rough outline of each character. Colonel Tall, brilliantly played by Nick Nolte, is a West Point graduate who is finally able to be in battle, and will do anything to win. Elias Koteas plays the defiant Captain Staros, who feels for his men and will not send them on a suicidal frontal assault as Colonel Tall orders. These are the two most rounded performances in the movie. Private Bell constantly dreams of his wife back home. (These scenes also contain some beautiful, dizzying photography). Private Witt is a more soulful man, the only one that never quite completely loses his sanity. Sean Penn as the tough and brave Sergeant Welsh. There are many more, but I could possibly not name them all.The reason that there is not too much character development is because "The Thin Red Line" is simply not concerned with them. I was reminded of a couple of lines in "Patton": "An army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps fights as a team. This individuality stuff is a lot of crap....." That is why "The Thin Red Line" does not care about character development. "The Thin Red Line" sees its army as a team, not individual people. Private Witt ponders: "Maybe everyone's got one big soul that everybody's a part of..."The people who say that "The Thin Red Line" is boring, that it's a war film with no action, need to stick to "Armageddon". There's plenty of intense action in this movie, believe me. It may not shove it in your face the way that "Saving Private Ryan" did, but like I said, it's still intense. "Saving Private Ryan" is a great film, one of 1998's best. "The Thin Red Line", in my opinion is better. The battle scenes in "Saving Private Ryan" made my mouth hang open with horror. I never really knew that it was that bad at D-Day, until, of course, I saw the movie. "The Thin Red Line" contained supensful battles that caused me to hold on tight to my seat, not letting go. They are equally horrific, but in different ways.There is a great beauty to the first 15 minutes that I think a lot of people missed. The section has some of the greatest images in cinema. The islanders, swimming in the blue, crystal waters of the Pacific is one of the most tranquil, serene shots ever filmed. The lush, green island trees as Private Witt walks through the native village. This is heaven, and Terrence Malick makes it feel that way.Around 390 miles worth of film was shot during the making of "The Thin Red Line". The original director's cut was 6 hours. Malick had to chop it down to less than 3 hours, and he still made a great film. I didn't find the voice-overs annoying in the slightest bit."The Thin Red Line" never lost my attention. I didn't think it became boring after the battle. I became interested in the different characters' outcomes. (Despite the not-too-much character development). Private Bell's outcome hit me hard, I didn't even see it coming.I did find the cameos by John Travolta and George Clooney a bit distracting, but since Malick had to edit it down, this suggests that both Clooney and Travolta were in it substantially longer. How I hope they let Malick come out with a director's cut!What question does this film ask? The late Gene Siskel said it best. "What is the source of the underbelly of hate that fuels war. A question for the ages in a film for the ages".</fullReview>

"Saving Private Ryan" contained about 30 minutes of stuff like I'd never seen before, but "Thin Red Line" had nearly 3 hours of stuff I'd never seen before. I will never forget this film for as long as I live. Nick Nolte gave one of the most powerful performances of his career and the huge cast of guest stars did not distract from the movie's power.

		<fullReview>An excellent film with many actors giving an a very good performance!It is a different war movie focusing on the contrast between the beauty of nature/ the innocent life of the local natives and the cruelty of the actions of war. I remember a lot of war films from the last 40-50 years, but none of these focused on this aspect. It is the most beautiful war film I have seen due to the repeating sequences showing small wonders of plants, animals and sun light (well knowing that such wonders usually soon disappear in a war zone). On this background the realistic presentation of the fear and sufferings of the young soldiers on both sides (not to mention the awareness of what is going on in Eastern Europe these days) leaves one with the question: Why cannot human beings find another way of solving serious international conflicts? Will we never learn ? It is important that young people see a movie like this one. The message of this film may be as strong (if not stronger) as that of the traditionally more dramatic and noisy war films. When the movie was finished nearly all of us including many young people sat silent for 1-2 minutes before we left the cinema. This does not happen very often!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "MELANGE" OF ALL REVIEWS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After twenty years of silence, the lion roars back... It seems that after long years of darkness, the sight of the sun was worth the wait. Terrence Malick returns at last with nothing less than the finest contemporary war film full of power and poetic grandeur as it follows a company of American soldiers during the brutal invasion of Guadalcanal in World War II. The exhausting fight for a key-positioned airfield that allows control over a 1000-mile radius puts the men of the Army Rifle company C-for-Charlie through hell. The horrors of war forms the soldiers into a tight-knit group, their emotions develop into bonds of love and even family. The reasons for this war get further away as the world for the men gets smaller and smaller until their fighting is for mere survival and the life of the other men with them. Malick's screenplay revolves around the inner dialogue of the men of Charlie Company as they confront their own fears and try to make sense of their disparate pasts while struggling to survive amidst the carnage whirling around them in an otherwise idyllic tropical "paradise". Aye, every man has his war...The film's title comes from a 19th century allusion to the British Empire's infantry (red uniforms) whose small numbers managed to 'protect' the British "civilization" from the countless hordes of "savages" which the Empire ruled. Indeed, a simple title that reflects the true meaning of war, revealing the racism that sparks all wars. Considering even that war is mere defense of a civilization from barbarians, is but a proof to the fundamental paradox of war. Truly, in defending "civilization" we are sending young buds to war, coloring their white souls with satanic horrors of battle. And turning them into the very "savages" that we are trying to prevent from destroying our civilization. The cure is now but further contamination that would infest all the body...I personally find it unbelievable to hear sort of comments degrading this masterpiece especially concerning the absence of a plot or even characters. This film does not develop characters because that is part of the message: war embraces all men and crosses all socio-political boundaries - do I really have to know anything about a character to see the senselessness in his death?. All the characters just represent one human, the flames of an only fire. Indeed, they are all just parts of our human subconscious. As for the plot, it lies hidden underneath the shroud of war as it reflects the development of man amid the bushes of brutality. It's intended to show a small slice of one part of a campaign to take a hill on one island in the Pacific during a war which lasted 6 years. Depicting the war in this way is far more realistic than an action packed extravaganza of explosions and heroism ( like Saving Private Ryan ). For the average soldier the war would have been remembered in terms of vivid images of small battles, not as any particular timeline of larger events. For the price of a few too many of Bell's memories you have the sight of a lone soldier lost in a misty haze as the occasional bullet whizzes past. Or the image of Witt's return to the village to find his heaven corrupted by the cruelties of fighting. War is finally revealed as an outplay of doom rather than a conquest for hope. The disease is diagnosed, and its deadly and contagious effects are revealed. The best sequence is the companies attack on the Japanese encampment. Whilst only five minutes long it's a frenetic episode as the camera moves in all directions. Inside huts, over corpses, alongside running troops. Its pace means we never actually see anybody killed clearly so there is no sense of loss. Until it stops and the defeated Japanese are paraded in front of us. There is no feeling of victory or pride ; shame is the only survivor. Indeed, what does war hold but shame or the loss of pride. Conqueror or Conquered, both are defeated by the concept of war...Terrence Malick brilliantly interweaves tragic images of nature's inexorable brutality with almost spiritual views of the jungle sunshade, leaving the viewer simultaneously stunned by nature's beauty and aghast at its violence. By comparing war with natural beauty the film highlights the ridiculous extent man has gone to by ending life and destroying such beauty. This contrast reflects the fierce and brutal identity of war, destroying the Eden of yesterday. At the same time, the ebb and flow of the poetic narrative gives character to the universal themes and forces one to introspect and to contemplate the very nature of existence. The philosophical undercurrents of the film are made apparent through such vivid symbolism as the alligator, the bird, the snake, and the seed, all of which touch upon topics ranging from the inborn evil in nature to the nature of the soul, war, and God. The crocodile entering the green algae covered water symbolizes nature's savagery, the tree being choked by parasitic vines reflects Lt. Col. Tall own words 'nature is cruel', the bird being born as a soldier dies sheds light on the cycle of life for "we come from the earth and return to it", the coconut sprouting a palm on the empty beach in the last scene is a proof that after death comes birth, and that amid the waters of despair man lives on a mere speck of hope, his own palm tree...Words fail to unmask the true beauty that surpasses the matter, reaching the ephemeral nirvana. I can but wonder what enchantment another twenty years wait holds? Maybe a supplementary bouquet of divine philosophy and an escape from the dungeons of the run-of-the-mill cliched Hollywood action-movies. Malek once again proves that the art of movie making is but magic sculpted by the wand of the enchanter...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the film opens the first thing to strike you is the beautiful cinematography. The "look" of this film is incredible. Unfortunately that is all it has going for it. If I threw some butterflies and shafts of sunlight in to the first 20 minutes of "Saving Private Ryan" and repeated it over and over again for 3 hours from different angles and points of view then you would have this film. At no point is there a plot or any character development at all. This is by far the largest collection of wasted talent I have ever seen. The likes of Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, Woody Harelson and many others far to numerous to list are never given a chance to do anything at all in terms of any acting per se. I spent 3 long, torturous hours waiting for SOMETHING to happen to SOMEBODY but there was never a somebody who was in it long enough to develop in to someONE that we cared enough about to have something happen to them.This was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen because of all the disgustingly wasted potential and cinematic beauty corrupted by bad screen writing and lack of any substance at all. They spent a lot of time dressing up the film in pretty pictures and colorful shots but at no time did anyone decide what, exactly, they were dressings since there was nothing there.</fullReview>

It was somewhat "difficult" to follow (again, tho, I was expecting "one" story-line, more similar to SPR, while this one had so many going at one time)-- and there were so very many disappointed movie-goers in the theater with us, between their taunting at the screen and "booing" (there were cheers when it was over tho'), it made it more difficult.

		<fullReview>What angers me most about fans of this film is that they claim that people who disliked this movie because of its length (an excruciating 170 minutes!), or the fact that there are virtually no identifiable characters are just half-wits who want to be "spoon-fed" the latest Hollywood special effects blockbuster. Well as a person who does appreciate cinematic quality, I was bored with this film's ten ton ego.I don't care how powerful a director's vison might be, you can't have a film, especially a three hour one, that doesn't have a storyline. Now I know that film students who have no doubt studied every millisecond of the movie would disagree with that vehemently. I can understand their viewpoint since I WANTED to like this film. On a visual level it certainly has its moments. I could definitely tell the movie was trying to say something. But without solid characters (I'm sorry, but any argument that these characters are anything but half-finished sketches is pure bunk!) the heavy message of the film hits the floor with nothing to hang onto. And no, the constant narrations, which sound at times like passages from a Moody Blues album, didn't help since I didn't believe for a second that anybody in this situation would really have something like that going through their mind.Still, I didn't hate this movie. I was impressed with its intent. In a way it does make "Saving Private Ryan" seem kind of childish. And that's no easy task. But a little characterization can go a long way.I don't usually give number ratings, but as an example of how this movie affected me, my rating shows how the impressive visuals and the non-existant characters and plot cancel each other out.(5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the year, if you don't mind the slow pace...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the Thin Red Line to be a much more satisfying movie than Saving Private Ryan- by a mile. While they are very different movies, I felt the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line matched Private Ryan's to say the least: they were more structured and handled with greater delicacy, whereas in Private Ryan, it was just a lot of blood and guts scattered all over the place. While it provided perhaps a little more horror and realism, it certainly wasn't as well done. I especially enjoyed the contrast between the battle scenes and the peaceful nature scenes, which were superbly done. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line was moving, without being sentimental,which is one of the defining characteristics of the two movies. But it is rather slow at a little less than 3 hours long. While I don't personally mind slow movies, I did see a few people walk out of the cinema halfway through because of the pace. Rather than seeing the slower paced scenes as boring, I tried to understand what they were trying to say. I did have a slight problem with those inner monologues though- I didn't understand half of it. And Nick Nolte's mumbling was particularly hard to understand. Overall, the cast and performances were fantastic, even though some of the cameos (such as Travolta and Clooney) did seem out of place for some reason, and I often questioned the purpose and importance of them being there, even though Woody Harrelson was surprisingly good. One of the most annoying things about watching American-dominated war movies is the way Americans are portrayed, and more importantly, how their enemies are portrayed. Unlike Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line handled this particularly well, which is why I think non-Americans would enjoy this movie a little more. I can see why a lot of people disliked this movie, and I guess it is reasonable for people to dislike it. But I think if you don't mind a slow pace, then you'll find this movie an extremely rewarding cinematic experience, more rewarding than Saving Private Ryan ever will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or maybe it's because I haven't read the book (or any of them in the trilogy, for that matter). But either way, I don't get it.Is that a problem with me, or the movie? I choose the latter. Technically, the film is brilliant. Action scenes truly involve the viewer in the battles. The cinematography involves us in the location of Guadal Canal. I now feel as though I've been there, and understand something of the damage done to this peaceful-but-strategically-located island.The problem is that the film isn't about war; it's apparently about human nature. Fine; all films should deal with that on some level. Unfortunately for us, though, this film--be it the director, script or actor--tends to reach beyond its grasp. Poetic lines (vs. genuine poetry) are interwoven not at pointed intervals, but instead as pointless interruptions. And what seems to desire to pass for wisdom is shallow and droll.Nolte, Penn and the rest turn in honorable performances, given what they had in the way of script and direction. Indeed, at points the cast rises above the shallow circumstances in which they find themselves. They certainly cannot be held responsible for the film's final appearance, or its lack of impact (let alone import).It's the images so haphazardly interjected into the film that break it apart, no matter how well the cast worked. The crocodile, the bird--well, there's a difference between "too deep for most people" and too weak to make a point. Where the imagery of "Apocalypse Now" added to the story and its effect, the comparatively lame attempts in this version of "The Thin Red Line" provide only a thin veneer, where real depth was needed.Color me disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to imdb for restoring my sanity. "The Thin Red Line" drew raves from critics and garnered 7 Oscar nominations, including the much coveted Best Picture nod. I gave it a "7", but even my vote was probably an exaggeration. I didn't really like this movie! I thought I was in a bad mood (which I was), that I was tired (which I was), or that I just "didn't get it" (which I didn't). But it wasn't me after all-- it was the movie.I will compliment the cinematography and the basic story line. I appreciate the film's message that "nature is cruel" (to sum it up in 3 words). The most annoying thing for me, however, was the over-use of the voiceover. I don't usually mind voice-overs, but this was ridiculous. By the end of the film, every time the voice-over came on, I wanted to shout, "Oh, shut up! Already!" Most of the voice-overs were unintelligible (poor sound, I guess). The ones for which I COULD understand the words were unintelligible to my brain because they seemed like some kind of psychobabble. My guess is that these voice-overs came directly from the book. If not, there is no reason whatsoever for them.Unfortunately even the message and execution of the film seemed a little dated and a little derivative. What's in this movie that we haven't already seen in "Platoon" and in "Apocalypse Now"? Not much. It certainly wasn't original like "Saving Private Ryan".The performances were fairly solid, with the exception of two "cameo" mistakes in casting-- John Travolta (who I absolutely LOVED in "Primary Colors" and damn he didn't get nominated for it) was not believable as someone from the 1940s, and George Clooney, who, by the time he came on the screen, I was ready to accept anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only real problem with this masterpiece of a movie, is that people in general seems not to be intelligent enough to understand it to what it's worth. Some people are telling the movie is too pretentious. Well grow up ! It's not because you don't understand and you fell bored that it's bad ! Learn a little something about cinema and you'll know then why it was called one of the best films of the year by almost every critics. And like my old friend Jules Vernes said : " RESPECT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND". Which means if you didn't understand the film, you're the problem. A movie not made the classical way doesn't mean it's bad...This movie is the greatest masterpiece of the decade. At least, one director remembered that cinema is also an ART, not just entertainment.</fullReview>

Characterslike Doll, Stein, and Welsh are reduced to pathetic actor'srepresentations, stressing style over substance. The constantvoice overs tell us how we should feel, instead of the actorsconveying their characters' emotions with actual acting.Particularly ludicrous was the penchant to lapse into prosepoetry at the slightest provocation. Most of the time I feltlike I was watching a still photograph for 3 hours.Historically, this film uses a lot of modern equipment, anddresses planes that weren't on Guadalcanal to look like otherwarbirds. This constantly reminded me I was watching a movie.I think this film is a slap into the face of all of those whofought on Guadalcanal, and everywhere in war, by trivializingtheir experiences with death.</fullReview>

I have never read the book so I had no preconceived visuals of what the film was going to be, I was just expecting a decent movie at least. What I got was a movie that almost seemed sophmoric in effort,there were some powerful scenes in the movie, but it was one of the worst edited movies I've ever seen, No character development half the time you didn't even know who was who(When will they learn not to cast actors who resemble each other to play supporting roles in the same movie)or did you really care. Malick tries to introduce a dozen or so people so you end up knowing nothing about any.And predictable in style A:soldier gets shot. B:Panaramic of how majestic nature is, i.e sunset,rolling brook,leaves on a tree, or a dozen or so red parrots, ohh sometimes bats too. C: Back to soldier getting shot,repeat process throw in some guy thinking of wife for 5 minutes for the tenth time. I'm sorry this movie was not moving or even poetry it was just bad. It could be cut about 45 minutes,to make it a coherent movie with substance.Like said in many other posts Cinematography was excellent but that does not make a three hour movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the 1990's draw to a close, it is pretty safe to say that Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE is one of the few films of the decade that will regularly turn up on future lists of the greatest films ever made. This is not by any stretch of the imagination, your typical Hollywood war/action film,(no doubt why so many are having trouble with it). What it is is a profoundly passionate, and personal cinematic exploration into the very heart and soul of man, nature and the eternal quest for spiritual solace in a world vying against itself. I urge anyone who loves movies, who truly believes in the redemptive power of a great work of art, in any form, to forget what you may have heard and see this film. It is a transcendent masterpiece, one that will live on long after the safe, homogenized, corporate crap that we are normally fed is long forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes when you try to reach the stars, you realize how low the floor is...`The Thin Red Line' It's hard to really put into words how odd this film is. It would help if the film knew what it was. A three hour `inner child' meditation set during the taking of ONE hill during World War 2. It's easy to say the battle scenes are exciting, they're battle scenes... that's what they're there for. But the rest of the film is painfully slow and mortifyingly tedious. Some may call it art, some might be entranced - I was p****d. I feel really sorry for Sean Peen, John C. Reilly, George Clooney, Nick Stahl, and scores of other actors who's parts were severely trimmed to one line cameos. Those `star' actors are nice to have, with Malick's unprofessional attention to character, it's all we get to tell who's from who. To sacrifice great acting in favor of nature shots and aimless voice-overs is a real shame. The movie forgoes plot A B C thinking in favor of just rambling along. I'm not looking for rigid structure here, just a nice flaky pie crust of form would have been nice. Malick should have had a leash on this one. This film looks and feels like the work of an insane man. Only Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin and Jim Caviezel register strongly - and only because Malick amazingly left their back story in the final film. I do like the Stedicam glides that are used liberally, and who can say anything bad about the location? Gorgeous. I get the sinking feeling that the critics who praise this film don't want to look bad in front of their peers. Tough to sit through, and even tougher to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a poem. It is a medication on war's destruction of the human spirit. Nonlinear, imagistic, subjective--ultimately it is a Buddhist tone poem. War destroys both man and nature, and man is but one part of nature. The soldier's narratives are moving. So what if soldiers don't really think like this? This film makes Private Ryan's soldiers' vernacular look fake, as if the script writers of that movie saw too many World War II movies.What I particularly appreciated was the portrayal of the enemy. The Japanese are seen as frightened, half starved human beings. In Private Ryan the Germans were superhuman killing machines, but in Thin Red Line a soldier looks down at a Japanese face buried in the dirt and imagines his thoughts, his wishes, his dreams. The face becomes a flower. It is so moving, so beautiful.I wish to thank Malick and the actors for creating a war film that is almost as great as the best war film ever made--Russia's Come and See.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely does a film approach the genius of The Thin Red Line. In contemporary Hollywood, where so much of film is simply "eye candy" with little social or intellectual value, Maleck has created a film both visually stunning and intellectually brilliant.The days of John Wayne are over for "war" films. The last 25 years have seen a magnificent progression from glorification to horrific realism in "war" movies. Going beyond conventional portrayals, The Thin Red Line shows life within and without. That is, the inner thoughts of soldiers, American and Japanese, caught up in a sea of blood and carnage.The film beckons analysis from the perspective of magical realism, where intense, life-like battles are interspersed with moments in time across the sea. Death is seen in different ways by different characters, but war is the same to all: it rips each soldier by the soul.The Thin Red Line departs from the Hollywood main as it leaves the audience bewildered, with more questions than answers. To its last frame, however, The Thin Red Line is a paradox: the agony of few soldiers surrounded by a tropical paradise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 out of 10, this IS a great war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line can be described in so many words from poetic to horrifying. The visuals are among anything you have ever seen in any war film, and that's only the beginning. There are so many great things going for this movie that it is one you might not want to miss if you are into the war genre. And even though some may not like it in their own opinion, criticizing this very artistic picture by Terrance Mallick as some distasteful film critics did is nearly a crime.The plot is very simple and lets itself at you 10 minutes into the film. A rifle infantry known as Charlie Company are set to raid Guadalcanal Island ordered in a 5 minute performance by John Travolta and led throughout the film by Nick Nolte in a very intense performance. As the large group of mostly young soldiers sets foot on the island to fight the Japenese the action jumps in right away. Throughout the following 2 hours of almost nonstop war different platoons are given different orders to take over the island step by step. Each platoon has their own result, some involving major sucess while others suffering in loss.A trouble The Thin Red Line ran into for being released this January is that it's being severly compared to another very different WWII film Saving Private Ryan. Terrance Mallick and Steven Spielburg have a much different vision on war, different storyline, different location, different enemy, and different characters. Saving Private Ryan's intensity was for it's considerable realism throughout while The Thin Red Line's intensity may not be as real but extremely horrifying. If you even think about comparing these two films you minus will throw in all the other WWII films like Das Boot into the mix, because they are all very different.There are so many great things in Terrance Mallick's film it's almost hard to name them all. The visuals were absolutly spectacular which made most of the war scenes not only to make you feel that you were in the war but if you were surrounded. The location which was reportadly shot on Guadalcanal is also incredible which is what makes some of the scenes so scary from the amount of surroundings the soldiers were in during their battles. The sound effects and soundtrack are both outstanding which help give a lot of meaning to the mood and feel for the movie.The cast to The Thin Red Line is something quite unique and unusual. There are so many familiar faces in this film that it's hard to keep track of them all and the young cast members (especially the main character played by Jim Caviezel) are also superb. It's surprising to see though how little screen time many actors like Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, and especially George Clooney (not even a minute) were given. Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, and John Cusack all gave wonderful performances with very memorable characters. One thing that added a lot of emotion in some scenes of this 3 hour epic were the flashbacks to give character background. This gave the characters enough realism to make some of their deaths very dramatic.Out of the eight of ten I gave it there are only a few problems. One of which is the narratives that seem to never end and it's hard to imagine some of these soldiers speaking so poetically with such symbolism. But the main problem The Thin Red Line had can be thanked to 20th Century Fox. When Terrance Mallick was done filming he supposedly had over eight hours of film (much of which was probubly lost in the editing room since Mallick is known to aim for perfection in his films) and when he gave 20th Century Fox the rough draft of the film they wanted it to be cut down drastically. This caused the film to feel a little choppy in many parts and could have been fixed if they let Mallick release his original version of the film instead of the very cut 3 hour version. Hopefully there will be a directors cut released on DVD to help fill in the taken out scenes.Overall this is definitely a good choice. Terrance Mallick's direction is a one of a kind experiance and if you haven't seen his earlier films like Badlands you will be surprised at how different his films can be. Note all the symbolizm and camera effects throughout, they make the most effective difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon leaving The Thin Red Line, I had to take a moment to step back and ponder my review of the movie. The overall response from the fleeing masses seemed to be that of dissatisfaction. If the film was scaled down a 1/2hr by cutting down on over exposed scenes, such as the many flashbacks-which were too frequent and lengthy. The opening scene could have also been scaled back a few minutes, there was too much time spent reflecting the AWOL soldiers. Yes, that was a segment of the plot but far too much time was spent on it. The battle for the island was over an airfield, which held little of significance with in the movie itself. Not enough if not for the great cast of actors, both known and unknown the movie would have taken a severe hit. The Thin Red Line falls well short of Saving Private Ryan, for film of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are going to make a film based on the novel, "The Thin Red Line," you should at least make it resemble to book. Malick had too much time to change every detail of the amazing novel into a jumbled mess of a screenplay.The scenes that are straight from the book are some of the best scenes ever filmed (i.e., the assault on the Japanese bunker, the Sgt. Keck death scene, the destruction of Boola Boola village). Where Malick fails is in his overly drawn-out approach to the men of C-for-Charlie company crossing the thin red line.Although the scenery is beautiful, there is far too much of it. Instead of including more sections of the book and filming the development of the characters, Malick only gives us a glimpse of the men of C Company, unlike the book, where the histories and, most importantly, the motivations of characters are well developed. Although I realize that the film would have been 6 hours if the book was filmed cover to cover, Malick ignores or changes key points of the book and instead films exotic birds, or a "happy native village." And apparently, Malick ran out of film, because he did not bother to include the end of the book, an injustice on the scale of Kubrick's (accidental) exclusion of the real ending of "A Clockwork Orange."Malick changes characters, and in doing so changes what made the book so good. Perhaps if I did not expect to see "The Thin Red Line," I wouldn't be so hard on it, but I expected to see "The Thin Red Line." When you do see it as James Jones envisioned it, it is a classic nearly equal to "Saving Private Ryan." When Malick takes over and interjects his perspective, the film turns into a chaotic mess. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" is a beautifully shot film... that's it. Because of the enormous popularity of Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan," it would be impossible not to compare the two war pictures of 1998. That being said, Malick's picture is far inferior to Spielberg's:CHARACTERS -- [TTRL]: Poorly developed and easily forgotten by the end. No one had their "own" voice... only one: Malick's. [SPR]: Everyone was VERY convincing. The actors' pre-shoot boot camp really paid off onscreen.CINEMATOGRAPHY -- [TTRL]: Nice things to look at... showed us the terrors in Guadalcanal, WWII. [SPR]: Striking things to look at... made us FEEL the terror at Omaha Beach, D-Day.EDITING -- [TTRL]: Too scattered. [SPR]: Tightly paced.DRAMATIC SCORE -- [TTRL]: Driving at times, but distracting most of the time. [SPR]: Beautifully used at the APPROPRIATE times.SCREENPLAY -- [TTRL]: Again, not one character had his own voice... everyone had only one: the director's. [SPR]: Dialogue was a bit trite at times, but the feelings of the film were magnificently expressed through all the action.Bottom line: "The Thin Red Line" is a BIG disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without going to Kantian philosophical lengths to explain my deep abiding love for this film, I will simply speak about the two shots which I found the most important in the film.The opening shot is a medium close-up on an crocodile as it slowly descends into a murky swamp. In context of the Edenic sequence afterwards with Private Witt, this sets up the entire movie. Man has gone from peaceful cohabitant with nature into baleful warrior, the evil lurking underneath the surface, separated by a thin line between the water level. Later on near the end of the film the troops capture a dead croc in Guadalcanal. Danger has turned to decay; Nature has crawled back into the earth to die.The most powerful moment for me, however, was the scene just before the battle is to begin, before any shot has been fired. Several of the soldiers are wordlessly marching toward the enemy, marching toward their death, and in a long wide shot a Melanesian native walks in the other direction, calmly, quietly, eventually passing the soldiers entirely. They look at the native with utter bewilderment. The pure insanity of juxtaposition between this pivotal moment in the lives of the soldiers and a native on a walk in the jungle brings war, humanity, progress, civilization, life, death, and spiritual meaning into question without saying a word. I defy Spielberg, or for that matter anyone, to approach such brilliance.This is a mediatation on the essential oneness of man, a sobering portrait about the inevitability of evil, and a maddening glimpse of the natural world we can no longer have for ourselves. Leave the star cameos out of it. Forget the unconventional narrative. Watch the first living art on celluloid in years without the bias of hundreds of films' worth of experience. And be ahead of the curve, because in twenty years this film will take its rightful place among the best ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line, the second WWII film to come out in 1998, is a film that aspires to greatness and falls down in its climb. Visually, it's beautiful to look at. Two time Oscar winner John Toll has given the hills of Guadalcanal a luster that reminded me of his previous efforts, Legends of the Fall and Braveheart. The battle scenes between the American and Japanese forces are heart pounding and brutal, there is a sense of dread as you watch the soldiers advance up a hill that has a machine gun pillbox at the top. Unfortunately, the film doesn't know what it wants to be. The action sequences are good, but in order for them to work, you have to care about the characters, and in order for that to work, you have to know who they are! The Thin Red Line boasts a good cast, but they come and go so quickly on the screen you don't have time to connect with them. The voice over narration adds to the confusion. I found myself wondering, who was talking? Toward the end of the movie, I found myself thinking, I can't tell the soldiers apart! Maybe that's what Terence Malick wanted, maybe not. In any case, The Thin Red Line was a failed epic. It had a chance for greatness, but it lingered to long on the philosophical views of war, and did not let you get to know the men the way that Saving Private Ryan did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering all the Oscar hype surrounding this film, I really was expecting a much better work. This film lacks any coherent sense of itself. It tries to be a character study, but doesn't adequately develop any of the characters. Moreover, the costume and makeup units do a very poor job of making the soldiers distinguishable from one another. While this may constitute an interesting statement in itself, it further hampers the effectiveness of a character study. The result is a slow-moving film that seems to have little point to it. There is some interesting dialogue in the voiceovers that smacks of Gnostic dualism, but it is disjointed in the context of the story and comes across as rather "tossed off." There is little else to distinguish it from the generally hackneyed war film genre. All the classic elements are there--the Dear John letter, the rebellious squad commander--but they are there in their most cliched format. If you want a quality war film, see Saving Private Ryan, but give this one a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film last night from midnight to 3 in the morning, and I have only one thing to say - this film is simply the best film of the year, and, I dare to say, perhaps one of the best films in the film history.I firmly believe that interaction between audience and film should be made on a feeling level. Film is like music and not like literature. you should feel first than to understand. And The Thin Red Line does this so well. One image after another is so beautifully captured and presented I was having hard time breathing. some might say I'm being too pretentious just like the film, and they maybe right, but i'm sure there are audiences who felt catharsism after viewing the film. When was the last time we sat through a movie and thought about what we are watching or what we are seeing. most shots in Hollywood movies were planned so that audience don't have to think about it every minute, and they were arranged in such way that watching movie seemed almost efforless on the audience part. But The Thin Red Line goes against that. almost every scene is disjointed and fragmented. There isn't really a character who stands above other characters. That's because Malick wants you to take all that information in and create your own character. Instead of having a character telling you what the war was like, he's asking you to create your own and ask yourself about the war. Some of you who have already seen the film have probably noticed it already that this film is not about war, but really about the relationship between human and the nature. what is our relationship with them at present? Have we lost our contact with them? What is there to ask for in the nature that we need? I already want to see this film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it. I can compare it with saving private ryan and platoon. This movie has a life and really touched me. But there are times when it gets a little lengthy but overall it is absolutely a great war movie. Every scene in here is artistic and beautiful. The movie started out peacefully, slowly and the director kept the balance between action and the pace. it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan by looking at the action scenes but this movie focuses on the emotion of the soldiers even more. The director tried a lot to get the audience to feel- 'whats it like to be in a war' and I think he did a really great job. However, the ending of this movie is a little lengthy.If you like anti-war movie and if you like Saving Private Ryan then you will like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a lot of Oscar buzz surrounding this movie for quite some time now. After seeing this movie, I can say that the buzz is completely undeserved. The biggest problem with this movie is that it does not have any character development. Without that, the audience don't care for the characters. It just leaves this movie with pretty bird shots. If you look at the scene where Jack (I think it is him) gets a letter from his wife. It should be even a little emotional but since you there was no character development, you just don't care. Secondly, The story seems needs to be streamlined. It seems if the screenplay was just a chopped down version of the book. Also the birds shots, grass shots,etc, need to be edited out. If you put some in there it gives the movie atmosphere, but if you rely on it, it just gets annoying. Overall I think it was a waste of 3 hours. If you want to see a war movie, see "Saving Private Ryan". The first 20 minutes of that film is better than all of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How NOT to do it. The Thin Red Line. Quite simply one of the worst war films I've ever seen. Nick Nolte overacting and bellowing all the time, Sean Penn, John Cusack, George Clooney, John Travolta for Chrissake and all the rest. I'd read very good reviews of this but it did all the wrong things. First, the intensely irritating quasi-philosophical monologues throughout the film like "Why do we do this to ourselves? Where does this hatred come from?", the endless shots of the sun through the ferns and the whispering grass, the horrible flashbacks to his girlfriend who dumps him in a letter - yawn - the hero that that gets killed, next shot is him swimming underwater with loads of kids, the dreadful men-dying-in-each-others'-arms scenes... mummy! Dire. Hollywood does it again. The thing about a good war movie is that it can be hours long like Das Boot or A Bridge Too Far and it still seems like no time has passed at all, crap like this you suffer every minute of its self-indulgent preachy saccharine 179 minutes. I was reduced near the end to fast forwarding in the hope of more battle scenes. Chronic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one for the ages. Cast, photo, direction, plot, soundtrack, screenplay etc. It all fits perfectly. It's a long poem about the horrors of war. And the battle off the human consciousness vs society, waring between what it thinks is right compared to what the outside world wants it to think and do, fear or love... war or peace. The personal journeys in this movie is amazing and coupled with the poetry it lifts the film to the skies. The actors all give something to the experience. Especially Jim Caviezel and Nick Nolte. But there are many great performances, like from John Cusack and Sean Penn. Other seasoned actors makes great additions to the plot.One of my favorite movies of all times. 10/10 Cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every group has its pantheon of saints whether they are sportsmen, artists, politicians, salesmen, folk singers, bankers, crooks or, of course, film makers. And for those who earn their grubby pennies in the whacky world of making movies Terrence Malik is up there as one of the greatest saints. So criticising the man and his work is not just like giggling at a funeral but dropping your trousers and taking a dump in full view of the corpse. It just isn't done, and anyone who indulges in that kind of behaviour - or dares to criticise St Terrence and one of his films - is quite obviously a candidate for the funny farm. Well, perhaps. And perhaps, in the case of Malik, perhaps not. With this, The Thin Red Line, just what is the man trying to do?It is, by turns, part post-modern war movie, South Sea travelogue, art house something-or-other and even touches on your actual straight-down-the-line gung-ho shoot-em-up before it reminds itself of its pacifist motivation and resorts to art house something-or-other. The technical term for The Thin Red Line is 'a mess' and that is putting it charitably. In another review I warned of the incessant, remorseless wall-to-wall sentimental soundtrack which does its very best to manipulate the feelings and thus the judgment of the viewer, and that warning applies to this film, too. I can best describe the soundtrack as chocolate box church music meets Joe Schmaltz and his Touchy-Feely All-Stars. And that description, too, is somewhat charitable, and for a film of this length - 163 minutes - I suspect the soundtrack composer was paid by the hour.I must confess that I was well on the point of throwing in the towel after about 20 minutes. Someone once said of Richard Wagner that after hearing his music for half an hour, you look at your watch and realise only five minutes have passed. Malik seems to share that same affliction in The Thin Red Line. But I took into account the director's current reputation and decided to stick it out. I could, I told myself, be missing something and Malik deserved an honest hearing. As it turned out, I wasn't and he didn't.I was stumped right from the off by a rather long shot of an alligator/crocodile entering a river and slowly sinking beneath the water. Significant or not? Well, to be honest, I don't know, although as that, or another, alligator/croc turns up in the film for no particularly good reason several hours later, tied to a plank in the back of a truck and surrounded by battle-weary troops on an R&amp;R break, the odds are surely on 'significant'. But don't ask me how or in what way.There followed quite a long digression (it, too, seemed longer than it probably was) of two squaddies relaxing with and relating to a village of South Sea islanders - paddling in the sea, being friendly with the locals, poetically musing on nature, you know, that kind of thing - before the navy show up and we realise the two have gone AWOL. Once interned to the ship's hold, it is then we are led to believe that the film will finally get going. And it does in a kind of way, but, well, not really. One young farm lad confesses to the sergeant that he's scared, another steals a pistol, a third reveals that he was once an officer but was busted to private - Malik is almost in danger of becoming conventional but confirmed cineastes will know full well there's no danger of that. So on it goes.At one point Nick Nolte does a 'is this man mad or just really, really committed' act, but the film isn't about that, either. Gorgeous George Clooney even puts in an appearance as the captain replacing the 'good man' unjustly sent home in disgrace, but after earning his million or two salary for the very brief guest spot, he, too, disappears.What were you trying to do, Mr Malik? Tell us, because I sure as hell don't know. Were you honestly trying to inform us that 'war is bad'? Are you really still not convinced we don't know that? And what was with all the, to my ears insufferably trite, cod 'deep' insights intoned every ten minutes or so in voice-over? Here are three random examples: 'War doesn't ennoble men, it poisons the soul'; 'Love? Where does it come from?'; and 'What's keeping us from reaching out and touching the glory?' That last is especially vacuous. There are well-directed action war sequences which would not disgrace any steak and potatoes action film, but after all the cod philosophising and insights it should seem obvious that Malik is not in the least bit interested in that kind of cinematic titillation. If anyone reading this wants to hear at first hand just how nasty and dehumanising war is, forgot about watching a confused and confusing Malik opus and simply ask your grandfather, father, uncle or brother.For this viewer at least Malik's The Thin Red Line is not just not a masterpiece, it is dangerously close to being an insulting piece of self-indulgence. Malik has a duty to provide us with, at least, the means and context to try to understand what he is attempting to do. If he has made and is presenting a more complex piece than Son Of Rambo Rides Again: The Dinosaurs, Malik is most entitled to expect the viewer to engage his or her intelligence and make something of an effort. But that simply isn't the case with this film. It is simply a mish-mash of sentiment, middle-brow insight, would-be stunning imagery, syrupy music and stock war movie characters, all somehow cemented together with lashings of liberal fellow feeling. And that does not make it a great or even good film. To put it mildly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't a war film, it's a film about life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You look at the posters, and you think that it's a war movie. But it isn't it's not guns blazing or "Gawd bless America!" It's about killing, death, life,evil, souls, nature. You can take years thinking about this movie, and never find it's true meaning, even if you watch it a hundred times. The film was of course over-shadowed by Saving Private Ryan, but that film is nothing like Thin Red Line, even Spielberg admitted it. The basic plot of the movie is a platoon in the pacific during World War II, but the true plot is much deeper. I can talk for ages about it, but we'd be here for years. The acting is well done, even the people who only say line really contribute. You can tell what the characters thinking just by their eyes, which is hard to do as an actor. The cinematography is beautiful, just looking at the film is a real treat, the way the sunlight pierces through the leaves. The music by Hans Zimmer is beautiful, in particular the track called Journey to The Line. The only real flaw is that George Clooney doesn't contribute other than a cameo, yet he is higher in the billing. But apart from that, this is a masterpiece. If you're looking for huge action and no story or themes, you're in the wrong place (and wrong mind), but this is a work of art rather than a war movie, and it is really under appreciated. Go see it, and if you already have, see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly among the greatest war films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mortality is the essence of war, the thin red line does not shy from this but at the same time does nothing to glorify war. This I feel is the paramount difference between this film and other, similar, war films. Truly it is difficult to compare the thin red line to Saving Private Ryan for instance, for while Saving private Ryan also deals with mortality it presents it in a different way. It is impossible to represent death on film, more impossible still to appreciate the horrors of war by watching a movie; saving private Ryan attempts both things, while the thin red line does not. The thin red line is a poetic expose on war, and is at its core a film commenting chiefly on the futility of conflict. Its interweaving of poetry and action does little to deify violence, but presents death as a consequence to it. If one were to watch two films to understand the underlying principals of war, one should watch Apocalypse now for the insanity of war, and the thin red line for the senselessness of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War poem....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen this movie recently, and I can say that as someone who was raised watching war classics such as Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Patton, this is by far the most gripping I have ever seen. I felt as though this film flew right past me in its release, failing to grab attention in the box office and missing out on many of its honorable Oscar nominations. Its been a little over a decade since its release, and I have just gotten the opportunity to see it, hoping for a powerful war drama, with exceptional characters and a haunting ending. I wasn't let down, but I found myself shocked.The Thin Red Line is a poem, encompassing the brutality and terror of war, as well as the personalities of the characters within it and their own lives, with a dramatic undertone that questions civilization's need for violence and war. The action slams into one like a machine-gun round, the romantic deaths crushing one's heart like an artillery shell. The cast is unbeatable, with Woody Harrelson, Sean Penn, and Jim Caviezel presenting some of the best acting of their careers. Along with an exceptional score by Hanz Zimmer, (his best, I believe) this war film has more to offer than any other i have ever seen.Anti-war, pro-war, American, or not, see this movie. It has potential to change your life. Amazing. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first war film I've ever seen that was above average also happens to be one that I deeply love. The narration was a wonderful touch, giving a chance to become much closer to every character in the film. As the tagline says "Every man fights his own war" and that is displayed perfectly throughout the film. Each man has his own different story. We got to see what was going through their heads as clearly as they were thinking it, and it really gave us a much more personal connection to each character, something that I always find lacking in war films. The performances are great all around, but I do wish Clooney had been a more vital role. As always with Malick, the direction and cinematography are absolutely superb. Such beautiful and striking images really set the tone for the film, and clash with the horror and brutality of war. Malick creates a contrast between nature and weaponized war, constantly switching from elegant images of nature to the terror of violence and battle.This creates one of the strongest paradoxes I've ever seen. It brings forth the question of how we could cause death and destruction while being absorbed in such beauty and wonder. The shot of the bird being hit by a bullet seems pointless at first, but it is really a contrast between nature's relation to life and man's association with death. The effect of man on nature is one of brutality (the constant fires and explosions) while the effect of nature on man is one of therapeutic absorption, displayed through Caviezel as he swims with the children in the water with a vibrant smile on his face and playful laughs surrounding him. Caviezel can handle all of the pain and bloodshed of war due to his connection with nature. The water cleanses him of sins and stress, in what I saw as a metaphor for baptism. The final image is one of optimism, showing that even though man took a heavy toll on it, the beauty of nature will live on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War inside</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People usually remember Thin Red Line as Saving Private Ryan Oscar rival. Most of them have never seen it.It's a very different kind of movie. Ryan is realism, flesh, blood, physical pain. It shows the cruelty of war mostly from the perspective of violence. We are actually shown how fragile human body is and what merciless bitch is war (sorry for cheesiness).Thin red line is more a philosophical journey. A journey into the depth of human mind. It shows war from the perspective of life and death as more spiritual substances. Mallick meaningly avoids showing physical violence, physiological ugliness of war and wounds it brings along. He examines it from a point of struggle between endless, perfect beauty of nature and destructive essence of mankind. Ryan and Thin Red line are simply incommensurable. The nature of war in these two movies is different. Ryan gives us a war on the surface, Line gives us the view from the soul - we see how war eats soldiers from inside, breaks their spirit, rapes their minds leaving open wounds on their spiritual essence.Line, Ryan - both are great, both are important, but in different ways. When you watch Ryan you think "Oh, God, that's disgusting. Poor, poor boys. How... Why did we let THIS to happen?!" And I can't know what you are thinking about when you watch Thin Red Line, I simply can't imagine. This movie is too personal, its theme is too delicate. And the last note: people usually animatedly discuss Saving Private Ryan after watching it. And after watching Thin Red Line viewers are usually detached , only mark of grief on their faces - cause they've just seen this line. And they've crossed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... the anti war movie from clichs ... That is what other movies did (SPR from the same year is just one example), building on clichs and not letting you see the enemy as humans. Here you see the enemy also as humans (one thing that Clint Eastwood might have achieved too in his two war movies, he did, with Flags of our Fathers and Letter from Iwo Jima). Or another big contrast you have here: Silence and Noise! The silence at the beginning of the movie is intolerable (maybe unbearable is the more appropriate word). Silence that is felt more so, when it gets loud ... and it does get loud. This is not to say that Terence Malick is exhausting every last drop of an action scene. Often times he even cuts away to a little episode, that involves one particular soldier.Speaking of the soldier. The amount of big time actors that got involved with this movie, is proof enough, that there is more to this movie than the war it depicts! You might not even see some of the actors, because it's a blink-and-you will miss them appearance! Jim/James Caviezel is the main actor and he delivers a career highlight here. Everyone is talking about him playing in Passion of the Christ, but this one is the one he shines and has his breakthrough performance!Edit: I had a chance to re-watch it on the big screen (International Festival in Berlin). And my admiration for this film only grew. The thin line between humanity/inhumanity, sanity/insanity and more contrasts are on display here. And you are still able to watch it as only a(n) (anti-)war movie. What I also realized on the second viewing, is the perfect "score" (no pun intended). The music is really a great factor in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was excited to see this. I think I heard somewhere that Scorsese called it the best movie of the 90's. I'm not sure whether that's true, but it got me fired up. Other people said good things. It was like post-release hype.Okay, well, I put this baby in the DVD player and let 'er rip. But, she really didn't rip.It started out with Caviezel (he's still relatively unknown, unfortunately, even after a bunch of big films) AWOL on an island of indigenous peoples he likes for their innocence. Then a ship comes and picks him up, and Sean Penn yells at him. They have this relationship throughout the movie.Caviezel doesn't like war, so the writer seemed to figure: "let's have him say poetic-sounding things while we show shots of nature - people will think it's deep." Okay, well, I'd say about an hour of the 2 hour 40 minute movie is dedicated to this voice-over narration. It gets old. Quickly.The film's story revolves around taking control of a Japanese controlled island in the Pacific. There are some battle scenes that are expertly done. These are definitely the strong points of the movie. I think that if they had focused more on these and done more of a "Black Hawk Down" approach, this would have been a tremendous film. But of course, we had to make it anti-war. Aside from that being pretty clichd at this point, it wasn't handled all that well. A friend of mine told me that he didn't care for this movie, citing his opinion that "it was boring - war films shouldn't be boring." I'm not saying that it should have to be a blood-filled gore fest of testosterone-inducing violence, I can appreciate slower, thoughtful films, but, with the exception of about 15 minutes of intense battle scenes, this really was just... boring.The acting was fine. Nolte is definitely a strong point, and Caviezel is fine. Brody isn't given much to do, though, and Travolta has only about 3 minutes of screen time. Clooney has even less.I suppose that this film is "technically" good, as in acting, cinematography, etc, are all fine, but I think that the issue came in the editing process. They made it way too long , and they focused on all the wrong things. I don't see war films to see shots of nature, I see them because they should be compelling, they should have action, and they should definitely not be boring. Sorry, But I don't think that The Thin Red Line meets these criteria.</fullReview>

Witt and his friend are found and send to new mission in to the island. Ambitious general played by Nick Nolte and sensitive captain who tries to protect his man for the deadly mission played by Elias Koalas Instead of the meaningless loudly action scenes, Movie focuses on character buildings, meaning of the life, madness of the war, loneliness and pureness of the Mother Nature.

Hans Zimmer made one of the best original score of all time.Special effects and make ups look so realistic and intense and create disturbing feel its audienceActing is superb in the movie, Senn Penn, Nick Nolte and Jim Caviezel gave powerful and fantastic performances however, effective voiceovers worked perfectly and give the emotion of the moment.

		<shortDescription>"There ain't no other world where everything's all right. There's just this one. Just this rock."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The account was always that Terrence Malick's return to cinema was in some sense going to be the Pacific foil for Saving Private Ryan, the start and finish of the incidental year of WWII films. That reductive summation evaporates with the apprehension of the solitary opening string chord and the foggy grey-green image of a crocodile, descending into a swamp, slowly sinking beneath the slime. Little in our typical experience as moviegoers prepares us for this class of audio-visual dialect. The movie has a colossal cast, but if it has a "main" character, it's Jim Caviezel's Pvt. Witt, ecstatically AWOL somewhere in a Pacific subregion. He exists in resplendent paradise, relishing the pattern of a life influenced only by nature?that's when the patrol boat recovers him.Nevertheless, upon being been reprimanded by Sean Penn's benumbed 1st Sgt. Walsh, he wafts into the film's immense ensemble, though his effort to square war's cruelty with the serene South Pacific remains at the film's heart. Sure, the movie has a narrative drive. It's about the campaign to seize Guadalcanal. Throughout the days spent conquering a hill, a swarming throng of people happen before us, some consistent, some essential for intermittent scenes or moments. Woody Harrelson's completely shocking final scene is the most heartrending of its kind, and some of the inimitable actor's most outstanding work. Despite Adrien Brody's outrage at the streamlining of his role, his eyes speak volumes. Save Witt and Walsh, the relationships given the most elucidation include the clash between Nick Nolte's Lieutenant Colonel and Elias Koteas' Captain over the extent to which either can squander lives for victory, and Ben Chaplin, who struggles to endure by grasping at recollections of his wife, but never does the action fully pledge itself to the viewpoint of a single character.It's partly this breakdown of movie storytelling that makes this blindsidingly emotional landscape of sacrifice, violence, empathy, humanity and melancholy perhaps the penultimate war film of all time, and while it's not simply, or centrally, a great war movie, it absolutely is one. It's the reason why the picture accomplishes the grand uniformity that war is believed to beget in its soldiers. Lacking one dominant figure is a distinct infrequency in war films. The film steamrolls all contrived features in which movie characters are given a pecking order. Here, the dominant figure is Charlie Company itself.Indeed, The Thin Red Line is an effort to construct a film in the figure of warfare, to make the film itself cacophonous and purely visceral, instead of to imitate reality. The creation of Malick's battle sequences have an impact of being incessantly unacquainted with where blasts, clatter and movement are emanating from, having your thoughts transited through incidental moments. It is, however, one of the most fluid films, at least purely in terms of feeling, I've ever seen, because single moments definitely resolve themselves, like one of the film's most enduring images, a butterfly fluttering past terrified, scurrying soldiers, merrily unaffected by them.One can understand the film as a portrayal of how war in humankind devastates nature, stability and the soul, but Witt's opening thoughts, and therefore the opening shot of the crocodile, seem to tell another tale, that conflict and brutality are already there, that humankind is simply an expansion of it. To that end, practically every soldier gets some occasion to ponder life, sorrow, beauty and harmony. Over each lush summit and riverbend, the movie presents unlimited uncertainties. Malick's return to filmmaking is in some ways distinct from his preceding masterworks, but in its curious meditation on the light and shadow in the human core, the part of God in our feelings and actions and the contradictions that rule our passions, Malick's film is endemic to his foregoing work. As per his pure-form custom, dialogue is regularly overwhelmed by environmental commotion, and performances and implications are elucidated by a gushing configuration of arresting visual and aural unions that elegantly fuses with John Toll's euphoric, shockingly exquisite imagery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like war movies a lot. Some are good, some great but very few are as memorable and thought provoking as this one. Through showing us what some of the characters thoughts are, we view the movie differently to all the others. TRL is a war movie with sensitivity built in. Yes, there are plenty of action sequences, but there are also many emotional and thoughtful interjections. I've seen this movie times and still keep hoping Witt will make it back to his Paradise. The movie also stars one of my favorite actors, Sean Penn. Excellent here, as always.The great acting and storyline is further enhanced by a wonderful score and beautiful camera work. Even if you're not a great war movie fan, please see this. It is so different and, like me, will be a film you can watch many times. Probably my favorite movie, in any genre, of all time. Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing, Horrible, Serene, Beautiful, Though-Provoking Yanks Vs Japs War Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During World War II, America and Japan are fighting for control of air and sea routes in the South Pacific. Landing on the key strategic island of Guadalcanal, a company of soldiers are ordered on a dangerous mission to recapture it from enemy forces.Malick's return to cinema after a twenty-year break is an intense, mesmerising, unique war film, which scores both as an incredible action piece and as a philosophical-poetic examination of conflict and death. I suspect many people don't like it because it's so strong in both areas - too pretentious for action fans and too exciting for cognoscenti - but this is its major appeal for me. The long, long battle scene to take the hill and then storm the airstrip is exhaustingly brilliant, supremely well executed and totally horrifying. The smooth direction and brilliant three-feet-off-the-ground photography by John Toll puts us right in the thick of the action - it feels so close, you can almost reach out and touch the reeds and the dirt. But equally important is the fear, excitement, anguish and revulsion the men feel, all of which is carefully documented and extremely thought-provoking. With the exception of Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, I've never seen a movie which so accurately and objectively depicts war, but is also so profound in its musings. The large ensemble's conflicts - Caviezel's fascination with nature, Chaplin's longing for his wife, Koteas' love for his men, Nolte's bloody ambition, Penn's insular weariness, Cusack's disillusionment, Savage's insanity - are touching, tragic and richly played. Featuring one of the prolific Hans Zimmer's best scores, and shot in incredible locations in Australia and the Solomon Islands. I do have one big problem with this movie however, and it's the demarcation of the people - there are six main characters and seven important supporting characters, most of whom are young men in identical clothes, which the film does a lousy job of distinguishing (particularly Caviezel and Chaplin, who look very alike) and the bottom line is if you don't know Who's Who in a movie, all dramatic tension can be lost. But don't let that, the running-time, or any of the naysayers of this truly original film put you off however - if you really want to see both the brutality and the beauty of war, you can't miss this. Based on a novel by James Jones (who also wrote From Here To Eternity), and filmed before in black-and-white in 1964.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice scenery, but the excessive use of imagery and introspection makes this more an exercise in contemplating your navel than a war film.If you want to see a recently made WW2 film with an interesting story and good acting instead of some artsy-fartsy coffee shop drivel, rent Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates instead. The quality of the acting in The Thin Red Line is quite good...too bad it's all overshadowed by the weird directing. I never read the novel, so perhaps I am being too harsh. Perhaps the director captured the tone of the novel perfectly. Whether or not that is the case, I can tell you that I wasted three hours of my life that I'll never get back. If I were to compare The Thin Red Line to a Vietnam movie, it would be more akin to Apocalypse Now than Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. This, IMO, is not a good thing. Be warned.Here's hoping that someday we will be treated to a (modern) well done WW2 film set in the PTO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Study of War and It's Inhumanity I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've viewed a tremendous number of "war" films in my life, and a number stand out as true classics for their cinematography, cast, authenticity, narrative quality, and intellectual content. "The Thin Red Line," which I screened only very recently (and viewed again the next evening), has emerged as my new personal favorite. Of course, it invites comparison with "Saving Pvt. Ryan," another outstanding work, but this film reflects -- and invites -- a far greater and richer depth of thought on the nature of God, the creation, humanity, faith, mortality, and morality. It does so through outstanding cinematography, powerful imagery, truly inspired editing, stand-out performances, tempo, superb score, and a great script . . . in short, all of the essentials of the com pleat art of film-making. It also does so devoid of any nationalistic or patriotic overtones, without glorification, and without any questionable plot devices. Philosophically and theologically, "The Thin Red Line" is a profound exploration and meditation in which each scene contributes symbolically and metaphorically to the dialectic struggle. Unlike so many films, intended to be stimulating but essentially passive entertainment, this film requires our active engagement, our thought. Here are individuals, each of them confronting the world, their beliefs, and themselves, struggling collectively in the crucible of violent conflict for survival, meaning, understanding, and ultimately, salvation. Note in particular the conflicts between Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) and Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), Cpt. Staros (Elias Koteas) and Col. Tall (Nick Nolte), and Sgt. McCron (John Savage) and . . . God. Beyond the obvious recognitions that human beings victimize themselves through war, creating our own hell out of paradise, and that all are victims, on both sides, there are no easy, simple answers in this film. That is as it should be. I was amazed, impressed, troubled, and very deeply moved. Is this film perfect? No, there are some minor issues (e.g., John Travolta's rather woody MacArthurian general?), but none that mar its overall excellence. I join others in calling for an extended "director's cut" with commentary, which unlike many other films, this work truly merits. Kudos to director and screenwriter Terrence Malick, cinematographer John Toll, editors Billy Weber and Leslie Jones, composer Hans Zimmer, and a great cast!ALSO RECOMMENDED: Saving Private Ryan, The Deer Hunter (note the work of John Savage in both films, thematically connected), Platoon, Das Boot, Apocalypse Now, King Rat, Cross of Iron, The Naked and the Dead, All Quiet on the Western Front.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst thing that happened to this movie was the date it was released in theatres here in Europe.I have to admit that when I saw this movie in the theatre it was shortly after I'd seen "Saving Private Ryan". That made me not like the movie that much as I was still under the awe (if I may call it like that) of SPR. I came out of the cinema a bit disappointed.Several years later I bought the DVD second hand. After a few month in the shelf I watched it and I have to say it's a piece of art. The directing, the music, the pictures are wonderful (as far as one can say that about a war movie). It's the only war movie I saw that doesn't only show war but also what the soldiers were thinking, how the same situation had a very different impact on the different people. Why some of them did the things they did, heroic or horrible.If you're in for a philosophical trip, ..... don't miss this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true masterpiece. I wont write a long comment on this one but just say a few things about it. This poetic, beautiful, melancholic movie is truly one of the greatest war movies I have seen. I believe this film depicts war in a very honest and truthfull way. If you want to feel what war is really like, the madness, the horror, what goes on in the mind of a soldier in a full out war this is definitely a film you must see. If you're more into action war movies and only want to see things blow up and leave the film without really learning anything don't bother. this movie is in my eyes right up there with Full Metall Jacket, Come And See, Apocalypse Now and Platoon. If you're more into Black Hawk down or When We were Soldiers patriotic war romance movies and haven't yet grasped the fact that war is never noble you wont like it. I also have to say that I did not like it much the first time I saw it when I was about 16 years old. When I saw it again at the age of 20 I loved it and I have now seen it 3 more times and it grows on me every time. What I want to get to is that I think many people have to see it more then one time to really appreciate it and you probably have to be mature enough to be able to appreciate a film that focuses on the psychological part of war and not only explosions and heroes. well give it a chance at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...after watching the movie, I just sat on the chair, staring out off the window, for a long time. all kind of thoughts ran through my mind, but none could take shape. I couldn't even cry. so this is the human nature. at its best and worst... it's a sublime movie. and a terrifying one. oh, the images...the soundtrack..the performances...the story...the overall picture... some complained that it's too long. well, this is not a standard movie. he could have left it 9 hours long, for all I care. I would have watched them nevertheless. this is real art, at its best... but other posters have said it all, a long time before me. nothing more to be added, I guess...I would dare say that in a way it's better that T.Malick didn't make too many movies. 'cause maybe they might have been more than we could take.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting analysis on the madness of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thin red line's base story is about American soldiers defending the Guadalcanal from the Japanese . What makes this film so more poignant than any other war film is that it's not about the body count,the friendship,the trials and tribulations of the soldiers,the war on terror etc. The thin red line conveys the individuality into the soldiers mental psyche, and in all this madness you've got a diverse handful of characters including the zen like Witt (jim caveizel),passive cpt staros (Elias Koteas),the extremely aggressive colonel tall (Nick Nolte),the introverted pvt bell (Ben Chaplin), the weary sergeant Welsh (Sean Penn), the aspiring cpt Gaff (John Cusack),the sadistically complex pvt dale (Arie Verveen) , the desensitized sergeant storm (John C. Reilly) , the confused pvt.fc Doll (Dash Mihok) and the muted corporal fife (Adrien Brody). From the opening shot of the crocodile slowly descending into the water conveying the "beast" of humanity , to the closing shot of the coconut growing a plant from a sand bank at low tide conveying 'a new life' you know you are in for a treat, Terrence Mallick is a visual poet and is a master of his craft still unequaled by any other contemporary director. The cast is nothing short of astounding, the best ones being Nick Nolte,Jim Caviezel,Sean Penn,Elias Koteas and Ben chaplin the film is more about visuals of nature than it is in words each soldier maintains their sanity in different ways from witt's escape to his tropical and beautiful island daydreaming to jacks fantasies of slowly holding and caressing his wife . The thin red line is just another prime example of essential cinema it is nothing short of virtuoso film making nor is it a film that tries to pursue the viewer to be empathetic towards the Americans or the Japanese . My final statement to describe it in one word would be sublime , thank you for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's only a Thin Red Line between the sane and the mad"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No other film about war captures me as has The Tin Red Line. Repeat viewings are always more satisfying than the last.Many seem to have missed what "The Thin Red Line" really means as a title, thus the quote from the booklet offered in the Fox Ware Classics DVD presentation.Recurrent themes are many in this film, spirituality in the face of the horrors of war. No film that I can think of deals with these themes in such a provocative and profound way. Certainly no film I can think of leaves such a lasting impression, nor inspires me to contemplate the nature of war, and indeed humanity itself on so many deep levels.Others have summarized the story and plot well enough, have dwelt upon the variety of character studies in the film and methodology for achieving these studies. What impressed me the most is that when we finally meet the enemy, in the machine gun bunker on the top of Hill 210 and then later during the "mopping up" is that the enemy is human too! The Japanese prisoners are visibly shaken and terrified of US soldiers they have just fought. They are frustrated, disillusioned, some are praying. A pivotal scene just prior too the assault on the Japanese bivouac shows just a Japanese face buried in the debris of battle, with a voice over comparing the viewer (an American soldier, and the audience or "us") with what that dead Japanese soldier was and hoped to be. He challenges us that we are not different after-all.Rather than American chest pounding bravado in victory over the "evil Japs" as in many other WWII Pacific Theatre films, we have moments where the enemy has a face, has emotions very like our own leading me to conclude that no matter how righteous the cause, war kills us all, that we all loose something by it's nature.Many feel that this is an "anti war" film, I'm not sure that this is so. I think TTRL paints an unflinching, profound poetic and philosophical look at war and what it does to men, to our world and to the other "earthlings". The struggle of the newly hatched yet mortally wounded bird in the midst of a battle scene brings this to a haunting reality every time.I hope that more people come to view this film for more than just another look at war, but for what it truly is, and exploration of what it is to be deeply human, in extraordinary circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing with death and the thin line that divides you from it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camera slowly moves through the long grass, you can see the tips of the mountains in the distance, the sun reflects down over the solders as they pass through the undergrowth. Setting the scene for The Thin Red Line. The solders are dancing with death. Every single scene captures the moment with perfection and precision. The Thin Red Line says so much through silence or music because it is expertly crafted. This is the definition of art and an example of a contemporary war film. The image of the tiny slash of blood on the moving grass is a very haunting one, that will always stick with me. And I can't forget the baby bird hatching underneath all the furious rage and hatred surrounding it. This gives the impression of peace fighting against the dying. The introduction is one of the best ever, the slow paced narration and the bright colours of the children swimming while the score plays asking you questions about immortality. A poetic vision of war, unsurpassed beauty and questions of belief. And also the study of obsession...The weather seems to suit the mood and fit in perfectly with the scene, an example would be the orange clouds passing over the mountains. One frame expresses everything that a character is feeling. You can see it through their eyes and their physical actions/expressions. An example of using acting as an art and the cast is amazing and filled with such great variety. The men are all different and all have different views and ways of dealing with a situation. The sweat sits on the solder's faces as they rock back and forward getting ready for a battle. The film has the elements of hide and seek as the men crouch along the ground with the fast whizzing sound of bullets buzzing over their heads and men screaming. You feel the strain, the stress, the anger that the solders are going through and the fear of dying alone. All this makes the movie so powerful and moving. The whole film feels tense, edge of your seat nail biting genius. I love the shots of the spraying light filtering out through the trees while men have the horror of waiting to die. The vast array of actors (everybody perfectly casted) in the movie all put on powerful and believable roles. I love the use of mist in the film to create atmosphere and the close up shots on the solder's horror stricken faces. Some of the most thrilling sequences and one of the most harrowing films ever made. The editing is another point that stands out to me, it is all precise and fits in perfectly at the right moments in time just like the score.Terrence Malik has established himself as a cult director; he makes films years and years after the previous. Though The Thin Red Line seems as though ages was spent preparing for it. Terrence Malik loves movies and knows all the techniques you can really see this when watching his films. He manages to capture the realism of war, the strategic combat of military. One of the main outstanding point of the movie is the way you never see the enemies faces or at least not clearly till that latter part of the movie. Possibly the most realistic war experience ever, apart from Saving Private Ryan. But whereas Saving Private Ryan is a brutally honest interpretation, The Thin Red Line is philosophical. Both are masterpieces no doubt about it. The personal director's message is an anti-war statement that will ring and out and haunt you till the credits close. You see the terrible evil things solders have to do during war in an un flinching perspective. The attention to the detail is astounding, the focus on animals in their natural habitats as well as the beautiful settings. Voice over, 1st person camera shots, beautiful imagery, stunning photography, amazing direction and a moving score make this a true masterpiece. A film that asks the viewer questions and morals of life at war, should you do what you think is right for your fellow men or do what your commander says? You see there are many ethical questions filtered with powerful mind numbing scenes that grab the viewer. The Thin Red Line is definitely not for the average viewer or someone who just expects lots of action, it's a thinking persons war movie rather like Apocalypse Now is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have had this DVD on my shelf for years now, and have recently dusted it off, sat down and watched it from start to finish. A lot of people can't even manage this with this film, with a running time of approx 160 minutes and during that only one major battle sequence. However, that's the only real complaint I can find myself thinking of.The film is from Terrence Malick (The New World) and sports the theme of human vs nature. It's obviously also a war film, and focuses on a load of soldiers fighting against the Japanese so they can take control of an air field. The film follows the soldiers from arriving at the island, to leaving the island....and in my opinion there isn't one dull or boring moment in between.Don't believe the trailer, at the end is boasts how many actors are involved, and although it certainly is true, the one misleading fact is that actors such as George Clooney and John Travolta are only seen for a matter of minutes. Instead, the film focuses on the characters of Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas. Everyone here acts to their best and we see Elias Koteas in his very best performance, as well as a stunning and emotional portrayal of love, loss and fear from Ben Chaplin, who uses memories and the hope of getting back to his wife (Miranda Otto) as a means to carry on. The flashbacks themselves are very well conceived, using the music to carry on the emotions between the couple and placing Miranda Otto's character in situations and places of dreamlike quality....they were conceived and executed perfectly and makes the character of Ben Chaplin all the more believable.The music and cinematography here are stunning. The music is beautiful but also haunting at the same time and helps stir the emotions, whereas the scenery never fails to mesmerise. It really makes you question brute force when you see a beautiful landscape get blown to hell by a raid of artillery and the effects of war and human invasion has on the animal inhabitants (e.g. a baby bird on the verge of dieing amongst a battle and a snake being caught up amongst a group of crawling soldiers).The battle(s) themselves are also tremendous....but anyone expecting the shaky-cam style of Saving Private Ryan will be disappointed. The action is realistic, but not gritty. The raid through a Japanese village is exceptionally emotional, following American troops as they chase the enemy through a village and witness them killing and being killed. The violence is not glorified, overly brutal or gory....but serves a reminder of how unsettling and emotional war can be like.The reason for why this film wasn't as much of a success as it should have been came down frankly to Saving Private Ryan, which was released around about the same time. This film, is not for the average movie-goer and needs a lot of attention and endurance from the watcher....it does not adhere to the conventions of normal war films, but then again acts and flows more like a piece of poetry than it does a war film.I urge everyone to at least try and watch this film.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Red Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is based on the novel by James Jones. The film takes place during the second World War and focuses on the soldiers and their battles in Guadalcanal. The film focuses on one soldier in particular named Private Witt. This film has won over 17 awards worldwide. The Thin Red Line has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good art direction and set decoration. The film is a gorgeous looking movie with great cinematography and photography. It is a beautiful film to look at. The film is a little slow in some spots, but overall it captured my attention and kept me interested. There isn't a lot of plot to this movie, but I liked how the film managed to show us what these characters went through and some of the struggles and different things that happened to them during this war. The one soldier that the film focuses on named Private Witt is a likable and kind character and I liked how we got to see the war from his perspective and his thoughts and views on it. This is a war movie, but it is done in such a way that it is much more of a war movie. Yes, it does have battle scenes and violent moments but there is also scenes where the soldiers travel around where there is little or no dialog and we focus on the beautiful scenery and feel curious and compelled to know what happens next. Probably much like the soldiers felt at the time. This is a compelling film and also a film that has some good character study and beautiful moments of scenery and moments of silence that make us appreciate the characters and the film so much more. This is a great movie and one of the best war movies in a very long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody poem every soldier writes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War movies are overdone and after two hours of blood and guts an audience doesn't walk away with much anymore. It takes a really moving film to be able to resurrect this tired genre from the ashes and the overlooked World War II drama The Thin Red Line was able to pull this off.The movie centers around several American soldiers at the battle of Guadalcanal in 1944. The separate soldiers hardly ever interact with one another and the movie's main focus is on each individual's private struggle and what they are going through both mentally and physically during this rough time. The movie's tag-line sums it up best with: "Every man fights his own war." The movie is about individualism and personal conflict, not brotherhood and teamwork which is what war movies usually focus on.Academy Award winning actor Sean Penn's (Mystic River) character finds himself confused and distraught over the war and hates himself for not being able to feel what everyone else is going through. Penn's buddy Private Witt may be neck deep in one of the bloodiest battles ever fought but his mind is swimming in the Pacific Ocean. Witt, played well by Jim Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ), is trying his best to isolate himself from what's going on and rush his way through the war.The character's struggles vary from a lost love to battle hardened colonel casting morals aside for his climb to the top. Each soldier's struggle is as real and emotional as war itself and are carried out wonderfully by this movie's all-star cast. It's easy for everyone to bond and relate with the characters and feel for them. This is a gripping feeling when one is used to watching the typical Hollywood movie or violent video game where watching young men get shot is as significant as seeing blades of grass get stepped on.Another theme common throughout the movie is the beauty of nature and how the grim visuals of war contrast with it's surroundings. The movie opens with a beautiful sequence of a tropical jungle filled with dripping leaves and exotic animals. It's only a matter of time before man's barbaric acts rip the landscape to pieces leaving nothing untouched, including the once placid indigenous island people. This is director Terrence Malick's poetic signature that is unique and very awe-inspiring.In today's world where violence and art are one in the same it's very bold for a filmmaker to direct such a magnificent movie that sacrifices killing time for a deep look into the human heart. Thankfully there are sensitive actors and filmmakers willing to embark on such an idea and make a beautiful movie out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go read the novel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'm not one of those perpetually whining people who watch book adaptations looking for excuses to rant about how inconsistent the adaptation was and such. In this case it was the opposite, I only even knew there WAS a book after watching the movie.So, I caught it on cable, and thought if it wasn't one of the greatest (anti)-war movies, it was right below them (like a Top 5 runner up). So I looked James Jones' novel up, looking for more of that insightful soulful search amidst the chaos ("if I never meet you in this life, then let me feel the lack"), and what I found was the extreme opposite, on hindsight realizing how lame this movie adaptation was when compared to it, or to the all-time anti-war favorites "Platoon", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" (or even "Band of Brothers", whether book or TV series). Now, mind you, it's not the case of concessions having to be made in the translation of one medium to the other, but rather of the writing/direction going to lengths to contradict the original in all it's main points! Overall, I believe this movie version (it left me very much curious to see the 1964 one) could be summed up as being about the finding and preserving of one's humanity amidst all the chaos and dehumanization of warfare, being the heroic plight of the foot soldier under the whims of "the high brass". Jones' book, however, could be summed up in 2 or 3 main points: -There's absolutely no heroics, only a collective unspoken lie, and absolutely everything that happens in military life, every action taken from the private to the general, is dictated by petty and boyish locker-room competition, pissing-contest style. Every character, even the more likable, is utterly petty and despicable to a greater or lesser degree; even Bell or Fife, who are portrayed as the most consciously sensible and least inhumane in C-for-Charlie, still dictate their every move by the role-playing of the general facade and bickering. -UNIMPORTANCE and NUMBNESS, both emphasized throughout: the sheer and absolute unimportance of oneself and one's actions, with the progressive numbness of body and ? more importantly ? mind, a last ditch shelter from feelings, till one does become the hollow fighting MACHINE a soldier is supposed to be. -Yes there is horror in war, the worst of which is to be found not without but within, in the realization of one's own actions (like the gold teeth hunting in dead bodies) and attitudes to everything witnessed.So, whereas the book brutally succeeds in being and x-ray exposing the ugly underbelly of warfare and military life, the movie becomes a seemingly censored version affirming the very things the book condemns! The godlessness and meaninglessness is replaced by the soulful search of an inner haven; the Captain's doubt of whether his refusal to carry on a suicide charge was in fear for himself or for his men is replaced by a wholesome fatherly love and caring for his men; the covert homosexuality (or rather the manly guys' "helping each other out") is downright omitted; the list goes on.Down to specifics (meaning HERE BE SPOILERS), no, there's no weirdly nonsensical but noble sacrifice by Witt (Jim Caviezel) to give an uplifting and transcendental climax to the movie; Witt is a whimsical self-important who storms out of the Company (he's actually long been transferred out of it) like a spoiled brat whenever he doesn't agree with something, only to sheepishly come back time and time again. The book ends with him contentedly as a Squad Sergeant, and the overall tone that, unless you are evacuated through a medical loophole, the drudgery will go on through the next campaign, and the next, right unto the grave. Neither there are those long exchanges about God, Man and World between an all-loving, tree-hugging Witt and a cynic, nihilistic atheist-who-wants-to-believe Welsh (Sean Penn, otherwise perfect on the role with his perpetual sardonic sneer). That's simply NOT THE POINT of the story! The chance of bringing to the wider popcorn-chewing public who'd never pick up a meager 500-page book this disturbingly thought-inspiring deconstruction of standards was wasted, for the sake of making one more movie that tells you more of the same: "war is hell, but deep down it brings out the noblest in man". A pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the more real war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is a thirsty man in search of water; cinema is his dowsing rod. And while in The Thin Red Line does not always bring forth what he is looking for, this artistic approach by itself makes the film more interesting, more firmly grounded in questions of humanity than your typical war film.I am sure I do not need to thoroughly go over the mundane details of plot with you, dear educated reader. Malick tells the tale of the taking of Guadalcanal, interspersed with two outside visions, two islands of calm - one soldier's tropical paradise, another soldier's distant household. The course of this one large piece of the Pacific campaign is punctuated by realistically crafted battle scenes and monologues which give voice to the inner fears and anxieties of several characters.The problem with a dowsing rod, however, is that although at times you are fortunate enough to find a well of insight, at times you can look a little silly getting the job done. Sometimes the voiceovers and the long-prolonged meaningful gaze can destroy the illusion of the film by being a bit too artsy with a capital A. There were a couple of times where I felt the psychological information conveyed in the voice-over was already present in the visual image, and redundant.However, these are quibbles that only keep this film from becoming a personal favorite, and do not prevent it from greatness. What makes it great, to my mind, is that it does not glamorize or make idols of the soldiers of World War 2. If I watch a typical Hollywood world war 2 film starring, say, John Wayne, and I look at my grandfather, a genuine world war 2 veteran, I cannot reconcile the two. When my grandfather speaks of the war, one element is always remembered: the horror, the hell on earth aspect. As we see our group of soldiers hunkered down, protected from fire by a ridge and ordered to kill themselves in a futile head-on assault, when we see men fall to the ground without style or grace, when we see a man have a nervous breakdown after a battle, it becomes impossible to watch the film and be given the chance to "play soldier". War is hell. All of the really great war films, from Hell's Angels to Paths of Glory understood this fundamental truth, and exploited it for these dramatic qualities.The combination of the truthfullness of the cinematic combat with the art-house sensibilities of Malick is a strange one, but ultimately more successful than not. As a director, Malick somehow manages to coax worthy performances from a bunch of no-names who are likely to go nowhere fast. He has the wisdom to realize that have a beach invasion take place during a bright sunny day is perhaps more frightening than a highly stylized overcast day, doom present in every large cloud. For we can relate to sunny, happy days.All throughout the film, my interest was engaged, and although I never quite fell into its charms fully, I certainly appreciated the cinematic work of this Mr. Malick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Malick Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HBO has scattered this film around its many channels in recent months to coincide with the release of The New World. In many reviews of Malick's current film, the word elegiac pops up. I can't honestly claim to know exactly what that word means but I'm pretty sure you could apply it to the Thin Red Line as well. I've never seen a film so full and yet so reticent at the same time. The running time is almost three hours and there is not much dialogue, despite the impressive cast (Penn, Nolte, Travola, Clooney, and Jesus himself, Jim Cavaziel), none of whom can really be labeled as "the lead." (maybe Cavaziel). Most descriptions of this picture begin with the photography, and rightfully so. Malick gets some amazing shots of the South Pacific islands, and its not hard to contemplate living a life in paradise. The action footages are fast paced and well-done; Malick can bring it with the best. It's also interesting to think that in a lot of ways, this movie was overwhelmed by the other WWII of 1998, Saving Private Ryan. It's hard to actually describe this movie, as much of its power lies in its haunting, elusive beauty. I'm not a huge repeat movie viewer, but I've probably seen this one at least 10 times, usually noticing something new each time. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetry On Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie for the "MTV Generation". This is not a movie for those with short attention spans. This is not a movie for people who want some disposable entertainment to "veg out" to. No. This is quite possibly, one of the deepest and thought provoking movies to have come out of Western cinema and is quite possibly to deepest view into the hearts and minds of men at war that has ever been seen. I think the perfect definition of this film would be to liken it to poetry on film. There is much introspection from the characters involved particularly the lead character (played by James Caviezel). To compare it to the likes of "Saving Private Ryan" which was released several months earlier would be unfair because "The Thin Red Line" goes about it's business in a far different manner. It does not try to "check the boxes" so to speak as regards the war movie genre. What it does do however, is portray a fascinating insight into the minds of these young men and the way they feel as regards the brutality that they see each day and their own mortality. Director Terrence Malick has triumphed here. As I said - It's not a movie to watch if you want some light viewing. But if you want something more substantial and thought-provoking. Then this could be the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a different kind of war movie, but very good and worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is an artistic look at James jones's novel about the guadalcanal conflict during World War 2. The film is shot in a brilliant and more artistic manner than most war films, as a result it seems a bit more uncut and surreal. Its also very long, however the story drags one in, and it has some beautiful cinematography (John Toll) and a great score from hans Zimmer to go with an all-star cast. The best performances of the film in my eyes were by Sean penn, James Caviezel and Elias Koteas. The other big faces also did good work, but these 3 gave the most touching performances in my eyes. Travolta, Cusack, Clooney, NOlte and travolta were all impressive as well. Malick's direction was good, this film would be a favorite of mine that I would watch over and over if only it wasn't so long, however running at almsot 3 hours, this film does an extraordinary job of covering the conflict. Its not the most enjoyable, but definitely a well-made film. 8/10 #201 on my list of all-time favorite films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward when this film came out to a realistic portrayal of men at war in the Pacific.Instead Terrance Mann gives us this artsy film of soldiers of an Army unit on Guadalcanal.We are first treated to scenes of the beauty of nature and this is shown in the thoughts of some of the soldiers.All the accounts that I have heard of described Guadalcanal as a fetid hellhole.I believe the troops on the island were more concerned with the malaria carrying mosquitoes,snakes and the ever present humidity.We also see the Japanese surrendering meekly in one scene;at this stage of the war few if any surrendered.A suicidal hari-kari or Banzai charge would have been their realistic fate.We also see the main characters relaxing in front of a campfire at night like a bunch of boy scouts.There would not have been any fires while out on patrol;the Japanese were experts at night infiltration and soldiers sitting at a campfire would have been rudely disturbed by a grenade or a samurai sword.However that being said there were some well done scenes such as the attempt to take the hill and the humane captain's reluctance to send men to their death in a frontal attack. ...I don't know if John Travolta would be my first choice as a cameo of a brigadier general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie it was in the theaters, about half way into it I thuroughly regretted it and thought to myself "This movie is boring why the hell did I pay 7 dollars to see this." Almost a year later my friend had it and I put it in out of boredom, not remembering what most of the movie was about. Maybe I matured since the first time I saw it, or it just took another look for it all to sink in but I realized how stupid it was of me to just glaze over it. This is the best war movie in my opinion much more realstic then other all other WW2 movies. This movie doesn't make the mistake that almost all other WW2 period films make, that is honoring veterans sacrifice by elevating the characters to infallibility. This movie doesn't BS the viewer it shows what soldiers actually thought of sitting in a hot jungle waiting to be shot, rather then packaging a soldiers emotions neatly for the viewer. I'm really ashamed to say the first time I saw it I couldn't see the truth in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you love voiceovers, here's your film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>War is supposed to be hours of tedium interrupted by moments of terror. At least Mallick has the first part down. The first half hour of TRL is nothing but voiceovers, and meditative ones at that. And he doesn't let up-the last scene has a soldier reflecting on Life, Fate, etc. The lugubrious music begins with Faure's Requium and descends from there. The battle scenes, such as they are, only deepen the musical mood. There's no helmet discipline, so we can admire Sean Penn's do. Many of the all-star cast (Travolta and Clooney for two) are in the film for one bare scene each. For Oceanic nature lovers, there are lots of shots of leaves, grass, birds, mammals, and running water. For the rest of us, there is just too much pomposity and too little action to make this film worth its nearly three hours of running time. (After this, I pulled out The Steel Helmet and watched it again-now *that's* a war film.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello. Just a couple of points as I have to go out now.I know this will probably never get read by anyone, but here it goes.I really enjoyed this film. I read earlier that someone described it as an experience; they felt they could walk around it. I wholeheartedly agree. I haven't felt that since I saw LA Confidential.I thought Travolta looked ridiculous and acted poorly.George Clooney might have been better if his part was allowed to develop more. He might well have been there purely to get the audience in, I don't know the actual state of play.A big name ensemble cast. This was a stroke of genius. By getting experienced, quality actors in to play relatively minor parts, such as Woody Harrelson, John Cusack etc, the film's atmosphere improved immensely. Although this comes from a comedy film, for an illustration of the difference a quality actor can make to a small part, see Wayne's World 2: the scene at the petrol station where Charlton Heston replaces a crappy actor. I mean it. These two actors, Cusack and Harrelson were superb in their roles. It didn;t appear like "Oh my god, its those two. Gosh aren't they great." It was as if we were actually watching and experiencing their lives at this point in time.The visuals were also stunning. The attack on the hill to get the machine gun bunkers was unbelievably tense, with oppressive greenery everywhere. I felt myself thinking: What;s hidden in there?Sean Penn. Wow. I keep forgetting what an amazing actor this fellow is. I recommend people see this and Carlito's Way for the proof of this guy's talent.Overall, what an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a slap in the face...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why must filmmakers of the last twenty-five years paint the fighting soldier, particularly the American fighting soldier, using a angst-filled, vile, butchering brush? Did the home front experience of the Vietnam War so scar these men that now make movies about those who actually went over there and did the fighting? The argument as to whether the Vietnam War was a just war is for another time and place, but in attempting to broaden that argument to cover all war in general, director Terence Malick has committed something akin to blasphemy in The Thin Red Line. By choosing to move such metaphysical musings to the heads of the soldiers fighting the World War II battle for Guadalcanal in the Pacific, he has distorted history, insulted veterans and completely misrepresented the values and beliefs of the American GI's who fought that crucial battle. Malick doesn't deserve all the blame, I suppose, as this film is based on James Jones' somewhat autobiographical novel from the early 1960s, a time when all of the free-love, no-man-is-right-over-another philosophy was beginning to gel amongst the intelligentsia of the world's youth. The book may be fantastic, but I can't say as I haven't had the pleasure of reading it. Whatever the quality of the source material, however, Malick has taken it and made a complete and utter mess of it. Sure, this film was his celebrated return to filmmaking after a twenty-year absence, and it received a Best Picture Oscar nomination, most likely just due to the awe in which Academy voters hold Malick. But this wasn't worth the wait.The plot (such as it is) follows four men, I think, as they struggle with finding meaning in the carnage of the Pacific War against the Japanese. I say that I think it was four men because two of them, played by Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin, look so remarkably alike that at times I couldn't tell them apart. One (Caviezel) plays the part of the Conscientious Objector, a chronic deserter who, after being picked up by the Army while living amongst island natives, is assigned to stretcher-bearer duty at the film's outset. By the end of the film, Malick shows the character's selfishness to be misplaced, but for certainly less-than-patriotic reasons. Another (Chaplin) is the one who was taken away from his young bride, and lives only to return to her. Again, Malick shows us the foolishness of such devotion by the film's end. The other two are thankfully a bit more discernible from one another. Sean Penn is a company sergeant who makes it his mission to show Caviezel's character the error of his ways, but by film's end, he finds more sympathy with the deserter than he would've imagined possible. Lastly is the battalion colonel (Nick Nolte), who drives his men relentlessly to take a well-defended Japanese position, one that his underlings believe impossible to take. While Malick shows the Colonel to be right, we're to understand that it is more for the colonel's fear of missing out on his share of military glory than for the higher cause of victory, because he flat-out tells his subordinates so! How ridiculous a notion. Other characters drift in and out of our vision, played by A-list stars like Woody Harrelson and John Travolta and John Savage, mumbling about vines consuming trees and soldiers being like children to their Captain-fathers, none of whom ever make any mark with us save as examples of the Hell of War. Their voice-overs almost overlap, allowing us to eavesdrop on their confusion, their fear and their cowardice. The imagery of this movie is breathtaking. Don't let it be said that I didn't acknowledge that. Malick has not lost his visual touch during his extended vacation, but he has obviously not advanced beyond his mid-70s thinking. Whatever things the Vietnam War may have been, World War II was almost none of them. That war was a just war, and the soldiers fighting it knew it. American men were lining up in droves to volunteer to go and crush an evil power that had attacked us and swore to destroy us, and only a microscopic few had any problems with self-doubt or introspection about `why nature must contend with itself' or finding the `evil inherent in all men' that the wretched souls in this film have. I shudder to think of what my veteran grandfather, God rest his soul, would've said about these pansies.The film is so without a logical structure that I suppose it's possible Malick himself didn't know exactly what he wanted to say. He worked on this material so long that he might have simply drifted away from the novel's original intent. I doubt this, though. Say what you want about the politics of filmmakers, their skill is rarely debatable, and filmmakers of Malick's caliber put on the screen exactly what they intend. It's just so puzzling and disappointing that what he intended here was such a slap in the face to so noble a struggle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghastly, pretentious mess of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I don't think 'The Thin Red Line' was a rip-off of 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's an infuriatingly stupid attitude to take towards the two films. Working on that basis 'Platoon' must be a rip-off of 'Apocalypse Now' since they are both set in the Vietnam War. 'Private Ryan' is also terrible, but that's largely due to the fact that Spielberg produced a slickly directed peice of jingoistic, sentimental art-as-propeganda (William Goldman dismissed it as 'an execrable piece of sh*t', and I heartily agree). But 'The Thin Red Line' plumbs new depths by actually appearing to be something of artistic quality. Terence Malik is a fine director, 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven' are both excellent films, but TTRL is nothing short of disastrous. It sprawls. It doesn't cohere. It looks beautiful but has nothing so say other than the usual trite and hackneyed mesages about mans inhumanity to man and the human condition. There are far too many characters, so we aren't actually given the opportunity to see any of them develop satisactorily. Perhaps Malik wanted to show how hundreds of little stories were being played out, with the war itself merely a huge framing device. On the other hand a more cynical, and accurate, perspective would be that lots of extraneous parts were written for the huge number of A-list actors who wanted to attach their name to such a project.The film is also too long. There's nothing wrong with a 3 hour plus running time if the narrative can sustain it. But about 10 times during the last hour the music swells, the camera pulls up into the sky and the screen fades. On each occasion I was halfway out of my chair before it cut back to another boot camp sequence. This was because I genuinely felt the film had ended. Had there been conflict I felt was unresolved, or a plot that hadn't satisfactorily ended I would have stayed seated awaiting it's conclusion. But since the film is essentially one big non-event with no perceptible story or point it could have ended anywhere with no bother. Someone really needed to sort out the editing, and leave a lot of the self-effacing cameos on the floor.Needless to say the critics loved it. 'An overlong, superficially meaningful war movie by a reclusive director coasting on past glories, with a huge cast and aspirations to making some kind of meaningful statement? I'm There!'. It's also the kind of film you can't just come out and say you hated. The usual response is 'Oh you just didn't understand it.' Oh, but I did. I understood it only too well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Thin Red Line is one of those movies where the audience either loves it or hates it. I have yet to view a comment in which a person thought the film was moderately entertaining. People have either exclaimed their complete frustration and utter disatisfacton with the movie or have praised it as a masterpiece, there is no middle ground. This type of movie grows better and better with each viewing, I must admit after watching it for the first time it was difficult to make sense of who was narrating at a particular time. The complexity of emotion and desire in this movie are astounding to say the least.Another IMDB user mentioned that the tactics and strategy that the U.S. soldiers utilized while attempting to take the hill was unrealistic. My advice is that this person study WW2 infantry tactics or at least watch the History Channel. Human waves was a common method used by all sides of the war(especially the Japanese).Anyway, I'll refrain from turning my review into a long essay and end in saying that this movie(and A Midnight Clear) rank as a couple of the best movies ever made. This movie is perfect in every way. 10 out of 10 is my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't believe the negative comments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this film has got bad ratings due to the fact it is a war picture - most people expect action, action, action or CHEAP melodramatic moments for emotional involvement i.e. every soldier bites the dust during the course of the film except the main star(hmm Saving Private Ryan). Furthermore, the influx of new war films of late, have led to many revisiting past ones such as the Thin Red Line. This is where the negative comments stem from since Thin Red Line deviates so much from the other batch of war films. It is a film more about human soul and nature, set in the backdrop of war rather than an out an out 'war' film with a set goal (e.g. secure the fort!). For the record I have seen it with 2 other people and they didn't get it, so they didn't like it. The Thin Red Line is like fine wine, you have to taste enough of (and a variety of) it before you can really appreciate a fine one. And this is one. This film is so much more. This was the first film I saw from Malick. I have since seen Days of Heaven, and that is even more accomplished as an example of poetic moving imagery (although not as good as The Thin Red Line since it lacks the any real substance, intelligence, characterisation - merely a series of beautiful moving images, albeit extroadinary ones). I must say Malick is an outstanding visionary. The Thin Red Line is magnificently shot with its long sweeping shots and panoramic views. Expect a certain stillness and beautiful calmness to the cinematography, which complements the somewhat philosophical nature of the film. However Malick does make use of a more frantic camera motions and movements during the 'cleanup' of the japanese camp - but not just for the sake of it (i.e. the MTV style so prevalent today), but to emphasise the sheer terror, chaos, brutality of the battle. It makes you question the justification and futility of such barbaric acts of war. This is in stark contrast to his more measured thoughtful direction of the hill siege for example. Thank goodness the more thoughtfully still and relaxed art of directing, is still around. Others have argued the film is pretentious. Me? I hate pretension in films if abused. I'm an Bergman fan but even he is sometimes prone to too much 'arty poetic' talk in his films. I hated Apocalypse Now since the actors would break in a long boring philosophical speeches at every opportunity. The film is very overrated and not a patch on The Thin Red Line. Many find this an enigmatic statement since I love philosophy, plus Apocalypse Now and the Thin Red Line are considered to be from the same mold of film. For me, Apocalypse Now seemed more like an out of control binge on pointless philosophy just for the sake of it. Not all of it really added to the film (thats just me). In the Thin Red Line I could connect to the philosophy narratives, they revealed insights into the psyches and feelings of its characters, rather than just being there to make the film 'philosophical'. They elicited feelings and emotions from its viewers (from me at least). The Thin Red Line is never manipulative in the same ways that Saving Private Ryan is (a film which has its detractors from those stuck up elitist circle of critics I detest so much; but for all its negatives its still an accomplished film).Clearly Malick put his heart and soul into this film (his first for 20 years) to craft a profound, unforgettable and dreamlike piece of melancholic, poetic art. It may not have the most realism. It may be unconventional in both its narrative and plot, but those who understand it, those who yearn something a little different, something with a little more intelligence will find that it is a film which resonates a sense of euphoria through the mind and soul. Incidently others who like this should try the other James Jones film 'From Here to Eternity' (53). Not the same type of film (in a philosophical sense), although like The Thin Red Line its a war film concentrating on its characters rather than the war. Its a prime e.g. of a Hollywood film, but its an absolutely CRACKING one with the same type of theme, i.e. a somewhat rebellious soldier who, while treated/punished bad by the army still loves it. Also planned is 'Whistle' form Sidney Lumet. Not yet released but considered part of a trilogy to From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line. Can't wait.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how many people have given this a bad review. They complain about it being unrealistic. OK, I ask, based on what? The movie is based on James Jones novel which is partly autobiographical, to my understanding. I can see some of being done for dramatization, but being unrealistic, come on! The next bit of nonsense is the idiotic comparison the "Saving Private Ryan". Apples and oranges. "Private Ryan" is nothing more than one giant cliched war film by Hollywood Spielberg. Had Spielberg directed this film instead of "Private Ryan", you all would be saying the same crap about that film. This movie has better acting, WAY better cinematography, and a much more talented director at the helm. I think the people that hated it don't understand it at all. It's not a war film, in the traditional sense. It's about the effect war has on nature and the men involved. The fact that this lost out to "Ryan" at the Oscars is the biggest tragedy. Shows you that Spielberg runs Hollywood.This is a thinking man's film. Essentially, the people who have the brain power to understand this film play chess, the rest play checkers. They read novels. The rest read comic books. Apples and oranges. Think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant use of environment as character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the aspects of the film that resonated with me was Malick's use of nature as character, as the impartial observer of the follies and tribulations of man. For example, that amazing scene when the soldiers are running across the hillside, and suddenly drop into the waving elephant grass and disappear as though they had never existed exemplified for me both the transience and insignificance of humanity, thus the pitiful insignificance of the whole opera of suffering that is war. And of course the persistence of nature, and its imperviousness to the above as exemplified by the coconut sapling on the beach in the last shot. The actors were all fine, but the finest character in the film was nature itself.I suppose I could spend all day raving about this movie (I think it's one of probably the five finest films ever made), but I'll just leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this film was great. It did not just deal with war but with suffering and the meaning of life. This film actually gave me a sense of peace after watching it. This film is a war film but much more than that it is a film that challenges people to think about life in ways that they may never have before. The cinematography was beautiful, the performance, especially by Jim Caviezel were superb, and the battle scenes were harrowing and extremely well done. I was glad Terrence Malick decided to make this film (since he had not done a film since 1978's "Days of Heaven"). It's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazingly complex film. The realism is breath-taking. I was impressed by the depth of the ensemble cast - even minor roles are well acted. The movie is lyrical at times, especially when the beauty and serenity of the natural world is set in juxtaposition to the banality and horror of war. I was also moved by the way the natives reacted to the war, and in particular to Pvt. Witt.There are two things in particular that I believe set this film apart from others in this genre. One is the in-depth examination of several characters' motivation for their actions. This sets a moral tone that runs throughout the film. The confrontation between Capt. Staros and Lt. Col. Tall cuts to the heart of the matter: every victory is paid for with lives.The second truly rare aspect of this film is its depiction of the enemy as people, just like us. You see it in the faces of the soldiers when, after great sacrifice, they finally overrun the Japanese positions. This realization, that we are all the same inside, is what makes this film unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even better than "Saving Private Ryan"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1998 was truly a remarkable year in a cinema history. It was the year of a two extremely spectacular war movies: Steven Spielberg's breathtaking "Saving Private Ryan" and Terrence Malick's outstanding "The Thin Red Line". Filmmakers produce war flicks all the time, certainly, but these two movies happened to became instant larger-than-life classics and both turned out to be the very finest movies of the whole genre. That's something that doesn't happen every year. Terrence Malick is a very interesting personality. In the 70's he directed two beloved and celebrated film classics, "Badlands" (1973) and "Days of heaven" (1978). Then, when he was considered a highly respected filmmaker he wanted to take a "little" break. Audience had to wait 20 years for his next movie "The Thin Red Line". When I watched it as well as "Saving Private Ryan" for the first time I was certain of myself - I found "The Thin Red Line" even slightly better than Spielberg's awarded spectacle.While ago I watched "Saving Private Ryan" again and now this one. I had to be sure is "The Thin Red Line" really the better one. Now I'm sure. In some ways, it's definitely better. I know many of the IMDb users don't agree with me so I guess I have to state reasons for my opinions. These two films look and feel like completely different and "The Thin Red Line" has got much more heart and intelligence in it. "Saving Private Ryan" was definitely technically the superior one. Phenomenal camerawork of it was unbelievably wonderful but I guess no one can expect less from a wizard called Spielberg. On the other hand "The Thin Red Line" is soulful, poetic, meditating, artistic and even hypnotic experience. It shows brilliantly how war in all of it's madness effects on different people.Soldiers come in the middle of a beautiful wild jungle full of fascinating wonders of nature in order to kill. In those sceneries everything looks so senseless and it's so difficult to get an answer to the obvious question "why". Movie takes constant glances to a various animals in the positions where the soldiers are moving or fighting: there's snake, owl, butterflies, parrots and bats as well as many other creatures. For example that sorrowful, tragic image of a little baby bird struggling for its life in the middle of a battlefield is a moving picture and it lasts only few seconds but nevertheless it can haunt in your mind days after. Unlike in "Saving Private Ryan" there are no heroes or winners in this movie, only losers. I'm not suggesting that "Saving Private Ryan" tries to glorify war (which I find disgusting), of course it showed it as the hell it really is. But it made the war acceptable in some cases: saving Private Ryan was a reason enough to kill and get killed. Typical theme of patriotism is always a minus. "The Thin Red Line" doesn't make the enemies look like only faceless, heartless monsters. It's not afraid to show the suffering in the enemy side - after all we are all people. Cast of the film is quite astonishing. How many movies can you name with as much notable and famous actors? There's Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, Tim Blake Nelson, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Dash Mihok, John Savage, Jared Leto, Adrien Brody, John Cusack, Ben Chaplin, James Caviezel, Elias Koteas...hell, the list seems almost endless. And yet nobody's in the actual leading role. Even the biggest stars don't necessarily get much screen time. For example after the beginning we unfortunately will no longer see John Travolta and people who are about to watch "The Thin Red Line" only in order to see George Clooney will certainly be disappointed to notice that they have to wait over two and a half hours and then, at the end of the film he only has one incredibly brief appearance in one scene. But it's not a problem and it doesn't make the film bad. "The Thin Red Line" is something special, it's something peculiar as well as sensational. It's not an easy movie because it makes the audience think lot harder than war flicks generally and I guess some day I have to watch it for the third time to understand it yet even better but it's definitely an excellent and stylish motion picture masterpiece and a splendid way to spend nearly three hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>takes you to another place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is the best war film I have ever seen. But I hate to classify it as that, because if you do and someone reads that it's a war film, they're going to expect Saving Private Ryan. The two were compared when first released because they were released the same year and were both up for Oscars. However, the two are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FILMS WITH DIFFERENT INTENTIONS. So, I won't waste time, energy or space comparing the two.There is a stellar, all-star cast, but there really is no star. The film has a flexible narrative and the story adapted from James Jones' novel is told from different points of view. This is a problem for today's audiences who are not open minded when watching a film that doesn't play like a standard popcorn flick or T.V. movie. Like Mulholland Drive a viewer can come in the middle of it and not really miss anything as far as not understanding what's happening now. It's like an or circular film that just keeps going - like the war for the soldiers that never seems to end.This film has been criticized so many times, for so many different reasons. And those who criticize it, also criticize those who like it, saying that they (the people who like it) think that film is philosophical, when really it isn't. Or theat the philosophy is only sophomoric. But the film is about the soldiers and I would doubt that these soldiers were Philosophy majors, so if the philosophy is sophomoric (which I don't feel it is) it's because they are. But I should point out and remind people that Terrence Malick taught Philosophy at MIT, and I would think he has a better comprehension of it that the people who are criticizing his use of it.I also think that the people who criticize this film are the same hypocrites who hated 2001: A Space Odyssey, until it became a classic, and then started to like it. The Thin Red Line is a film that is ahead of an audience. Like the work of Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch, the film takes more than one viewing to fully understand, which may be impossible. But if you're open minded enough, it is such an enjoyable movie in its grandeur. That is another thing people dislike, its pretensions. But how do they expect Malick to deal with a subject as broad as WAR, and not just a group of soldiers, and avoid the possibility of pretension? Most war film deal with a select few that we as an audience get to know. We don't here. We only get to glance. And we glance at so many people it's hard to KNOW any of them. I have not fought in war, but I would assume that is what it is like. You'd get to know who you're close to, but the others, you would just see.I think that this film is more realistic about war than most. We don't just see a constant attack. We see the quieter moments. Not all war is fighting, sometimes the hardest times are when nothing happens in life. People always say to "keep busy". Well what happens if you don't?We see the women in these soldiers' life (another thing criticized). I don't know about you, but if I was alone in a war, I'd probably be thinking about the good things in life too - which unfortunately may also turn out to be bad.The acting in the film is superb. Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson, Jim Caviezel are all fantastic. The music is awe inspiring. When the main theme hits a certain point, a few minutes in it's breathtaking. The cinematography - the island - is like a character in itself. Man's war is at the same time a war against nature, against our environment. I can't remember any other film that took such an effective turn in using the camera to make the viewer seem like you are in the film.I can still remember some of the images. They're imprinted like a photograph burned onto paper.Whether people admit it or not, this film is a masterpiece. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. And I am glad that I had an open enough mind so that I could see that film for what it is - a work of true art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the argument that SPR is for idiots while TTRL is for intellectual elitists is a weak and misguided one. I enjoyed SPR the first time I saw it, though I didn't initially think it to be a masterpiece, and still don't. The first time I saw TTRL I must confess I spent the entire ride home thinking whether or not I'd liked it.I have since purchased the DVD and must say that it is now high on my list of all time favorite movies-not war films, because as many have noted, this really isn't a war film so much as it's a meditation on the nature of nature, set amid WWII. For all you "professional warriors" out there, relive, as I'm sure you do, what you know to be the truth of war in your heads and leave storytelling to filmmakers.I have seen few films in recent years whose beauty and deliberate obscurity are so staggering and, as Martin Scorsese has already deemed it, this is one of the very best movies produced in the nineties. It requires focus whereas SPR demands only that your eyes and ears be working-your brain can actually be elsewhere and thematically, you are not likely to miss anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i watched this movie was when it was out on video in 1998.And i can't remember anything about the movie.I could not understand it so i didn't like it but 3 years later in i say to myself "Going to watch the Thin Red Line again".And this time i liked it i really liked it .It was great simply great.Now i understand why i didn't liked it the first time i saw it.Because i didn't not focused myself enough on it.I wanted to see a war movie with boms and shooting and ect..ect..but that is not what this movie is about.The thin red line goes deep in to the mind of several persons in there way of surviving and there way of living in the hard jungle.It's about dead and how to escape from a place where this people did not want to be in the first place.Like private Whit played by Jim Cazeviel who did a fantastic job in acting. Anyway the movie is a masterpiece and i think it's better then than Saving Private Ryan.(Also a great movie that i will watch again for a second time ).But if you din't like it the first time watch it a second time and you will like it.You wil cry and you will get a cold turkey for the whole time you watched the movie.I give it a 10/10 .yes i do</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a masterpiece.The Thin Red Line is a dance between Poetry and Philosophy that has the courage to ask us to examine the scope of humanity, in a war set in Paradise. What you take away from this film is unequivocally yours. Yes, this is a long film. In return, you get the limits of human experience in its rawest, most visceral form. You see painted sunsets and swim in crystal water simply because we as humans revel in beauty, and you'll see blood pour from wounds because we're capable of that too. You may fail to notice, but you'll be spared Spielberg's Spiky Club O' Morals, and the subtlety associated with that. I promise you won't miss the indignity of seeing a fullscreen American flag waving over the remains of the universally dead.See this movie. Stay to observe the tragic farce of dying at the top of a ridge from something as inglorious as dehydration, only to receive more than you can drink when they sprinkle the green grass over your grave. Stay for the look on John Cusack's face when he's risked his and other's lives to be told "You don't know what it feels like to be passed up.." If for nothing else, stay to see the one film that can pull off a scene with a woman on a swing without cliche.Will you enjoy this movie? Maybe, maybe not, The Thin Red Line is definitely not a casual entertainment, but even if it counts for nothing, I consider this the best film of all time. 10/10(.. did you notice the birdcage? :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking, in any sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading most of the comments listed I felt compelled to add my own. Reason for this is that I feel that this movie is being misunderstood by a lot of people. The basis for this misunderstanding is IMHO that most people regard this movie primarily as a war-movie. This is understandable since the movie is situated in WW II and features a lot of fightingaction scenes. However, as the tagline for this movie also reveals, it's more about the battle that each man (read individual) is fightig for himself. What struck me most while watching this movie were the shifts of perspective that Malick (the director) offered his audience. Demonstrated most clearly by a scene in which a soldier after being hit by a bullit falls backwards on the ground and in his last moments looks at the beautiful environment of the island. In other words: the horrors of the dreadful war which were up till then all he experienced, disappeared after he was no longer part of the army (and the western civilization) and at that moment he could experience his true place, in nature, on earth. This is only a small example of all the beautiful, eye-opening scenes that this movie offers it's viewers. Apart from the above there is also the awesomely beautiful cinematography, like I said in the title of this comment, it is breathtaking. All in all I am not afraid to state that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen (it resides in my all-time top three). Last recommendation: If you are looking primarily for the action and suspense of a war-movie let this movie pass. If you are looking for a movie about war and life watch this movie, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

This film is only for intelligent and sensitive people, not for stupid arrogant ones. Persons who ever felt sorrow, separation, love and pain will like it very much. No doubt this movie is just great and it is hard to describe why. Action scenes are more than simple action scenes. They include sophisticated emotions and thoughts. They contain philosophy. The film helps you to understand world better. You'll know more about women, the role of genders, nature. It makes you accept death. Everybody see it!</fullReview>

I consider myself a patient moviegoer, but I kept expecting it to end. When I talk about the cinematography, don't get me wrong. It's some of the most beautiful, color-rich cinematography I've seen in any movie; but if they took out many of the shots of wildlife, and plants, the movie would've been a good 45 minutes shorter.

		<shortDescription>as unexpected as it is brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this to be one of the most intelligent and worthwhile pictures ever made. Terrence Malik's use of cinematography as a continuity device is as unexpected as it is brilliant. He touches on the same devotion and innovation as the French Impressionist filmmakers, who were the first to explore the possibilities of using the camera to describe character's inner thoughts and feelings. Malik leaves the viewer caught in the action, unsure exactly of how each soldier fits into the grand scheme of things, and without any real idea of the direction of the film and how it is going to end. The result of which leaves the viewer disorientated, confused, and not at all sure what to think (whilst at the same time filled with despair).Unfortunatly such style of filmmaking isn't ever appreciated by a wide audience, and the film and Malik have received as much criticism as acclaim. It is so unfortunate that a large portion of the movie-going public don't appreciate films that are not purely entertainment pictures, if only they realised what they're missing! I took a lot more away from this movie than any film I can remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War as nihilism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this and noticed that the previous viewer had given up after about a tenth of an inch of tape, not having rewound it. I could see why. This begins as an arty war movie that is not doing either the arty or the war part right. I would have given up on it myself except that it had been nominated for a number of awards, and I knew there had to be something I was missing. So I occasionally rewound the tape and listened and watched carefully. Gradually something began to build. The impressionistic and stream of consciousness techniques began to pull me in and to mesh with the flashbacks and poetic voice-overs to make a meaningful contrast with the jungle and carnage. The studied camera work with the long takes on the faces of the soldiers, interspersed with panoramic vistas of jungle and mountain and naturalistic shots of tropical island animals, lead me to believe that in making this, Director Terrence Malick had taken Shakespeare as his muse, in particular the celebrated words from MacBeth: "...(Life) is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing."As other critics have pointed out, Malick's movie does indeed signify nothing, and perhaps that is the point. But I am somewhat troubled by such an interpretation of our involvement in World War II. I would feel more comfortable had such a point of view and attendant techniques been employed in depicting our involvement in Vietnam or even in World War I. But to imply that the sacrifices made by our soldiers at Guadalcanal and elsewhere in the South Pacific were for nothing is entirely off base. Almost any war fought anywhere is a monumental waste; but if there is one exception is it without doubt World War II. We had no choice but to oppose European fascism and the expansionist policies of Imperial Japan. I shudder to think what the world would be like now, had we not. Imagine being surrounded by totalitarian regimes with their gas ovens and their slave labor, their policies of racial and cultural genocide. By comparison, such a reality would make George Orwell's "1984" nightmare seem a benign fantasy.I am also wondering how James Jones himself would feel about this impressionistic interpretation of his realistic novel. He was one of a generation of writers, including Norman Mailer and James Michener, who found their inspiration in the war in the Pacific. He is also the author of From Here To Eternity (1951), made a couple of years later into an academy-award winning movie starring Burt Lancaster (an excellent movie, by the way). I suspect that Jones would have to feel some ambiguity toward Director Terrence Malick's production of this sequel. Jones certainly did not feel that our participation and experience in World War II was meaningless. Nor was his personal experience meaningless. Furthermore to make his novel into a revisionist impression of war as nihilistic hell misses not only the spirit of his novel but the entire point of our involvement in World War II.I wonder how those who survived the horrific experience of Guadalcanal and similar battles feel about this movie. I wonder if they think it was accurate and fair and expressed their sense of experience.The performances by James Caviezel as Pvt. Witt and Sean Penn as First Sergeant Welsh were excellent. Nick Nolte as Col. Gordon Tall was also good, although he occasionally reminded me of George C. Scott doing General Patton. Perhaps the best sequence in the movie was the recollection in flashback by Pvt. Jack Bell (Ben Chaplin) of his sensual wife back in the states and the agony of being separated from her, and then the brutal knife of her letter telling him she had fallen in love with another man. The inclusion of a third element, that of the Pacific Islanders themselves amid the strife as innocents watching the gladiators, was valuable as perspective. However what might have been added was the brutality and enslavement they experienced at the hands of the Japanese military. Malick gave us none of that perhaps because such a view might have detracted from his purpose, that of depicting war as an expression of our nihilistic nature. Incidentally some have said that this treatment owes something to Tim O'Brien's short story, "The Things They Carried," or even to the spirit of the Thomas Hardy poem, "The Man He Killed." Certainly there is an intentional allusion to Carl Sandberg's poem "Grass" when one of the soldiers holds up some grass and says something like, "This is us." O'Brien's short story was an intense focus on the artifacts carried by soldiers and what the bare artifacts implied. Yes, I believe Malick was influenced by O'Brien, certainly in the sense that this is a strongly visual film. It's what our eyes see that counts, and not so much the story or what is said.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the war film genre given a new landmark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line has quickly become my favourite film of all time. I didnt feel this way after seeing it for the first time, but the thing with this film is that it works into you. a day after you've seen it, you're still thinking about it. it was the same with Saving Private Ryan, but in a different way.Where as with Ryan, you were more affected by its horror, The Thin Red Line makes you think differently about war, and its effects on the lives of the soldiers, and the crime war is against nature. or is it a crime against nature? is it just that war is part of our nature, and we can do nothing to stop it?These are the questions that The Thin Red Line asks, literally, and various characters have voice overs during the film, which keeps the audience thinking and mulling over.I really enjoyed the variety of characters which Malick has withdrawn from the novel by James Jones novel. all interesting in their own way, especially Private Witt (jim caviezel), and his fascination with death.To top off a fantastic film, the direction is visually stunning aided by superb cinematography from John toll, who won two Oscars in a row for Legends of the Fall, and Braveheart. He should have won again, but lost out to Saving Private Ryan. If you have to see one war film in your life... make it The Thin Red Line. This is the film which blows me away every time i watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only film I consider poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than just a war movie, The Thin Red Line addresses the fundamental question of how a world so beautiful can be so cruel. Unlike Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan, Malick does not provide answers, but instead shows how different men in a company face the jarring reality of war. Malick artfully brings to life each character (unfortunately some of the star power in the film distracts from the personal and ordinary lives of the soldiers). Each one has his own problems, but all are subsumed under the reality of being in the war. Also this movie does not dwell in the orgy of violence that Spielberg indulged in. Instead it achieves greater emotional impact in showing the absolute beauty of the tropical paradise where the violence occurs (note: The Thin Red Line would be one of the most violent war movies ever if Saving Private Ryan hadn't raised the bar so high). Malick has created an absolute masterpiece, an emotional and interesting story that creates questions, not answers them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never have been so riveted to a movie as I was to "The Thin Red Line".It seems to have also become a great divider among people with either it's great or it sucked/boring comments. It's becoming pointless to argue if it is a good movie or not. If you go in with the notion that Clooney or Penn will save the day and defeat the evil Japanese you'll no doubt be disappointed.Can you imagine the guts (or lack of brains depending on what side of the fence your on) it took for Malik to have the actors he had assembled on this one and only show the big names for brief scenes? I also have to hand it to the studio heads for allowing this one to ever hit the theaters.I have seen it 5 times now on DVD and still do not truly understand it but I still cannot believe how a film can grasp one's soul as this one does. Malick has entered new territory with The Thin Red Line and this will be a film that will be watched and appreciated for many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly deep and remarkable film. However, the lack of gory and fast paced action scenes like other war films (notably 'Saving Private Ryan') means that many people expecting to see an action film will be disappointed and bored. Many of my friends didn't enjoy this film, they believed it was 'boring'. There is action, however this is not so much an action or war film as an anti-war film. Showing the effect of battle on the mind.I really enjoyed this film; it gives you lots to think about and it is beautifully directed with stunning scenery. The score is lovely and the characters well created and depicted. The characters are the focus, yet, without basing the film around one central character, the director has managed to allow the audience to relate and sympathise with them.This film is brilliant, I have only one criticism and this may be just that I am not American; but it seems that a few of the characters sound very similar, and look very similar in their combat hats, making it a little difficult to keep track in some places. Although overall I loved this film and thought it was very intelligent and well worth the long running time.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Much Competition; The Best Film of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1998 was easily one of the greatest years ever for movies and "The Thin Red Line" was the best film of that year. Terrence Malick came out of a 20-year directorial hibernation to write and direct one of the best films I have ever seen. The story follows the C for Charlie Company through their nightmarish experience at Guadalcanal in 1942. They are sent to the South Pacific island to overtake an area that is going to be used as an airspace for the Japanese army. From the strange landing on the island, where there seems to be no Japanese army on the land at all, to the final frames, "The Thin Red Line" is crafted perfectly by the eclectic Malick. Every 30-second frame of this film could be dissected and analyzed by the finest of film students and even then one would not likely be able to get to the heart of this film. It's that well-crafted and complicated. Every noise, camera shot, and reaction from an actor has a meaning in this film. This film is not for those easily distracted, the squeamish, or those with short attention spans. All 2 hours and 50 minutes of this film are imperative, missing even the smallest of scenes could destroy the whole point of the picture. Many critics and most of the mainstream audience misinterpreted this film in some way. If one is not careful it is easy to do that. The fact that "Saving Private Ryan" came out during the same year stole much of this film's thunder when it became available to both the critics and the audience. Is this film better than "Saving Private Ryan"? In my opinion it is by the smallest of margins. True they are both great films but "The Thin Red Line" is a film that, if you really sit down and absorb it, will stick with you for a very long time. It's one of those films that you can see 12 times and you will still see something new the 13th time you see it. It did not win any of the seven Oscars it was nominated for (even though it probably deserved to for Malick's Adapted Screenplay at the very least), but I think the effect of "The Thin Red Line" will make it the most memorable film of 1998 when we look back at it 20 years from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, pretentious, an awkward film. I mean 20 years of waiting and I get nothing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is by no means the masterpiece the critics hype it up as. In fact, it is one of the most pretentious films ever, it had a great screenplay, but with the numerous flashbacks, repetitive voiceovers, and its big, all-star cast wasted, it seems like a disaster.The Thin Red Line could have been an excellent film, I was walking into the cinema expecting too see a haunting, beautiful triumph, like Malick's masterpiece, Badlands. Instead I saw more of a half-baked melodrama. Sometimes the film seemed even arrogant, I was listening to some of the dialogue and I could almost shake my head.The difference between this film and the other big WW2 film, Saving Private Ryan, is that Ryan knew what it was; a war epic which wanted to shock and devastate its audience by showing war attrocities but not glorifying them, so the audience can tell the difference from action and drama and appreciate it. The Thin Red Line tries to be philosophical, then decides not to, then goes for war action, then decides not to. I hope Malicks next effort, which will be in along time is a great one, because he is a talented director who is capable of so much more.Maybe there was something I missed in The Thin Red Line, something like a message, if I had caught it I might have appreciated it. I mean the critics caught it, and they're always right, aren't they?PLOT: 7 DIRECTION: 3 SCRIPT: 8 ACTING: 5 SOUND/CINEMATOGRAPHY: 8OVERALL: 4(GOOF): Note smoke canisters blowing smoke into the woods to make it look eerier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A painfully slow film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm deeply disappointed. This film was said to contend with Saving Private Ryan - but it's nowhere near it when it comes to narration technique and flow. The Thin Red Line is excruciatingly slow-moving, like syrup. Few movies are duller than this one. Yes, the more poetic moments are nice and the cast perform very well - but when a film lacks momentum like this one, it just never takes off. It feels like six hours instead of almost three.And what's the point. Yeah, I see it, it's about the horrors of war and the meaninglessness of killing each other. But The Thin Red Line rather observes rather than points out, and this just adds to the dullness. I sure hope I won't have to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too choppy and unfocused despite its potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed with this film when it first came out, but a recent viewing on DVD mad me enjoy it more.The movie is beautifully photographed. Malick has a great eye for visuals, and not just for the scenery and pretty colors. He knows how to compose a shot. Like any Stanley Kubrick film, press pause anywhere during this movie and you have a brilliant picture. The movie has an excellent and haunting score, accompanied by effective narration. The war scenes are great in most cases (especially the ones on the hill.) Some solid characters also. The landing on a Guadalcanal beach, with landing craft and airplanes is spectacular, accompanied by impressive sound.Unfortunately, many of the film's flaws didn't go away the second time. It dwindles on things too much, especially the scenes of one character's gorgeous wife back home. It moves very slowly at times, although I was able to forgive that after the first viewing. It slows down near the end, however, when the movie should be speeding up. It's biggest, most obvious shortcoming is the choppiness of what is rumored to be a five plus hour epic shortened to three; stories start but then drop off suddenly, and this is true of some of the most interesting ones. The best story (in my opinion) involved an almost father-son like relationship between Nick Nolte and John Cusak, but it just ended and never came back. Many actors had much bigger roles in the original cut. There are many characters that a viewer could mix up, since they may look similar and have the same amount of screen time. I am a fan of war films, and would be interested in viewing the final cut. But most people wouldn't, and this puts the director in a situation he could not win, and the film is, sad to say, in the end, a failure.See it for certain sequences, especially if you're a war movie fan (the film seems pretty accurate, although I thought that Japanese soldiers usually fought to the death at this time, and rarely surrendered). Lastly, this film is nothing like Saving Private Ryan, and should not be compared to it. Since it so often is, however, I would like to say that someone who claims that TRL is better than SPR is most likely either, A.)trying to prove that they are unconventional, or B.)unsophisticated and trying to prove that they are sophisticated.</fullReview>

And what's with the obligatory death scenes? Every second someone else get seriously hurt and he dies in his best friend hands. You don't really recognize the characters as well, they all look the same and act the same, so when they die you don't know what to think.Oh well, at least the movie was indeed over eventually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll love it or hate it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inevitably, the movie will be subject to comparison with "Saving Private Ryan," simply because of the similarities in release date. However, there really should be no comparison. For me, "Ryan" was a formulaic forgettable piece of Spielberg "product" - a kind of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" for grownups where the Germans get killed for real and we're all expected to stand up and cheer and reach for our hankies when directed. If John Wayne were alive, it would've been tailor-made for him. I never was much of a John Wayne fan."Line" is a completely different ball of wax, and one that confounds many viewers and reviewers alike. You either love it or hate it. Count me squarely in the former category. I've seen a lot of movies about war and wartime, and this now goes to the top of my list. While some find it instantly forgettable, others (myself included) find it impossible to dislodge from our memories.This is not to say it's perfect on all levels, but for me it worked perfectly as a whole in what (at least I think) set out to do. I found Malick's direction to be flawless, marveling in, and applauding, his choices at virtually every turn.The cinematography is stunning, and contribute to a number of scenes that bear comparisons to classic moments in film history. My favorite, and one that will linger in my memory along with the ice battle from "Nevsky" is the sun emerging from the clouds and illuminating a hill where the Americans are searching for a hidden Japanese bunker. I am in awe of this thirty-second clip - not only is it gorgeous, but the film deals with this in a sublimely understated manner - there is a brief pause while the sides wonder in, and reflect on, the significance of the event perhaps both in terms of it's meaning for the task at hand and in a larger context. This is emblematic of the rest of the movie, nothing is going to hit you over the head - Malick offers no definitive answers, but rather poses the questions in a fascinating and thought-provoking manner.There are many, many more unforgettable scenes along these lines - the opening and closing shots, three men hiding behind a tree while hundreds of Japanese draw closer - reminds me of the final shot from "Aguirre;" the battle scenes were on par with those from "Ran." The depictions of battle are highly stylized, unlike those from "Ryan," but I think were appropriate to the dream-like context of the rest of the movie.For me, it was more a movie about the fundamental questions of being, set during wartime, than a strictly literal snapshot from Guadalcanal. Viewed in the former light it is a movie to treasure. In the latter, I can understand how it can seem to be a confusing and disappointing mess.My only complaints were a few casting problems - Travolta simply did not work in what would've been a bizarre choice under the best of circumstances, and the cameos at every turn do get a bit distracting, such as Clooney's two minutes near the end (although I'm always thankful when Clooney is limited to two minutes ;-)). My viewing companion remarked that "it's too bad Kevin Bacon wasn't in the cast, or the 'Bacon game' could've moved to the next level."Still, across the board the rest of the cast is excellent, with Penn, Nolte and Caviezel standing out. Much has been said about the characters not being fully developed, and I agree. I disagree at this serving to the film's detriment, however, as we are given glimpses of lives forever altered by this battle, and consistent with the voiceover ruminations about "all men sharing one soul." In this respect it breaks from conventional wisdom concerning war movies, and I think is all the more remarkable for it.It does also seem, to some degree, to overlay a Vietnam sensibility on a WWII setting. I've seen criticism that the general mood at the time was more patriotic and sacrificing - that the "this is futile" remarks weren't appropriate. Yet, when viewed in their intended context, I can imagine that sending row upon row of men as machine gun fodder to take a piece of dirt must have evoked the same feeling among soldiers at Guadalcanal as it did in Vietnam.That said, it is not strictly an "antiwar" movie, nor is it a movie glorifying war - for this you must draw your own conclusions. The objectivity is laudable.Simply put, watching the movie on a literal level will not work. I found it to represent cinematic art at its best. For me, it will occupy a place alongside "The Best Years of Our Lives," "Ran," "Apocalypse Now," "Das Boot".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Inevitable Comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Inevitable Comparison of "The Thin Red Line" to "Saving Private Ryan" can be summed up like this..."The Thin Red Line" is to "Saving Private Ryan" as "Full Metal Jacket" is to "Platoon"All great films. All very different.This movie is nothing short of brilliant. If you didn't like it, I can understand why. Often brilliance is dismissed as rubbish because nobody really expects it to be there. Don't be fooled, it is there. I have seen it twice now. There is nothing rubbish in this film. Like great writers and poets command example and metaphor to tell an idea, so too does this film to tell emotion and irony in extreme circumstance.Nothing on the surface of this film matters. The narrativeexists twenty feet below the level we normally watch films at. And it lasts for days.This film ranks with "Apocalypse Now", "Das Boot", "Platoon", "All Quiet on the Western Front", "Full Metal Jacket", "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Ran" as the best war films ever made.Sorry, I will share no details on the film. Only to tell you that everybody from script, to production design, to music score, to acting, to direction, was right on the ball with this one.My Pick for best film of the year Also my pick for top ten films of the 90's to date and top 20 films of all time.$8 (out of $8)see it twice, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released the same year as "Saving Private Ryan", it lost out in the Oscars to Spielberg's film and "Shakespeare In Love". But as time has passed, far too many war films have borrowed Spielberg's formula for a WW2 Film: Start the film off in the present day and tell the story in flashback before returning back to the present day, hand-held cameras for frenetic action sequences, over the top gore, lots of extras for added realism, the usual moral that "War kills people and is bad". With this passage of time, with the War genre seemingly falling into stagnation, Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" stands as a film that doesn't buy into the normal Hollywood codes of convention. It is a rare breed: a War film that is a work of art.The film has almost no conventional plot, the two main protagonists are Pvt. Witt (James Caviezel) and Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin), and we start off with an AWOL Witt living in the South Pacific with the locals. Once the Army find out where he is, he is put on a ship, bound for Guadalcanal. The rest of the film follows each major character's battle against their enemy and the battle inside of themselves. Peaking inside their thoughts, their fears, their souls. It is a brilliant way of giving us insight into the varied characters, with the two biggest names in the film (John Travolta &amp; George Clooney) relegated to mere cameos, while the lesser known duo of Caviezel and (Ben) Chaplin charged with carrying the film as it jumps from each soldier throughout. The acting is very good from everyone, Jim Caviezel captures the spirit of Pvt. Witt perfectly, Ben Chaplin gives a really good performance, while Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas give arguably the two best performances in the film. Sean Penn is very good also. But it just isn't a Terrence Malick film without gorgeous visuals, incredible soundtrack and wonderful poetic direction. He may have been out of the game for 20 years, but Terrence Malick delivers on every level: The battle sequences are frenzied and excellent, without ever feeling Hollywood-ised. The cinematography is utterly gorgeous, bringing out the beauty of nature and setting it up against the ugly nature of man. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is exceptional, conveying a sense of the unknown, fear, triumph, evil and beauty all at the same time. Terrence Malick gives us some wonderful visuals: The opening of a Crocodile half-submerged in a swamp, a bird just learning it's first steps amidst a raging war all around it, Sunlight illuminating the tallest tree tops and penetrating the Jungle floor. There is almost no other war film that would concentrate on the beauty of nature in the same vein as "The Thin Red Line". But all of the beautiful pictures, the awe-inspiring music add up to a mood, a sensation that washes over you and immerses you into the film in a way that only Malick and a handful of others can do. But the beauty is more than skin-deep, Malick asks us questions that other war films don't even think of asking: Where did this hatred come from? Is God responsible for all of this? Is nature at war with itself? Malick can't answer these questions, because no human could possibly answer those questions. "The Thin Red Line" touches on God, War, Nature, Innocence, Death, Love among other things. It shatters the normal movie-making conventions that a war film must feature 2,000 battle sequences, that voice-over's should only be done by one person and everyone lives happily ever after. It doesn't exist in the movieworld, and it doesn't quite exist in our own world of realism, it is on a whole other world. It is a magnificent, thought-provoking, engrossing war drama that captivates you, holds you gently, and leaves you feeling elated after seeing it. It is Terrence Malick's finest film, one of the most unique war films out there and one of the finest films of the 90's. It is different, and in this case, different is much, much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As long as I have you, nothing can touch me; no hurt, no grief, not even death...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's film The Thin Red Line is one of my favourite movies, and one of the best and and most important films of the 1990s. Time Out calls the film 'an epic cine-poem', and that is as good a description as anyone can come up with. Trying to describe the philosophy of this movie, or attempting to dissect it from an intellectual point of view, are tasks that are quite beyond me, but on viewing the movie again last night, I have a few remarks to make about the way the film works as an ensemble drama.To the casual viewer, the one really striking aspect of The Thin Red Line is its awesome cast. Clearly persuaded to take part in the film by the chance of getting to work with a 'genius' like Terrence Malick, the entire cast plainly shot much larger individual roles, many have which have been edited down to almost nothing, whilst some actors' roles were reportedly removed entirely.The nearest thing the film has to a lead character, Jim Caviezel's Private Witt has a Zen-like presence that perfectly encapsulates the movie's entire mood; it is obvious that Mel Gibson's decision to cast him in The Passion of the Christ was based largely on the thoughtful performance he gives as Witt. The character most obviously based in traditional war movies of the past must be Ben Chaplin's Private Bell, who, aided by a haunting voice-over and some truly stunning flashbacks of the transcendently beautiful Miranda Otto, takes the character of the soldier desperately in love, and makes it devastatingly effective; even when the very obvious twist comes near the end, we feel Bell's pain right along with him. The only issue with Chaplin's performance is his somewhat dodgy American accent; it wobbles especially badly when he speaks the line 'there's a bunker up there'. And the most impressive performance in the film comes from Elias Koteas as the noble Captain Staros, the sensitive, protective officer too full of human goodness to see his men meaninglessly slaughtered. Several other actors, who one would usually expect to see in leading roles, have parts that have been so heavily trimmed down they are easily missed by those not paying close attention. Both Thomas Jane and John C. Reilly have just one short speaking scene each, whilst Adrien Brody doesn't have a single meaningful line, and just seems to spend the entire film with a worried look on his face.Further up the poster, many of the movie's bigger names are also ill-served by the sheer volume of characters in the movie. At the start of the film, Sean Penn's Sergeant Welsh appears as though he is going to be a leading character in the film, but he quickly fades into the background, only to re-appear towards the end. He does have some of the film's more memorable lines (when Witt asks him if he ever feels lonely, Welsh replies 'only around people'), but the character has almost no relevance at all to the events that unfold. Woody Harrelson, as the doomed Sergeant Keck, has one memorable scene, whilst John Cusack takes centre stage in a short action scene when his Captain Gaff leads half-a-dozen men in a successful assault on a Japanese bunker, then has a memorably potent exchange of views with Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall.Nolte is, of course, as good as always, and aided, no doubt, by his greater age than the rest of the cast, and playing of the one senior officer who appears in the main body of the film, he manages to leave a lasting impression of powerhouse movie star charisma. If one actor was short-changed in terms of the amount of screen time he was given, it must be poor George Clooney, who turns up for less than a minute, five minutes from the end of the nearly three-hour movie, in a role that any extra could have adequately filled.All this highlights what makes The Thin Red Line such a frustrating experience for casual viewers, and why this excellent (for it is truly wonderful) film does not enjoy a better reputation. At first glance, the film appears to have everything going its way in order to draw in film fans; so many must have seen it on the shelf in Blockbuster and, attracted by the promise of an all-action war epic with an all-star cast headed by Sean Penn, George Clooney, and John Cusack, decided to give it a go. But those viewers are invariably disappointed, and I have lost count of the number of times I have heard the film described as 'boring' by those who think The Shawshank Redemption is as clever as movies can get. If further evidence were needed, check out some of the ludicrous one-star comments on the IMDb ("not enough explosions, not enough slants getting iced, not enough John Travolta" claims Clay Numbnuts of Pig's Pecker, Arkansas). But despite its (conventionally speaking) odd use of the most impressive movie cast assembled in the 1990s, The Thin Red Line deserves to be watched by every human being on this planet. I didn't go to see this film at the cinema because I am a big follower of auteur Terrence Malick, or because I am a big brain able to grasp every facet of the movie's complex philosophy; I went because I'm a John Cusack fan. But I came away from the film as more than that. And that is the point; The Thin Red Line has the power to show viewers of Hollywood blockbusters that a film can be about more than the stars in front of the camera; if you can appreciate that, you will find The Thin Red Line a magical, life-changing experience. And if you can't?well, don't switch the movie off half-way through. George Clooney turns up in a bit.</fullReview>

I've known many like him - passed over for promotion and looking for a chance at glory, no matter what the cost.Or Elias Koteas as Capt Staros, who cared about his men and looked at them as more than sacrifices for the war effort.Of course, you can't forget Sean Penn as that Sergeant that manages to keep it all together.Others will have their favorites, and everyone will take what they want from this movie.For me, it is war's futility.Everyone will experience a beautifully shot film that really was a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best war movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a time when I subscribed to HBO, Thin Red Line was part of the line up of movies in rotation. I forget how many times I saw it but I never tired of its mixture of moody, meditative moments and some of the more exciting battle drama that I have seen on the screen. I saw it again recently and continued to be impressed with the depth of the story telling on multiple levels as well as the tour de force acting by among other Nick Nolte and Woody Harrelson.I was struck this time at the entirely believable but detailed look at characters that were almost totally of their time, I felt as though these characters could very well have thought this way in these circumstances at that time in history.Some of the commenters here who felt the movie was trivial or fit into the "war is hell" genre are missing much of the subtlety of this movie. Sure, war doesn't come out looking particularly good in the movie but that is not really the subject of the movie. The movie seems to be about exactly the battle of Guadalcanal and at the same time about the many individual psyches that are wrestling with their own private worlds in the context of the war. These personal battles as well as the collective battle draw up some big themes, which you as the watcher of the film are free to think about or to ignore as Malick also offers you a rich visual canvas and a compelling story to follow.I believe the genius of this movie is that the famously rich Malick cinematography allows you to dart in and out of the story and/or the themes which it presents at your own pace and doesn't really drub you with "messages". Some may feel this movie has huge messages and it may be that Malick was trying to say something very specific with the movie. I tend to believe that he is more providing an opportunity for us to derive whatever messages we would like from the story and visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never will war be exposed enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film on the US-Japan war in the Pacific, will you say. Of course, you'd be right but of course you are wrong. It is a film about any war waged by the US in any foreign country. That's the first point and it reveals so clearly the absurdity of the tactical thinking of some officers who see the war they are taking part in as a springboard for their egotistic self-satisfied career, and their men are nothing but pawns that have to be moved, by force most of the time, and not the force of rational arguments. Hence, if you have a bunker at the top of a hill, you do not go around to attack it from the flank or even from behind. You just run up the bare slope of that hill under the fire of their machine guns, and you take it. The men must do that. The commanding officer will of course go last, and most probably will come last to certify the work of the men. The second element is that this film shows how the minds of the soldiers still go on and they mix news from home and the famous letters from their wives who are asking for a divorce, and secretly hoping that will not be necessary. And the film reveals how deep the breach, the cut, the rip, or even the abyss is between life on the front and life back home, between the present and what is and can only be the past. Life back home has no future as long as the war goes on. The film is an absolutely fascinating denunciation of the psychological but also spiritual destruction a war is for any soldier who is de-structured and will have to rebuild his own personal psyche, structure, social being, human being, life in one word, afterwards. Third, the film shows the ugliness of war, the dirt, the blood, the din or even the blaring roaring noise, the mud, the physical suffering and death in the name of the fatherland or the motherland, the physical torture that is imposed onto you, that you impose onto yourself, or that you impose onto the others. The best example is how a captain who resisted the silly order of the colonel and whose resistance is shown as perfectly sane since it brings victory and the economy of a few deaths, is nevertheless sent back to the US, with a medal, but in the most disgraceful way: to get him out of the tramping feet of the colonel who is a pure fascist. All in all this film applies to the second world war the discourse we are used to hearing about the Vietnam war and it convincingly shows that all wars are bad, inhuman, inhumane, purely non-human, cruel, absurd, and probably aimless. It could and anyway should have been avoided. A war is for each soldier a loss of virginity, purity, happiness, promised rewards. "They want you to die or to lie with them." And that's all. That bunch of killing, deadly, fatal, lethal lies lead the soldier to looking for another dimension in the world, some god, transcending force that can wrap you up in its arms in a totally sexless and purely spiritual comforting gesture that makes you go on, on the war path of the limited political ambitions of those who govern us. In a war there is no power of the people, for the people and by the people but only power of the politicians for themselves and by themselves. A war, any war is a total loss of freedom.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Film With More Brains Than Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is good. Life makes man. Man makes war. War is bad. What's going on here?That's my attempt at summarizing the basic concept behind "The Thin Red Line", a film that defies summarization as it probes nature's dense duality in the vast jungles of Guadalcanal. In 1942, American forces arrived there to check the Japanese advance during World War II.Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) wants to prove his ability to win victories in combat to his superiors, for whom he holds a grudge. Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) wants to know he won't betray the men of the company under his command, and protect as many of them as possible. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) and Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) are locked in their own struggle over the meaning of life, Welsh avowing his nihilism while Witt maintains a greater purpose and meaning."You're gonna be alright," Witt reassures a hit comrade at one point. "Even if you die."There's many other subplots in this dense film. Terrence Malick returned from 20 years' hibernation with this adaptation of the classic James Jones novel. It's overlong and ponderous, but surprisingly rewatchable and full of the visual poetry that makes Malick so beloved by film buffs.Actually, I was amazed by the sound on this film, too, especially a sequence where Army soldiers make their first advance on the summit of Hill 210. The sound of Sgt. Whyte's (Jared Leto) rustling fabric and snapping gum as the breeze rustles through high grass is about as suspenseful as any musical background, knowing gunfire from Japanese entrenchments will soon follow.Malick puts together some incredible combat sequences, including one led by Tall's prize underling Gaff (John Cusack) about as viscerally exciting as anything from a John Wayne movie. But the action sequences aren't really what "The Thin Red Line" is about, nor is camaraderie, though both are addressed. It gets back to a kind of questing philosophy, the nature of man, of war, and of nature itself.Other reviewers here discern conclusions as well as questions, in the way Malick handles things. I think it's pretty open-ended, another reason "Thin Red Line" stands out. Tall, for example, appears at one moment a nasty piece of work whose orders suggest a total remove from the suffering of his men. (Tall telling Staros to advance into heavy gunfire for me is about as stomach-turning as "Thin Red Line" gets, and testament to Nolte's overall brilliance.) But his frontal approach to command is not without merit."Nature is cruel," Tall says, and, for his purposes, he's totally right. It's just we still understand and appreciate Staros' hesitation as more than soft-heartedness.I think the film gets away from Malick a couple of times, and have little interest in seeing the six-hour director's cut people talk about here. But it's a terrific overall experience, one that will only grow in stature over time. Caviezel's later turn as Jesus in "Passion Of The Christ" invests his performance as Witt with greater meaning. Even the long voice-over narrations fell more on point with re-watchings."You ever get lonely?" Witt asks Welsh. "Only around people" he replies."Thin Red Line" is a film where the questions provide more insight than the answers. In the end, you feel enlightened somehow all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and enticing but yet not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Terrence Malick is a lover of nature. I learned this from his painstakingly long The New World. Although this was almost a three hour movie, it held my interest from start to ending. This is not an action flick, but that's not the thing that kept my interest in this movie. This film draws a solid line between God's beauty of the earth and nature, and man's inhumanity and destruction of it.There are many attractive shots of the Guadalcanal landscapes, hillsides, beaches, and animals at work in nature. In the mist of such a gorgeous place, man's destruction of WWII engulfs it. This maybe no Private Ryan in its depiction of war, but seeing the casualties of both American and Japanese soldiers is more saddening and painful to watch. Why? This movie has some of the most powerful battle sequences I have ever seen. From the bombardment and slaughter on the hillside to the grisly hand-to-hand combat in the fog, they're captured brilliantly. The cinematography by John Toll and score by Hans Zimmer absolutely capture the tone and pulled me right into the gates of Hades.Compared to Saving Private Ryan, which is a patriotic film, The Thin Red Line is an anti-war picture. Most of the characters are young men who don't want to fight, die, or even kill. They only fight because they're ordered. There are no heroes which Private Ryan depicted. There is no patriotism.There aren't many popular actors in the movie either, at least ones that weren't popular in 1998. Adrian Brody, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin and many other faces lead the movie. I have to say though that it was a bit difficult to know who was who since all of them are: young, wearing helmets, and smeared with dirt and blood. They're voices even sound the same. This got on my nerves a bit when each of the actors would give their share of narration. I would often ask myself: Which character is now narrating? Actors John Travolta and George Clooney are minimal in the film. The only actors that really stood out for me were Sean Penn, Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte who really shine the screen.Because of the hell these soldiers go through, their lives ultimately change. The question of the film brings us this question: How can such a beautiful world be consumed by such inhumanity and madness? People probably dismissed this movie of even existing in 1998 and its 7 Oscar nominations. Personally, I found this to be a more engaging movie than Ryan. I felt for the characters, I did not for Private Ryan. We're all human.Now I'm not saying that this is the best war film ever made. I felt the characters' narrations were overused, overdone, and confusing. I also felt that the director had way too many shots of nature; I'll say again they were all beautiful, but they distracted the movie from the plot. I felt that there was much more to the story than was shown. Perhaps there'll be a director's cut or an extended version. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dreamlike journey through war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is a unique addition to the crowded field of WW II films. Terrence Malick's work is filled with visions of nature and this film is no exception; it even seems to be part of the story. How does war fit into human nature as well as the natural world? War brings out courage and heroics, but also cruelty and inhumanity. This is similar to nature, as explained in an analogy using twisting vines to show that nature is also cruel.This movie gives us a wide range of characters, from Caviezel's thoughtful soldier to Nolte's tough commander. The character's are the film's strong point, and while their narrated thoughts tend to wander, they add an unique element of poetry to the movie. The battle scenes rival those of Saving Private Ryan (in terms of suspense, not graphic depiction) and the depiction of the Pacific War strikes me as a better representation than "Flags of Our Fathers." This is not your average war movie. It plays more like a dream than like an adventure story, and more like a philosophical critique of human nature than a sermon about war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best War Movies .. and Definitely the Best War Movie in the 90s !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why many people keep bashing this great masterpiece !! .. probably because of the pure propagandist movie "Saving Private Ryan" which sucks in many ways.It is one of the best war movies if not the best already.Terrence Malick poetically entertain us in this meaningful masterpiece which is unlike many war movies .. is about war in general and it touches the depth of any human being .. in this movie .. no cheap propaganda .. and you don't have to take sides because this historical battle is only a frame to hold the humane meanings .. it is not just a war movie .. it goes far beyond that.The cast is probably the best cast you could ever dream of .. just check the full cast list .. check the trivia to see how many actors were wishing to appear in the movie but unfortunately they couldn't .. many big actors had to play minor roles .. this movie is "Hollywood's Stars Heaven" if I may say so .. it is full of stars who just wanted to contribute at any possible way in this amazing masterpiece.The movie doesn't try to direct you nor tries to manipulates the viewer .. it just asks the big question that should be asked in life .. especially in crisis times.Whatever I say doesn't do this great masterpiece justice.Just watch it and be your own judge .. and you wont regret watching it.If you have watched it .. try to re-watch to see the greatness again!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Battle Within</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to imagine for those who were not there the emotions that were felt during combat in World War II. The harsh realities of going form civilian life to dodging bullets, hiding in abandoned buildings, and ambushing your enemy while they are waking up are difficult to grab hold of. The times have changed, but the attitude towards what these brave soldiers went through has not. What really happened lies only in the minds of those who were on the battle field, not in a history book or some television special. Director Terrence Malick hopes to change your view on the men and who gave their lives so we might live ours in peace.Malick's intense war epic The Thin Red Line is a look into what the men were thinking about during and after the blood was shed. It is the behind the scenes look of the American and Allied forces in the Pacific Campaign. The film opens with Private Witt (James Caviezel) enjoying his "vacation" from the military, living amongst the islanders of the pacific. Before the military finds that he is AWOL, Witt enjoys living in a society where war is nonexistent and peace is everyday life. His life is quickly going to be changed when Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) finds him and brings him back to his "family".The Battle of Guadalcanal was a brutal campaign. The men weren't getting the supplies they needed and the enemy had the advantage of the territory. With the anger of missing home, wanting to win, and sheer courage, the American's pushed through. The struggle of officers with one another is evident with Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) who wants to run the show and make sure credit is given where it is due. Pressure from above forces him to push his troops to the limit and overcome the Japanese forces.What Malick incorporates into this story alongside the war aspect is the ripple effect the war has on the surrounding area. Machine gun fire tears through the jungle. Wildlife is forced to adapt to the intruders. The camera is almost an observer, neutral to the outcome of the war, just overseeing the devastation this war is having on everything. At one point Witt returns to the tribe he had come to love and become a part of only to find that hate and fear had entered the village. A settlement void of struggle now is engulfed in it.With not as much dialogue as most war movies, The Thin Red Line relies on voice over to convey the characters feelings motives. There is the usual war language, but during the times of rest or searching, the soldiers reflect on memories past, friends and family left behind, and what is going to happen next. What seems to be a talking journal to go along with the film, the audience can really get in touch with what the soldiers are going through. Not being able to feel remorse for fallen comrades and enemies is considered "bliss" for Sgt. Welsh. The reality of seeing you friends who you have been together with for months and seeing them shot in half is all too emotional to comprehend.Where The Thin Red Line prevails where other war movies don't is the connection made with the soldiers. Other films like Saving Private Ryan, although epic and stunning in its own respect, rely on the war itself and not the war within the men. Granted, the war was terrible and should not be forgotten, the struggle the men went through and what their families endured is paramount.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is about four years ago, when I saw The thin red line. I read about many famous actors who were very keen on working together with Terence Malick on this film. Later I could understand their interest. It's what I would call a anti-war-movie, but it does not only show shocking pictures, or needs a banal love story in order to show the beast of war. It shows that everyone looses his life in war, whether one gets killed or not. There is no politic and no justification in the movie, just a poetic approach towards the fate of uncountable wasted lives and the response to refuse war. I can really recommend the movie. There are so many fantastic actors to see, the cinematography is outstanding. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography in this movie is outstanding. One of my all time top movies, and my favorite war movie. Some exceptional performances from a great cast.This movie is very slow paced at times and takes the viewer on a long journey. During the 3 hour running time the film really delves into big subjects such as the morality and horrors of war. It doesn't initially grab the viewer but almost "fades in" for the first 30 minutes. It's a moving experience. While depicting brutality there is a beauty in the way the film is shot with the amazing landscapes and bright colors. This contrast is effective in that it reminds the viewer that the events being depicted are based on reality.The Thin Red Line is very different to the generic Hollywood war movie. In my view it puts significant space between itself and classics such as 'Platoon' and 'Saving Private Ryan' by avoiding the normal clichs so common in this type of movie. It isn't as epic as 'Saving Private Ryan' or as atmospheric as 'Apocolypse Now' but it does portray human emotion in a very believable way.If you've already watched this movie it's certainly worth a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrence Malick and Steven Spielberg are as similar in their styles of film as rubies resemble oil. They are entirely different constructs, therefore they make entirely different works. Obvious comparison will result between 1998's two big war films, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, but I honestly have to say that Spielberg's work is the lesser of two evils.Spielberg sees war as something to be glorified according to his "Making Of" documentary for 'Private Ryan. Malick doesn't see war as anything other than an extension of his whole philosophical storyline. To be honest, he doesn't know jack about his topic or setting. I guarantee you that he could've made the same movie set in Harlem and garnered the same results, only better. Thus, neither director is intelligent in his approach. Only Lewis Milestone and Oliver Stone have come close to understand the "real-world" boundaries of conflict.As such, The Thin Red Line is not a prototypical war film, certainly by comparison to more recent works as Blackhawk Down, Windtalkers, or Enemy at the Gates. The movie is not about pyrotechnics, but philosophy and psychology. I am happy that it abandons the stereotypes of 'Private Ryan, but doesn't achieve the level of feeling in Platoon. While the characters are not likable, they are credible.The cinematography and editing are two elements here that go into overkill. The nagging flashbacks and continuous nature documentary/art house shots rip the story from the film and the various narrations only cause annoyance. Many of his shots are powerful in their fluidity, but the editing is too rocky for them to be effective. If he is going for spiritual symbolism, he failed. As a whole, the script becomes second to imagery and mood. This is Malick's weakest film. Hans Zimmer's work isn't his usual pompous work (Gladiator, The Lion King, The Rock), but is certainly effective in supplementing Malick's moods, not many composers can do that.Thin Red Line would certainly have been better if Malick took the time to review what others (Kubrick, Milestone, Coppola, and Stone in particular) had done before attempting this film. Perhaps then he would have avoided many of the cliches and inevitable references that continuously pop up throughout the film. Overall, you don't need to see this movie because prior films have covered the same territory before. Malick is a visionary, but a visionary without a script. 2 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, in my humble opinion is the number one contender for most intellectual film of all time. Terrence Malick does it again in the same way as he did it with Days of Heaven and, to a lesser extent, Badlands. The use of natural light and colors and nature in general causes certain emotions in the viewer without the viewer even noticing. Watching this movie is truly a cinematic journey that is not for the faint of heart. Most will not appreciate it but all should sample it. Never has a war movie demonstrated the aspect of fear, which is most likely a major factor in any war, so well. This is due to the amazing cast and flawless direction and cinematography. I can't find the words to explain the brilliance of the film but watch it, and if you love it, read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the paragons of film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it that makes a film great - that everybody accepts it as so? That the majority of people out there put the film in question on a "best of" list for those too lazy, or rather: 'indifferent', to do any research into that films justifications for being there? If that were the case I'd have nothing to say here. I would simply acquiesce to popular opinions - shyly sinking into the horizon of our now nicely homogenized cinema land.But, what-if? What if what made things great were to actually be that deep resonance you felt with a particular movie? That, just like the world around us, you felt drawn to certain subtle differences - beauty that drew you in ways few others can comprehend. But, unfortunately, a lot of people are scared by this nowadays. They look towards Hollywood and fashion magazines to make these decisions for them. They would like to adapt without effort - yet be so ahead of their neighbor that they come off looking like the trail-blazer that they now, quite ironically, happen to be the antithesis of.Having said that - I think what makes a movie great is the rift that film creates between the those who intensely embrace it, and those who don't open up to what is being presented. If I've come off as sounding negative towards the latter group, let me now thank them for serving as a water-mark for this theory. It's not their fault that they've closed themselves off to movies like "The Thin Red Line." Those who have become conditioned to appreciate Hollywood blockbusters and the like are by no means "wrong" for doing so for a number of reasons. But, if you consider the faith involved for a film-maker undertaking such unpopular risks - the message takes on a new meaning. You find that the actual trail-blazers in our world might just be the ones out there who don't stand out - that are willing to take these risks for what they so unmistakably believe in.The hero of "The Thin Red Line" - his behavior reflects this. Amongst all the beauty and ugliness (and countless other traits) that fight against each other in this war parable - those who undergo and rise above the most profound suffering are often the most unlikely heros. In this case it was an equally brave &amp; cowardly character. He knew that somewhere in him lay the courage - yet couldn't summon it given all the pointlessness surrounding him. And his epiphany is as cryptic as the rest of this far-from ordinary work. The film itself is beauty incarnate. Director Terrence Malick is a master of capturing all aspects of nature and assembling them in a manner that appeals to even the most savage of critics. I don't think one person could walk away from this feature without the feeling that it at least "looked good". And if you go on from there, the depths that "The Thin Red Line" can transport you to is almost unfathomable. It's just a matter of how much of yourself you are willing to give to it, which is a fearful undertaking in itself. This is the movie that changed the way I look at movies as a medium of art. You most likely would be doing yourself a favor to give it a real chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line takes the standard war movie (lots of violence, little substance, 'happy' ending where the good guys crush the bad guys) and changes it, makes it something more meaningful. The film's philosophical tone, the beautiful images of nature contrasted against the horror of war, the moving story, flawless direction, brilliant performances all round (with the exception of a slightly mis-cast Travolta) will astound and impress anyone willing to take the time to appreciate it's brillianceThe theme of nature, and the nature of man, lend this film substance on a level which most movies lack. A cinematic device whereby we can here characters thoughts as they try to make sense of what they see taking place around them provides an efficient way of allowing us to better understand them and is also a better vehicle than a narrative voice over for the moral and even existential questions which the film puts to us.The soldiers experience of the war is imparted to the viewer clearly through strong character development and wonderful camera work and cinematography. Many low angle shots make us feel as if we too are lying in the grass with the soldiers, every gunshot and artillery shell is felt as well as seen.Terrence Malick has created a film which needs to be seen time and time again to better appreciate its texture and depth, as well as for its contrasts of pure visual beauty and horrific battle images.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I was looking forward to for a long time. When it was finally aired on German Pay TV, I could at last watch it and I was slightly disappointed.Though there are many strong passages in the film which make it a worthwhile experience, there are too many lame or over-ambitioned sequences to compare this one to the big genre masterworks like Platoon.In my eyes, it was the metaphysical dream sequences which spoiled the experience. The director tried too hard to get philosophical, and in some passages the monologues of the characters are plain silly.The war sequences though, supported by splendid actors such as John Cusack, were very intense and there was a lot of suspense and anxiety when the soldiers were simply WAITING for something to happen, knowing that every second they could hear the death bell.Another bad fact was that two of the main actors, James Caviezal and Ben Chaplin, looked so much alike that it was hard to tell them apart in the chaos of war, both wearing the same clothing and a dirty face. Though both did a decent job, it would have been the responsibility of the casting agent to avoid such a problem.All in all a decent war movie, but far from the genres leaders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the time, very disjointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film expecting to enjoy it. I like thinking films, I like war films, I enjoy philosophy. Seems like a match made in heaven, from all that I had heard. I only wish it were so. In all honesty I must say that I have not seen the entire film.  After 2 years I finally borrowed a DVD from a friend and sat down to watch it. After 2 hours of this meandering drivel I found that I could not bear the idea of watching the remaining hour. So, I may have missed something important, but I doubt it. Why? For one, I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Each of the characters seemed insipid and 2 dimensional. The flashbacks were confusing and didn't successfully reveal anything about the characters of the film. It seemed that the characters tended to think and speak in fragments rather than complete sentences and thoughts. There wasn't enough context or character development for me to understand why a character was saying or thinking something. Over and over, I found myself asking "Who is this person?" , "Why should I care about this person?", "What the heck was that about?" Characters uttered odd out-of place philosophical and sweeping statements. They mouthed cliches and said nothing when explanation was wanting, but kept talking when there was nothing to say. Nothing was making sense to me in the way of character development. I found the characters to be inconsistent, non-sensical, unbelievable, and, well, pointless. Which may have been part of the point. One of the themes of the film seems to have been (mind you, I am not certain of this) that war is awful and destructive, pointless even, and nature is serene and beautiful. But even a character in the film points out that such a statement is false. If that was the theme, it failed. As for plot... well, if it hadn't been for the theme of the battle, there wouldn't have been one. We skip around, lighting on this character or that, with seeming randomness. Very disjointed. Very tough to follow. I must also say that the directing was a disappointment. The characters seemed aimless and unmotivated. The entire film seemed listless and petty. The only character with any energy, Nolte's Col. Tall seemed very small-minded and selfish. No adequate contrast to his character was made to make any sort of statement, only a succession of weak and half-hearted protests to his personal quest. Also, though I may be on a limb here, I have read a bit about WWII, and in the Pacific in particular. If I recall correctly, Guadalcanal was early enough in the war that the Japanese forces were still highly motivated and organized. Even when obviously defeated, accounts I have read suggested that the Japanese forces were highly tenacious in defense. Not the desultory and leaderless bandit types that our heroes (and I use the term loosely) seemed to be facing. The Japanese army, especially early on, was well equipped and acknowledged as a skilled fighting force led, particularly on a small unit level, by able and driven (often brutal) commanders. So, to me, the historical accuracy seemed to be lacking a bit.However, I will say that the cinematography was excellent. Stylized in a way that I did not care for, but excellent. Also, the scenery was very nice, and provided an excellent visual testament to the horrors of war.I gave the film a 3 out of 10, and almost gave it a two. It is rare that I cannot watch an entire film, but having wasted utterly two hours of my life on this film, I couldn't bear that loss of another hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood classic. Profound.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking over some of the negative comments, I find most of them seem to arise from people seeing the movie with preconceptions and expectations not borne out by the film. Case in point is the widespread comparison to "Saving Private Ryan." As others have said, these two movies share little in common beyond being "war movies" and are good for very different reasons.Saving Private Ryan, while a good movie, is about as unsubtle in its presentation as a movie can possibly be, displaying gratuitous gory action and having an obvious and shallow theme (about courage, sacrifice, rememberance and all that...worthy to be sure but nothing new). It is a mainstream, mass-appeal action movie with a politically-correct, All-American theme. Its popularity was written in the stars.Then we have "The Thin Red Line." People aren't sure what to make of it. Some people come in expecting "typical war movie" and are bitterly disappointed. Others are just bored with it and couldn't care less about the questions it raises. My take is that it is a cerebral, fascinating, thought-provoking movie depicted with superb cinematography and a unique style. Its multiple meanings are right there under the surface if you care to look, although the real meaning is in the feelings it (should) evoke.It isn't the characters who are all having these philosophical episodes while under fire...it's supposed to be you, as we see the events though the eyes of the rather dreamy fellow the movie mostly follows. SPR tried to make you feel like you were there. TTRL presents the action more as a case study in humanity, where the individual personas are unimportant compared to the broader questions about life itself. In this way it goes far beyond the token anti-warness of Saving Private Ryan (although admittedly foregoing some of the high-adrenaline action of the latter).One of the negative reviews here hit the nail on the head comparing the movie to a nature documentary. That reviewer didn't see the relevance of showing the singing natives, the colorful animals, and the beauty of the island. He must have trouble with such concepts as irony, juxtaposition, imagery, and all that other jazz your English teacher droned on about in high school. "Where is the anti-war message?" asks one reviewer. Well, it's the entire movie.In the end, The Thin Red Line works on many levels. It will go down as a misunderstood classic because it doesn't sit down with the audience and patiently explain a nice, easy, Hallmark-card sentiment. It flies right over the head of Average Joe. That may sound arrogant but it's the simple truth, and you don't have to be Einstein to comprehend this movie. The "main character" wasn't a smart fellow at all, he simply observed the world using his natural common sense and wisdom. I consider The Thin Red Line (even the title is thought-provoking) one of the best movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have in front of me (with other books) the Official History of the United States Army in World War II -- The War in the Pacific, the volume entitled Guadalcanal: the First Offensive, by John Miller, jr, put out by the Historical Division, Dept. of the Army, Washington DC, 1949.What we saw on screen could come right out of it.Although it is occasionally dry with understatement ("As the troops moved up the grassy, open slopes of Hill 31 they were halted by heavy machine-gun fire from well-concealed positions..." and "the batallion, temporarily without a leader, was partly disorganized and, in the words of one observer, its operations were 'obscure' ") it is well and clearly-written, and can hardly be dismissed as "hippie crap".(Just think, carefully, about that oft-repeated phrase, "Pinned down by heavy machine-gun fire" and what it really means.)The December-through-January '42 assault on Mount Austen is what is being depictedIt is also well illustrated, with actual photos as well as maps -- and I defy anyone, now, to point to anything in TRL that cannot be verified from the actual, contemporary, first hand accounts.(The Japanese soldiers called it "Starvation Island" -- guess why?)EVERYBODY screwed up repeatedly -- both land and sea commands. Perhaps 10% of the Marines had ever seen combat, starting in in August 42, and NOT ONE of the infantry relief units, like the regiment in the movie, had EVER BEEN BLOODED.Time and again they were almost routed, beaten down past all belief, demoralized by lack of home-front support -- but they stood their ground.It was a disorganized mess on both sides, with minimal real experience of jungle combat, or any combat, on the part of officers and unlisted men. "A learning experience" for the rest of the Pacific War on both sides. From the unopposed landings to the terror of air-raids, to the wierd unrecognized planes on Henderson field, to the inexperience of officers and men alike, to the utter disorganization that characterized all of the Guadalcanal campaign, to the gross inadequacies of anything approaching accurate field intelligence, to the terrible omnipresence of the Jungle, to the starving and demoralized Japanese (by the December assault on the foothills of Mt. Austen, which is what is shown in TRL, one group of Japanese soldiers discussed surrender but gave up because most of them were too sick and starved to walk), to the mud- bugs- alligators- rains- snakes- rivers- &amp;-kunai grass, to the gross incompetence of some commanders (some, but not all, REMFs) as contrasted with the superb leadership demonstrated by other officers with equal lack of combat experience, to the final withdrawals of troops in mouldering rags, bone-weary, bone-sick with tropical diseases, and haunted by their first blooding as they know they go to do the same elsewhere -- it's all there--but it was worse.Those who think it just HAS to be inaccurate -- what preconceived notions of Guadalcanal are you basing it on? Sands of Iwo Jima? Other WWII movies? The assumption that if it was THAT BAD, we couldn't have won?Guess what -- the Civil War started like that too.Read some first hand source materials, before you start talking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe you're not supposed to compare the two movies but it's hard not to since they were released within a few months of one another. There was far, far, far too much soliloquy and narrative in this movie. I think the characters' emotions were well summarized by their acting but a few less dream sequences, flashbacks, etc. would have done this hard-to-follow movie well. Nothing in particular tied this movie together. I felt the filmmakers were trying to insult my intelligence by telling me about the "horrors of war" this way, rather than Saving Private Ryan's letting you experience the "horrors of war" and letting you draw your own conclusions. The audience isn't stupid. The acting was good overall but the story really sucked. And what was with all those pointless cameos? (esp. George Clooney's 2 or so lines of speech at the end) Overall I voted a 1 on this movie. There was just nothing good about it. Why do films like this have to be released in pairs (a la Dante's Peak / Volcano, ad infinitum)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed in this movie. I wasn't expecting "Saving Private Ryan" or any other war film but what I was expecting, was a movie. War may be tedious, but a movie shouldn't be. Not long into the movie, the gratuitous nature shots got old real quickly (thus my comparison to National Geo). So little time was spent on any one character that there was no one that you felt interested in. The opening (I don't call him main) character spent most of the movie looking like a wet-eyed seal with this somber expression on his face - I almost thought he was a mute. The movie which may have tried to be either uplifting or spiritual was neither. I have to admit, I've only walked out of 1 movie before (Prospero's Books) and I was more than tempted to walk out on this one. Disappointing effort by what should have been an ensemble cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie feels like it is about six hours long. The action is so sporadic and mood just dull in general. I managed to stay awake and finish this one, but it was bad. This is the kind of garbage that gets nominated for Oscars and it is sad. It seems like the criteria for nomination be that the movie is long and has little action. My biggest complaint to this one is the cameo appearances by different actors. When it was released people made it look like some star-studded picture. In reality, the famous actors made very brief and unnecessary cameos. They might as well have just walked on screen, said a line, and walked off with a bag with a dollar sign on it.</fullReview>

I didn't enjoy it very much the first time I saw it in cinema in 1998 but I did enjoy it more and more with each time I saw it again.The most beautiful scene is Private Witt walking past his fellow soldiers in the camp towards the end and a tear drop runs down his cheek. What is this supposed to mean ? Sadness because he knows he is going to die soon or happiness because he feels like they are his only true family left after he lost his most important family member - his mother ?

There was a variety of top class actors in this movie and each one gave a great performance and the directing was superb. One of Nick Nolte's best performances yet (not that I am mocking anything else he has done as he is a natural actor). I have no idea why anybody would give this movie a poor review, maybe they should watch the movie again with no disturbance and get a better perspective.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Thin Red Line (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took 20 years for Terrence Malick to return to the cinema with The Thin Red Line, and if I recalled correctly, the audiences here were spoilt that same year by another much hyped about war movie, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which delivered to action junkies some of the more in your face type of action with plenty of violence and gore, coupled with dismembered limbs flying all over the place. By the time Malick's movie was released, war movie fans here had already been spoilt by Spielberg's offering, and have already given respect to Tom Hank's Captain John Miller, so much to say that Malick's movie, without the fast cutting action sequences that the Private possessed, was boring.Personally, I'd like to set the record straight. If Private Ryan is akin to fast-food, delivering what is expected of a war movie without much frills, with its realistic war violence, then The Thin Red Line is like a fine restaurant cuisine that deserves to be savored and appreciated slowly. Not to say that it is slow paced, but for a war movie, it is exquisitely filmed, and captures real human emotions, good and bad, from both sides of the battleground, not just having Matt Damon looking afraid. And to anyone debunking the action sequences here as being less than stellar, they do not know what they're talking about. Granted that there are only 3 major action pieces, and the wait of almost an hour to get a shot fired, it was well worth the wait, but remember that action here takes a backseat.For anyone who has been in the armed forces, I'd like to think that we can easily identify with any of the perspectives that were presented here by the ensemble cast. And when I say ensemble, I mean it with a capital E. One of the plus points for the marketing folks of this film to go ballistic with, is the wealth of talent at Malick's disposal - Adrien Brody, James Caviezel, Ben Chapin, John Cusack, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, and folks like George Clooney and John Travolta who were obviously there for cameo star power. Some were filmed but dropped off, like Tom Cruise, Martin Sheen, Viggo Mortensen etc, and I hope one day we do see that ultimate extended originally conceived cut of this movie.What make this film a triumph, was its characterization of the folks caught up in war. Not everyone allows for adrenaline to take over and becomes a Rambo overnight. More often than not, even with weapon at hand, we are afraid. Afraid of death, of the necessity to tote the line and follow dumb orders (we know how stupid sometimes officers can get), and the constant lingering thoughts of loved ones when you're out in that field. Yes, even though I, and many other local males, have never been at war (and hope not to be), training exercises and operations do allow for such experiences (hey, we are dealing with real equipment, and if safety isn't followed, then at the extreme, death would come knocking).While many films have been made about the European theatre of war, very few good ones have been made on the Pacific theatre, and The Thin Red Line is set in the Battle of Guadalcanal, were a group of American infantrymen get ordered to take a hill and an airstrip on that island, to secure bragging and landing rights for their fighter jets, so as to achieve air superiority over a 1000 mile radius. It is the build up to their initial attack, that we learn a bit about our characters, and you can treat them like the buddies in your platoon - the one who goes AWOL, the one with a wife/girlfriend, the officer looking for his days of glory at all costs, and the one looked down for being soft. What I liked about Malick's presentation, was through the use of narration in between dialogues, it tells a lot more on the background of the character, and allows us to read into their thoughts, hypocritical or otherwise. And it doesn't shy away from the negative aspects, and what I found amusing, was how corrupt the process of awards can be.The Thin Red Line is one excellent movie which looks at the mindlessness and insanity of war. And for action junkies, it doesn't roll over from providing some of the most intense war action sequences, with soldiers attempting a full scale frontal assault charging up an enemy occupied hill, but my favourite would be where it captures perfectly in fluid motion, total confusion and utter mayhem unleashed when two sides meet in a village, where you can either follow the lead character on the camera's foreground, or focus on the wildly active background.</fullReview>

According to Ebert "this film has no firm idea of what it is about", that makes it bad, really bad. It is, in fact, so disappointing that you can hear yourself thinking "this is it?"It is a film in the act of becoming a long and expensive screen saver image, an experiment in which a crazy and deranged crazy evil science doctor creates a big and ugly monster that after repeated shots of electricity doesn't raise to life but just stands there smelling of slightly corrupted and burning flesh.It's a movie that definitively cost me a good amount of will to live</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War II Soldiers as Walk-Ons in the Theater of War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE THIN RED LINE (TTRL), writer/director Terrence Malick's Oscar-nominated World War II drama based on James Jones' book, is notable not only for its introspective approach to its subject, but also as the film that was initially supposed to make Adrien Brody a star in his pre-PIANIST days. Brody trained at boot camp for his portrayal of Cpl. Fife (the character based on James Jones himself) and was hyped to the skies as Hollywood's Next Big Thing. No sooner was Brody included on the cover of VANITY FAIR Magazine's 1998 Hollywood issue than he discovered that many of his scenes, chiefly those involving dialogue, wound up on the cutting room floor. I got the feeling that Brody wasn't the only TTRL cast member victimized by the editing process, though. While Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin, and Jim Caviezel have substantial screen time as the audience gets to see and hear their thoughts, the rest of the all-star/star-to-be cast come across as extras in their own movie, with everybody from John Cusack to John Travolta to Nick Nolte to George Clooney (among many others) getting one or two memorable scenes at most and then moving right along. Perhaps that's Malick's point; maybe he's saying that combat dehumanizes men until they're just walk-ons and bit players in the theater of war. This might also explain why most of TTRL's characters have one-syllable names that soon start to sound alike: Welsh, Whyte, Witt, Fife, Gaff, Tall, Tills, Bell, Doll... Indeed, as the soldiers of Charlie Company become increasingly filthy and exhausted during their traumatic tour of duty in Guadalcanal (some of it filmed on location), it gets increasingly difficult to tell one from the other. As my husband Vin and I played "Spot the Adrien," Vin kept thinking he saw him because, as he said, "It's like everyone in this movie has thick eyebrows and big noses!" Once you actually spot Brody in TTRL, however, it's hard to forget him, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of the man. While Brody doesn't say a word until the final reel (Vin and I were amazed: "Finally! Brody speaks!" :-), his expressive face and eyes and his considerable screen presence make up for his lost dialogue as he hovers anxiously in the background; Brody haunts the film like The Ghost of War Past, Present, &amp; Future. You'd think they'd release a special-edition DVD with Brody's cut scenes, now that he's an Oscar-winning star! :-) Even if you're not on the lookout for your favorite actors, TTRL dazzles the eye and touches the soul with imagery that is at once grim and poetically beautiful, as well as poignant Melanesian native music that acts as a moving counterpoint to the soldiers' ordeals. If you're looking for rock-'em-sock-'em action and people getting blown up real good, you may find yourself getting impatient at TTRL's leisurely pace and 170-minute running time, but if you like your war movies intelligent and thought-provoking, TTRL is worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is bad...yeah, we get the message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the curious notion that seemingly every director who undertakes making a war film, not only feels the need to state the obvious -- that war is bad -- but must also try to make it seem as though it is his original insight. This shallow, condescending attitude is but a minor flaw in the long-winded, chaotic jumble that Terrence Malick has served up in THE THIN RED LINE.I am more than willing to assume that Malick had the best of intentions, but that is little consolation for the incoherent mess that is the result. Reportedly chopped down from an original running time of 6 hours, the resulting three-hour marathon of simplistic ideas and pretentious metaphors adds up to little of any consequence and doesn't even offer a compelling narrative to justify the effort. Like a latter day AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS, Malick has assembled a notable cast of big name stars, whose only function apparently was to help generate financing for the spectacle. Plus, Malick's reputation is such that major stars are eager to work for him, just for the bragging rights for having done so. Yet, here they are given little to do within the film other than to contribute insignificant cameos. But then again it is hard to see where anybody in the film is there for any reason other than to be a cameo. No one character is given any real identity, let alone material to play.The vague, almost generic, storyline is divorced from any sense of the political realities of war, just as the characters are reduced to playing one-note versions of one war archetype or another. The narrative jumps from phoney-baloney "poetic" moments to poorly staged battle scenes with little continuity or flow. Dream sequences or flashbacks or whatever they are supposed to be are littered throughout with little regard as to who they refer or their relevance to the story. The film is an editorial mess. This is just plain bad film-making. Period. Pretentious monologues and pretty shots of nature cannot hide the bumbling incompetence that is the sum total of this failure. All the desperate rationalizations about it being a poetic statement can't overshadow the numbing banality of its vision.THE THIN RED LINE is a big bloody bore.</fullReview>

One reason the movie is so terrible is that it has this one bright spot where the pacing is adequate, and interesting things are happening.Add to that, the fact that you can't tell any of the characters apart (deliberatly, I'm told, to emphasize the point that all men are every man, or that armies drain your humanity, or something) and the oh-so-long and dull nature shots, and you get the war movie that sets the record for least interesting movie ever made.

		<shortDescription>My favorite of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Transcendent. I wish there were a more magnificent way to describe this piece of wonder. "The Thin Red Line" is quite certainly the greatest piece of art that I have ever beheld in the entirety of my existence.So many films excel in one or two or maybe three areas, and are considered exceptional. In this film, every single facet unifies into a beautiful, magical force, and one may be left exhausted after experiencing it, or perhaps in a confused state of edification and pure awe.It begins with a story, that of soldiers, each one an individual with unique pasts and futures, thrown into a war together. There is friendship, as between Bell and Doll, and rivalry, as between Witt and Welsh, or Staros and Tall. This coexistence of peace and violence is mirrored in the subject of the unknown, omniscient narrator's voiceover. This voice speaks of the "war in the heart of nature," how perhaps there exists "not one power but two," as the land resists the barrage of the sea, and as armies fight each other, and as men stand in opposition of themselves. Dramatically, this film is a powerhouse.Not ceasing in its brilliance, however, "The Thin Red Line" displays Malick's unparallelled visual sense, as well as his tremendous talent in editing. Of course, John Toll, Billy Weber and Leslie Jones all deserve great praise for their contributions in these areas (such as their Academy Award nominations), but clearly, the master plan was Malick's.The island of Guadalcanal comes alive in the cinematography--it is no longer a place but an entire breathing world, feeling the pain of the wounds of war, and sighing contently with the soldiers when they, Witt in particular, feel the beauty of its paradise.And such genius editing cannot be found anywhere but here. Malick embraces both continuity and montage styles as he relates the chaotic melee of battle, or the comparison of a family of natives to a cluster of fruit on a tree. Such freeness of style creates a mellifluous flow of ideas and tones and pace, and there is nothing left to do but exhale.Entering into Hans Zimmer's masterful score or discussing the characters' drifting voiceovers, not to mention the rest of the film's marvellous sound would probably amount to just too much, unfortunately. But these elements do not at all fall short of the excellence of the rest of it--they also reach an unattainable perfection in this film which I simply haven't seen anywhere else. And on top of it, there is the outstanding ensemble acting. There's just way too much to say about "The Thin Red Line."I am past recommending this film. I demand it. It must be seen. Something of such rareness and majesty cannot be missed, by anyone on this breathing earth. I am not writing this as a critic, which perhaps has been suspected already. I am an artist. And I behold this film as one. It is with all of my being that I praise this thing of beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The central drama in this film pits Elias Koteas (Capt. Staros) as the feminine principle, who prefers to play nursemaid to his men rather than lead them, against Nick Nolte (Col. Tall), the stern father figure who will sacrifice a few to save the rest. Fortunately, Nolte takes charge before Koteas can get everyone killed.Other than that pairing off, there is no drama in this story and no character definition of any depth. Of course no one is interested when faceless fodder goes before the cannon. James Jones gave all his characters monosyllabic names to make them indistinguishable from one another, and they certainly are. The fact that soldiers die amid grass that is an unusually vivid shade of green hardly matters, does it? When you have never even made their acquaintance?The film is ostensibly about the Battle of Guadalcanal. Viewers will be forgiven if they come away with the notion that the battle consisted of a couple of minor skirmishes totalling about 50 guys. Guadalcanal, the Historical Footnote. Pearl Harbor: The Tiny Puff of Smoke.History is clearly not Malick's strong suit. Do the Japanese in this film bear *any* resemblance to the Japanese the US actually fought in the South Pacific? The Japanese surrender in droves! And then they're not tied up, or guarded by anyone. The cowed soldier of Imperial Japan, noted for his docility? Or was Guadalcanal secretly occupied by Japanese-American civilians ready for internment? Was that it? Is that An Untold Story of World War II?I suppose I've seen Terrence Malick's "Days of Heaven" (1978) several times in the past couple of decades. I'm not terribly fond of it; it's long, and slow, and pretty, much like this one. Malick seems to think he's the reincarnation of Aleksandr Dovzhenko, or something.But "Days of Heaven" did have characterization that was a little fuller, and some social observation as well. On both counts, "The Thin Red Line" falls short. When an artillery round happens to fall short, it tends to land on its own lines. That should be the epitaph for the volunteers who enlisted in Terrence Malick's pet project: "Killed by friendly fire".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Three Best American War Films, Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed and written by Terrence Malick, based on James Jones' novel, The Thin Red Line follows the C For Charlie company as they battle for a strategically important hill at Guadalcanal during WWII. As the men form bonds of life and death on the battlefield, the story becomes more and more character driven, and the men are fighting for their own survival, ignoring the outside world as they drag on. I could not do justice to the film with my words, but here it goes.Malick and John Toll (a friend of my family) have created a visual masterpiece. This has less action scenes than most war films, mainly because this is philosophical. Many have called this movie "anti-war", which I believe is incorrect. Most war films now insult the viewers intelligence; they pose no important moral questions about humanity. All mysteries of the way men function during war are fully explained away by the director, leaving no room for the viewer to form their own opinions about what is going on before them.The Thin Red Line does not insult the viewer's intelligence like this. Instead, Malick shows the ugliest side of a war which most people generally agree needed to be fought. One could arrive at either the conclusion that "war is bad", or that "WWII was necesary" from watching this; Malick is surprisingly unbiased. But the fact that you aren't TOLD what to think, that Malick takes no noticable moral position on the war, that you can't decide who's right and who's wrong in the conversations between Sg.t Welsh (Sean Penn) and Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel) drives many people crazy, as they are used to being told how to feel. Consequently, this film is stereotyped as being "anti-war", when it is not so concrete.The performances are solid, although I thought the casting of Clooney and Travolta was a bit distracting. Nick Nolte, one of my favorite storytellers, gives a great portrayal of a man who sees this war as a mere game to further his career. I could say Penn was amazing, but I feel that way whenever I see him, so I may be biased. Caviezel did, quite simply, give one of the best performances I have seen an actor give...ever. Regardless of genre or time period.All nations have their own legacies, and in American war films, this is by far in the top three best. I would say the other two are The Deer Hunter and Full Metal Jacket, again, films which many deride as strongly "anti-war", and again, something I disagree with. Simply showing the fact that war is hell is not saying that it cannot be justified; it's simply giving an accurate portrayal of the way war is.Most veterans I have talked to say no film gives a more accurate potrayal of what troops went through mentally/psychologically in WWII than Terrence Malick's the Thin Red Line. This is one of the three or four films (out of several hundred) on IMDB I gave a 10/10 rating to. If you like war films, buy this for your DVD collection, and even if you don't like war films, rent this just to see what you've been missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and moving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line takes the standard war movie (lots of violence, little substance, 'happy' ending where the good guys crush the bad guys) and changes it, makes it something more meaningful. The film's philosophical tone, the beautiful images of nature contrasted against the horror of war, the moving story, flawless direction, brilliant performances all round (with the exception of a slightly mis-cast Travolta) will astound and impress anyone willing to take the time to appreciate it's brillianceThe theme of nature, and the nature of man, lend this film substance on a level which most movies lack. A cinematic device whereby we can here characters thoughts as they try to make sense of what they see taking place around them provides an efficient way of allowing us to better understand them and is also a better vehicle than a narrative voice over for the moral and even existential questions which the film puts to us.The soldiers experience of the war is imparted to the viewer clearly through strong character development and wonderful camera work and cinematography. Many low angle shots make us feel as if we too are lying in the grass with the soldiers, every gunshot and artillery shell is felt as well as seen.Terrence Malick has created a film which needs to be seen time and time again to better appreciate its texture and depth, as well as for its contrasts of pure visual beauty and horrific battle images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you, Mr.Malick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My English is not very good, I don't have any experience in commenting films in English and I'm a novice in the Internet. I am glad to have an opportunity to read the comments about the film that made a great impression on me and I would like to thank Mr.Malick for his spectacular work. I saw "The Thin Red Line" in May,1999 on the large screen. I remember going out after the show absolutely shaken. That was very strong emotional reaction and I was fascinated by the visual row of the movie. It must be seen only on the large screen and after that you can see it again on video, although I wouldn't recommended the latter. As for the philosophy and ideas of "The Thin Red Line" I was pondering over them later. In this film you can not see the "hurray-patriotic pathos", so usual for the cinematography of Hollywood. It is not the movie about courageous American guys at the war. The nationality of the soldiers is not important here. In the grinder of war all are victims: you and your enemy, the nature, all the world. Everybody has their own God and say their praying but at the war their God doesn't hear them. One of the best episode of the film is the death of the author's alter ego. The very moment when he runs into Japanese we can see on his face the inevitability of the death and the desperate desire for living at the same time and it's acted perfectly. We don't see the instant of his physical death and thanks Malick that he didn't show it to us. In the mediocre director's hands it could have been a simple establishment of a fact, but Malick creates the real art here. This movie is not probably perfect in its form, but I don't want to discuss it. It's a real cinema of a genuine artist. Thank you very much, Mr.Malick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" was the most overrated movie of the year. A complete waste of money and time.There are absolutely no characters to get involved with. There isn't even a central character. Many of the characters (especially the stars) disappear from time to time. Sure the lingering shots of wildlife were beautiful, but by the umpteenth time we are shown the local fauna you just wish the film would just hurry up and end.Plus the message of this movie, which Malick spends so much time to display doesn't even ring true. I get the feeling that he is trying to say that war rips apart nature with its violence. But nature is also a place of violence.</fullReview>

Mallick's narrative poetry is repititious and devoid of all sense or meaning. such philosophical gems include 'who was it that is shooting at us', and well, i cant remember anymore of the crap that i had to listen to for the better part of 2 hours. dont waste your time on this drivel. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great cinematography, average movie with bad acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thin red line was a great movie, however there were a couple of things that was just not up to par for me.Let me start with the bad things. First of all, the acting was just terrible 80% of the time. This might be a combination of bad actors or bad script here and there, however, some of the lines were extremely cheesy and most of the lines/audio sounded like the volume of the dialogue was pulled down at the end, so i.m.o you have to listen very carefully, or else you will not hear the last word a character says. Another thing that was really terrible to bear was the fact that about 90% of the soldiers there were not willing to fight, scared out of their pants and had a cry face on the whole time. When someone had to go scout or flank or basically do anything, there was always a long silence before someone would actually man up and volunteer. No one wanted to fight for their country, they all looked like a bunch of cry babies. Fair enough, it's war, but still, they knew what they were getting themselves into. Not one guy stood up and said something like "alright men, let's show these Japanese what were made of!" Instead, they all looked like they were about to cry. And it's not like they were heading for Normandy, they were basically fighting a few squads of Japanese soldiers that took a large part of the island. Also, the movie didn't really focus on a particular person or group, instead it focused on some individuals and the rest of the troops, giving very little back story of any character and it feels like there is no real point of conclusion. They could have just shot all the beautiful scenes and had text appearing that displayed the narrator's words. I get what they tried to achieve throughout the movie and the message they wanted to portray, however the rest of the movie has no point. there is no conclusion other than the message from the narrator. There is no character's story, no real storyline except the narrators words.In any case, besides that, there were also a couple of positive things. The photography and cinematography was excellent. Some of the best shots I have seen in any "war" movie. Again, they probably received an Oscar for best picture and if they didn't they should have, because the shots of the soldiers moving through the windy grasslands, or moving through the jungle were really good. One or two actors had maybe a few decent lines and the music was good.To conclude, this movie had a lot of potential. The overall theme and message of the movie was clear, the cinematography and shots were just brilliant, however cheesy lines, bad acting and soldiers scared out of their socks about war just ruined it for me.</fullReview>

No leader would do this.He'd lose most of his men and windup cleaning the latrine.He needed to do reconnaissance and he didn't.This is not a secret technique.Find the enemy,his strength,his position and resources.Then blow them up with artillery.You use your artillery until every structure is obliterated.The men then mop up the area.Simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS*** "Thin Red Line" ranks right up there with "All Quite on the Western Front" and "Paltoon" as one of the finest war or better anti-war movies ever made. It centers around the angelic looking as well as acting Pvt. Witt, Jim Cavlezel, who's given a chance to redeem himself after being AWOL a number of times form his unit by his good friend and company 1st Sgt. Edward Welsh, Sean Penn, who assigns him to a disciplinary unit as a non combat stretcher bearer. Sent to hit the beaches at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands Witt soon realizes that he can help his fellow GI's, members of the 25th US Army infantry division, more in fighting alongside them then carrying their bodies, dead and wounded, back behind the battle line.Lead by Let. Col Gordon Tell, Nick Nolte, the troops are to relieve the exhausted battered and blooded US Marines in securing Henderson Field on the island that the Japs are determine to capture and hold on to. Let.Col Tell who's been passed up a number of times for general feels that this, the battle for Henderson Field, will finally get him the general's star that he sought for so long. Even if every man under his command end up getting killed and wounded in him getting it. The one problem that Let. Col Tell has on scudding his dreams of combat glory is one of his front-line officers Captain Staros, Elias Koteas, who's far more interested in the safety of the man under his command then any promotion he can get by getting them killed. Which is exactly what Let. Col Tell plans to do in having them take the vitally important hill 210 in a frontal assault not flanking movement, which will cost far less losses, that Captain Staros insists upon. The film has one of the longest sustained battle scenes, well over 30 minutes, of any war movie that I can think of that puts you right into the thick of the fighting between the GI's and their Japanese Marine opponents. Were shown in the give no quarters fighting how war dehumanized both sides with the what you would expect the good guys Army GI's almost as brutal and barbaric as the Japs in how they treat the surrendered and wounded Japanese soldiers in their custody. Not that the Japanese were any better towards the US Marines &amp; GI's that they captured in the fighting either.***SPOILERS*** It's late in the movie that Pvt. Witt's Humanity comes to the surface in him voluntarily taking the lead or point on a dangerous mission deep behind the Japanese lines in order to, if and when the time comes, have the men with him survive at his own expense. It showed to everyone in his company including his good friend. 1st. Sgt Welsh just how courageous Pvt. Witt really was, in spite of his record of AWOL's, in him saving lives not taking them. There an actor in the movie who get's a Dear John letter from his girlfriend back home who for a while I thought was Joaquin Phoenix but, until I read the ending credits, isn't. the guy looked so much like Phoenix that he could have well been his long lost identical twin brother!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't thinkso. The Thin Red Line is well made, that I don't argue, but better than Saving Private Ryan? No sorry but I have to disagree with people on that one. Plus it had loads of big named actors in it but I don't think Malick knew how to balance all of them. The endless quiet inner monologue scenes were meandering and dull. Plus to me Jim Caviezel just doesn't fit the part of a soldier fighting in the Pacific theater of World War 2. Malick is also pretentious with his directing and constantly tries to hammer in the message that war is bad and "every man fights his own war". Personally I think Spielberg conveyed that a lot better than this film with SPR, I say skip this one and watch the ten part mini series The Pacific instead if you want a better representation of what war was like in the Pacific theater and Saving Private Ryan just is the superior film in terms of its style of story telling and characters. At least the actors in Saving Private Ryan don't get caught up in pointless melo drama.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked, but really long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick doesn't do movies that much, so when he does we need to embrace them. The academy didn't really embrace them back in the 70's, but when he returned from a twenty year break in 1998 for The Thin Red Line, they gave him two Oscar nominations.The Thin Red Line is a personal film, a deep and rich character structure, which is truly what he does and always will do best. The film is mainly focused on certain soldiers, in the war. That's about it. It's three hours long, which is way longer than it needs to be. But for some reason, any director who does a war movie feels entitled to three hours.What I like about Malick's war tale is that it's not just three hours of shooting. It's three hours of men who just want to go home. The cast is terrific. The cast includes, wait for it, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Jim Caveizel, George Clooney, Adrien Brody, John Cusack, and many others. Nolte is terrific here, giving some of his best works.It's ashame that not many people remember this film. There's one main reason why: It's badly timed. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but do you know what else was? Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan, the best war film known to man.The Thin Red Line is a sprawling war epic with terrific cinematography, another Malick strength. It's a really good movie, but falls short of greatness due to it's length and because it doesn't really have a whole lot on it's mind. But you should still see it before you die. But it is a commitment.A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Equal parts spiritual and horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" (1998) details the experiences of an American platoon during the battle of Guadalcanal in the SW Pacific during December/January 1942-43. The heart of the picture covers the taking of a grassy hill protected by Japanese bunkers; but that's only the surface of "The Thin Red Line," as this isn't a normal war flick in the least.The film features an all-star cast with cameos by the likes of John Travolta and George Clooney. Nick Nolte shines as the gung-ho Col. Tall, who wants to take the hill ASAP whatever the cost. This is his first war engagement and he lusts for glory. Meanwhile "softhearted" Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) resists sending his men on an obvious suicide mission and insists on a less-costly strategy to taking the hill.Some of the men are so defiled by the war that they can't feel anything anymore, for example Sgt. Storm, played by John Reilly, whereas a few haven't lost their spiritual bearings, like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel); others are somewhere in between the darkness and the light, e.g. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn).Other standouts include Ben Chaplin as Pvt. Bell, who's dearly devoted to a wife who may or may not deserve it (Miranda Otto); Dash Mihok as the incredibly courageous Pfc. Doll, who wildly leads the way in taking the bunkers; and John Cusack as the bold Capt. Gaff, who's simply speechless in the face of Col. Tall's asinine antics.Other notables include Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody, Jared Leto and Nick Stahl.COMMENTARY: As noted above, "The Thin Red Line" is not a conventional war flick, so stay away if that's the type of movie you want to see. The battle of Guadalcanal is merely a stage for Malick to explore the nature of the human experience and, in fact, life itself. Why is nature at war with itself, from the smallest animals to people? Where does evil come from? What is love? Why do we feel it? Who is the Divine? What is the nature of the Creator? Why are we poisoned by war? What is death and why do we fear it? For that matter, why do we have to die? How can we keep from being defiled by strife and war? Malick shows both the beauty of the world and human existence as well as its horrors. We cannot change the way this world is and must therefore face the inevitable conflicts; the only thing we can control is our response to this ongoing war, like Caviezel's Pvt. Witt.As you can see, the film explores the noblest and darkest reaches of the human heart and experience. As such, it's a picture that keeps giving no matter how many times you've watched it. In other words, it's full of hidden gems to glean with each viewing.In contrast to the contemporaneous "Saving Private Ryan," "The Thin Red Line" has a slow start with an uneventful beach landing; it also has a mellow ending, but the center's full of brutal war horror even while its heart is deeply meditative and reverent. If that sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, see the film and you'll understand what I mean. In the end "The Thin Red Line" towers alone in the annals of war cinema, a deeply spiritual triumph. There's really nothing else like it.FYI: The film was shot on location in Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, and Australia and runs 2 hours, 50 minutes.GRADE: A</fullReview>

I've known many like him - passed over for promotion and looking for a chance at glory, no matter what the cost.Or Elias Koteas as Capt Staros, who cared about his men and looked at them as more than sacrifices for the war effort.Of course, you can't forget Sean Penn as that Sergeant that manages to keep it all together.Others will have their favorites, and everyone will take what they want from this movie.For me, it is war's futility.Everyone will experience a beautifully shot film that really was a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the movie was very long, every bit of it was bewildering. I think it requires more attention than Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. This movie portrays beautifully the struggles of war, with the questions of life embedded between the lines. The frustration in me at the fact that this movie did not win best picture is overwhelming.The film is most probably forgotten because it was released the same time Private Ryan was, and I guess people liked the fights and stories between the soldiers in Private Ryan more than the emotional ups and downs in The Thin Red Line (or maybe it is just because Spielberg wasn't involved in it.) I haven't cried in a lot of movies, but this one left me in tears, speechless and unable to leave. I was staring at the screen until after the credits, just thinking. And the only criticism I can think of is, why didn't they translate what the Japanese soldiers were saying? But I guess this is to add suspense to the movie, because I'm sure when everyone got home after watching it, they went straight to google.This is by far Nick Nolte's best performance. Yes, better than Warrior. He does a beautiful job at sending the feeling of anger and frustration through to all the audience. Apparently, a lot of people disliked him after watching it, but it just made me love him a whole lot more than I already do.If you loved the movies Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and When Trumpets Fade, you will definitely love this movie. This is without a doubt a must-see film for everyone.</fullReview>

It takes things way deeper than Saving Private Ryan or most other modern war movies dare to go. Very introspective and dreamy at times, with the camera constantly dwelling on faces, animals, and the landscape. Merrick is never in a hurry, and this pace suits the film well.The Thin Red Line asks a lot of good questions about death, war, and the ultimate meaning of life. Now that I have seen it, I'm very surprised that this film did not win picture of the year. Spielberg's film was a gritty, realistic portrayal of war. But it was also highly commercial and had a very contrived plot. In comparison, this film sort of wanders through itself and in the process helps to put you in the boots of the soldiers it portrays.My only criticism is perhaps the film was a bit long, but I never noticed that the second time through. I can't praise this film enough. Excellent work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Thin Red Line boasts an impressive cast that includes Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrleson, John Cusack, John Travolta, and George Clooney even though unknown actor Jim Caviezel plays the main character, Private Witt. The film begins with Witt hiding on an island paradise while AWOL from his unit, Charlie Company. One of the film's key themes, nature's inherent violence and cruelty, is presented here. After Witt gets picked up, the film shifts to the actual fighting that takes place as Witt's Charlie Company makes the bloody and nearly impossible attack on the Japanese base on top of the island. The film's major characters drift in and out of the story line and are often indistinguishable due to the mud and blood covering the battlefield. The only regular soldier that stands out of this is Witt whose philosophical voice-overs present the soul of the film. Witt's voice-overs are matched by Sean Penn's great performance as the leader of Charlie Company, Sgt. Welsh. Nick Nolte gives the best performance of the film as the highly driven Lt. Col. Toll who forces the soldiers to continue the deadly campaign despite all setbacks. Toll, a life-long military man who is experiencing his first ever combat, is an interesting character who is solely a commanding officer and is detached from the regular fighting men. Although the acting in the film is superb, the characters often fade into the background. The scenes of anonymous soldiers fighting and dying in battle and still shots of nature's beauty dominate the film. The driving force behind the film becomes the progression of these wonderful images that are only linked by the narration of the few main characters. Nominated for 7 Oscars including best director and best cinematography, The Thin Red Line is intensely thought provoking and a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatal flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I rant, I will say that this movie has some fantastic sequences. For example, the opening in which two soldiers are living amongst the natives in peace, only to be sucked back into the war. That was very good.In fact, the entire movie would have been just as perfect and fantastic as everybody says it is if only they had changed one thing; Cast unknown actors instead of big name stars.For all of its beautiful shots and haunting messages, this film comes very close to be laughable, stupidly, ludicrous. This is due to the endless amounts of COMPLETELY pointless cameos from famous actors scattered all throughout the film. Oh look, there's Sean Pen, oh look, there's Adrien Brody, oh look, there's John Travolta, oh look, there's George Clooney (for thirty seconds). There is no way that the makers of this film thought that doing this would not be a catastrophically large distraction, unless they were utterly clueless. This movie was not meant to have a character driven storyline, I totally understand that. I'm fine with the characters not speaking, not being given objectives, not having personalities or, well, features of any kind for that matter. And this would have worked just fine, if only they had not crammed in every famous actor available to show up on set for a few minutes and just sit there dressed as a soldier, then leave. The only character who comes even close to rising beyond one dimensional is Nick Nolte's.This does bring up an interesting point though- maybe I'm the one with the problem when viewing this movie. Maybe I'm too familiar with these actors, and thus too expectant when I see so many of them in one war movie together. So perhaps if I were to have watched this without any knowledge of who these actors were, then I would have been able to enjoy the movie's beauty and poetry.But as it is, this is about the equivalent of casting Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dolph Lundgren in Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A glorious and achingly beautiful movie about the psychological toll war takes on the men who fight it.Released the same year as Steven Spielberg's WWII combat film "Saving Private Ryan," "The Thin Red Line" exists on a different and higher plane of film-making from Spielberg's. "Private Ryan" is an exercise in technical meticulousness but has a giant zero at its center. "The Thin Red Line" gets into the heads of the characters involved and tells us what being in a war means to them and what it's forcing them to leave behind. Malick's film is haunting, ambiguous and stunning, but no wonder Spielberg's in your face patriotic anthem won all of the attention and all of the awards -- ambiguity has never been a big seller.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before it devolves into a remake of Platoon, this movie seems to be going some place interesting. Unlike Spielberg, Malick did find a new way to make a war movie. But Malick's insistent prettiness becomes very distracting, and inappropriate ...and irritating ...and intrusive ...and soporific. Each new gorgeous cutaway makes you mindful that all this self-conscious 'art' is being laid on a few feet thick. You could invent a Terence Malick drinking game to underscore all of his formulaic tics. He seems to constantly be thinking "We can use that really nice (mist shot, tree shot, light filtered through leaves shot, owl shot, lizard shot, bat shot) here. He's not committed to developing an idea about war, or to getting back to the story. He is however very committed to the idea that a viewer cannot go 20 seconds without seeing something pretty.Two-thirds of what he includes would have been scrapped by a less indulgent director. At one point he starts a skirmish in a dusky, misty wood and a minute later it's sunny and there isn't a tree in sight; best not to waste all that pretty footage he shot. It reaches a point where Malick's own effort at being deep is instead undermined by his visual superficiality. Is everything in the world, no matter how ugly, to be distanced from actual experience by pretty photography? ?to be converted into a pretty picture? When you make everything so ravishing that a viewer can't look away, you may have made porn.I don't mind that it corrects the outdated 50s conventions for war movies (as in South Pacific) where there's a single casualty and there's nothing but time to be cheerful &amp; sing. And after watching the dull &amp; flat Tora Tora Tora just before this, I was delighted to see shots not as brightly lit as a suburban living room. But at absolutely no point does this feel like the 1940s. I had to continually remind myself that this wasn't Viet Nam, because it's distractingly filtered through a revisionist post-Nam viewpoint. Just as in 'Tora Tora Tora' where it seems like no one under 50 was at Pearl Harbor, here only southerners fought WW2. All dialog more than three lines is given to one of innumerable Baptist-raised, home-schooled savants from the deep south who's two words away from some honest deep truth, or some bittersweet, Faulkneresque musing, usually both. I wonder what Malick would do if he was forbidden to fallback on a narrator drawling over a bunch of pseudo-poetic musings. As Carlos Cavagna has noted: "he feels the need to elaborate with voiceovers. Malick is unable to show you what he's trying to convey, so he must tell you." Forget anything resembling high spirits or individualism, these troops have been thoroughly screened so as to compile a full platoon of lost, alienated, anomie-fueled ruminators.Malick loses the throughline often and the last hour is mush. The 'love-making' scenes that carry one soldier forward are absurd; like something out of a romance novel or a perfume commercial, not the grubby, efficient screwing that's more likely part of the life of some back woods southern boy.Is it a better movie than I could make? Profoundly so. Is it better than Hollywood can make? Emphatically. Is it better than Malick can make? Unfortunately, no. This is a film-maker who is fussily pulling strings to get you to declare him a genius, not someone making art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite Accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the film to be enjoyable over all but there is one particular scene that does not fit with what I know of the Guadalcanal campaign, namely the various Japanese prisoners that appeared in Marine custody. It is my understanding that the Japanese either were eliminated in the any one of several BANZAI charges or otherwise succumbed to disease or starvation. The Japanese high command evacuated the emaciated garrison in Feburary 1943. Upon their removal, the United States began its operations to clear the remainder of the Solomon Islands with the Japanese acting in comparable fashion all the way to Bourgainville. Remember, to the Imperial Japanese soldier, surrender was the highest form of anathama and actual capture was little short as a day in Hell. Now, I respect Mr. Malik's attempt to inject some humanity (if that was indeed the goal) and to humanize the enemy to some point. However, if the goal was historical accuracy, then might I respectfully submit that this film has some shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Philosophical Meditation on War Damage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband, who watches the War Channels constantly, hated "Thin Red Line" because it was certainly not a conventional war movie. I think it should be compared to Kurasawa's epic films. I let myself float with it. Certainly WWII is used as an excuse to meditate on war in general, from a post-Vietnam perspective. I did have to ask my husband for some particulars on Guadacanal and he noted some things that were correct in the movie (the unpreparedness of the military who just threw 1000s of recruits into battle slaughter) and inaccuracies (at one point a key character defends his men because he's been in battle with them for 2 1/2 years - my husband chortled that no American served in WWII that long at the point when the movie takes place, certainly not in the Pacific, as they served from Pearl Harbor to V-J day, from '44 to '45. He just meant that at the time the sergeant was speaking in the film he couldn't have served for 2 1/2 years with those men in the Pacific theater because that battle started in 8/42, 9 months after the war started and the movie seems to take place at the beginning of the battle. Guadacanal ended 2/43, which still wouldn't be 2 1/2 years).But this was the first war movie that makes the visual case of war as anti-environmental. John Toll's cinematography is staggering beautiful. This is not a movie to rent on video but to see in a wide screen theater. Famous hunky actors come and go in visual and auditory cameos, much like they did in "The Longest Day"; clearly all the Best Young Actors were dying to play soldier, but they are so dirty it's sometimes hard to tell them apart--but that's like war too. (Hey wasn't that John Cusack? Whoa, it was him! Hey isn't that John Savage sort of replaying his character from "Deer Hunter"? Yeah it was.)The romantic memories are some of the most beautiful romantic visuals I've ever seen in the movies, but then all the images are breathtaking, but that makes the realization that war destroys love too all the more shocking.If "Saving Private Ryan," which used every war movie clich of the past 50 years, was about realism in war movies, "Thin Red Line" is about the philosophy of war (with a few anthropological clichs thrown in).(originally written 1/24/1999)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have ever seen (now around 20 times). Though it lacks many aspects of the book forcibly due to length, no other movie, not even Apocalypse Now captures war as vividly or with such harsh reality. Though by no means bloodless, The Thin Red Line doesn't rely on blood and gore to capture the evil, rather focusing on war as a whole, developed by a constant spiritual and emotional narrative by many of the main characters. Beyond this, the movie captures humanity with near perfection. Unlike the heroism that burdens war movies like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, The Thin Red Line approaches soldiers from the opposite view...no individual is more than mind, body and soul...humanity is the inevitability of breaking. And then, of course, there is war...How did we lose the good that was given us? Let it slip away; scattered, careless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie! Contrasts of beauty and horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie! Acting, scenery, battle scenes, death and dying, music, etc. The music makes the movie - being a cross between a funeral dirge and beautiful, peaceful island melodies. The calm, peaceful narration by the various characters is as powerful as the music. It reminded me of another great movie in the way it was inserted into the movie, and that was American Beauty. Contrasts exist between the horror of war and the beautiful islands where it occurred. Contrasts between the peaceful villagers and the hardened combat veterans. Contrasts between those with courage and valor and those without. In battle, everyone is afraid (or stupid), but some face it and go on and some cave in to it (been there, done that myself). Contrasts between the still-fighting, faceless Japanese soldiers and the Japanese wounded and prisoners. Many contrasts, many messages. War is horrible, but it is fought by humans or one race or another. There are leaders such as the Captain played by Koteas, and leaders such as the Colonel played by Nolte. This movie presented the human side of war. Whoever wrote those reviews saying there was no combat in this movie must have slept through it. To say this was not a war movie is unbelievable to me. It it is not the greatest, it is still right there with them. Yes- Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Apocalypse, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released too close to Saving Private Ryan, many people dismissed this as philosophical dreaming compared to the mega budget and very realistic battle scenes (which were about it's only true virtue. However, I loved every frame in this film - the depth it created, the horror and personal tragedy as well as the larger themes of destruction and warfare. You can almost smell the fear, gunpowder and dirt during the battle scenes and the sweat as they trace through the jungles. The situations are so real and you can feel the angst inside the men as they battle with everything around them. I think there will be two people in the world who see this film - those who truly love this film and those who didn't understand it. It took me several viewings to really get a grip on the film itself and focus on each character and while the length might intimidate some, I hate the end as it's one of those films I could keep watching and watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never had the chance (unfortunalty) to see this film in a theater - I'd pay $100 to get that chance now! I've watched this film countless times in the last few months since I bought the DVD - and every time my enjoyment and amazement of this film increases. The range of human emotion, of strengths and weaknesses, of the hopes, dreams, and failures we all experience in one way or another are all beautifully illustrated in a film that in its execution is nearly flawless. There are visual moments in this film that literally make my heart ache...and moments in the score that make my soul soar and others than cause it to weep. The cinematography is just fabulous - with every scene crafted perfectly - and fortunately without the overbearing slow-motion or heavy-handed digital manipulation which has ruined many films of late. The thing I like best about this film is that even though it is a war movie I never think of it as such....it is more a study of the transcendental nature of human thought, wonder, and emotion. Scenes like those where you see soldiers in the midst of carnage looking in amazement at some tiny jungle flower...or those where we see these men risking their lives to protect or ease the pain of wounded and dying comrades - these illustrate not just war but the human elements which both begin and end them. I strongly disagree with anyone who says that this movie shows U.S. soldiers in a negative light - war is war and that is just how it is: soldiers on both sides are seen committing evil acts and that serves to define the underpinning point of this film - that war degrades us to our basest selves, in all things. For me the most heartbreaking moment is when Fife(I believe) gets the letter from his wife asking for a divorce because she grew lonely - after he has carried her memory through such dark times. Thousands of men experienced that moment and for me it highlights the fact that not all casualties of war need be those in combat...that the thin red line between sanity and insanity stretches far beyond the battlefield and into the lives of those far from the fighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the movie might be a little too long, yes the movie might not obviously have a red line but though it all it is in my opinion one of THE and one of the most important war movies probably of all time! But why do I think about this movie in such an enthusiastic way while other guys just tare it apart in anger about their three "lost" hours of life? It is his tiny little thing the making the movie far better than Saving Private Ryan and consorts. It is the art of Malick to takes the bursting loud and chaotic nature of war and puts it in a calm and calming shell and mixes it with intelligent voice overs that really let you get into the minds of the soldiers giving their lives in a battle ordered by a freaking officer that has no idea what his orders might mean to the soldiers. It is just the point that you can really feel the fear and the desperation of the men running into machine gun fire one by one without the slightest appearance of patriotism and pathetic crap like it can be seen in war movies like Saving Private Ryan (which in fact is a good movie, too). Congratulations Malick! A masterpiece of a film what you have delivered here!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So it's not really a war film. No unrealistic heroes, probably realistic fear-factor of men in combat. The message is not original or very profound. The voice-over speculations on love and evil I found rather simple-minded. The maxim 'Don't tell them, show them' could have done with an airing, but I suppose the screen writer/director was following the book here (sorry I haven't read it.) While agreeing with the commentaries and analyses of the many favourable reviews found herein, overall, I found the film tedious.

The Thin Red Line not only keeps up this high quality but it's bearing even more. this movie is different. it has got a distinct flavour to it, unavoidably getting a firm grasp upon its audience due to its emotional method of showing the gasp between life and death, beauty and cruelty, light and darkness. this movie is a poetic nightmare inscened with intense pictures and words that go straightly towards the heart. The Thin Red Line manages to keep you spellbound in a way that is hard to describe, and after you've seen this movie, you can't deny the bitter-sweet taste of war remaining on your tongue. personally, i felt like something within me has died in this movie. the actors, the score, the dialogues - screenplay in general is a very impressive masterwork and deserves high respect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The direct but hard route to a peak of discovery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this a couple of nights ago, I'm pushing Thin Red Line up to my top five. Wow... WOW. What an experience. It's like a three hour, semiotic meditation on war as an encapsulation of various human conflicts and aspirations. The way in which it was executed (visually and otherwise) was rare genius. This is not merely an anti-war film, though I can see how it is received as such. It's not quite as naive as the ones usually considered anti-war films. In this one, the experience is even richer when one knows the history surrounding the Guadacanal invasion and what was at stake... then and only then to go here to see things from the narrower perspective of these ground units... that is very engaging.But that historical conflict itself is just the top layer in this film. We get many reference points to the depths. I'm thinking for example of the voice-overs as nude exposures of the characters' souls.- Soldiers are carried through with visions, or disturbingly peaceful memories.- The disruptions and the brutal indifference of nature. Interesting how Nick Nolte's character derives his war tactics from the same.- The inevitable but still ambiguous changes which overcome the characters who live through a hell.At the end of it, I can see that these characters have changed profoundly, even if they don't give away too much for us to go on. But at the same time I'm not entirely sure whether they've changed for the better or for the worse. This open-endedness was subtle yet very intelligent, a rare thing for a filmmaker to believe in. It's relatively easy for actors put into hyperbolic situations to announce with trumpets a dramatic change in their character, so we can all get it and learn the same thing at the same time.But Malick doesn't want to take us around there with an immediate and easy roundabout flank to the plateau of enlightenment like that. We will have to work our way up to that peak of discovery (self-discovery?) by the direct path of a simple enough surface story, but must strive to understand the undercurrents one slippery step at a time. And each one of us is going to ascend at our own pace because it is each our own journey of conflict.</fullReview>

Terrence Mallick's masterpiece it's not just a war movie it's a poem about the peace, about the price we pay in every war and how the real enemy is not in the other side of the battle it is in this part of the heart who is losing his humanity in the path of chaos. Just a few days after watching this movie I went to see Saving Private Ryan and almost go out of the theater just twenty minute after the beginning of the movie, cos the memories of every good scene of The Thin Red Line, with less blood and so much realistic concepts still were in my mind. The power of this movie is in the beauty of the images and every character. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, there are no heroes here (in the flesh of big actors), no bad men just soldiers, dreamers fighting to keep the innocence where only darkness flows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God-Awful Bad (Possible Spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I hope that any spoilers I drop aren't too obvious, I won't be using specific character names for them.I saw this movie when it first came out and have hated it ever since. I literally checked my watch every five minutes of this torturous three hour disaster of celluloid. I have always found Malick to be a wholly overrated director, and this film only further convinces me.First of all, the man cast just about cast as many big name stars and favorable character actors as he possibly could, and then slapped all of their names on the posters and in the opening credits, even though many of them appear very briefly. I don't consider George Clooney appearing for two minutes at the very end as some afterthought drill instructor reason to have his name get prime billing. And I really like George Clooney. Besides this, I found most of the acting (both featured roles and "supporting" cast) to be very very poor. Sean Penn and Jim Cazaviel are supposed to be award winning stage and screen actors, what the hell happened here?To add to the frustration of the sheer number of characters and the fact that you never get to know or feel sympathy for any of them, Malick has some of the most wretched and painfully bad poetry I've heard since my high school English class as part of the voice-overs spoken by at least 7 characters. And if you can't recognize the different voices, seven different narrations gets very confusing very quickly. It almost doesn't matter though, as the dialogue is inane and as boring as the poetry. I wanted to pull my hair out.In addition, the plot lines of featured characters are so predictable it's ridiculous. You know exactly who's going to die, watch his best friend die, lead the unit into certain death, get divorced while overseas, etc. Any time the new situation was introduced, it was so damn obvious just how it would be resolved.In summation, as eloquently as I can possibly say: This "film" sucks ass! Please, do not waste your precious time (and so much of it!) on this piece of trash. If you really have to see a war film, please watch something worthwhile like "Platoon," "Saving Private Ryan," or "Apocalypse Now.""The Thin Red Line" is absolutely awful and you will be p***ed off, at the director and your own dumb ass, for having been suckered into watching it.

I think the only thing I found interesting were all the cameo appearances which is probably the real reason I watched it to the bitter end. Oh, and trying to catch scenes with Adrien Brody. After recently watching The Piano, I wanted to check out more of his acting. I had hoped to see more of him in the movie because he was billed near the top. Well, I was disappointed. I did not even notice if he had any speaking lines. The other characters probably would not let him get a word in edgewise. Blah, blah, blah. I know war is scary as hell and can cause mental instabilities, but I wish they would quit talking/screaming about it and just get to their objectives. I found the voice-overs extremely annoying and the flashbacks/dream-like sequences unnecessary.I was disappointed because I was hoping for a shoot'em up war movie to get the adrenaline pumping. After the first five minutes, I was totally confused about the direction of this movie. I mean, is this a movie about frolicking with a bunch of natives during war time or are they gonna fight? When they finally made contact with the enemy, I did not even find the battle scenes very suspenseful. I also found the whole way this film was shot very annoying. I just did not "feel" the soldiers angst or fear. I have a feeling this movie was supposed to have an impact on my "psyche." Well, it did not. Watch South Pacific instead. At least with that movie you get some catchy tunes.</fullReview>

This is an artist's perspective, which isn't in itself bad, but in that respect the originality of its interpretation falls far short of classics like "Apocalypse Now" and "Slaughterhouse Five". "Saving Private Ryan" paints its characters broadly, but makes no attempt to hide it; it knows its power comes from the amazingly visceral battle scenes. The characters in "The Thin Red Line" are painted just as broadly, only the filmmakers don't seem to know it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie goes from a snore to engaging. It has a bunch of hillybilly WWII soldiers (who would be, more than likely nominal Christians) spouting post--modernism (a movement that didn't pick up steam in the US until after WWII). There is not one character that we, the audience, cares about. Not one. Every time you think you can get to know a character you're introduced to three more. And they're all spouting the same anti-war, existential mumbo-jumbo in the form of voice overs. And we, don't care. Then the guns start blazing, ah, we care. The violence is real and painful. Some of the best battle scenes ever shot. But it could be more than that. It could be emotionally moving but since we don't know, or care, about these philosophical soldiers it's just a great battle sequence. There is some great acting, but it's like the actors just had their short films, with no character development (the writer's not the actors' fault). This movie might be good to watch on DVD, just skip to the battle scenes and go take a nap. It's the same thing as sitting through this movie.</fullReview>

Some of the main characters are visually hard to separate from one another; voice-overs by some of them are difficult to pin-point; there is nothing like an over-all story with a beginning, middle and end; and there is a serious lack of sub-stories where they are needed. Especially: a unit is told to capture the summit of a hill; this is so dangerous an enterprise that their commander refuses to order them to do it; someone else takes over and they do succeed in carrying out the assignment; but we are not given any clear account of how they did it, what made the difference - more skill? more courage? unexpected luck?

I don't know how it got nominated for an academy award unless the academy members heard that in the theaters when the movie was over the audiences stood up and cheered. The thing is, they weren't cheering for the movie, they were cheering because it was over.This movie has a beginning and what might be called an end, but in between there is vast nothingness. There is no plot or storyline. It consists of battle scenes interspersed with the characters' philisophical rambling thoughts which mostly mean nothing because they make no sense.The acting in this film is horrendous. John Travolta is unconvincing and looks puffy with what appears to be a really bad pair of false teeth. Sean Penn plays himself in that he only shows two emotions throughout the picture, anger and disgust. Nick Nolte would play an excellent raving lunatic except I don't think his character is supposed to be a raving lunatic. John Savage does play a lunatic, but he comes off as the comic relief. The vast majority of the time that John Cusack is on the screen he is just staring at his superior officer. George Clooney could have been good if he had been in the film for longer than 5 minutes. Woody Harrelson is trying so hard not to be "Woody from Cheers" that that is all you can think about. There is a stellar performance by Jack (no last name) as "old man walking through the field". Sorry, that's only understandable if you've already seen this exercise in boredom trying to pass itself off as a great piece of cinema.If you choose to watch this film, don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a little surprised...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little surprised by the number of people in the comment section who seemed to like this film.I found this film to be trying to be something, and not quite getting there. I also hated how some people commented on the realism of war in the Thin Red Line. I found that all this film had going for it in that department was that the physics used in this film were much better than in older war films. Meaning, that a grenade does not propel a man twenty feet in the air. Aside from that, where's the realism? There is very little in the way of blood (World War II weapons, and all weapons, are not kind to human flesh.), and gore.The plot was also confusing. It seemed to lead somewhere, and nothing. James Caviezel, for example (I don't think this applies as a plot spoiler), is going somewhere and meets up with another soldier (I think it was the guy he was AWOL with at the beginning of the film). They talk, bla bla, and you never see the guy again. Was it to introduce some emotion, of how the guy is so happy to get away from the fighting. Maybe. Or another scene, in which they show an alligator (or a crocodile) that the GIs had captured, in the back of a truck. Did that scene contribute anything to the film?Also, the cinematography was, in a word, odd. At climatic scenes, you would get wonderful footage of the forest, and animals. Who cares? I don't care about bats in the tree. Not while these people are shooting at each other.The voice overs were also annoying. But only annoying. They got stupid later on when the guy dies, and I swear, he's still doing voice overs. Isn't he dead? What did those voice overs contribute to the plot? Nothing that couldn't have been spoken aloud.What was with the marketing of this movie with George Clooney, and John Travolta as key players?For that year, Saving Private Ryan was the better war film. Why? You care when the characters died. (small spoiler alert) Woody Harrelson's death scene, is tragic, but who cares? He barely spoke before, and there was nothing that made him more special than any extra in the film, except that he's Woody Harrelson. In the department of realism, Saving Private Ryan is ahead by at least decade.I have seen this film only on T.V. but it has struck me every time I've seen it as an unremarkable film that tries everything but achieves nothing. The so called realism, isn't there. Camera man is out to lunch. Plot comes and goes. This was the battle of Guadalcanal. This was one of the most brutal battles fought in WWII. This was the first major land engagement the Americans fought against the Japanese. We get to see how the bats in the trees are doing. Who cares?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please. Opinion is healthy and good - and it is allowed to be negative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having already submitted a review for this flawed but noble film in February, I am drawn to make this addition as a result of those reviews posted by rabid fans who clearly seem unable to allow negative criticism (no matter how detailed, accurate or intelligent) to focus on THEIR film! I am particularly incensed by bollocks relating to what Einstein may (or may not) have said regarding some fascistic argument that people who did not appreciate this film are, basically, inferior. An argument perpetuated all too frequently throughout the reviews. Bizarre really when you consider that war ordinarily exists because one race or nationality considers itself superior to another and yet, because people don't appreciate this anti-war film, they are classed as 'lessers' by those awarding themselves an intellectual superiority based on their grasp of one man's cinematic interpretation of a novel. Be careful, this is where it all starts.I don't doubt that negative reviews on this 'broad-church' website are frequently dubious and facile. But so are many positive ones. And no matter whether we disagree with another's opinion - we should never lose sight of being prepared to defend their right to voice it. Unless, of course, you're reading this in North Korea.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best war movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to say first of all, that I saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1998, and thought about walking out every 20 minutes or so. However that was then, this is now. Thin Red Line, while long, is an incredible movie about WWII, taking on plots never seen before in the war movie genre. Not only is the psychology of this movie provoking, but the battle scenes are some of the best I've ever seen, and even put the much overrated Saving Private Ryan to shame. While Saving Private Ryan was merely a vehicle for Tom Hanks, and obviously had nothing to do with what the war was really about, The Thin Red Line masterfully coordinates the struggles of several different characters, and allows each's emotions to be displayed on screen beautifully. To complete it, Malick uses amazing cinematography and makes excellent use of the score as well. After finally understanding this movie, I only wish Malick made more films like this one.. let alone more films in total. 10/10</fullReview>

All of the characters possess an inner voice, speaking to the heart of all men whether one wants to listen or not. It's a fabulous movie which deserves so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the negativity towards this film. As a separate entity from the book and from any other war film, The Thin Red Line is nothing short of beautiful. It is a meditation on conflict. Not just on war, but on conflict. The photography and the film score are outstanding. It's hard for me to recall another film with as much power in those two areas. I've never read the book, so I can't make any comparisons, but I think people need to understand that film and literature are different and people have different interpretations. It is unfair to justify a film being bad because it wasn't exactly like the book it was taken from. Stanley Kubrick's films were never like the book, he put his own interpretations in and they were always totally different than anyone else's! That's what makes filmmaking and film watching so marvelous. In my opinion, The Thin Red Line is one of the greatest films ever made, end of story.</fullReview>

For certain it is not a simple re-make of the original. Like all battle films it is peopled with the cowards, the cynics, and the lovers of combat. Nolte was superb as the Pattonesque, rabid rank climber willing to see any amount of death and bloodshed to look good for his superiors. 4 stars.</fullReview>

It is strong stuff and he does not shun away from the violence of war but I never felt comfortable about where the story was going and I found the sudden disappearance of characters made my mind wander wondering where they had gone.

As it is it repeatedly hammers home the same tired old references (a bird of paradise in a tree, a gun - a beautiful flower, and explosion - et al) over a tedious 3 hours. The characterisation and writing is exceptionally poor with some decent performances saving you from the full horrors of the script on first viewing.The spoken-word narrative is what ultimately sunk this film for me; schmaltzy and unbelievable the film ends up feeling cheesy and smug; rather-like a parody of the over-rated Apocalypse Now.Self-indulgent tedium - watch Das Boot or Dr Strangelove and save yourself a boring (but visually pleasing) couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, it was the latter. I didn't go into the film expecting Saving Private Ryan 2, although I was interested in what was going on in the South Pacific - My dad had been stationed in New Guinea and spent the war fighting there. He would never talk about it, though I know the horror got to him. He'd wake so quickly if someone touched him, and was ready to pack me off for Canada at a moment's notice during Vietnam.I love thoughts and feelings about war - Dispatches by Michael Herr, about the feelings and craziness of Vietnam, is a favorite book.Thin Red Line wasn't in the least bit believable to me, and it moved at the pace of a snail. And I don't mind snail pacing - 2001 for example. The dialog was contrived, pretentious and stilted - it was just poetry for poetry's sake - a whole lot of verbal masturbation. It would have made an interesting 5-minute avant garde piece for some PBS show. Congratulations to all the people who got to the end and loved it. You deserve the medal of honor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST WAR MOVIE EVER!!!! NO DOUBT ABOUT IT!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see nice cinematography of a jungle, rain drops, water, and plants, this movie is for you. If you want to sit through hours of narrative poetry about the meaning of life, this movie is for you. If you want to go to sleep, but are having a hard time doing so, this movie is for you. If you want to see a war movie with action and realism, then rent SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, FULL METAL JACKET or PLATOON. THIN RED LINE is NOT a war movie. There are a few battle scenes, but very few. The majority of the movie is narrations of poetry that each soldier is thinking or writing. There is a huge portion of the movie about one soldier narrating the poetry/letters he writes to his wife. It goes on for endless hours showing flashback scenes of him and her in a dark room with the window open and the curtain blowing while they are having sex. Then, after hours of watching and listening to this dreadful sappy crap, he reads a letter he gets from his wife that says she's leaving him and re-marrying. This was a huge bore and a waste of money. I almost left the theater but stayed because I was hoping for some juicy war stuff to take place. I guess I just couldn't believe that a movie advertised as a war movie would simply read poetry for 3 hours!!! Don't expect to see much of the stars that they advertised were so prevalent in the film. Woody Harrelson is in it for a few minutes, Travolta's part is almost non-existent as well as Cusack's. George Clooneys role is almost like he was just an extra in the film. I believe they threw these guys in there because they needed some box office attraction. If you want to see a Private Ryan type war movie, this is not it. This is NOT a war movie. This is just 3 hours of boring poetry and pretty pictures of plants, trees and rain drops.</fullReview>

I was drawn in to some of the characters minds by the use of thought, I followed the love story that depicted that everyone does indeed have that evil within ourselves. I stood beside the man who danced with the savages. So I saw the beauty of the movie...but well into the film I still had a hard time seeing which soldier was which. I couldn't understand who was thinking half the time. It showed "HATE" and "DARKNESS" in such a subdued way. Maybe if it had been darker more people would have hated it. But you cant have light without darkness, no good without evil. And although this film discussed that, and it showed people getting killed on either side, and it showed the men suffer, I think it could have been incredibly more powerful. You want to see a beautiful, powerful movie? Go watch Doctor Zhivago. Go watch Das Boot. You like this movie, those ones will knock you over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read James Jones novel The Thin Red Line and finding it the weakest of his trilogy (From Here To Eternity, The Thin Red Line &amp; Whistle) I wasn't expecting much from this film. For a war picture it tends to drag in many spots, is too long and the message isn't always clear as to what the director is trying to tell his audience. The filming of the combat scenes are good however. John Travolta cast as an Army General is almost laughable. He would have fit in as that character in Spielbergs `1941' but not here. Likewise George (Yes it's me girls in BDU's no less, aren't I handsome?) Clooney makes an appearance for no other apparent reason but to add another well known name to the cast. It's not overall a bad picture but had it been not quite so long would have been better. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was an insult to the WWII participants.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie seemed to be attempting to remake WWII as a Vietnam type experience. If the real soldiers of that war really behaved in the way they are depicted here, I doubt we would have gotten past Pearl Harbor. Commentaries on war are fine, but they can be generalized only to a point. This one did not make it precisely because they picked the wrong war. WWII was unique in that most of the participants truly believed in the cause. This movie was an insult to those participants and to me personally, as my father-in-law went through it all, right from Pearl Harbor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looooong and depressing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed this film at the cinema so snapped up the chance of renting it on video instead. I was expecting this to be along the same lines as Saving Private Ryan which was absolutely tremendous, however I was really dissapointed with this movie.While some of the characters where excellently realised and portrayed, esp. Elias Koteas, I found the film to be way too long with a lot of it being very boring. The middle section which had charlie squad pushing it's way up a hill in order to secure the top was the only part of the movie which really had any substance, or story for that matter. Most of the films narrative has it's various characters pondering the futility of war and life in general. A lot of this narrative is obscure and seems pointless but still wears the viewer down, like much of the rest of the movie. The pace is very slow too but it has to be said the most of the acting is very good indeed. Especially of note are Elias Koteas, Sean Penn and Nick Nolte. Ultimately this film is the movie equivelant of Pink Floyds "The Final Cut". Long, depressing, and once you experienced it you don't really want to hear/see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for the senses from the one of the best living US film directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line among Mallick's work but they have left a deep impression on my evaluation of Hollywood cinema. Mallick's film makes the earlier version of the Thin Red Line look pedantic and immature. He transforms the story into a virtual feast for the eyes, ears, and the heart. Nature and allegory play a bewitching spell on a serious filmgoer--take the example of sound of the wind on the grasses (dealt with only by camera in Days of Heaven. The flora and fauna rub shoulders with top actors in attempts to draw the viewer's attention. The storyline in the film does not merely revolve around seemingly disjointed episodes but even on postures of characters (Travolta's walk on the deck of a ship and Nolte's aggressiveness tell you more than what is spoken by them).It is indeed interesting to note that it did not win a single Oscar but won the top Berlin film festival award.Compared to Days of Heaven, this film is a testimony to Mallick's personal growth in the fields of application of sound and music in his cinema. In terms of cinematography, Days of Heaven holds more allure.Here is one filmmaker who needs more recognition within the US. In Hyderabad, where I saw the film the posters mentioned the actors, not Mallick! The marketing of this gem of a film was flawed as the wrong people came to see the film, while those who would have loved to see it missed the opportunity altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never have I been so disappointed in a war movie. Sean Penn was totally unbelievable as a Master Sgt. The flashback/dreamscenes were an annoyance. The beginning of the film was a total waste of time. The scenes between Nolte and Travolta were almost comical. I couldn't follow what was supposed to be happening. i.e. John Savages' character. The only redeeming value I could find in the film, was Nick Noltes' acting. On a scale of 1 to 10 this is at most a 5. This is the only war movie that I have ever quit watching.

		<shortDescription>Not "Saving Private Ryan" but still one of the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deals with the time that the army relieved the marines on Guadacanal. Very well done and perhaps the best ever performance for Nick Nolte. An academy award should have been due. Also the movie deals within the "head" of the combatants-something that is seldom done and done here very insightfully. One other thing that was done was to show the captured Japanese undergoing the same kind of emotional stress as their captors. Usually the Japanese are shown either stoic or vengeful. This is very helpful in understanding that our enemies are more like us than we like to suppose. "Private Ryan" was better in depicting actual combat in terms of accuracy but this should be ignored as this movie is more about what goes on inside the combatants than outside of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being Australian, I am proud to think that our film crews and locations are finally being recognised by America for high quality film making, so when i heard that the war drama Thin red line was being filmed here I was wrapped. A movie with Nick Nolte, John Travolta, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, Woody harelson and Sean Penn would be awesome and do wonders for the local industy.............and then I saw this movie, which in good light makes a more than passing resemblence to a floater in a toilet bowl!The film was nominated for a sqillion Oscars (including editing??????) why I must ask? The film was disjointed it couldn't decide which characters to focus on so whenever a member of Charlie Company died we didn't even know him well enough to even care at all! I won't make the obvious comparison to Saving Private Ryan but you can't spend 170 minutes in a cinema with people on screen that don't interest you.All of the big names were wasted in this production, even PENN and NOLTE who were at least allowed to speak for more than 4 minutes onscreen. I can only summize that their sole reasons for agreeing to take part in this claptrap were to get a holiday in Queensland during filming.save your money, save your bored sole, save the world ....seek out the original print of this film and Bar-b-que it!!!Rating out of 10?

		<fullReview>There are many aspect that make up a great war film. It is not enough to simply sit an audience down in a cinema and blast them with shells and death. War has never been black and white, you must alway strive to show the human aspects of war. The way in which it affects the solders and the villagers involved. " The Thin Red Line " captures all aspects perfectly, showing you the personalities of all the cast and delving into the mental aspects of both the front line troops and the commanders safely unfolding the battle from a distance. If you want to see war as it truly is then this is a film you want to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful film of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Well, it's a tie with Private Ryan). Before I saw this film, I thought that "Shakespeare in Love," though unworthy of it's Best Picture Award, was a desent movie. Now that I've finally sat down and watched "The Thin Red Line" and seen what it was up against, between this war epic and "Saving Private Ryan," I am banging to the beat of a different drum. How, oh how, did "Shakespeare in Love" beat "The Thin Red Line" for best picture?I'm not sure. Perhaps people just didn't understand this film and dismissed it as a "Private Ryan" wannabe. This isn't true. While "Ryan" was an equally powerful film, the themes were much different. "Ryan" had a single tone, and it followed it: Is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one? "Red Line's" whole concept is, why are men evil enough for wars to even exist in the first place? From this point, it asks many questions: What is the value of human life? What are we fighting for? Is the enemy really evil, or are they just like us, fighting for their beliefs? In addition, it paints the picture of the war through the eyes of at least eight main characters, as they struggle through emotional turmoil.The cast is great. Malick's direction and script is perfection. The cinemintography is the best I've seen since "Braveheart." There is absolutely no flaws in the film, and from the character's private wars to the central themes, everything is played out with a touch of a master.Again to reiterate: How on Earth did "Shakespeare in Love" beat this masterpiece? I'll tell you why: Hollywood is no longer comfortable with films about topics like this...It would rather settle for films about sex and false-romance over films about true sacrifice and humanity. And as long as Hollywood continues to think this way, more excellent films like "The Thin Red Line" will miss the opportunity it deserves: the opportunity to be awarded for its greatness!****************************** out of ****</fullReview>

In a strange way it has it's war is hell brutality but the location setting is so beautiful it offers a stark contrast to the violence unfolding before our eyes.

The only thing SPR had going for it was the opening battle sequence. The old man at the beginnig walking around the cementary with the two blondes in tight shirts was so cheesy. SPR will fade fast.

		<fullReview>Well, I'm not a person that normally has a black/white opinion about these matters but you can feel it coming : I most definately had *some* feelings after trying to leave the area (half in a daze with [for my doing quite rare] depressing feelings) Let me explain : TTRL has been compared by the absolute masterpiece : Saving u know who :) "Why?", I can hear ask myself so many numerous times... TTRL came over like a stunning nature documentary made by a halfdope director (wanna bet those greenleafed hills weren't covered by plain grass but by a kind of grass of a different kind???) Plants/flowers/wasted shots of the local inhabitants and I can go on and on... Where is the antiwar-message? If it wasn't the fact that going on a holiday costs money, I would leave at once to this lovely area... Hmm... Utter crap in other words! When I went to see SPR, I most definately had this 'gooey' feeling inside that turned my life literally upsidedown. With TTRL I discovered that it IS possible to fall asleep whilst the boxes are at a setting "10". Un-be-lie-va-ble...So, it's quite easy. If you have *any* set of brains handy, skip this movie please 'o' please. Look at the facts : SPR is beautifully made and the message pounds on you like a 10-ton drillhammer... TTRL would have been nice if they'd plan to release it as an insomniac-therapy; unfortunately they went for the cinema's and this was a bad bad thing to do ;) Score? Easy!

		<fullReview>THUMBS UP---Through symbolism, TRL focuses the viewer's attention to the concept of Dualism, a basic Buddhist idea that everything in the Universe is made up of "pairs of opposites" (Superstring theorists call these 'dimensions'). HOW we experience and react to life, depends on a deep understanding of these unavoidable pairs of opposites. TRL uses the backdrop of wartime in Guadalcanal to portray and exhibit these profound aspects of reality. This film is not intended to be a story about soldiers in Guadalcanal, it is a story meant to tell something about YOU, as a struggling human being.THUMBS DOWN--I might point out that people who disliked this film probably viewed this film as a work of PROSE, where water is water and a crocodile is a reptile, instead of a POETIC sense, where WATER is universally symbolic for the UNCONSCIOUS mind and the crocodile is the deep dynamic set of primitive human emotions, often difficult to control because they are rooted in the unconscious. For the unenlightened, this film is indeed boring...but with a proper introduction---;I've written the following to help the viewer understand TRL in a symbolic sense:SYMBOLISM WATER - The UnconsciousCROCODILE- (Note the film's excellent Intro) represents our mind's "Dragons". In European mythology, the dragon represents those negative aspects of ourselves which are often difficult to control -- greed for territory, property/food etc. To improve, you must slay your dragons. Buddhism speaks of 3 major dragons in each of us - LUST (for gold/money or sex for instance, without regard to consequences etc), FEAR (of death, pain, suffering, or loss etc), and SOCIAL DUTY (basically doing what you are told by authority; mindless living; allowing others to direct your decisions instead of following your own truths)CHILDREN - Innocence. Later in the film, we see what exposure to conflict/war does to the innocence of children; war changes our openness to others.BIRDS - extensively and superbly used in this film. Hawks- represents alertness to opportunity. (Ready to pounce on you). New hatchling on the war field - The struggle of the life force despite tremendous adversity. (Like grass growing between the cracks in the sidewalk) Vultures- Opportunists of death or misfortune (As an allied soldier collects gold fillings from the mouths of dead Japanese soldiers) Birdcage - prison. The binding of your ego. Limitation. (Later in the film the birdcage is open -- Witt's deep understanding of reality, the one flame in each person, has freed his spirit.) Bat--represents death. It's leathery black wings enclose it's body like a sarcophagus.Multicolored Birds--In standard mythology, Prometheus stole fire (power, higher consciousness) from the Gods and gave it to man. Birds flew away with the fire, passing it along to other birds. The fire burned their feathers which accounts for the different coloration of birds we see today.COCONUT TREE - the coconuts in vegetative cultures often were seen as human heads, as the nodules on their surfaces simulated human facial features.BLACK HANDS/WHITE FINGERNAILS - Witt joyously recognizes that we all have the same origin...we are all 'Brothers' in this sense. However, racism flourishes because many of us simply can't see this obvious fact ...hence the tear shed by Witt.THE FILM'S PROFOUND MESSAGE-- WE are GOD in the deepest sense. (To say that a Universal consciousness is APART from us is to evoke our lower nature, our dragon---what results are feelings of separateness and war ensues, which history has sufficiently demonstrated) These are the eyes of God, the hands of God and the Voice of God . This Concept is in Sharp contrast to most Western Religions.(In many traditional western religions, to say "We ARE God" is blasphemy!)God is experiencing the wonders of this world through our eyes, our senses...but it comes at a price....to exist at all, we MUST live in a field of dualism -- the 'pairs of opposites'. It seems even God can't escape dualism if experience in the field of time is the objective. We must affirm the good with the bad. We must affirm life! We must not fear death! After you die, you will simply manifest as a different individual, asking the same questions as you are now---why me? why in this body? why at this time? We inherit the experience humanity chose to give itself from the past- the good and the bad. We are creating that experience today for future generations (us). That is why it is critical to understand the importance of love for self and others- what we put out, we get back--this is karma. You as an individual die but your 'other self ' never dies; Witt realized this;He saw himself in others, lacked fear of death and in fact welcomed it compared to existence as a prisoner. It's our job to live responsibly in this world of opposites...to bring forth the positive potentials of reality (Witt-- "I see another world")--- for the worlds of horror are valid options waiting to be manifested too.(Read the Daily newspaper)As research in quantum physics implies, the universe is an interconnected whole of probability waves and space-time dimensions. When we study Math, Science, and Eastern philosophies sufficiently, we gain a strong intuitive sense of this idea....life begins to flow; fears are quieted, greed is overcome, we follow the truths of our own hearts, NOT religious fundamentalism as we are INSTRUCTED--- ("Why are you such a trouble maker, Witt? Isn't that what you like to do...turn left when they say go right?") Every day we look out into the world and see a miracle....we are in utter awe that reality can even exist...yet here we are! We experience the 'thou' feeling of life. We no longer believe in God, we KNOW God.---Carl JungFor further study, I strongly suggest you purchase: Joseph Campbell's ' Power of Myth' video series -6 videocassettes It will change your life.

		<fullReview>How unfortunate that the release came so quickly on the heels of "Private Ryan"; a lot of people went in expecting the hell-on-wheels non-stop carnage of that movie and left disappointed.A shame.Those of us who know Malick's work knew that this was going to be a more contemplative piece; however, I didn't know that it was going to be this great.Just as you don't go to the symphony to dance, you don't go to this movie looking for summer slam-bang action thrills. Instead, what you have is one of the most beautifully photographed and symbolic war movies ever made.Make no mistake: the combat scenes in this are just as jarring--if not as graphic--as "Ryan," and it seemed that they were even more unnerving because of the creepy anticipation that would unspool before them. The fog-shrouded assault on a Japanese camp had to be one of the most insane sequences since the "What are they doing!?" face-to-face combat of "Glory."Sean Penn contributes yet another convincing performance, and in what could probably be called the role of the movie's moral "center," the deserter-turned-hero Witt is unforgettable--Oscar for that guy!The many cameos are so/so. Cusack gets the best battle sequence and delivers as usual; Travolta is appropriately sleazy; Nolte does what Nolte always does. If you blink, you'll miss Jared Leto and about 5 other guys who's names you don't know but whom you'll recognize anyway. Only George Clooney seems somewhat tacked-on and strangely out of place at the end, much like Ted Danson seemed in the middle of "Ryan."Go watch it again if you didn't like it. Just soak it in. It's one of the best movies of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Movie With Money??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a professional critic or anything, but if one should state a "cult movie" as a movie which only appeals to those who want it and doesn't appeal to the majority, although the essence is really deep and thick, then this is the one.All the things in this film just tickles my lace curtain, old fashioned door knob and Vietnamese War images that I grew up with in LA, and I'm not lying when I say that this 3 hour movie did not bore me one bit. As I have said "Vietnam", although the story is about the 1940s, there is hardly any clue to what the era is. No big round cars, no baggy pants or funny hats. If you come into the theater in the middle of the film (which I really don't want you to do), you may think that this is about the 70s or even the 90s, and this is what makes the whole thing look so real. World War is no longer a heroic specialty of long ago. It's right there, right next to you, and hugging you whether you like it or not, sending the message "it doesn't matter which war it is". This is enough for me to cover up the too handsome looking actors (which I must confess that I did enjoy), too much calm words coming from the minds of the battle field, too much resemblance to "Days Of Heaven" and Travolta who looks too much like (my favorite, you know who) rock vocalist who passed away.The water, river and sea, is so beautiful to your eyes and soul. But then, a cult movie often does not have a good budget because you don't know how many people will like it. So this is such a luxury for me; watching a dream (or a nightmare) with one of the world's most richest scenery, acting, and technical effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT the best war movie ever made... not even close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>God this movie was bad. It tried so hard to be a good movie, but fell far short of its goal. The cinematography is incredible, but that's about the only good thing I can say about it. Sub-par performances from all the actors in this incredible ensemble cast, which is more the fault of the worthless script than of the actors themselves. There is little dialogue to explain what is going on, and instead the film relies mainly on soft-spoken, esoteric narration that flows thorughout the whole movie and takes the viewer in and out of flashback scenes (often in places where flashbacks seem unnecessary and unwanted). This narration, by the way, is spoken by several different actors throughout the movie and it is sometimes hard to tell who is saying what, and why. If you really want to see a great WWII film, stick to Saving Private Ryan and avoid this one. This film's only saving grace is its cinematography, so if you are into that kind of thing, rent this. If not, DON'T.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD RIP OFF OF SAVING PRIVATE RYAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is nothing but a bad rip off of Saving Private Ryan. I was bored throughout most of this film. I want to know why there were so many weird naked indians running around. The movie had some good action sequences but most of it was some guy thinking poetry to himself. This movie actually had a cliff hanger ending! Why would you make a movie that deals with a historical event and then make a cliff hanger ending? Maybe it was so people would go to the library and look up World War II. It was extremely disappointing. I gave it a 3 just because of the star powered cameos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is the biggest waste of money ever and I have seen Star Trek Insurrection. This film is the worst ever. Fair enough some of the acting was good, for example George Clooney's 2 minute appearance! What was that all about? His double looked nothing like him I only found that out by reading a paper! This film is absolute rubbish and I strongly recommend that you DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!! out of 10 I would not even rate this film. It went on for too long and the interruptions of the animal scenes were in my opinion not necessary! The film did not logically run through as there were jumps from one area to another for no reason! The war tactics used were the biggest joke as to send troops up a hill in the line of fire is the biggest waste of human life I have ever witnessed in one film! How this film was ever made I do not know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how bad I found this movie. In a film about war, it would help to have an explosion less than 40 minutes in. I constantly found myself wanting to leave the theatre but thinking that it couldn't possibly get any worse so I might as well stay. I should listen to my instincts. It was good to see that the Academy totally whored it and gave all the awards for which it was nominated to other people. When I was voting on this movie I found myself wishing for negative numbers. The only good thing about it? From now I'll see anything - I know nothing could be that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I've seen worse movies than this, but I can't really remember when: lucky for me, I block them out..... When were the guys in this movie gonna shut up? This is the most obvious anti-war movie ever. And that's not good...according to Malick, nobody on either side of the Pacific wanted to be fighting. When he shows us the G.I.s, they look shell-shocked, dogfaced, worn-out; the Japanese look malnourished, brain-damaged, psychotic, like patients from a mental ward. So who was firing the machine guns from the bunkers? Malick never shows their faces as if the men in the bunkers are different from the men killed and captured. And those unrelenting interior monologues!!!! Won't these guys ever shut up??!! Their speech was like poetry, but there was nothing poetic about it: it was like brick upon brick of ironic sameness. Each character, in an effort to express individuality, to break free from the sameness of the platoon, ended up sounding like every other loser. How the hell does Malick expect us to believe these guys won a war? Maybe they didn't win....maybe nobody won....oh, my goodness. War is Hell, and Sgt. Rock said it so much better with fewer words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An advice from me: "Please dont watch this movie, you will be disappointed". There are too many main actors, you will have a problem to distinguish the main characters in Malicks war. I dont understand the title of this movie and the bad attempt to show the brutality of war in this kind like in this film. Moreover the movie is too long and the contents too less. However I have to say the cinematography is beautiful and the landscape breathtaking, but this is too less in order to make a thrilling movie with a serious background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe in being shallow. I believe in being superficial. I think people are happier that way because bigger issues do not affect them as much. They can be concerned with lesser problems. I am not being sarcastic.When I walked out of this movie the first time, I was confused. Not about the plot. Not about the characters. Not about the narrative.People who complain about these things are just as much pseudo movie buffs as the people who liked the Thin Red Line are pseudo philosophers. I was confused because this movie was entirely different than any other movie I had seen before. It dared not to follow conventional filmmaking. I saw it a second time and it made even more sense. It is balanced, true, and follows its convictions to the very end. I don't pretend to know what everything meant. I just know that there was more to this movie than most people give it credit for. A lot more.I'm definitely going to see this movie again. And I know I will get something new from it. It is too big not too. As for everyone who believes in my aforementioned motto, maybe you could watch this movie and appreciate it in secret. Watching it alone helps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has left an indelible impression on me. I saw Saving Private Ryan before this film, and I am glad I did. To my mind, this cinematic gem demonstrates the horror of WW2 much more vividly than the Spielberg vision. The personal insights of the protaganists made me realise that what they fought for was not just the freedom of our way of life, but for individuals to have the right to think about how they wanted to live their own lives. I cannot believe it has not been recognised with an Academy Award. The finest examples of acting with minimal use of words that I can recall. The whole film was a wonderful experience.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, mystical but slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TRl isn't an easy film. Mystical, shifting, perhaps unfocused, occasionally exciting, more often philosophical, it was a brave decision to make it this way.One should start by observing that the photography is superb (though, admittedly, it would be hard to make this landscape look dull), some of the performances are excellent (Chaplin, Koteas, Nolte), and Hans Zimmer's score is beautiful, seamlessly blending his own string arrangements with the works of Ives and Part.Malick's take on war as a soul-searching experience is rewarding, and makes a neat contrast to Spielberg's gung-ho approach. Nevertheless, I did find myself wanting him to get a move on at times; when the film seemed in need of some propulsion, Malick would stop for some slow-motion contemplation with voice-over, or another shot of an exotic bird. This makes the whole experience dreamy, but slow.The casting isn't always successful: Cusack looks out of place, and you'll miss Clooney's contribution if you blink. As for Caviezel, I found myself just wanting to smack him in the end.8 out of 10, then, for courage, for finesse, for novelty and for intelligence: this is a good film which exhibits all these qualities. But I found myself preferring Ryan - for its directness, for its technical achievement, and for its harrowing detail, which TRL cannot (and does not try to) match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the greatest film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it unbelievable to read the sort of comments that have been put on the web concerning this masterpiece. Without responding to any particular comment: this film does not develop characters because that is part of the message; war embraces all men and crosses all socio-political boundaries - do I really have to know anything about a character to see the senselessness in his death?Also, to suggest that the scenes depicting nature so beautifully are merely arty rubbish just highlights the ignorance of those commenters. By comparing war with natural beauty the film highlights the ridiculous extent man has gone to by ending life and destroying such beauty.The film also breaks the mould in that out of the countless war films made this one has finally taken a fresh approach to dealing with death. Finally a film seems realistic when showing the reactions of men in a combat situation - my favourite scene being the silence and restless inactivity that proceeds the order to charge the enemy in a suicidal attempt to gain a ridge; it perfectly depicts the reluctance of sane men to take part in an insane war.There is so much more I could praise this movie for but I feel as though my words would be wasted on deaf ears. This film is clearly a masterpiece - all one has to do is sit and think and reflect on the film as it unfolds rather than wait for the next action sequence or explosion. I rejoice at the fact that many people feel similarly to me yet I cringe when I hear the moans of action junkies and philistines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrence Malick's "Of War"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a note for anybody who has not yet seen TTRL: THIS IS NOT SAVING PRIVATE RYAN II! It's vitally important that you understand this going into the film or even if you're only considering seeing it. It's vital because if you think you're going to see a straight forward war movie then you're only going to be hideously disappointed. And that would be a real shame because somewhere in here is a magical film. You've just got to be prepared to look for it.Terrence Malick has always been one to bypass story in favour of emotion. It seems that having taken twenty years off has not changed his opinion. As a result the first thing to strike you will be the beauty of the visuals. Each shaft of light coming through the jungle canopy is a joy to behold. Your next thought will be "And? When is something going to happen?" There's another ten minutes of Jim Caviezel as the constantly AWOL Private Witt to endure (yes, endure is the word) in his idyllic island life before a navy patrol boat arrives. When it does you'll be somewhat relieved because there is now the promise of something actually happening. Patience. Terry isn't finished yet.It's about three quarters of an hour before the opening shot is fired. For a war movie this is rather long. But this is not a 'war movie.' It's a movie about war. In the interval there's a long, slow study of the men in 'C' for Charlie company and the world they're entering. And again slow is the word. Malick takes his time introducing his troops. But then there are a lot of them to go through. There's about 17 major characters and dozens of minors. And all of them, without question, are acted magnificently. Penn, Nolte and Cusack will be the most familiar regulars but this film is held by the 'B' players. As it should be in a way because wars are won by the grunts. And as they all breathe life into such real characters we get Malick's sumptous, textured visuals. And what visuals they are. The sight of a native casually strolling by a squad of armed troops as if he was passing them on the street. Private Bell's memories of his wife at home. A butterfly as it floats by the tree roots. And then there are the voice overs. Lyrical, poetic pieces about the nature of man, war and nature. Yet beautiful as this all is there's no structure. There's no plot. There's no real direction.If a picture painted a thousand words then TTRL is the complete set of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, with appendices, with several copies of War &amp; Peace thrown in for good measure. But without a central structure there's nothing to string them together. And this is really TTRL's problem. It's a collection of emotional images but with no direction. It's enough for us to know that the company landed at one end of the island, marched through it, and came off at the other side victorious. But we never go into the events that took place in between. The only major event is the bunker attack in the middle of the film. But even this goes on for too long without nothing much happening. When this frontal attack ends the alternative flank approach succeeds in ten minutes. But then that was point. It showed that Col. Tall, safely co-ordinating the attack from a mile behind, doesn't care about his men enough to use a much more strategic but time consuming approach if the suicidal charge gets the job done quicker.And that is what makes the film great. Malick's vision, though slow and wayward at times, does deliver the emotional impact if you're prepared to let it. If you want slam-bang thrills then you won't find them here. That is not the film's purpose. This film takes you into the hearts of these soldiers and allows you to experience their emotions. The worst thing you can do with this film is watch it, find it boring and then just forget it. You must analyse it. Break it down. True many of the shots are unnecessary. But for each of those there are two so haunting as to be genius. For the price of a few too many of Bell's memories you have the sight of a lone soldier lost in a misty haze as the occasional bullet whizzes past. Or the image of Witt's return to the village to find his Eden corrupted by the cruelties of war. The best sequence is the companies attack on the Japaneses encampent. Whilst only five minutes long it's a frenetic episode as the camera moves in all directions. Inside huts, over corpses, alongside running troops. Its pace means we never actually see anybody killed clearly so there is no sense of loss. Until it stops and the defeated Japanese are paraded in front of us. There is no feeling of victory or pride. Only shame.Without structure a film remains only a series of pretty pictures. When the pictures are as pretty and emotional as this you can make allowances. They work better as short clips or glimpses into the nature of war and should really be seen as such. This is undoubtedly one of the best artistic movies ever made and you wish that Malick could have been given more time to edit it. A long running time is not a bad thing but it could probably have been used more constructively. I would rather sit watching a fantastic film for 10 hours than watch a series of clips on a familiar theme for 3. You wonder what Malick could do with a film that had a rigid and absolute structure that he would have to stick to. Until that time try this. If you have any interest in cinema you should enjoy it. If you don't well try it any way. It might persuade you to have one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for this movie, I said to myself "Now that's a movie I've got to see." In the wake of Saving Private Ryan, I was enthusiastic in seeing another World War II movie. But to my dismay, this movie for me, was the biggest over-rated movie since Waterworld. "The Thin Red Line" just dragged, on and on and on and on and on. The movie is far too long, the story moves so slowly it stagnates, the movie is all over the place and it hard to follow in parts. I can see how it is a good movie by way of telling the story and the philosophy of the soldiers, but for me this is a movie that had I know it was going to be this bad - I wouldn't even get it out on video. In the cinema I was in, people started leaving approx 3/4 of the way through the movie. This movie is not my style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a month of waiting for a film I thought was going to open on Christmas, I finally saw A Thin Red Line. It is quite simply the most overrated movie of the year. First, the opening 15 minutes are an utterly boring montage of shots of natives and tropical landscapes with a narration by the lead character slurring a southern accent that I didn't believe for a minute. This apparently is supposed to send a "message" of technological man intruding into a tropical paradise. Alright, I got it in the first two minutes, I didn't need it rammed down my throat for a quarter hour. Don't misunderstand me, Nick Nolte's performance as a washed up Lt. Col. trying to gain prestige and promotion through a victory was great and perhaps worthy of an Academy Award nomination. The combat scenes were spectacular and realistic, however, the film's useless baggage of montages, boring interscene shots and an absolutelessly pointless third hour cripples what would otherwise be a great film. The studio should have take control of this film and edited it down to two hours. The result would have been a leaner and substantially better film. Already, the word of mouth is going out on this film and patrons are starting to stay away in droves. It's not going to make a dime of profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That red line ain't the only thing that's thin... 1 star out of 4.I read a review posted on the IMDB stating that they were disappointed George Clooney didn't appear until the last five minutes of the movie. About 1 hour into the film, I started praying Clooney would show up!The first half hour is just a poor duplication of Das Boot. The rest is just poor (please stop comparing this to Apocalypse Now!). Terrence Malick has no idea how to shoot a film. With all this montage of scenery, flashbacks, voice-overs, and people staring into the wilderness you never connect with the character. I was just hoping the main character would hurry up and die.I'll rephrase that, you do connect with one character; Captain John Gaff played by John Cusack. Cusack seemed the only player that gave it his all and became emotionally involved with his part. It is because of Cusack this film is 1 star instead of 0.I've always hated voice-overs, and in this film they are more plentiful than bullets. Terrence must not have realized that he could have more voice-overs if it was all done in pantomime!The thing that scares me more than this film's success is that critics and individuals seem to think it's deep. If you haven't already pondered all the philosophy brought up in this film, you need a conscience. I felt like I was having flashbacks to book reports on sixth grade assigned reading.The side topics brought up in the film which could have added emotion were only touched and never examined. Examples include the passing over of promotion, a dismissal due to difference of opinion, the accessibility of an officer of higher rank... None of these topics were perused.In the end I should have saved the seven bucks, stared at a tree and had a four year old read the voice-overs to me. After these three hours, I wouldn't be surprised to see the tree get up and leave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie this boring and pathetic. Besides the point that there was absolutely no story to it, the movie was dragging. I can't believe that Malick could actually use up 170 minutes for something that had no plot whatsoever. He was basically using a lot of trash to fill up the time. Mr. Malick, please stop torturing us who like to see decent movies. I was going to leave during the middle of the movie, just like a lot of other viewers. But I was really enjoying my sleep in there. I think the theaters should consider installing removable armrests so we can actually lay down to sleep when they're showing a trashy movie.</fullReview>

It's attempt to be artful only succeeds in making the file a grueling drudge, with too much narration and false scene endings.Save your money, rent the letterbox video so you won't feel so bad when you hit the rewind button and slip it back into the Blockbuster box.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far one of the best movies ever made. Stunning cinematography, excellent acting. The decision to have the main characters played by less well-known actors was also brilliant - had John Travolta or Sean Penn played the part of Witt, it would have become an entirely different movie. I have to agree with what someone else wrote: you will either love or hate this film. Some have said there was no characterization - look deeper. Yes, characterization on film is often achieved through trite, simple narrative and stereotypes, and maybe that's what some want, but what makes the characterization in this film so effective is that it is subtle. You learn as much as necessary from an expression on someone's face or the way he reacts to battle. In writing, the motto is "show, don't tell", and this is what Malick has done. It's an absolutely amazing movie, and in 100 years or so when AFI does another Top 100 list, it'll be on it.</fullReview>

The battles were interesting. What happened to Elias Koteas character? His Jewishness was so important in the book - why the switch? I would watch Sean Penn make coffee but i, sadly, cannot recommend this.</fullReview>

The editing was poor to say the least, there was no coherent plot-line, no character development - it leaves you feeling unfulfilled and longing for the end long before the end is near. And even if you take that on its face, that perhaps the director didn't want you to get to know any of the characters particularly well because that's the way war is, well, I still feel like I wasted three hours. If I could re-edit it, and leave all the good bits I liked, there might be an adequate - if wanting - film. One thing that makes it worthwhile - John Cusack. He did a great job with what he was handed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, Mr. Malick, you disappoint me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the only reason critics haven't given this film the thrashing it deserves is because it was directed by Terence Malick (whose previous two films, "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven," are among the finest ever made). "The Thin Red Line" falls tragically short. The plot is loosely strung together and the narrative doesn't flow. The characters are undeveloped (with the exception of Nick Nolte's Col.Tall), and in some cases remain completely enigmatic right up to the film's unfulfilling conclusion (i.e. Sean Penn's). Unlike the effective voice-overs in Malicks prior films, those in "The Thin Red Line" are awkward and incomprehensible. It is difficult to tell which character is speaking but that doesn't matter because the poetic, esoteric nonsense seems to have little to do with the characters or how they feel. The bizarre cameo appearances of John Travolta and George Clooney seem to serve no other purpose than to get two more big names on the marquee. The great battle scenes are few and far between. In fact the only positive thing I can say about this film is that it is beautifully photographed; but we expect no less from Mr. Malick, who, in his other films, was also able to provide us with entertaining and comprehensible plots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great art, but, not a better film than Spielberg's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This motion picture is poetry on film at it's best. Each scene is perfectly in sink with the movie as a whole, while developing many characters in the film as well. In contrast to Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line manages to show the humanity of war, and attempts to give a compassionate sense of these humans which are sent to kill and be killed. It does this much in the way that platoon and full metal jacket did but is even more successfull. It touches upon the bureacracy, hypocrisy, and desensatization of combat but in a more matter of fact way than the two aforementioned movies. The artistic sense which Malick implements in his story-telling is unmatched through his utilization of flash-back and inner-voice. Unfortunately, this is also the one flaw which the movie suffers from. Unintentionally, this film suffers from the same thing all previous war movies before Saving Private Ryan suffered from and that is glorification. No, war is not made out to be great or good, but classical music playing under actions of war and violence are almost a guilty pleasure in an artistic sense. Yes, it creates a sweeping sense emotionally as do great swooping shots through the tall grassy fields, but perhaps this is where Spielberg succeeded. Priv Ryan was artistic but in a brutal way. Spielberg for once gave up much of his sweeping cinematography and went with the hand-held camera for twenty minutes straight, he desensatized you without pointing it out. He put you in battle without making it look cool, if only in retrospect, and he removed color from the film without you even knowing, which were artistic moves but not necessarily for the point of creating art but for the sake of creating an experience still unmatched by Malick. In Priv Ryan the characters are developed because you experience war with them, while in TRL your told who the characters are. In Priv Ryan you don't even get to know who the title character is because that's not important it's a war and there is no compassion in war. Your captain knows your proabably going to die, other-wise he wouldn't be a captain. I enjoyed A Thin Red Line more than Saving Private Ryan, why, because I'm a human. I rather see something beautiful which Malick creates than something real which Spielberg achieved, and the closest anyone will ever come to knowing what war really is like from a film, which will still only ever be a fraction of understanding what those men experienced. A Thin Red Line shows the humanity of war, while Saving Private Ryan shows that there is no humanity in war. Ask a veteran what they remember about war, most won't mention the humaneness. The better war film is Priv Ryan, the better experience is TRL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been waiting months to see this movie, and when I started to read all the negative comments, I got worried. Is it really going to be that confusing? That 'pretentious'? Full of empty characters?I'm sorry, but from the second this film began, I was completely spellbound. The images are so amazing that I still can't stop thinking about them and I feel like I have to see the movie again. The story isn't really confusing at all, it's just not a typical movie story. I guess people are upset because they don't get a straightforward Hollywood story with all the loose ends tied up neatly and they can't get all teary eyed because someone died that they really 'felt for'. If the idea of a great war movie is to build up a character so that you really like him when he gets killed off, then I don't really think you're getting the point. No one life is more important than anyone else's...not the Americans, not the Japanese, not the animals and trees that get caught up in the cross-fire between scared children. We're all part of the Earth, we live and die with it, and that's just one of the many things that "The Thin Red Line" said to me as I watched it. It's a movie that really makes you think if you allow yourself to, as opposed to just simply drawing an emotion out of the audience. An incredible movie that I'll never be able to forget. I wish Hollywood had the guts to make more movies like this. 10/10</fullReview>

That way it would get the admiration and the attention it deserves.SPR was made by a modern filmmaker, and shows all aspects of war just exacly right. Even the veterans themselves say that it is the greatest war-film ever made. The new growing generation will know what war is like.What I am trying to say is that we won't be shocked anymore by war-films, like we were shocked seeing SPR for the first time. And therefore TRL will not serve it's original porpouse - showing us that war is hell.It's great that TRL is made, and the film itself is very good. It has some flawes, but it's one of the best war-films I've seen.Another war-film that made an enormous impression on me was Andrej Tarkovskij's "Ivan's childhood" - genious film, made by a genious filmmaker.But still I must say that I've never seen a better war-movie that "Saving Private Ryan"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line has some brilliant photography. It's fantastic, and it is always been Terrence Malick's talent to film on fantastic locations and get visuals that come across as poetic and meaningful. It's a philosophically driven movie, using voice overs to share its ideas. But the movie makes it point 40 minutes in, making the movie more insufferable to watch. As opposed to Wings Of Desire, the points evolved with the movie, and seeing as Wenders also had a strong eye for photography, managed to evolve them and keep them more and more interesting. The Thin Red Line is an often repetitive movie, there is a strong sense that it is going no where.The whole entire conception that Malick makes in a philosophical sense is that nature and war are connected to men. Their is different interpretations, but those seem to be the main three ideas. Being released in the same year as Saving Private Ryan, it seemed rather clich to compare them, so I avoided thinking about SPR whilst watching it. But as a war movie.... it isn't horrific at all.The soldiers have hardly, if any back story whatsoever, the scenes that they have a wife, seem so clich and one- dimensional. The Thin Red Line is more of a novel than it is of a movie, it needs to show us more, how it effects men, how it is corrupt, how it changes the environment.... things Platoon and The Deer Hunter did masterfully, whereas The Thin red line falters.The whole film lacks direction, and it is much needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Private Ryan's philosophical (see stoned) cousin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one is endeavouring watch The Thin Red Line, the recommendation is to do so twice, once to gain understanding of the structure, motivated by one thing and one thing only which is, in one word, thought. The second time is to work out what the heel just happened!In one sense, Terrence Malick, a man who embodies the very epitome of perfectionism, in producing, adapting for the screen and directing Red Line has created a brutally realistic depiction of war that touches upon such themes as morality and mortality, nature's role in the world and whether it is inherently evil or just a random presence and one's very existence in this apparently beautiful world. On the other hand, it's all over the goddamned place! The perspective from which this film's narration is told changes so frequently that it's virtually impossible to comprehend what everyone has to say and keep up with the simultaneous goings-on. Brief flashbacks and a relentlessly persistent voice-over (that at select times is enlightening) present themselves as substitutes for any real substance when the film's trajectory ceases.The director's forte is his passionate love for all things that are untainted in their natural state, ranging from his beautifully crafted depiction of a Melanesian coastal village to his enchanting portrait of the emerald fields of Guadalcanal glinting in the sun, accompanied by an original score by Hans Zimmer, which it would be redundant to say is at times heart wrenching and others invigorating. Malick's idiosyncratic thought process is at its best in these conditions, particularly the film's opening ten minutes, where Private Witt (Jim Caviezel) sits on beaches and floats carelessly in the sea, wondering why the world can't revel in such peaceful serenity as he does. Witt is a man as gentle as Forrest Gump, with a bit more sense and perhaps too lively a mind. He is not necessarily religious but simply believes in another world, a concept that he and his superior Welsh (the inimitable Sean Penn) are at odds over. Penn as Welsh is a stoically intimidating cynic, his toxic jadedness even affecting the lively Witt."I can take anything you dish out," answers Witt to his sergeant. "I am twice the man you are." Welsh reclines back on his chair subtly and cocks his head to the left, his piercing gaze never leaving Witt. Witt's smile falters and he turns away; he's not so sure anymore.Another truly innovative approach to conflict is the verbalisation Malick uses to represent the relationship between the Japanese and American soldiers, particularly while the battles still rage. An American soldier in prone on the side of a bunker containing a Japanese turret is spotted. The exchange: "We know you out there, Yank!" "Tojo eats sh*t!" "No, Roosevelt eats sh*t!"Not so innovative, of course, is the token trooper (Ben Chaplin's emotional Private Jack Bell) with the girlfriend/fianc/wife/what-have- you at home who just couldn't wait anymore for him to come home and met this really nice guy and? yeah.Also, the constant ponderings of Witt, Bell and many others as to "Who did??", "Why does??", "How come??" increase in repetitiveness until you're certain even God isn't listening anymore. Which reminds me, why does it seem that everyone in Red Line is on a conversational basis with The Almighty? Are there no atheists in the squadron, or are they just not allowed screen time?However, to be fair, this film is far from a lost cause and contains too much enjoyable, aesthetically stimulating and professionally rendered material to simply be dismissed as a failed experiment.A particularly potent scene: Sergeant Keck (Woody Harrelson), in what he calls a recruit mistake, reaches for a grenade strapped to his belt and accidentally pulls the pin off instead, with the active explosive remaining tied to his waist. Reacting quickly, he throws himself against an embankment so as to fully repress the blast and protect his surrounding comrades from danger. The grenade injures Keck mortally, and he begins lamenting his error, shouting, "I blew my butt off!" (Not as funny as it sounds!) He claws at his face jerkily, wanting to remove any mud or dirt so as to depart the world with as clean and respectable an appearance as he can manage. The soldiers around him watch in silent pity as he slowly becomes delusional and eventually lays his head back against the trench. Bell turns to Private Doll (Dash Mihok) and asks gently, "You gonna write his wife?" Doll looks around, terrified. "F*ck no," he says tearfully. "I don't know his old lady. I ain't no good at writing letters."Penn's finest hour as Welsh is arguably his heroic sprint to a young soldier dying too noisily in the midst of crossfire. It's amazing to witness the conventionalism of commander/commanded relationship broken in such simple dialogue: "You gotta be quiet. I came to help you, OK. Calm down." "F*CK YOU! I'm dying. I'm dying, sarge!" "Well goddamn it, do it with less noise!" Welsh attempts to carry the wounded soldier which proves too painful for him to suffer. The boy screams for Welsh to put him down and just leave and let him die. Welsh's face flares with defiance. He runs across to a recently gunned-down medic and grabs all the morphine he can find. Bullets rattling all about him, Welsh returns to the dying kid and gives him all of it. Welsh stares down at the boy, writhing helplessly on the ground, nothing but sorrow in his eyes. He stands reluctantly. "Bye, kid." The soldier whimpers. "Goodbye, sarge. Goodbye?" Not a dry eye in the house.Succinctly, while Red Line is overstated, at times lengthy (it's hard not to be at 160 minutes!) and Malick sometimes finds himself drowning in his own brooding deepness, there is no denying that it has the potential to excite, provoke agonising thought and move its very perplexed audience beyond words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Just So Easy to Misunderstand This Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of Terrence Malick's sparse, efficient technique - choosing to allow the marvelous images, the nuanced shifts in tone, and the character's own impressions to provide whatever philosophy the film may have - The Thin Red Line is very easily misunderstood. There's very few, if any, moments that one can point to and clearly discern a simple, common, facile attitude. Every scene is an exercise in ambivalence and contradiction. For many people, this sort of complex reasoning is just too troublesome. They grow weary of the process of unwrapping for themselves the curious mysteries of the soul that this film explores. They are the frustrated, angry, bitter ones. I, however, am one of the amazed and thankful ones. It's the most gripping war movie I've ever seen. It's entirely an expression of the various soldier's psyches. Their personal motives, ambitions and fears assume the foreground, eclipsing the more sensational aspects of war. Troop tactics, martial strategies and national politics are barely recognized. An internal monologue, a half remembered poem, an incoherent rant constitute the bulk of the film's dialog, centering the action within the over strained, cracking minds of the combatants.Language is the weapon of choice as each soldier battles to retain a thread of dignity, a glimmer of hope. There's no right or wrong, just the possible and the impossible. The impossible is again and again forced upon them, demanding the most elemental, primal responses. Every confrontation is a wasting of precious sanity. Watching someone be eviscerated is only half as terrible as experiencing another man's psychic disintegration. The trauma of baring witness to this slow motion slaughter of the soul surpasses even the most graphic moments of carnage.The cast is huge but the star is Nick Nolte who very probably crossed his own thin line into the realm of madness. He so entirely merged his own psychosis into his character's, it's terrifically disturbing. He is riveting as he erupts in volcanic bursts of terror, hubris, conceit and bravado. It's as though we're present at a clinical exam of a tormented soul. All the other actors are very fine, notably Jim Caveziel as the central conscience. His posture - a wide eyed peace guru of indeterminate commitment to the "cause" - ruffles the feathers of career soldier Sean Penn. Penn is compelling, if a little stiff. In fact, Nolte's molten performance has everyone else looking relatively stiff. But with Sean's pedigree, I kept waiting for him to rise to Nick's challenge. Nick does have 20 years of experience on Sean, so maybe that's an unfair expectation. A totally fair criticism, however, is just how ridiculous is John Travolta. He can barely coordinate his own tongue to form intelligible words. His vocal drone is like the ringing of a lead bell. He's an absurdly inarticulate, flat cardboard cutout. Luckily he makes only a brief appearance.The theme of "Man vs. Man as opposed to Man vs. Nature" is gorgeously revealed in the beatific visions of the tropical jungle. What acts as an alternative Garden of Eden provides a lush backdrop to Malick's sublime morality. "If life weren't so tragic, it could be so beautiful"; a notion emerging from all the lingering gazes upon transcendent vistas, tender child's play, and home bound flash backs. A respite from war's horrors is offered in tender, dreamlike images of domesticity. Ironically, one of the most shocking, most traumatic wounds is inflicted by a Dear John letter received late in the film by a love sick soldier. Had he been made to endure this outrageous hell fire only to be made to suffer an even more exquisitely cruel hell? It's truly a godless moment, witnessing a breaking heart. Wyler's "The Best Years of Our Lives"(1946), Kubrick's "Paths of Glory"(1957) and "Full Metal Jacket"(1987), Nichols' "Catch-22"(1970), Hill's "Slaughterhouse-Five"(1972), Cimino's "The Deer Hunter"(1978), Coppola's "Apocalypse Now"(1979), Joff's "The Killing Fields"(1984), Stone's "Platoon"(1986), and DiPalma's "Casualties of War"(1989) had cleared considerable psychic space, laying a broad foundation for skepticism of traditional concepts of war, even our own wars. Because those films had accustomed us to the themes of profound ambivalence, cynical patriotism, and delusional, if not corrupt leadership, Terrence Malick was granted extra time and space to develop a particularly vague, ethereal philosophy. And so, "The Thin Red Line" was privileged to luxuriate in prolonged self reflection. It is continually considering its own role as a very public forum for inquiry, constantly doubting its own ability - or right - to ask the simple questions that it does. The specifics of its realizations are inseparable from its haunting imagery, from its hypnotic cinematic method. The true story can only be intuited through the patient act of experiencing its intricately woven rhythms. As a meditation or a prayer or a lamentation on what is war, this film is unequaled. An extremely crude summation could be "A war hero, it seems, is anyone who survives as even a ghost of their former self," but this, at best, is only misleading.The occasionally overwrought narration and Travolta's tedious bit may have slightly detracted (very slightly), but the "Thin Red Line" is very highly recommended for it's uniquely poignant insights into the horrendous psychosis that is war. If you're not deeply affected by this powerfully evocative film, I'd be very concerned.</fullReview>

And was "turned off" by the ridiculously cruel and inaccurate portrayal of Japanese soldiers. I only tend to visit the comments section of IMDb when something really feels "off". thank you to the commentators who articulated my "off" feeling for me. I guess I'm not the only one. I worked on Clint Eastwood's film Letters from Iwo Jima (aka Red Sun, Black Sand) - in which the Japanese soldiers ACCURATELY committed suicide rather than be taken alive.And yes, unfortunately "the poetry" did begin to get tedious.that being said... Nick Nolte was superb! Penn superb! And yes, Jim Caveizel superb! as well, there were some impressive performances from "lesser known" guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>war is hell, but poetry is heller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting film, but it's based on a rhetorical trick. War is such a hellish experience that the only thing that can make it bearable is the comradry of soldiers, the sense that their platoon, company, unit, is acting as a group, that they are looking out for one another. Of course, this is to some extent an illusion, but it makes the experience bearable. What Malick does is strip away any sense of being part of a group. The poetry, and the rendering of the inner experience ? and most often doubt; Malick never allows his soldiers to feel they are doing the right thing or to allay those doubts ? acts very quickly to reduce the soldiers to collections of isolated individuals. Naturally, under such conditions, the experience of war completely overwhelms them, thus making those doubts seem more valid, or rather, disallowing the possibility of any other way of looking at things. So, yeah, it's a good film, but it's by no means a great one. And once you realize that the poeticization is not only a bit of a rhetorical cheat, but also loaded against anything other than one way of viewing the experience, then the whole thing reduces to a propaganda exercise. The clearest indication that this is the case is in the fake utopia of the native people, everybody being nice and organic and environmentally conscious, which is, at best, a naive view. Prehistoric humans had wars just as we do, they simply lacked the destructive means with which technology endows us. The way Malick sets it up, however, he tries to make it seem as if war is the property of civilization, rather than something inherent in human life per se. Again, it's a rhetorical cheat, and a cheap one too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line suffers from a confusing and meandering narrative, laggard pacing, and over-indulgent film-making in general, which is a shame, since the film has so many powerful moments among the mediocre ones with brilliant performances from john Cusack and Sean Penn. Like Saving Private Ryan, it shows the reality the Second World War and constructs it to the brutal truth that it was with a series of stunning battle scenes that are not easily forgotten. But unlike Spielberg, Malick takes a more roundabout way for making this point, as i watched it in Liverpool switch island cinema i found myself bored sometimes in the slower parts of the movie.But it is one of the best movies i have seen with very good battle scenes</fullReview>

My view of this film is very different from the comments I read. First of all, I had a hard time enjoying this movie, and a hard time watching it, finding it sleep-inducing, slow moving, and insipid in dialog. Despite its having plenty of blood and gore, it just seems to lack realism. The characters seem trite and stereotyped, and only of three or four "types". I find it difficult to write the required ten lines here, because it it hard for me to find words to recommend this movie. Maybe it's too much of an "anti-war" movie to be a good war movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the most pompous and heavy-handed antiwar films ever. The plot is preposterous and the interaction between characters borders on sheer caricature. This sort of artificiality might be excused to some extent if the film itself did not beg--and I mean grovel, simper and then stamp its feet--for some skewed, hackneyed sense of profundity. The pretentious symbolism is enough to drive a viewer with the least bit of poetry in his or her soul far, far away. The allusions to far better war films and texts scream for attention like a six year old boy beside a GI Joe display in Wal-Mart. Cheap, cheap theatrics meant to evoke some cornball mystical view of a man's place in a conflicted world. The self-indulgent cinematography and story line make this epic and unbearable experience.</fullReview>

The action scenes themselves are well filmed and acted, however the parts where everyone asks why they are there and what the meaning of the world is are overblown and don't mesh well into a war film. Thin Red Line puts forth ideas about life and living and the meaning of it all right into the face of the viewer and basically demands that everyone to buy into the morals presented; a war movie is a bad forum for a spiritual lecture, which is what this is. This would have been great as a straight war movie or as a spiritual film, but not both mixed together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best anti-war war movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thin red line is one of the best war movies, since it doesn't just focus on the war itself, but also very much on the soldiers, how they feel, during a battle, during a briefing, when just talking between the battles, and it's all very credible and well-acted by all of the actors. All of them portray their characters well; of course a few of the big names are typecast, especially Sean Penn and George Clooney, but that doesn't drag the movie down, as their characters fit well into the situations. The problem of the movie is that it's slow. Very slow. For pretty much every scene that isn't a war scene, it drags terribly. In fact, it drags so much that my rating went from a perfect 10, down to a 7. The war scenes are incredibly realistic, very chaotic and confusing, explosions everywhere, people running and shooting everywhere. Perfectly staged, perfectly done, simply perfect. But the scenes between the battles are at times so incredibly slow that it can be a trial to sit through them. I guess if you like war movies, and you can sit through this, you probably should. But be prepared for some very slow scenes. 7/10</fullReview>

(Nothing against commerce and audience-tailoring, but it can't aspire to make an impact.)The messages that Terrence Malick has succeeded to get across:- War is two parties of silly boys having a fight... And warlords of these times are very far from the men doing the fighting.- The death of someone is the more lamentable and pointless because war will have no impact on this planet and life is so beautiful. (Of course, this may change with a world nuclear war.)- In war, human mind goes through so much, memories of life back there, a reality here, which is fights, orders and deaths, another reality here, which is the nature.- etc. (Anyone welcome to publish your own observations.)Both the master-work of photography, dramatic and poetic, and music, soothing, harmonic, slow and calm, underline the contrast of life and war.The movie is so beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Malick is one of the few living directors who still believes in the primacy of the "image" and the uniqueness of "motion picture" as an art.All through TTRL there are various shots of trees, natives, animals, soldiers in meditation, soldiers staring into emptiness..., these only emphasize his belief in the image as a "sign" or as a symbol vivid enough to convey meaning, rather than relying on an "external" plot that would render film "secondary" creation, following a path of a narrative or drama, like some sort of illustrations on paper to help with the read, or nothing but an extended theater captured on film. The image here is primary, more important than dialogue, plot, or background music. It's the center of the work, and everything else is there to give it prominence not to cancel it out. This has always been Malick's philosophy in making movies, whether it's Days of Heaven or Badlands, the image is the only entity which holds his films together. He does it in a simple, natural and quiet way, as if slowly exposing nature's (and nature means all that's there to be seen, including humans not only trees and animals) calm unspeakable, and indescribable secrets, that can only be traced as it sparkles in the time dimension, by the eyes.This isn't a traditional war movie, the novel itself didn't read like a war novel. James Jones seems to have been much interested (particularly in this novel) in showing the deterministic truth of our world, in which soldiers (as subjects) are nothing but puppets having no control whatsoever on their destiny. Of course he depicts war(as he has always done) not only realistically but also horrifically, not interested in major outcomes or nationalistic motives but in the soldiers, how all this affects them emotionally and spiritually. But also how this war changes them, makes them care about each other, and how an enormously different culture is the culture of soldiers and war.James Jones' "war" was "the cosmos" in how it represented determinism, and how it cancelled it out and dehumanized the subject. However, in essence, Jones' soldiers had more freedom than most other humans. Malick has delivered this vision, though he wasn't exactly faithful.The novel was also interrupted by descriptions of the Guadalcanal Paradise-like beauty, but these descriptions didn't seem as essential or symbolic as they were in the film, in fact the shots were more copious and took much more space, and in the film they served different themes, most notably that of nature's contradictory essence, "war in the heart of nature", the tranquillity of colorful birds contrasted with a crocodile sliding into a swamp, or the peaceful carefree natives with the violent struggle of the soldiers. However, the work is multifaceted and it doesn't exactly represent a single theme or philosophy. The issue was too big, too universal for James Jones to represent through a single character(or even two or three), he probably wanted and needed to involve everything at once in one grand kaleidoscopic vision ("allspace in a notshall"). All things coalesce into a primordial singularity of no names and no characters. The film takes that further and negates any sort of behaviorism. There 're no boundaries between the viewer and the character, the characters are almost transparent. Understandably, many people complained about the lack of plot or characterization, which if you have a progressionist's view of literature and art you'd consider both as relics of a bygone world, but that's extreme, and they're the sort of tradition that survives and is worthwhile, and the greater part of our modern creative productions do have a coherent plot, but to dismiss any work because it doesn't have a straight plot is blasphemous, some of the greatest ever works were simply thematic.The film carries some optimism, but it's not essentially in the face of war, war is represented in this film as something natural (though brutal). This was a meditation on a phenomenon, there are no messages that could be said to be anti-war. It's far from being didactic or overly sentimental about war. War is depicted as a complex phenomenon, an extension of life, an extension of an argument, a representation of a contradiction, a representation of an ongoing struggle within nature, everything is in a constant state of war. However, the Jesus-like Private Witt, who could be viewed here as one of the main characters (though less obvious in the novel), transcends all of this, into a true Paradise of peace, belief, and brotherly love, but he doesn't lead or act like a dramatic protagonist(and there're other characters who had belief in brotherly love like Staros "Stein" and Keck. Symbolically all die or fade away prematurely). Witt can become a source of optimism if you look for it, but it's the type of optimism that has to do with acceptance and calmness, not only expectance and hope.Though Witt is constantly searching for some truth or meaning, his belief in the Good remains unchallenged. That maybe what irritated or even dazzled Welsh, that in the midst of all this, Witt remains a believer, he'd sacrifice his life for those beliefs, actually he did, but it wasn't a sacrifice, it was more of an acceptance and submission, it was as if Witt was looking for death, as if it's a reward or a realization (in a spiritual individual sense, not at all nationalistic sense. Maybe Witt was in his most selfish when he died).This isn't exactly a film made with the popular taste in mind. The globally sacred Consumer Ethic here is almost non-existent, it's not value for money, not intense entertainment (no twists or turns, no common stunts or tricks). This irritates the "pop" moviegoer, maybe because it's too self-conscious, too difficult and complex to become a consumer's item. In the end, you don't have to accept the premises offered in this film or come out with a favourable conclusion, it's just a movie! But at the least you have to respect its ambition, loyalty and truthfulness.</fullReview>

It was so beautifully crafted, acted and filmed, with a stunning soundtrack (The Melanesian music was superb,and the musical highlight was Faure's Requiem-in Paradisium,during the opening sequence)and although i like SPR, this made me really realise the horrors of war even more,as we delved into the main characters, and there were many of them.

		<fullReview>Having seen this film in the theatre and now several times on DVD, this movie gains in stature with each subsequent viewing.It is a meditation on war, a speculation on how it fits in the scheme of nature, if it does at all.... or is it evil? It is beautifully shot. All those gorgeous shots of fauna and flora are not just stunningly beautiful, but are central to the movie's theme and indeed serve as commentary on the action surrounding them, even ironic at times.This movie is not meant to be patriotic or to give us an adrenaline rush (though it certainly has its tense action stretches). Indeed, the action to take a hilltop position on a grassy slope is certainly one of the most tense war sequences ever filmed...... perhaps we get the feel of what it is like to pursue and unseen enemy in bright sunlight in unexplored terrain..... perhaps because the enemy remains so imprecise..... fleeting distant figures yet close enough to kill or be killed. The heroics are real. So is the fear, the vanity, the care, the sacrifice..... also the betrayal, the irony.The negative comments I have read on this site I think stem from disappointment by viewers not getting the movie they were expecting. This is no formulaic "action" war movie.... not a Dirty Dozen, Saving Pvt. Ryan, In Harm's Way..... good on their own terms as these may be. They should take a second look at Thin Red Line.... listen carefully to the various voice-overs.... wallow in the imagery..... let the movie unfold at its own pace and on its own terms. I bet they will see a very different movie from what they thought they had seen originally. I think they will be quite favourably impressed. I think it is one of the greatest war-based movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-Rated Anti-War Statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exciting moments are few and far between in this account of an American Army battalion's experiences on Guadalcanal during the Second World War.Now, to be fair, the exciting moments - when they finally come - are pretty exciting. The battle scenes are well-choreographed and there is a strong and consistent anti-war theme jumping out at you all the way through (probably best summed up in one line: "war don't ennoble men - it turns them into dogs; poisons the soul.") OK. Message very obvious and received. It's just a matter of staying awake long enough to see it through.There are some decent performances. Nick Nolte was very good as gung-ho (and perhaps slightly insane) Lt. Col. Gordon Tall, who is looking to make his name in the war, and Sean Penn does a credible job as a Sgt. Edward Welsh, grown cynical as he watches the comings and goings of various officers, none of whom seem to really have a grasp on what they're supposed to be doing. None of the rest of the cast stood out. You can watch for little more than cameo appearances by stars such as John Travolta (dreadfully cast as a general) and George Clooney as yet another officer rotated into the unit, whom Welsh looks upon with disdain.The movie is far too long at 2:50, most of the flashbacks to civilian life serve no real purpose, and, frankly speaking, the movie just doesn't work for me. I think it's vastly over-rated, and give it a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Example of a war picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thin Red Line is a great example of what a war film can be. Unlike 1998's Saving Private Ryan (which I thought was the best film of 1998), this film doesn't have a plot with a big beginning and ending (even though that would be nice). It just chronicles a group of soldiers and their battle in the South Pacific, and with themselves. Good character study, and some good monologues by Sean Penn don't make this the best war film ever, but it isn't bad either. Pretty good effort by writer/director Terreence Mallick who returns to the screen after a 20 year absence. Big screen cast includes Penn, Jim Chazviel, George Clooney, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Shawn Hatosy, Elias Koetas and Nick Nolte as a powerful General. A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Red Line (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all star cast and good performances just could not save the plot of The Thin Red Line. The plot for this film is really boring infact its so boring that it made Beloved look like Jackie Chan flick. The plot is so slow and the war scenes are not that exciting. Saving Private Ryan is great movie but this one is awful. I just could not like this movie even when I try to. I could not believe this film was nominated for best picture, the film critics said it was good but not that good. The Judges nominated this film for over the Truman Show. The Truman is one of best films if not the best movie that came out in 1998. The soldiers sit around think a lot and we can hear their thoughts of course. This becomes more and more annoying as the film goes on. It was too long for such a weak war story. See Saving Private Ryan but avoid The Thin Red Line if you can. It's just not that great at all. Worst war movie I have seen.</fullReview>

The narrative detracted from the movie and the movie needed all the help it could get. Nick Nolte was not the man for this role.

		<fullReview>I was fortunate. I did not pay to watch this film. Still, I was cheated out of 170 minutes of my life!I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I saw the posters and thought, "What a fantastic cast!"However it was awful.People have tried to read all manner of intellectual qualities into this film, but the sad truth is that it's crap.Look at the poster: Sean Penn, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody... etc...etc...Where is George Clooney? 30 seconds at the end of the film, with Sean Penn talking over the top... And he was listed 5th on the poster. They should have put John Travolta's name on the poster too - just to really have a laugh.Don't get me wrong. It was beautifully filmed - lots of sunlight through leaves and pretty plants, but the constant drivel of the voice overs will make you want to pull your own teeth out.Another thing that bored me to death was the pointless wife. Her role was almost as obvious as the wife in Se7en.John Cusack and Nick Nolte were good, but they disappear half way through the film.Do yourself a favour - watch "Cross Of Iron", "Apocalypse Now" and "Saving Private Ryan" all of which are so much better.At least you won't want a refund of your 170 minutes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm...let's see here...a war movie with philosophical, lyrical and subconscious interpretations of good versus evil and man's view of immortality when faced with death and there's absolutely no mention of God. That in itself sums up how pathetically shallow this movie really is. In a nut shell, I thought I was watching an extremely expensive Calvin Klein commercial and I was waiting for some kid to pop in and whisper "CK One." Did you know Malick shot a million feet of film? Again, just another fact bearing witness to what a bad filmmaker this guy truly is. Let's face it, the movie is about a bad script...nothing more and nothing less. How bad? If they didn't tell you they were trying to take Guadal Canal, you'd never know it was a WWII movie. Do you want an example of why you shouldn't use stars for cameos roles? Then see this movie. While lingering in thoughts of walking out of this bad film, the viewer is hit with an almost cartoon-ish scene of George Clooney talking to his troops about how he is their "daddy." Does laughter in the audience during a serious scene like this give you any indication of how bad it really is? All I know is that when I'm on my death bed, I will wish I had this three exhausting hours back in a very bad way. Do NOT go see this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A philosophical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to define why Terrence Malick's picture touched me so deeply. You can say, at first approach, it's a great gallery of human psychologies, it tries to let emerge from war's destruction and violence the basic questions about each man's destiny and the non-sense of death, the non-sense of every war in every time. You could say superb actors' performances, great cinematography, brilliant screenplay, excellent direction. That's not the real point about this movie.The real focus is: what does anyone look for, finding himself in front of death? A sense to his life. A deep sense I mean, a non-political, non-ideological one, neither conformist. Every soldier feels the primitive force of life arising from all this horror and waste. Someone escapes into ancient memories of happiness and love, as Private Jack Bell. Most of them choose a pragmatic, individualist, fundamentally nihilistic solution: save yourself. But they, as well-represented by Sean Penn's character, don't believe either in this vision of things. In facts, they help each other against all: here is the true sense of their lives, their humanity. One of them goes beyond, searching for an enlightenment, a fair comprehension of the all. He found it living among Solomon islands natives, in a sort of Eden, next to the core of life. So he is not frightened when the enemy surrounds him alone and he knows he's going to die. He doesn't cry for his lost paradise. He saw the rays of the divine, he watched the other world, he touched pride and wonder of life, in a word he saw God. Nature, mother and step-mother, calls back her sons into her breast, and is new and old together: from the dead body a plant grows.</fullReview>

The mystical flashbacks and dying dreams and idyllic scenes of native life leave me wondering what the message is supposed to be.

		<fullReview>I missed this one in the theaters. Forgot all about it. Saw it on a list of 'Best War Movies' online, remembered all the buzz from when it was new and thought I'd give it a try. Big mistake.I like war movies. I like movies that take a turn from my expectations. I can watch a dog of a movie and find at least some redeeming qualities. Honest. Except for with this one. I was dumbstruck that this thing had such a good buzz for no apparent reason. I couldn't turn it off because I honestly thought that the worse the movie got and the longer it dragged on, the more awesome the ending would be and would turn the whole thing around. I anticipated that the folks behind the movie must be brilliantly toying with my emotions and something unbelievably cool would be waiting for me at the end. That was the only rational explanation for the buzz, right? RIGHT?!? wrong. Even after spending my teenage years going to poetry nights at a coffee shop I've never EVER heard anything so pretentious and boring as this movie. (Especially not supposedly coming from soldiers who are busy humping it through a jungle!) This movie is completely unforgivable and I'd give it a zero if only I could.

Thats right even 'Forest Gump' small action sequence that came out 3 years earlier than 'Thin Red Line'. Has a more spetacular and realistic action sequence than this entire slow motion picture. The film Directer should have stayed in retirement and the star cast are all a bunch of 24 carrot plonkers for starring in this utterly waste hole of a movie.

I saw at least 5 people leaving the theater before the movie was over, but my friends and I stayed there hoping for some good action scene or at least a satifying ending.

		<shortDescription>Worst Film of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line has to be the worst movie I've seen in more than 5 years. &gt; And for those of you reading this who still have an open mind about this movie: I really mean it. I don't exaggerate the way other people do about this kind of thing.Let me explain what I didn't like about this movie.#1: No Protagonist You might expect that in a movie where everyone is a young white man wearing identical army outfits, they might helpfully give people different personalities and perhaps NAMES so you can tell them apart. No such luck, I'm afraid. It's almost entirely impossible to tell when the action focuses on the character who's supposed to be the main character and when it focuses on someone else.#2: The Concept The Concept is "War turns you into a monster." Okay, first of all, this is a tired and stupid concept, it's been done eloquently and grippingly in two of the REAL war movie classics: Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now. Secondly, see point #1. The main character, barely ever named, impossible to tell apart from anyone else, is supposed to change. Well, maybe he does, but I never had a clear idea of what he was like in the first place to change... so basically this movie takes a tired concept and executes it badly.#3: The Action This is a movie about war. Right? So you kind of expect there to be at least some good action. Well, this is very disappointing, too. The central scene of the movie is about a whole bunch of American troops trying to secure a hillside protected by a hidden Japanese bunker. There's a lot of shooting, and there are some people dying but the scene skips around all over the hill, you can never tell which group you're with or where they are or what they're supposed to be doing, so basically it's just confusing.#4: Gore Well, without some action, it'll at least have some gore, right? SOME kind of effects? Wrong. At one point, someone is hurt by a hand grenade, and instead of showing anything, they basically just show his face with a little blood on it as he slowly dies. Basically, the best effects you can hope for are people pretending to get shot and falling over.#5: Dialogue Why not at least have some decent lines? I have to admit, the dialogue the characters actually engage in isn't too bad, but there's this constant, confusing, rambling, pointless talking, some detached narrator goes on and on with. None of it makes sense; artistic talk like that kind of requires that you understand the character, or that you at LEAST know who's talking.My basic complaint is, after sitting in this movie for 2 and a half hours, I still didn't know who anyone was, what was going on, what the point was, and I had stopped giving the movie a chance. This was SUCH a boring movie.If you want to write or direct movies, part of your job is to make a story people can follow. Without that all your high-flung philosophical ideas just become confusing and pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. If I ever have the misfortune of viewing a movie worse than this, I may have to slit my wrists in the movie theater. Every time I thought that the action was about to pick up, and the film was going to leave the sappy "character insights" behind, the action scene would come to a halt to listen to the character ramble on in his mind. This movie should not have been made. I had a more enjoyable time watching the previews for the other movies than I did sitting through the thin red line. I had to force my girlfriend not to get up and leave. I kept telling her it has to get better! It just has to. The introspective looks into the character's soul did nothing to make me care for them. It did not develop them, or even make me understand their reasoning. It only made me hope that they would die, so I wouldn't have to sit through their mindless, ramblings anymore. Do NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE WITH ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT. Take an enemy, someone you want to torture. Tell your boss you haven't seen it, but Simmons (random office name) thought it was great! Instead of spending the 7.00 on the movie, pull out your toe nails, soak your toes in lemon juice, and pluck yourself in the eyes for three hours...trust me, you'll have a better time!</fullReview>

As I walked around the victims, one was awake enough to excuse herself as she was still "zoning out." I will ask you to heed my warnings, as I thought the English Patient was one of these painful rides to astonish the critics. At the same time, I'd ask you to also notice that I'd rather sit through the English Patient 10 time in a row than watch the Thin Red Line a second time. Five of us saw the movie. To this day, we will remind each other of it just to hit that nerve. I hated it the most and it was probably because I stayed awake through the whole thing.

So, one questions oneself when viewing and absolutely abhorring the picture - there must be something wrong with ME. Not so, friends. The movie is just dreadful! How can this be? A movie boasting Sean Penn, John Travolta, Nick Nolte, John Cusak, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson, and a host of others should be good, right? Well, one way to ruin it is to have most of this power cast appear on screen in little more than cameos. Another is to have no script or coherent story. Then, have nearly all the characters either appear as trembling hysterical cowards, or carrying out insane heroics. Also, use plenty of pseudo-profound narrations and express lots of anti-war sentiments. For good measure, throw in many silent flashback scenes of one GI intimately interacting with his attractive and compliant wife.And when you do have dialog, make it inane and entirely nonsensical (Sgt: "I'm gonna make you a stretcher-bearer." Soldier: "I can take anything you can throw at me." --- Huh?) You should also have the 'tropical' terrain look like the hay-fields of Iowa.The Thin Red Line is a tapestry of snooty artsy intentions and battle-babble that runs on seemingly longer than the Guadalcanal campaign itself, and is no less painful to endure. I am more than halfway through it, and I am withdrawing from this beachhead and leaving it to its occupiers. Be kind to yourself and skip this one altogether!</fullReview>

Not to mention that anyone who knows anything about Japanese history knows that a WWII Japanese soldier would have killed himself before curling up in a ball, naked and crying. Could anyone even follow the story line? It seemed like the whole movie was "take this hill." Hamburger Hill did the same story, different war, but did it in half the time with a lot more entertainment value. Thin Red Line is a terrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the worst movie I have ever sat through and that is saying A LOT. First off, I don't normally comment on movies but when I saw that this film had a 7.1 rating I almost threw up. Had I been watching this movie alone I would have left the theater halfway through it, which is something I have NEVER done. Now, for all you who say it is such a beautiful movie, blah, blah, blah, yes it was directed well. However, good directing does not a good movie make. The movie tried so hard to make statements about how bad war was that they hijacked their own plot. The movie was spliced together like it was an anti-war propaganda film rather than a theatrical release. I cannot believe how many glowing reviews this movie got. It was awful! This just shows you can't make an artsy, propaganda film and still have it hold any normal person's attention or interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like this movie but could not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line is the first of Malick's work that I have seen or even heard of. It did not take me long to wonder, why this film was billed as a war film at all. For although it brings forth images of war, it focuses more on internal issues than anything else. The characters themselves say little. We see with their eyes, we hear their thoughts but we never truly get a sense of who they are. Nick Nolte's character takes a long time yelling orders and cursing his men's lack of courage. I spent the first half-hour confused about who was who. Many of the characters looked so similar in their army garb, not to mention that their monologues were indistinguishable. There are also several scenes which completely baffled me for their purpose. For example, one solider (his name escapes me) meets another wounded in the leg. They exchange pleasantries on a scenic hilltop and then separate without any action or significance. The monologues dragged on with an excess of rhetorical questions. The still moments of nature and creative use of light was exceptional. However, these images ran too long and at times I began to lose interest. Images, beautiful or not, cannot alone complete a good film. There has to some context for images. As far as acting was concerned, I felt that Sean Penn was just playing himself and not a solider. His indifference and strained effort at emotion was a nuisance, at best. The other big names in this movie were also ambiguous. Clooney receives top billing for a role that lasts only three minutes. John Travolta also plays a short role, in a uniform and mustache that make him look more like one of the Village People than an actual general. John Cussack's character mysteriously disappears at the end - someone help me here... did he die ? The other actors seemed to blend into one big army-green mess, all sniffling and trembling. Realities of war I cannot understand... perhaps. Nick Nolte's raging commander was the only mentionable performance and in the end his character has no closure. I was too lost in the confusing techniques and bored by the length. Anyone with a short attention span will be lost and those who are impatient will leave the theater, as some did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just because a lot of people didn't like THE THIN RED LINE, and just because it is non-Hollywood and long, doesn't mean it will be the next 2001. The similarities end there. Explain why critics love TRL while they once mocked 2001.2001 was groundbreaking and went in a bold, original new direction. Who would have thought to do what Kubrick did with science fiction? But narrating crappy philosophy over top of an inaccurate war movie? Is that bold? Perhaps. Original? No. The only originality that exists is that such an amateurish movie convinced so many people to worship it. Now, I don't think that has ever been done in movie history before. Perhaps Independence Day. Yes, TRL and ID4... there we go... both suck, and both have hordes of mindless cult followers, only one camp chants "Action!" while the other chants "Art!", (dont forget that if you like an art movie you're an advanced being).In the end, it's no 2001. 2001 has layers. It is deep, and its complexities can be analyzed. TRL, on the other hand, can be taken only at face value, which says "war=bad". Whoopee!!! I rank TRL up there with such classics as "G.I. Executioner" and "Sgt. Kubukiman, N.Y.P.D.".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Critic's Shame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The outstanding/good reviews given to this movie by almost every well-known critic, and the universal hatred of it by everyone else is ironic in a way. No critic is brave enough to admit that he/she did not like this movie. No, that would be like admitting you have no taste in movies, that you're prejudiced against art flicks - and we just can't let Stephen Spielberg be king forever.Well let me tell you something. I like art flicks, PROSPERO'S BOOKS is one of my favorite movies, but THE THIN RED LINE is just bloody immature. True, there are a few miscellaneous redeeming features, cinematography and other things technical; however, not enough to cover up the embarrassing dime-store philosophic narrations, the in-your-face symbolism (duhh what does that dying bird symbolize duhhh), the overacting, the pointlessness of half the scenes, and the constant repetition of the war-is-hell cliche. We've heard it all before, but now Malick wants to bore us to death with it. Maybe that was his point and this movie is a poke in the face at modern attempts at war movies. Nah... no one's that smart.I never dared dream that there could be a war movie worse than SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in the same year, but Terence Malick continues to shatter all Hollywood expectations. My hero.</fullReview>

The best parts of this movie occurred when it ended. I would have fallen asleep if it was not for all the characters crying so damn loudly every other scene. Ya sure the jungle is beautiful and its full of a lot of bright looking parrots, but what in the world that has to do with WW II escapes me. If I had to look at one more scene where the camera looked at the sun throught the jungle leaves, I would have started shooting at people too.The idea that people can actually say this is even a tolerable movie amazes me. I'm still wondering what happened to the bad poet that attemped to bore me throughout the movie with muttled speach and idiotic references. Too bad he didn't get dropped in the first volley of gunfire. I'm still trying to figure out why guys were swimming around with little boys every time I woke up during the movie. Oh let me guess, it was another mind numbing attempt to say that there is Peace within, ya yada yada yada. To say this movie sucked doesn't describe how bad it was. I was like national geographic on bad acid. It was an hour into the movie before the first actual war scene occurred. This was a war movie?I am so taken back that people refer to the imagery, symbolism, ya whatever.

		<fullReview>he return of director Terrence Malick to feature filmmaking after a twenty year sabbatical, this World War II drama is an elegiac rumination on man's destruction of nature and himself, based on James Jones' semi-autobiographical novel, his follow-up to From Here to Eternity. James Caviezel stars as Private Witt, a deserter living in peace and harmony with the natives of a Pacific island paradise. Captured by the Navy, Witt is debriefed by a senior officer (Sean Penn) and returned to an active duty unit preparing for what will be the Battle of Guadalcanal. As Witt goes ashore in the company of his fellow soldiers, they meet diverse fates. Sergeant Keck (Woody Harrelson) is killed by an exploding grenade. Captain John Gaff (John Cusack) is an intelligent, sober leader facing the destruction of his command because his commanding officer Colonel Tall (Nick Nolte) is bucking for a general's star. Sergeant McCron (John Savage) loses his mind. Private Bell (Ben Chaplin) gets a "Dear John" letter from his beloved wife. However, as the U.S. troops advance up grassy slopes toward entrenched Japanese positions, it is Witt's voiced-over ruminations on life, death, and nature that are the real heart and soul of The Thin Red Line (1998). Adrien Brody appears as Private Fife, the major character of Jones' novel and the author's alter-ego, although Fife has been relegated to a minor supporting role by Malick's filmed adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The war films as poetry . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' is a very poetic movie about the duality of man and it has lingering images that will stay with me. But they are in service of a movie that is too long, too labored and has too many underwritten characters.Where 'Saving Private Ryan' showed us the war in Europe, Malick takes us to the other side of the world to the taking of Guadalcanal. Amid the fighting we meet several characters (a few of whom are not underwritten) including a pacifist (Jim Caviezel) who has gone off to live with the Pacific Island natives; A bullheaded colonel (Nick Nolte) determined to have his war no matter the cost and a soldier (Ben Chaplin) who's thoughts remain at home with his wife.The rest though all get screen time at about two minutes a piece and that's too bad because this is a remarkable cast: John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, Sean Penn, John C. Reilly, John Savage, John Travolta. George Clooney comes on screen and doesn't even play a medic - what rip-off! Everybody gets their moment, a few words of dialogue and then are gone just as we are getting interested in them I mentioned that there were moments in this movie that would stay with me. I loved the opening image of an alligator sinking beneath the swamp water (symbolizing the animal that hides just beneath the surface). I liked the shot of a long path symbolizing the long road home and the shots of the open ocean symbolizing the gulf that divides these men from their civilization. John Doe's cinematography is beautiful.I appreciated these images just as I appreciated those in Malick's 'Days of Heaven' and 'Badlands'. But the movie tries your patience (and I am a very patience film-goer). It seems to take forever to come to a conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>show, don't tell..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one rule in film making, it is that you show plot, themes, motifs, and not tell them. That's the beauty of film - it is a medium that combines video, sound, script, and music. Thin Red Line amounts to little more than a series of montages of explosions and flashbacks juxtaposed with lengthy, almost pointless scenes. yes, war is hell, it is "poison to soldiers", it turns "men into dogs". Now, instead of explicitly telling the audience in lengthy, contrived monologues, the director could have shown us that through action (acting). Instead, we are subject to nearly three hours of mopey characters reciting the most trite and hackneyed of scripts, with cuts to quivering soldiers with thousand mile stares, and accompanied by a somber soundtrack to really hammer the point home - in case you didn't know you were supposed to feel sad for these poor souls.The characters themselves are rather two dimensional; they are mere vehicles for conveying their disjointed platitudes. The characters come stock: the villainous commander who cares for nothing except for his promotion, the caring officer, the naive officer, the aloof dreamer, the soldier with the wife back home, the various prospective heroes who are determined to die for their brothers, and of course their screaming and bleeding counterparts. Each of these characters have little depth beyond their purpose, which is so painfully obvious it makes the movie almost unwatchable.As you might expect for a movie that emphasizes philosophy (however flat and pretentious it may be), the cinematography is quite excellent, and is probably the only redeeming quality about this film. Guadal Canal in its pristine form is beautiful and paradise-like. When it is on fire, ugly and hell-like. These dichotomies are well portrayed.In summary, don't be fooled by lengthy scenes and talk of abstract concepts as a sign of a meaningful film. See if you can derive true meaning beyond what is simply given to you. My bet is, you can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A decent try at blending Philosophical lowbrow musings with Action and Character Study. It really doesn't work. The Poetic voice-over verses seem to be written down to the level of Junior High (Middle School) grunts of awe and inspired confusion. "This great Evil. Where does it come from? How does it steal into this World?" and so on and so on and so on.There is much of this kind of thing and not any of it is tantalizing, profound, or even that interesting. It does display a youthful heartfelt yearning for understanding, but it just does not enhance the Film. In fact, if anything, it mostly stops the Movie dead or at least lays it comatose.The Director/Writer is Poetic with a Camera, and that is an understatement, but with a pen, borderline failure. All of the off Screen mutterings, and there are many, could be removed and nothing would be missing. All of the stilted, corny, ruminations are present on Screen and delivered by the visuals. The whispering recitals are painfully redundant.The Film has Action and Suspense, Horror and Compassion, Violence and Suffering. It looks like the Garden of Eden, after the Reptile. It is a beautiful landscape defiled by the Devil. This is an admirable and noble Work that is surely to be divisive. Worth viewing for some wonderful and woeful images and Characters, but be prepared for a slow, restrictive ride full of stunning visuals and dull didactics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm serious, so much of this film shows shots of grass waving in the wind, it just doesn't work. The story has no pace, and comes across as extremely pretentious. We get the meaning of the waving grass by the first couple of seconds, yes, here is a tropical paradise, being fought over by vicious, violent human beings. Still, we get more and more waving grass. There isn't even any tension or apprehension that there could be a hiding Japanese sniper, just more waving grass. "The Thin Red Line" is like a fading shadow of the brilliant Chinese movie "City of Life and Death". This film also uses the technique of showing the beauty of nature transposed with violence and death, but in this case it works. Unlike The Thin Red Line, it doesn't have one side being the heroes and crack shots who can fire from the hip whilst running in the jungle and never miss. The disturbing picture of inhumanity portrayed by the movie "City of Life and Death" was probably what "The Thin Red Line" wanted to aspire to, but instead, turned into watching grass grow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Great Evil. Where does it come from?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The element of truth about all wars - "The whole f.....' thing is about property" - is only tangentially explored in "The Thin Red Line". The 1949 John Wayne film "Sands of Iwo Jima" expressed it much more directly - "That's war boy, tradin' real estate for men". Though the concept is well conveyed here, one's thoughts are sidetracked by the meandering voice over narration of various cast members questioning the meaning of life, death and matters in between. While I don't fault a picture for making the observation, it gets tiresome when stretched to almost three hours duration. I pretty much got the point at about the two hour mark, sooner actually, but was repeatedly amazed to discover that the picture had no intention of quitting.What puzzled me as well was relating to the cast list as indicated on the DVD cover. There's his name - George Clooney - but again, it was past the two hour mark when he showed up for a quick cameo. Conversely, Travolta had double the screen time, but wasn't even mentioned.So I guess I understand that it's supposed to be a different kind of war film, an anti-war war film if you will. That's OK, that's a point of view as well. Perhaps though, someone like Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) could have explained that if we don't take this island, the Japs will continue to use it's air strip to bomb bloody hell out of the rest of our troops across the Pacific, just like they did at Pearl Harbor when nobody was looking. Yes, war is hell, but the failure of war can be hell too and maybe even more devastating. Retrofitting sentiments about Vietnam into a World War II picture just didn't quite click for me, though I can appreciate the artistic elements that went into making the picture.</fullReview>

All tragically wasted on one of the most incredibly tedious and pointless films ever made. Rendered all the more painful by its laboured pretensions to philosophical depth and emotional significance.There are some poignant moments and at least one sub-plot that manages to wade against the crushing tedium of the whole to briefly, feebly, flicker across the screen before the audience is once again plunged into the desolate morass of myopic self-indulgence that characterises the rest of the film.Most painful of all is the voice-over which rams poetic but meaningless metaphors and platitudes down the audience's throats until they become grateful to be returned to the boredom.I have never in my life been so tempted to walk out of a cinema, and I have seen some absolute stinkers in my time. The only thing preventing me was the knowledge that I would be accused of not giving the film a chance or not viewing the work in its intended context.Those hours of my life are gone forever, lost to one of the worst films I have ever seen.

		<shortDescription>With Focus, Coulda Been a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With focus, Terence Malick's 1998 "The Thin Red Line" could have been a masterpiece.Though the film depicts the brutal and desperate American and Japanese battle for Guadalcanal during WW II, it is one of the most beautiful films ever made. There is as much exquisite and detailed nature photography in this film for it to be cut down to a one hour nature documentary. The birds, grasses, water, and aquatic life of the South Pacific are presented in all their vivid lushness.The film contains some first rate performances. Sean Penn as a cynical, "go along to get along" first sargeant, James Caviezel as a pre-Passion christ-like figure, Nick Nolte as a West Point careerist and jerk in high command, John Travolta as a windbag, Elias Koteas as a flawed but ultimately heroic captain, are all in their best form. Each has a moment, or moments, that are among the best work you will ever see these very fine actors do, and that is saying a lot.No expense was spared, so you see vintage WW II-era ships plying the South Pacific and what appear to be thousands of men preparing to defeat the enemy, or die.The problem is that the film lacks focus. If you didn't know anything about Guadalcanal going in, or about WW II, you won't learn anything from this movie, and all the men crawling around in the dirt with guns in their hands will just appear like boys playing pointlessly at war to you. Perhaps Malick intended that, but if that is what he intended, he doesn't do much with that message, either. Nothing is at stake. The Japanese aren't the agressors who committed the Rape of Nanking, the Bataan death march, or violated countless Korean women. They're just skinny guys atop a hill with a machine gun.The Americans are not average Joes utterly without plans for world domination, who were sent halfway round the world to defeat the Axis Empire.In short, there is basically no point and no plot to what's onscreen.Too, the movie suffers greatly from voiceover narration. Outside of Film Noir, you can bet that narration is a sign of a bad movie. In this movie about war, men go on and on dreamily in a faux-noble style, waxing philosophical about love, the afterlife, and purpose.Oh, come on. Don't soldiers in war ever think mundane thoughts? Like, "Gee, I wish I could have a ham sandwhich right now"?All these Deep-Thoughts voiceovers make war seem like an inspirational adventure; probably not Malick's goal.Too, there are too many star cameos. Do we need the face of that one anonymous GI to be Adrien Brody's face? Do we need a new commander who is onscreen for about two minutes to be George Clooney? These cameos of big stars in small roles seem just plain silly.Finally, one key character, Witt, is just plain hard to believe. He's a conscientious objector, or repeat AWOL-er, or something. He keeps running away. And then, of course, he turns out to be the most noble warrior of all.Okay, but ... why? Why is the best warrior in the outfit the guy who always runs away? Give us some characterization, some story, some plot, some coherence.None are to be found in this flawed but beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too many slips and instances of equipment, etc. not available during the period. Although the cast is better suited than the 1964 version and does a better acting job. Color over the original B&amp;W certainly adds some enhancement to the film. The director probably doesn't realize there was no Air Force until 1947, far after the war was over. Not really a great piece of work that demands your total attention. Some day perhaps Clooney will be the tough, action hero he sees in himself, although I doubt it. To be fair, I watched this film on the USA channel and the commercials were a pain. I was just as glad to be done with this film as the persons it portrayed were to get out of the line and on to something better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the worst movie I had ever paid to see, until I recently saw "Anger Management". I am a veteran, and I enjoy war movies. This however, was not a war movie. It was a weird excuse to pack in celebrities into minor roles, and to have Sean Penn say strange things against a jungle backdrop. My friends and I were laughing in the theater by the 2nd hour of this movie, when they show a bird flying, and offscreen Sean Penn says something to the effect of "Why do some men fear the darkness, while others run from the light?". My question is, why would anyone like this movie?My other problem was the massive infusion of celebrities in this flick. I thought Nick Nolte was okay in his role, but did we really need John Travolta, John Cusack, George Clooney and others in small supporting roles?I really dont think this movie compares with such greats as "Battleground", "The Story of GI Joe", or even "Saving Private Ryan".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont understand why so many people dislike this movie.I thought it was good.It is in fact one of my favorite war movies,considering that there are not so many war movies out there.This movie shows a better perspective of each soldier and there emotions.It also has one of the best casts I have ever seen.The thin red line,like Saving private Ryan,shows only a a special event in the second world war.The movie shows the americans taking over a little island from the Japanese,in the pacific.I think this movie is very underrated,but must admit that it has moments where it goes a little slow and I think that they could cut the length by half an hour and still tell the same story,because it is a little to long. But all in all I think it is a good movie.</fullReview>

And at least a turd doesn't pretent to be caviar, this movie does. I was lured into the trap because of Sean Penn (although the first warning bell rang after realizing that there were too many big time actors here, hence something is terribly wrong), and boy, after the first 45 minutes I couldn't stop watching my watch every 5 seconds. After the first 90 minutes I felt I was slipping into a deep coma, and after 2 hours became really afraid of suffering brain death, so I ran out.

		<fullReview>I read through some of the comments by others and I am afraid I cannot remain silent. Usually I just move on but this time I was forced to comment.This website actually has a little plot line listed; giving the incorrect impression that there was a plot.I saw none. I saw paddling. I heard narration. I saw camera shots that have been in a host of other movies before. I saw characters come and go with no rhyme or reason. I saw a woman on a beach; some other beach. I saw paddling again.The movie people released a trailer giving the impression that this was a war movie. It was not.It didn't have to be but at least they could have been up front about it.I didn't think anything could top Contact as the worst movie I have seen in a very long time but this proved me wrong. I don't know how long I was in the theatre. Days maybe? Weeks? I know it was too long. I aged noticeably.Seriously though. This movie was a failed artistic statement. It is proof that the only people that are interested in this kind of drivel are artist wannabes. The movie critics and the artist groupies that pat themselves on the back at functions and talk about the low brows that aren't cultured enough to understand a fine piece of work such as this. It's too deep for us.Being an artist myself I know about these people because they annoy me. They claim to love art and expression but all they really seem to do is try to make it inaccessible by touting anything bad or incomprehensible as great art. This leads the remainder of the people to assume they know nothing of art because they really thought Thin Red Line stunk.Guess what people. It did stink. It failed to make the grand statement that it set out to make.It isn't even just that. the enemy in a real war doesn't stop attacking because Woody Harrelson blows his butt up. There is no paddling. Battalions don't attack and assume the entire enemy unit is made up of one stupid man and then go away. Ghosts don't appear and talk to anyone. You don't go AWOL and then rejoin your troops after one heartfelt conversation that makes no sense to the viewers.Most of these are little things but there are so many of them in this movie that they become one big thing. A bad movie.Anyway, suffice it to say. Don't go to this movie unless, in your own opinion, you are a deep person capable of thought well above and beyond that of we simple folk. For this is an exceptionally deep movie. So much so that no one understands anything about it. No one I have yet heard from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ahhh... what a movie. I suppose I did need a good nap, and this movie provided the perfect backdrop. This stunted war flick had the continuity of Jacob's Ladder, the character development of Fun With Dick and Jane (the book, not the movie), and the writing of Blues Brothers 2000.The Thin Red Line is a movie with no beginning, no end, and about three different middles. The viewer wonders: Is it the story of a dissident soldier, the story of a battle for a hill, a story about hope in the face of adversity, a story about how there is evil inherently present in nature and man? Turns out that it is not much of any of these. None of these story lines was spun thoroughly enough to be worth of my $8. My apologies to Mr. Malick, but you have failed in the extremely difficult task of combining three movies into one.Some characters are explained all too simply in plain english, such as Nick Nolte's character when he reveals that his career has been retarded by a lack of combat experience, therefore he wants to create as much hell-on-earth as his stunted military acumen needs. But beyond the few obvious roles, the vast majority of characters thoughts and motivations are nebulous, inconsistent, and never explained. Even the narration makes no sense. What the heck was he talking about?!Although some imagery and themes were evident, I don't think it worthy of a high budget 170 minute film. I could strap my camcorder to my dogs collar, and I'll wager that in 170 minutes of running around the neigborhood hydrants, he captures more brilliant imagery.The writing of this movie is disjointed, and unlike a great Seinfeld episode, or Pulp Fiction, it is not magically tied together at the end. The writers leave this very difficult step for the viewer. I challenge anyone who claims that they make sense of the film to justify why each scene is relevant. I'd be happy if they could justify half. I can think of a bunch of scenes that were just plain gratuitous, and should have been left on the cutting room floor, for example: the scenes with John Travolta. Were these kept in the film just because they were the only scenes with the red-hot Travolta? I actually don't think so; their presence was consistent with the generous editing of the whole film.I'd say save your $8 and rent the video, but I think it more important to say save your 170 minutes and skip this film.</fullReview>

The use of so many stars was sickening, worse yet I do not even know their characters names. The shots of the animals, natives, the sky, crazy American soldiers, the sky, rain, crazy Japanese soldiers, the sky, more animals, the sky, and more crazy people is enough to drive anyone crazy. The excessive introspective utterings from the soldiers you don't even know or care about are unbearable.

		<fullReview>Anyone who hopes to find, in the words of Fox executives, the "most anticipated movie of the year" will be sorely disappointed with The Thin Red Line. In its almost three hour running time, so little unfolds onscreen that it's hard to believe Malick even needed a script at all to shoot this overblown opus. While audiences can appreciate the wonderful visuals Malick provides in abundance, the metaphoric shots of trees, flowing grasses and jungle life soon become intrusive and obvious, snuffing out the already thin wisp of a story. Equally annoying are the many voice-overs in which the characters whine about war and human nature. Yes, James Jones' novel is a different creature from Saving Private Ryan so it's not surprising that a film adaptation would also be very different. But instead of a unique perspective on World War II, The Thin Red Line leaves us with a pretty but ultimately empty exercise in cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm still waiting for Jones' book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be made into a movie. This is not it. Other than pilfering a few character names, a few quotes, and the title, Malick's Thin Red Line is so far removed from Jones' novel as to almost be unrecognizable. Jones' flowing fictional narrative based on his Company's actions at Guadalcanal from disembarking the ship to embarkation is a brutally realistic portrayal of infantry life and the nuances of combat in the mountains of Guadalcanal. Malik retains none of this brilliance and ops for art house melodrama on some fantasy island with no discernible resemblance to the actual local.Malik takes the character of Witt, a secondary character in the novel, who was a racist Kentuckian rabble rouser with a penchant for shirking duty when his superiors annoyed him, and portrays as some kind of Christ figure. He begins the film living in noble savage utopia among the peaceful Melanesian natives. In reality these natives used to ambush Japanese patrols and sell their corpses to the US Marines for candy. Solomon Island tribes have a long history of tribal warfare, but Malik would have use believe it is the touch of the industrialized world that has suddenly corrupted their virgin paradise.The next glaring departure from the novel I noticed was the character of Lt. Col Tall. In the novel he was a younger man, an overachiever to be sure, but a capable and brave commander. Malik decided to go with the old heartless commander routine. Malik concocts a scene were John Travolta plays a General who takes advantage of an aging Tall's desire to make rank at the expense of troops. In the film Tall is shown disinterested in artillery, declaring that it is used only to give the ground troops the perception that they are giving the enemy hell. In the novel Tall was a huge fan of artillery and blasted away at the mountain for hours before deploying the company. In addition, in the novel, the protagonists followed two other companies who had attempted to take the same hill the day before. Maybe it is in the five hour cut, but I doubt it, where Jones describes how the Japanese prominently displayed the heads of dead American, on pikes, with their severed genitalia shoved in their mouths as a warning to the soldiers that followed. I guess that wouldn't fit the narrative.I go on for much longer, but my point is made. The movie is not a cinematic depiction of Jones' novel, it doesn't accurately depict infantry life, or life on Guadalcanal, and it gives us no insight into the Battle. That's what makes it pretentious, and that's what makes it a bad movie. It is ultimately preaching to the choir. Those who like this kind of movie, and who agree with the narrative, will gush about it. To me it was uncompelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I originally thought, but I still don't see it as a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first Malick film I ever saw, back in the theater in early 1999. I didn't think much of it, but I liked it enough to check out his other two films, and liked them both a lot. And his subsequent two films have been fantastic. So I assumed I was probably wrong about this one. Well, I did like it more the second time around. Unfortunately, I still don't think it's a great film, and I probably agree with my assessment that this is his least good work. It is a very beautiful film, but, really, what exactly is it saying that is that much different from what any other WWII movie was saying, including its chief rival, Saving Private Ryan (which I also reassessed as a little better than I had originally thought about seven or eight months ago)? It's pretty much comprised of scenes of soldiers ducking in the grass, quivering, throwing a grenade, getting picked off, yada yada yada. In the end, I don't find it especially profound, as gripping as it no doubt is at times (almost the entire first hour of the film depicts the taking of one hill, and it's every bit as nerve-wracking as the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan). Acting honors belong to Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson and Sean Penn. Acting dishonors belong solely to Jim Caviezel, whom I still hate. What a damn bore that guy is, and his subsequent role as Jesus makes several of his scenes unintentionally humorous. The appearances of John Cusack, John Travolta and George Clooney are distracting, even if none of them are particularly bad in their roles. So, the big question: SPR or TRL? I'd actually go with SPR. Sure, the bookend sequences are absolutely awful and insulting, but Spielberg does construct a handful of sequences which are the very definition of taut, gripping cinema (obviously the D-Day sequence, but also the sniper sequence where Vin Diesel bites it and Jeremy Davies' big sequence at the end, among a few others). As for the Academy Awards, I think, despite the fact that they were bought off, Shakespeare in Love deserved the big award. Although, who knows, perhaps that would suck on re-watch (haven't seen it for over a decade, either, though I've seen it at least once since I saw it in the theater). Perhaps I should give it another go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been said that war consists of long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. This movie seems to want to recreate that by giving the viewer long periods of sheer boredom (unending internal monologues by the actors, long, artsy shots of landscapes, flying birds, a sprouting coconut on an empty beach, flashbacks and what appear to be flash-sidewayses of a Marine's wife being unfaithful back at home while he is mumbling on and on about how much he loves her) punctuated by moments of excitement and big explosions. I think there were more Japanese captured in this movie than there were in the first two years of the war in the Pacific, and long scenes of Japanese prisoners and battle-weary Marines all shivering and shaking together and trying not to cry after a fight was pretty damned unrealistic, given the historical record of that war.If I watch a war movie, I want to see battles, fights, desperate struggles and acts of heroism. I don't want to see what looks like a very special episode of Oprah proceeding at a pace that makes a snail look speedy. There were a few good moments in the movie, but the accumulated weight of all the sleep-inducing scenes smothered them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thin Red Line 10/10The Thin Red Line is a movie that does not project but closes inward. It moves smoothly and doesn't rush violence to titillate the senses. Moving with visuals and narration that call for interpretation and the union of emotion and thought it paves with an uncanny sense of a baffling view of war. I respected it's depiction of both Japanese and American soldiers as equals fighting an exhaustible war. Both sides reluctantly killing each other in contrast to many scenes shown in Vietnam movies where napalm is dropped enthusiastically by embittered troops. James Caviezel throughout the film in his voice overs question the reason of war and the loss of innocence. I have heard nothing as captivating as how he delivers these questions as the shots linger over nature and flashbacks for you.'Maybe all men got one big soul everybody's a part of, all faces are the same man.'After all Caviezel's character name is Private Witt if that doesn't suggest anything. He although has never lost his own innocence and with this he is utterly lost throughout the journey. A 'Linus' so to speak among so many instruments of death. Flashbacks of home are the only thing that proceed to fuel the soldier's in going forward. Sean Penn's character Sgt. Welsh contrasts that of Caviezel's character Private Witt as Satan to a Prophet. Welsh has lost his hope maybe even cast out of heaven just to have tea with a prophet more hopeful and infinitely wiser than he will ever be. On top of that Penn has a father like presence and role to Witt. Which is double irony. To add even further the shots of the scenery are beautiful in such a violent attempt to gain control over a single hill. Furthermore no one is portrayed as the winner in this film just more dead added to the landscape.The silence of shots comes through as the director's security in knowing there can be multiple view, interpretations, thoughts and reflections. It does not have heroes only two sides unwillingly killing each other without real thought. Unlike a MTV music video the shots are continuous without fast cuts and mean what they show. According to one director 'Every edit is a lie.'. Here there really isn't a need to do that or have quick cuts. It makes you look at what is on screen without remorse. It is provocative yet never surrenders to conventional war clichs and hammed patriotism in Saving Private Ryan. It is a death and journey through hell, purgatory and perhaps heaven like Jacob's Ladder."Is this darkness in you too? Have you passed through this night?""This great evil, where's it come from? How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who is doing this?"10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is without a doubt the best war movie of all time, and easily ranks in the top ten of all motion pictures. What is really unique, apart from the gorgeous cinematography that links man to an all-pervasive nature in his most desperate moments, is the fact that this movie develops and carries the actual thoughts, not just the words, of its soldiers at all times. As a Vietnam veteran, I could recognize many of the scenes in this film from my own memories (and nightmares!). It is real war, real people, and an extraordinary work of art.The casting for this film was superb in all respects, including a remarkable performance by Nick Nolte that should have won best supporting actor, hands down. You need to appreciate the biological detail and accuracy in this film- for example it included eclectics parrots that are only found in Melanesia. By contrast, the more recent film Master and Commander depicts the capture and release of tree-dwelling South American green (common) iguanas on the Galapagos Islands, instead of the actual species that are found there- a very disappointing lack of attention to detail that destroys the credibility of the film for the many people who are familiar with green iguanas.This film came up against Elizabeth, Shakespeare in Love, and Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture in what was probably the best lot of films ever nominated for an Academy Award. By contrast, Saving Private Ryan is more of a typical war film with an American bias, with a focus on action. The Thin Red Line has none of this- it is really a nature and psychology film, and a very, very deep one that even succeeded at depicting some of the mystical and insane experience, the real mental experience, that accompanies warfare.Fortunately, with DVDs, we can now study films of this kind and get more out of them with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very untruthful. Untruthful in many, many ways, the billing given to the major stars, that only appeared for two or three minutes in the film, the depiction of the after action scenes that showed the victors unnaturally intertwined with the vanquished, the disjointed voice-overs, and the many false characterization of men in combat. The film tried depict war in all its gore and insanity and thus morph into an anti-war movie, but at the same time show the details of war as an impressionist painting of the lowest order. It failed in all its attempts.A great disappointment for a film having so many accomplished actors who have contributed much to this genre in past performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 105 minutes I stopped to watch it because my wife didnt like it or she likes not every war movie such this one. TRL is a mix of psycho, action, terror and war. What I didnt like was that I waited 45 minutes until the first action scene came. Then it was disturbing how long the story takes to show you how to combat a japanese bunker. The role of the nonstop crying Nick Nolte was disturbing because he was too loud. John Travolta was ridiculous and not credible enough. I have nothing against him because I like him very much in other movies.The best actor for me was Jim Caviezel. I wont be surprised if he wins one time an Oscar. The action scenes were well executed. The story is slow paced, too long and very predictable. I enjoyed therefore the nice picture. The characters were well developed but what helps this if the other missing elements doesnt contribute to an interesting war movie. For me it doesnt deserve more than 5/10. I have my respect to all war veterans. Instead I highly recommend the top-mini-series "BAND OF BROTHERS".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst War Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers* The Thin Red Line has to be one of the worst excuses for a war movie ever. This movie lost me right from the beginning and on to the end. The story didn't seem to make sense. It was all about cheesy action sequences andwasting talents of a great cast of actors. I will give this film credit for it's sound effects I thought they were good but that didn't make it a good movie. It seemed all during this movie that more Americans were being killed or wounded thenwere put ashore in the beginning. I thought the cinematography in the film was good and that was the only thing good about it really. I would avoid this one if I were you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, yes... but also harrowing and unusual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrence Mallick's unconventional war film is at times almost too harrowing to watch - rarely can a film have more accurately depicted war as a mechanism for taking live people and making dead ones. Mallick's use of music, imagery and voice-overs is hardly subtle, but the overall effect is highly unusual, eschewing conventional narrative to concentrate instead on some very un-Hollywood concerns - the futility of individual valour, and the impossibility of even defining what makes a good man in situations such as these. Well worth watching for all of us fortunate enough never to have been asked to fight for our countries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film by which I judge ALL others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all my life, I have never sat in a cinema and seen so many people leave before the end of the film. The only reason I stayed is because the friends I was with looked interested in it and they thought the same of me. Had we actually spoken we all would have left with the rest of the discerning customers.At the end of this most unpleasant marathon, the entire audience breathed out a huge sigh and one guy behind summed it all up about how glad we were that it was finally over with the wise words "Praise Jesus!"This is the most pompous misleading pile of rubbish I have ever had the misfortune to see in my entire life. Practically an art house movie, the only decent character, played by Woody Harelson, dies early on leaving us with nothing but bad poetry and no real plot.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy any film that stirs emotions and gets you thinking but the only thing I was thinking with this was 'please finish'.One tiny plus point is that there is one scene that more than any other goes further to capture the absolute terror of the troops as their leader has a conversation with the general about whether or not he should send them all to certain death.This however lasts about two or three minutes and really isn't worth the effort of watching the rest of this self-indulgent drivel.I thank this film for one thing - I now judge all films by what I call the Thin Red Line (TRL) factor. How many times would I rather watch the film I have just seen than watch the Thin Red Line even once.For example - Leon: The Professional scores around a 10. I would rather watch Leon 10 times back to back than watch the TRL once.No film I have ever seen since (or before for that matter) has ever scored lower than a 2. Even Rambo 3.Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much negativity towards this beautiful film that it makes me cringe. Released shortly after Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan," many people seemed to think that THE THIN RED LINE was a "ripoff" of the former. Yeah, that's something I really heard someone tell me. A ripoff. Even though the two were in production at the same time and dealt with totally different topics (the only similarities being that they both were about soldiers in World War II), people called The Thin Red Line a ripoff. Unbelievable.And if it really is a ripoff (which it isn't... I still laugh thinking about referring to it as that), what an incredible ripoff... I must say.The people who didn't like this movie didn't like it because it was ingenious. It is based on an ingenious novel of the same title by James Jones (which I have read, it's fantastic), and of course it can't compare to the book, because few movies can. People have blasted Terrence Malick on his adaptation, and while I admit many parts are different than the book, many parts that should have been included were left out, and some were poorly recreated, the film on a whole is brilliant.The World War II generation was not afraid to fight, is what I've read. But the World War II generation is not every single man... of course there were those who were afraid, those who didn't want to fight. No matter how small a percentage these kinds of men were (and I'm sure that what I've read doesn't lie, I'm sure it really was a small percentage) they did exist. And this film shows it. There is Private Witt, who goes AWOL in order to avoid fighting. There is Corporal Fife, who's so scared he can't even stand still. There's Private Doll, who's eager to kill a "Jap" but when he finally does begins to regret killing a human being. There's Private Bead, the young guy, whose death is one of the most emotional in the entire film. There's Captain Staros (Stein in the book... I still can't figure out why they changed that for the movie) who has become so close to his men that he is afraid to follow any order that might get too many of them killed.But then of course there's those characters who remind us of what the other kinds of men were like. There is Sergeant Welsh, who knows he's got a job to do and does it without hesitation. There's Lieutenant Colonel Fife, who orders something and expects it to be followed no matter what. There's Captain Gaff, eager to fight but also concerned about the health of his men. There's Sergeant Storm, who stands in the middle of a field at night screaming, "Why don't you shoot me? Come and get me!"So many different characters, and while a lot of people think the voiceovers were lame and corny, I actually think they blended those characters together very nicely. The battle scenes were well-paced and althought the movie was slow at some points, I never found it to be boring. It was disappointing how George Clooney and John Travolta were advertised as main stars and each was in it for about thirty seconds.I love this film. And the book.THE THIN RED LINE - 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe one of the most beautiful and deeply philosophical war movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Thin Red Line" is a philosophical look at the horrors of war. It revolves around the men of Charlie Company who are assaulting the island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific. Although it could be argued that the title "The Thin Red Line" refers to the front line of war, I find it easier to believe that it refers to the line between sanity and insanity, as Jim Caviezel (Pvt. Witt) has pointed out in an interview.A quick overview of my opinions on this movie: I consider it to be in the Top 10 movies of all time, for my money at least. It is a deeply philosophical movie, depicting both the horrors of war and the beauty of life. It has the ability to mesmerize you with the splendor of nature, and in the same instant disgust you with the terrors of man. This movie gives you a deeply personal look inside the minds of the soldiers and we feel as one with them as we walk the thin red line. I hope to attempt to analyze all aspects of the movie that I can in a relatively short piece.Lets start by meeting some of the main characters of Charlie Company. We have Pvt. Witt, Sgt. Welsh, Cpt. Staros, Pvt. Bell, Pvt. Doll, and Col. Tall. These are just some of the men we meet in the movie, but I am focusing on them because we get a deep look inside their experience with Guadalcanal.Each man seems to have his own way to escape the war: Pvt. Witt literally escapes to a Melanesian Island when he goes AWOL, and finds the love of family and the serenity of true peace there. Pvt. Bell escapes with the memory of his wife, with her love. Cpt. Staros escapes the horrors of the war through his love for his men, which he considers to be his sons. Pvt. Doll, who seems to almost be our narrator, escapes into his own mind, as he poetically looks at the good and evil of the war and tries to resolve it deep inside himself. Col. Tall escapes by focusing on his career and all that his family and his men have sacrificed at his orders.The audio and the visual aspects of this movie are absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant and sharp, the music soft and melodic. During the battles the skies are bright blues, the grass is green, the sun seems to melt across the landscape like a warm wave. However, the soldiers, their gear, and everything unnatural and part of the war is in muted browns and blacks, no color their. Almost as if these monochromatic men were nothing more than chess pieces, and they obviously do not belong on this beautiful board. We also noticed that the Japanese soldiers, too, have no color to them. They appear almost no differently than the American soldiers.The musical soundtrack to this movie reflects this as well. It is almost as if the music is the exact opposite of the scene: during a tense, horrific battle we hear the soft, beautiful melodies of strings serenading us in the background. The beautiful music carries a lilting, mournful tone, as if to both decry and mourn the horror that is going on around it. The stark contrast between the beauty of the music and scenery and the ugliness of the war leave us feeling even more disjointed and askew with reality.As we proceed through the film, we are put in the position of an anonymous soldier who is along with the rest of the men. The camera tracks low on the grass as we crawl, jumps erratically as we run, and pauses to look at the sunlight filtering through the canopy in a rare, unguarded moment of beauty. We feel one with the men and are treated to a rare look at their deepest, darkest and innermost thoughts.As they wrestle with the philosophical and moral issues of what they are doing, we hear it all. We are there when they realize with horror that they are no different than the men they kill. We are there when they come to the understanding that with a roll of the dice it could have been them dead on the ground or beginning for mercy. We learn through their eyes that there are no winners in the war, that everyone is a victim.As each of the men try to escape these horrors in their own way, we see that all of the escapes revolve around love: for Staros, it is the love of his men. For Witt it is the love of that other world he once saw. For Bell, the love of his wife. For Welsh, though, it is the love of the hope that Witt carries within him. Welsh himself has been too jaded with the war to feel the same things that Witt feels, so instead he escapes vicariously through Witt, a man he almost treats as a brother.In the end, however, we learn that the war takes all of their escapes: Witt's Melanesian family turn on him in fear, Bell's wife leaves him for an Airman. Staros is relieved of his command; Tall sacrifices the love and trust of his men for his career. Doll never seems able to resolve his moral argument going on deep inside him. And Welsh loses his escape when Witt lost his.In the end, Welsh realizes that to survive the war each man must find something that is his own and hold on to it. This may be the closest thing to an epiphany that this movie has. We learn through him that the thin red line between sanity and insanity is razor-sharp, and it may be impossible to walk it in war without falling off.As the survivors of Charlie Company leave Guadalcanal they are treated once more to a view of its beauty. It's as if everything they saw had been nothing more than a terrible dream to be forgotten and swallowed up in the beauty of nature around them. But each man also leaves with something buried inside them that only they and we privileged few will ever understand."The Thin Red Line" is a beautiful and deeply philosophical movie that pulls you in and leaves you feeling lost at the end. If you are lucky, you come out with a small understanding of the true cost of war. I highly recommend that you watch it many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best war film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right then let me first start by saying, all of those people who think that Saving Private Ryan is the best war film of recent years should either a)take another look at this or b)stop following the hype. The reason that Saving Private Ryan is rated higher than the Thin Red Line was that it was released earlier. However for pure brilliance nothing can touch the Thin Red Line. The cinematography is some of the best ever and the story line is impeccable. Looking at the trials of a few men in a platoon and seeing how they get through the horrors of war, as the tag line says 'every man fights his own war'.Also unlike Saving Private Ryan the Thin Red Line does not need to rely on the shock factor (e.g. people getting bullits through the head in all its bloody detail). I'm not saying that Saving Private Ryan doesn't have a moral to it (war isn't fun) but it goes a little over the top at some stages. The Thin Red Line has the gore but uses it to maximum effect, and only when absolutely necessary. Finally one other point to make is the acting, for a non starring cast in the lead roles I don't think I have seen much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to Watch - may contain spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>warning *** may contain spoiler - A true work of anti-art this one is. Never have I seen a war movie depicted with such callous disregard for reality. It's almost as if an overlay of 1990's contemporary philosophy is misplaced over the characters fighting in ww2 pacific theatre. At several points we have a comment that this war is 'nothing but a war over dirt(or property)' and we get the impression that this is a common view of the day. After Pearl Harbor, it would be a hard sell to believe that people thought anything like this during the war. And then there is the main character with this psychopathic half smile everytime someone dies as if its a happy moment. Or take the care free soldiers taking time to appreciate nature while in the midst of mortal combat. I would challenge the director to sit with some veterans from Tarawa and get THEIR opinions on this film. Definitely hard movie to watch, may take several sittings...its that terrible.</fullReview>

The film wasn't even one percent as good as "Saving Private Ryan." THE THIN RED LINE had a horrible story line, an alright cast with an alright director, BUT A HORRIBLE FILM EDITOR. The first half of the film could have been taken out. Much like the classic, 2001:A Space Odyssey, Malick, like Kubrick, take their time and shoot these panoramic shots that mean nothing to the movie but add on an extra half hour or more. It's annoying! I know people want to be creative and make a masterpiece, but that's horrible. 1 out of 100 stars given!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Save The Thin Red Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizen Kane. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Apocalypse Now. Raging Bull.Add The Thin Red Line to that list of great genre-bending, bar-raising epics by true geniuses working at the top of their games. And then add this: Each of these films was misunderstood and abused by the critical establishment and the awards givers on their release. And years later all of these films were anointed by group after group and individual after individual who tried to pretend that they were always on the right side of the argument. If this happens to The Thin Red Line, it would be a tragedy.The Thin Red Line is not for everyone. No truly great film is. But Terrence Malick, like Scorsese, Coppola (when not working for hire), Kubrick and Welles, is working on another level. This is not the pretentious work of a filmmaker trying to be an "artist," straining our patience with effort to play the genius. This is a meditation on God and man and the best and worst of what we are. The Thin Red Line the most intimate film about war ever made.You can argue that it's "not my kind of film." You can argue that "there's not enough action for me." You can argue that you prefer Saving Private Ryan. But if you know anything about film, if you are really paying attention to this movie, if you aren't lost in the fog of the 200 other films that you saw this year, you have to know that Malick deserves your absolute respect, if not your undying admiration.The reason that am writing about this is that the L.A. film critics have made it clear that they will be more than happy to bury this film. A film which they didn't see in it's final form because of the rush to get the film into screenings for critics awards. Now it is suffering not only negative local buzz, but vicious buzz. "Malick's never seen a leaf he didn't like." "It's the Heaven's Gate of the '90s." "It's Saving Private Ryan on acid."When I saw the film, I was anxiously awaiting an over-inflated, way-too-long, troubled movie. What I saw was a film that improved with every frame. With every metaphor. And my rage began. I went to a second screening just to make sure that I wasn't somehow way off-base here. I wasn't. The film only got better.To what depths has criticism fallen when the reaction to this film is to unsheath the knives and to prepare to kill this truly original work of art before it's even completely finished, much less released? (And, of course, these are the same people who are always going on about a lack of originality in studio films.) Have we all become so coarse that we rather slam something than embrace it?The future of The Thin Red Line is now in the hands of a few select critics who get national attention. Maybe if a Spielberg and a Scorsese and other filmmakers stand up for Malick, they can help this movie turn the corner. (It would be a supremely selfless choice for Spielberg.) In the end, it won't be enough if "opinion makers" are embarrassed when the tide does turn on this film. And it will. There are few films worth opening your heart to in any given year. Few films that aspire to reach for more than a couple of hours of entertainment. The Thin Red Line is one of those films. Don't let "them" take it away from you before you've even decided whether it was worth the trip.</fullReview>

There is not even a discernible plot line to follow. Just one of the worst wastes of time ever. I heard that the director shot about 8 hours of movie and when he couldn't put it out the way he wanted he just cut it randomly down to the still ridiculously long opus of garbage that it is. I hope this is true and he really was capable of putting a coherent film together. This just wasn't.</fullReview>

OH GOD please forgive them all, they do not know what they are saying. Not because you're not like the others then you must be Wonderful ! NO.. Sometimes -like this time- You are only different.Mr. Malick thought that he was making a great anti-war film about repression, torture, and doom of the human being killed by the very hands of the human or himself.. Yes, yes, we got it.. But you know what?.. We got it very well done at other movies.. which does not have any allegation.. any false greatness, and I want to say something.. No.. Screaming my head off TO ALL THE FILMMAKERS.. If you want to make a great work and want it to be immortal so please HAVE THE AUDIENCE first .., not to be that high in the sky, dawn to earth a little .. Because if you became that high, making no enjoyable work in the same time.. Well then .. Nobody will care.. Nobody will bother to understand what in the world you're saying !!! I know, you must to be different and make whatever you want as a writer and director especially when you planned to make something not like any of the usual war films.. But an anti-propaganda kind of work. Yet it turned out to be a film which's too boring to fallow, too scrappy to present a DRAMA could affect you or lead your emotion, therefore you'll have here a rare case : in more than 1000 comments you'll never find the warning "This comment may contain spoilers" at all (just ask yourself why ?!). Further than that when you have all of those stars to do little things or to do nothing at all (Remember George Clooney !!) then surely your viewer will feel disappointed and deceived. Actually the trauma is bigger when you know how this movie was the only creation of its director after 20 years of isolation, so he came back to explain the human behavior by concepts which are so close to Manichean.. But anyway.. Who am I to tell MR. Malick or any other artist what to make ?! I'm just the poor man.. The humble viewer who watch this and tell that it's a real pure absolute CRAP.. Which has been nominated for 7 Oscars to get nothing and it's one of a very very few times I find myself shouting (Long Live The Academy !!)At last I have 2 flaming questions.. What is the meaning of "The Thin Red Line" anyway ?! Because our dear FILM didn't give us any guide or what so ever to understand the title !, and just why is that EXACTLY ? That's my second flaming question ?!</fullReview>

The actions of the Japanese soldiers that was meant to make the American soldiers appear to be heartless and cruel is actually incredibly insulting to the Japanese who often fought to the last man and NEVER groveled or begged for mercy. This movie was made by people who hate the military and is an open attempt to degrade the young men who defend our country. The contempt of the makers for the soldiers is apparent throughout the film.

It's just so overwrought and tries to hammer its points of war is bad, the beauty within, and every other obvious pop psychology theme of the last half century.Caviezel is excellent and gives his usual and unique from another world performance as does Penn. Nolte however must have been taking the drug he was linked with during a DUI arrest for longer than we knew. His performance is simply terrible. Granted his roll was written by people who obviously see the military as a collection of every cliche and neurotic type possible. Your typical Hollywood writer knows few people outside those in his various therapy session groups. Who in Hollywood is sane?The people in this production have read way too much Mailer and have seen Apocalypse Now too often. Perhaps doing so under the influence of the above mentioned Peyote. </fullReview>

But this movie is just SO AWFUL that it was actually refreshing to see one of its stars receive a terrible beating. That's how badly The Thin Red Line has jaded me.Remember, if you see this movie, you may never recover. Don't be like me. Save yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confused exercise in pointlessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a mess! This film was the directorial reemergence of hermit-like director Terrence Malick after a twenty-year absence. A darling of film buffs, Malick had dropped out of sight after 1978's DAYS OF HEAVEN. The critical community awaited THIN RED LINE with childlike eagerness, ready to gush over any pearls that Malick was willing to cast before the viewing public. It was this hero worship that motivated most of the reviews that praised THIN RED LINE as a work of beauty and introspective genius. These reviews were exercise in not pointing out the emperor had no clothes. While film critics described LINE as a "tone poem" or a "philosophical exploration into the nature of man" few described it as a good (or even comprehensible) movie.This is not to say LINE is very deep. Most of Malick's observations (war is bad, men are brothers, Cain slew Able) have been made before and better in other films. THIN RED LINE is a self absorbed exercise in failed editing, the vanity piece of a small budget director allowed to go mad with a major studio's money.What appears on screen is a jumbled mix of footage from a National Geographic nature special and a preachy and poorly directed anti-war screed. Lush nature scenes are followed by incoherent bits of method acting and disconnected plot. Malick had some of the finest young actors of the period to work with, but won't let them act. Few have much time on screen, and much of their dialogue is drowned out by intrusive voice-over telling us what the actors are thinking. He fails to remember that the point of drama is to have the actors ACT and allow us to figure out what they are thinking. There is no character development and no discernable plot thread. Added to this is the bizarre casting of a pudgy and longhaired John Travolta as a General (!?) and an over-the-top Nick Nolte as a deranged and glory hungry Colonel to make a confused stew that only the pretentious or hopelessly Malick smitten could love.The only watchable segment is a combat scene where John Cusack (playing an Army Captain) leads an assault on a Japanese bunker complex, a sequence that stands up to any in film history. Seeing the quality of that scene actually makes one a little sad, to think of the film that Malick could have made with more focus and self-control. If he could do such a fine job there, what a shame that he wasted so much talent (his and the actors) and time (his and the film viewing public) on what is essentially a college film project made with a 50 million dollar budget.For a better picture of the harshness of war close-up read James Jones' original novel THE THIN RED LINE upon which this film and a 1964 predecessor were based.</fullReview>

The war would have never been won if every soldier was as they were portrayed in this film. Guadalcanal was a terrible, filthy, disease ridden hellhole, and every inch taken was at a very high cost to our men. Our men suffered and died and this island was just the start of many more to come in the campaign in the Pacific. This film treats both sides as moral equals. Did someone forget that we were attacked, and the Japanese had already conquered most of China and the Philippines and Southeast Asia. I just want to end by telling all you art nouveau types to let history be told by those who were there. If you want to find out about Guadalcanal, read about the history of the United States Marine Corp.</fullReview>

Two stand out. First, the voice-over that seems to drone on and on, not moving the story, just talking in the background. The second is the ethereal Zen-ness to the story itself to the point of losing this viewer behind. What was this a story about? I was actually rooting that Malik would show up Spielberg in the WWII movie race, but as it turned out, it was Saving Private Ryan that told a gripping story AND imparted deep moral lessons.

		<shortDescription>absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I heard about this movie was that, originally, it DID have a story, but the director decided he didn't want Nick Nolte to be the focal character, so he just chopped it up and put it in random order. I think that fact pretty much sums up this movie. It is incredibly self-indulgent; the narrative is horribly fractured but totally pointless flashbacks which aren't even original in their overt art-house techniques and subject matter (long, slow shots of lace curtains waving in the breeze). This "philosophical" movie bludgeons the viewer over the head with its point. There is absolutely no subtley or depth, and somehow all those ruminating voiceovers ("why does nature war against itself") don't really convince me of their profundity. The characters, except for maybe the faces everybody knows already, are indestinguishable from one another. I guess a possible justification for this is that it portrays war in all its confusion, or war makes everybody the same and renders individuality impossible or any of a number of thematic interpretations--but that's not a movie's job; form does not equal content. That's like saying a movie whose message is that , say, politics is boring has a right to be boring itself. Plus, the whole thing is way, way too long for a movie that functions by random images. As my friend said as the movie drew to a close, "Just end!" If you want a real war movie, watch something like The Deer Hunter (it's long too) or Full Metal Jacket.</fullReview>

Was Caviezel the guy on the island at the beginning? The only person I could recognize was Nolte and sometimes Sean Penn. Everyone else looked the same. The cameos only took away from the movie. The cinematography was wonderful and Sean Penn gave the best possible performance for what he had to work with. Unfortunately, nothing could redeem this film for me.

There are simply too many people and too many characters, and none of them get the proper treatment, just some stupid, airy voice overs and some "nature" scenes.Avoid this at all costs.

Somehow this movie even manages to to make a joke out of the time honored tradition of cameos as well....many big name characters join the movie and leave again without really having left an impression. Meanwhile the dirty business is left to a small group of lesser known (but certainly not lesser talented actors).All in all, it's a war movie that focuses on internal conflicts instead of the business at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There can be no argument that Malick can shoot beautiful nature scenes, but making a movie requires a few items in addition to great cinematography: script, plot, characterization, and for a war movie...opposing enemies might help. This film is probably the most boring I've seen in thirty-four years. When I realized the movie had finally ended I turned to my fiancee and said, "It will be better when we see the final cut." She said ,"That was the final cut." "Yikes." Before it goes national, Fox 2000 should consider changing the title to "The Thick Red Durge".The best thing I can say about this film is that it does have time value. In an era where most movies cost the consumer ten cents a minute, Malick's film is about five.A Thin Red Line ranks in my bottom ten list for 1998 along with The Big Letdownski, The Avengers and Lost in Space.</fullReview>

The storyline is non-existent - there is nothing worse than hitting the credits totally lost, baffled and unfulfilled. This is a shame with some really great actors in there, namely John Cusack &amp; Nick Stahl. It is nothing less than an attempt to take the war experience into the movie theatre gone completely wrong. A movie in this genre should horrify and sadden. It should send tingles up the spine, not the audience to sleep. If you want a real war film, not this psychological, depressing excuse, I suggest you try "The Anzacs" with Paul Hogan or "Gallipoli" with Mel Gibson. If a less Australia point-of-view is needed try the classics like "The Dambusters", or "Bridge over the River Kwai".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the strength of people telling me it was more than a movie ? it was poetry! - I decided to see this movie. What a horrible waste of time and money that decision turned out to be.After three hours of exquisite (and oddly annoying) boredom, of being pounded by the worst sort of melodramatic drivel, I went away confused, sleepy and wondering if I could get my money back. I suppose the gullible might be persuaded it was art, or poetry, or even good. There was a lot of noise and weird 'nobody-talks-like-that' prose, plenty of nature shots (more on that later), more than enough melodrama, and an almost constant stream of pathetic looking dead stuff. Nevertheless, this movie wasn't poetry, or art, or good ? rather it was three badly edited hours extracted at random from six hours of film. Just because something is disjointed, and has no true narrative, does not mean it is poetry. Sometimes if you don't 'get' something, its because there is nothing there to 'get'.What really bothers me is time that could have been used to develop a story and give depth to the characters was wasted on interminable scenes of frolicking villagers, close-ups of birds (mostly parrots), and face shots of earnest looking actors thinking 'Deep Thoughts'. Does anyone actually think a person in combat is thinking about man's inhumanity to man or frolicking villagers, rather than "I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, I'm scared, my feet are cold and I don't want to die"?I can say I was thinking about man's inhumanity to man by the end of this movie, and how I got suckered into wasting eight bucks. It's too bad really, because I'm sure there was a good movie buried in that six hours of film - butthis wasn't it.Stay home, clean the garage, watch an infomercial ? but don't bother with this movie.</fullReview>

Whats wrong with it? For a start I lost count of the number of times I confused Elias Coates, Adrian Broady, Ben Chaplin, John Cussak and Jim Ceveziel who with their dark complexion are virtually indistinguishable from one another in camouflage in a jungle some where in South East Asia. Then there are other characters such as Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson and George Clooney who may impromptu appearances and suddenly disappear without any explanation. Of course there is no main protagonists, just an ensemble of flashy actors who feel "privileged" to be in a Terrence Maick film. The director is even arrogant enough not to even state a location or a date, as if we the audience should some how be inspired to know. With a coherent plot lacking, just soldiers meandering through an endless jungle punctuated by sudden outbursts of battle, you would have thought that Ben Chaplin's narration would try and clarify events. Chaplin's drawl however is so monotonous that, without exaggeration, 90 percent of what he says is inaudible. The film has absolutely no redeeming feature which leaves you no choice but to leave the cinema or if you come accompanied to doze off quietly. A waste of three hours you will never get back in your life and ?7 which you can't ask for your money back. Avoid like the plague.</fullReview>

It encompasses everything to do with poor filmmaking; zero character development, endless spooling of self-indulgent scenery shots, dizzyingly bad dialogue, and absolutely no point. Terence Malick, once responsible for influential films like "Badlands", takes a trip to Guadalcanal but leaves behind the shooting script. The scene with John Travolta and Nick Nolte pacing wordlessly aboard the battleship may be the most painful scene ever shot on film, challenging any scene in any Pauly Shore movie. The critics' lavish praise for this film was a blatant case of The Emperor's New Clothes. I can't even think about this film anymore. Please stay away from this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically "The Thin Red Line" is Wim Wenders' movie "Wings of Desire" except we've got soldiers instead of angels (although Caviezel certainly qualifies as a Christ-figure), and cheesy philosophical vomica instead of Rilke's lyrical poetry. Yes, the movie has many "pretty" scenes, and perhaps it does indeed deserve to be nominated for best cinematography. But despite what might have been good intentions, Mallick deserves to be raked over hot coals for what he is forcing upon audiences. What seemed like hours into the overly long movie, I found myself wondering if the projectionist wasn't channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and the History Channel, while playing an oration of William Shatner's (I'm being serious). Juxtapositioning images of soldiers in the midst of battle and delicate ferns or dying baby birds, Mallick reminds me of an amateur film student, recklessly relying on obvious stereotypical "impact" shots and edits. If not for the decent performances of Nolte, Caviezel, Ben Chaplin and Koteas, I don't think I would have been able to sit through the entire movie. I wonder if people who loved this movie actually paid attention to the stultifying voice-overs, or whether it's just the impression that the movie is "deep" and "philosophical" and "different" that appeals to them. I'm sorry, but interesting camera shots and technique are never enough to make a movie great, or even worth watching in this case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was full of expectation when I entered the theater to watch this movie, but in the first 30 minutes of it, I started thinking that I have just made a terrible mistake. The Thin Red Line can be described as a movie where nothing happens. Its just two hours of war and cheap philosophy.. the plot is never clear, there is no actual story, and by the end of the movie, nothing changes... Its a movie where you never actually see the enemy, witch makes it even more boring. The editing is really awful too, the movie goes from a bloody battle to a birds nest, then, to somebodys wife who watches the sea, and to children swimming, back to battle again. I love movies and I have never walked away from any movie in my life, but this one, ALMOST make me go away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literally the worst movie I have ever seen: hyperbolic, trite, offensively quasi-poetic, trite, as subtle in its imagery as a Real World courtship, and most of all, trite. The only film I have ever walked out on, and I wasn't the only one. This is a film with so little respect for its audience that it literally seeks to tyrannize it with forced imagery and banal dialogue. This defines "fake deep."Sure, some of the shots are beautiful, but they are usually so manipulative as to be off-putting. The only truth about war you will learn from this film is that you haven't known horror unless you have lived it, and you will live horror by watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>execrable waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire time I was watching this movie it always felt like I was watching a Hollywood movie maker's idea of what war is like, someone who had done no research or background reading. Always. I never once felt like I had any insight to what it was really like for the people there. Extremely heavy handed.The characters were all over-acted. Nolte acted like someone's idea of what Patton was like. I've read a fair amount of WW II books and the there may have been generals back at HQ that were like Nolte's character but the officers in the field were not. The characters were either terrified and peeing their pants, nuts, or quiet with dignified bravery.The fighting tactics were completely idiotic and unbelievable; the kind of twaddle I'd expect from a grade C script writer for TV. The soldiers were always just standing up or crouching so that they were visible to the enemy and walking into gunfire. I guess it's more important for us to see lots of soldiers get shot rather than they might have some brains and act in ways to increase the odds of achieving their objective.This would have been a reasonable movie for a first time writer/director for the Lifetime cable channel but not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know that you've wasted your money watching a dramatic war movie when you feel no remorse or sadness for any of its characters.My wife and I went to see The Thin Red Line. She fell asleep in the first 20 minutes. How the hell can you fall asleep during a war movie?I never felt close to any of the characters. I even laughed at one soldier's situation with his wife.It was certainly a waste of $14 that I could have saved for another viewing of "Saving Private Ryan."Whatever you do... wait for video on this so you can fastforward through all of the senseless garble and flashbacks that are used for effect in this movie. That way you don't waste your life away (believe me... it was only three hours, but I was sure it lasted a lifetime!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. No storyline, no characters;2. Mumbled narrative, only trying to "talk things out";3. No connection between the scenes, no emphasis;4. Taking shots from the third-party's point of view while using "someone"'s narration, which goes no where;5. Too unrealistic about war. One won't try to take out a bunker in broad daylight. The enemy will not surround one and talk a lot before shoot just because he is a main character. The "slow motion" definitely weaks the point, if there is one;6. Too much redundancy in the talk. "I know what you are talking, can't you just show me something, bring me the feeling?!";7. Anyone with good equipment in such place can make very beautiful screen shots, but the filmmaker obviously lacks the courage to cut some out;8. For an epic film, "Dances with Wolves" is much better;9. For a more philosophical movie, go to see "pi", which is far better, although it only cost $6000;10. New explanation of the theory of relativity: When watching 'Saving Private Ryan', three hours is just like 3 minutes, while watching 'The Thin Red Line', three hours is like 3 days.</fullReview>

This could have been a really great film, it had great scenery, and an extroardinary cast, including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, John C. Reilly, and John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, and George Clooney in cameo appearences. All of the diologue was extremely choppy, and the film was too long for the little that had to be said.

		<shortDescription>The worst movie ever nominated for an Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the worst movie ever nominated for an Oscar. It is impossible to imagine that a more boring movie could ever be made. There is no plot, no tension, all the movie is is a confused mishmash of images drawn loosely around what could have been an interesting war movie. And it's not even original! Why did they bother with this collosal waste? That's an easy question - because of Saving Private Ryan. Near the beginning of the movie is the dramatic landing of the troops - to an uncontested beach. We're told the enemy is "thatway"... about 15 minutes into the (supposedly war) movie, we're told there are enemy troops up ahead! There might be a battle scene. 30 minutes. 45 minutes. 1 hour - no really, there are enemy troops on the island! The movie has no drama, no character building, no action, and no point. Supposedly, that IS the point - which may be great art, but is utterly worthless as entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was almost pure, unredeemed awfulness. There were some very pretty shots - someone definitely has a future with National Geographic. The rest was abysmal - incoherent, simple, and with an overpowering ability to cause boredom that was only matched by its sheer length. Its insights were shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive - how on earth could anyone have found this pablum deep? It was around as deep as "thought of the day" calendar. The only thing about it that is at all interesting is how on earth it received an Academy nomination! I realize the Oscars are fairly meaningless - Titanic cleaned up last year! - but still, the emperor has no clothes! I think Thin Red Line was just so awful that people thought there must be something very deep in the movie that they didn't understand, and were too afraid to admit that fact in public.To sum up - I kept hoping against hope through the movie that someone would shoot out the camera. In the alternative, I was rooting for everyone to die as fast as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretentous drivel. 3 hours of a mix of National Geographic with sureal "action" that is reminiscent of a perfume or jeans ad. Plot is non existent. Fortune Cookie quality Zen philosophy voice overs will irritate many viewers very much like Chinese water torture. A beautiful nature film documentory could be made from the footage shot; and if it was cut down to about one hour, I would watch it. I can see how if you have never contemplated basic philosophical thoughts before (or if you find lyrics in pop music as "deep"), that this movie could appeal to you. Besides Nick Noltes' role, it seems that the other actors are more like props than charactors (for some reason I found that disturbing). If you find plot, dialogue, focus and brevity as "musts" in a film, then don't see this trite piece of "stream of consciousness." Rivers of platitudes cascading over beautiful nature scenes do not a film make. I would hope that if I would make a movie only every 20 years or so that I could find focus and plot. This is surreal modern art goes to the movies for a mind numbing 3hrs - dreadful. "Apocalypse Now" achieved what this movie only muddles around about. The horror, the horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Movies of the Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an awful waste of time. Terrence Malick has created the most gargantuan piece of crap put on film in recent memory (Godzilla excepted). One of the most insulting things about this "film" is how it discounts the importance of it's profound subject. It seems to disgrace these soldiers actions in lieu of questioning war's nature with bad junior high poetry. I was surprised to see that this film even had a screenplay credit. As for the "symbolism" in the movie, anything can be made to mean anything. This film's supporters inject many types of meaning into the images, yet rarely do they agree. I don't believe that Malick intended for many of these images even to mean anything except that they are "pretty". I don't think he could explain their supposed meaning. He has allowed its supporters to make sense of it for him. This only goes to show how some people think that if it looks nice and makes little sense it has to be good. This film focuses on leaves and iguanas instead of any story that may be hidden in it's dense forest. Overlong, boring, and essentially accomplishing nothing, this film begins with a crocodile and ends with a coconut. As a serious student of film who prides himself on being knowledgeable of all aspects of films, this is probably the worst "serious" war movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressingly boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I understand why they titled this movie "The Thin Red Line." It's because there is a Thin Red Line between Boredom and Frustration.This film is long, boring, and offers nothing that comes close to entertainment. I watched this movie with seven other friends, and none of us had a single good thing to say about it. We all shared a common agreement that this is the worst film of 1999, 1998, and maybe even the decade of the 90s.How else can you describe a film that jumps around with little reason or explanation. There is no story here. It's just a hodge podge of various characters who have stray thoughts while we are shown cinematograpy that makes little sense. If I wanted to watch a documentary on the beautiful wildlife of the Southeast Asian Region I would have tuned in to the Discovery Channel. What does this have to do with a war movie?I went to see what was inconceivably billed as an Academy Award Winning Film based on The Battle of Guadal Canal. What I witnessed was a long, boring, and meaningless depiction of a confused war. Nick Nolte's character had no consistency, for example. One minute he's playing hard ball with one of his subordinates. The next minute, he's trying to butter him up with promises of purple hearts, silver stars, and other bribes. The story begins with a close up of an Alligator in a swamp. OK, that really has a lot to do with a war story, right?The early scenes are set somewhere in Southeast Asia where a couple of deserters are fraternizing with the natives. The next thing you know, they are back on a troop ship heading to the Guadal Canal. There's no transition here. One moment these guys are on the beach. The next minute, one of them is being lectured by Sgt. Sean Penn about the morals of being a good soldier. Did I miss something in between or was it just a bad edit?For the next 2 and a half hours the film concentrates on a group of Americans trying to advance in the dense jungle of Guadal Canal. Yet, when the movie finally comes to a merciful end, you ask yourself "What Happened?"There is no climax to the movie. This movie just goes on and on and on and on, then ends. No big ending. Rather, a cheap ending. The soldiers got to leave the war. That's it.What is this movie about? It's about 2 and a half hours too long. Don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensively awful in nearly every aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films I have ever seen, good or awful, this is the first I have ever walked out on (over two hours into the movie; don't think I didn't see enough). There was no facet of this movie that was not offensively bad. From the hideously slow pacing, to the ineffective cinematography and cheap effects, through the poorly written characters (don't try to tell them apart, because it shows through that even the writers couldn't), and especially the sophomoric political statement it tries to push on the audience--this was the worst movie I've ever suffered through.Expect to be flooded with Raising Arizona-like narration; flowery yet shallow, and delivered in a hick accent. Be prepared to see about 1.5 hours of mostly unrelated footage. Don't expect to remember any of the characters' names--they're not memorable enough to find a home in your head.And, to me, worst of all, be ready to sit through a movie whose core message is that war makes you evil; that war made our soldiers evil. The theme is repeated over and over (in hick voices), with unending "feely" scenes of watching soldiers looking at the destruction they've caused and wishing there were some flowers to pick instead. I am not right-wing or militaristic in any way, but I respect my country and the veterans who have defended it enough to abhor this film.If you feel an urge to see a war film, let me guide you happily to Saving Private Ryan (but go in with a settled stomach if you're easily disturbed!). But whatever you do, avoid "The Thin Red Line."</fullReview>

It tries to throw too much at the audience at once in terms of questioning human nature and the philosophy behind war i felt like i was in a church rather than a cinema, it had some great action scenes but alas these were cut short as the movie would wind of tediously into the soldiers thoughts and at times it felt like it was more of a documentary than a movie, close ups of animals and sun dazzled scenery made it seem like a discovery channel show.

		<shortDescription>Racist propaganda and historical fabrication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many pros and cons have already been detailed by other reviewers, what some see as poetry and philosophy others find pretentious. I can see the merit of both positions. However, the more serious and disturbing aspect of this film is the historical inaccuracy and the racial overtones. In The Thin Red Line, Japanese soldiers (apart from battle scenes) are depicted as children, sometimes naked children, wallowing helplessly. US soldiers and officers are variously depicted, but frequently given vicious and cruel character traits, and the more negative character traits are given to those characters that are played by those actors that appear to have the greater north European ancestry. Is it silly to note or comment on this slant? Imagine we were dealing with black soldiers, and that the darker ones would be portrayed in this way; enough said. The Japanese soldiers as portrayed in this film are largely unrecognizable as the ruthless warriors that history records. The scene where a whole platoon of Japanese soldiers is unable to bring themselves to kill an armed enemy soldier who refuses to surrender is patently absurd. Tie this into the racial overtones I have already described, and we are onto something very unsavory indeed. The film gets 5 for fairly interesting battle scenes, though they are few and far between.</fullReview>

BUT, the creators of this movie committed a fatal error...the very error that is committed at least once every year in some movie. That error is the mistake of focusing the movie on symbolism rather than focusing it on plot or substance.It's too bad, as this movie contain exceptional cinematography, and a whole slew of capable actors. But too many scenes of someone looking at a bird flying overhead and other "movie cliches" make this movie seem a little longer than it really is. Again, it's really too bad. A little less on symbolism and a little more focus on an actual storyline (which this movie doesn't even have), i give this a 9 or 10. I gave it an 8, and that is only because the potential was there. But because in all honesty the movie begins to stumble onto a path already well-traveled by previous war flicks, it only really deserves a 7.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong-- I'm open minded to experimentation in cinema, but there are certain basic, time-tested rules for movies that you just don't break. Number one, have a plot. Number two, have some character development. No amount of beautiful cinematography, movie-star cameos, or deep philosophical ponderings can substitute for these two basic elements.

I enjoy philosophy, and I can even sit through a long movie (Long Day's Journey into Night) but this movie could have been so much more and wasn't. I haven't been so angry and incensed about a movie in my lifetime. Perhaps that is what Malick was trying to achieve. I really think he could've made this movie beautiful, horrifying, profound and special ... if he just wasn't so into indulging himself. The actors themselves did what was asked of them, I'm sure, so the fault isn't with them. I've heard this was a great book and apparently the 1st version of the film w/Jack Warden was a success. So that pretty much leaves the script and the director. I wanted this to be good. I came into the theater with a sense of anticipation- who doesn't? Didn't everyone who bought a ticket want to be entertained? I personally think that Mr. Malick has made a movie that is neither about war or entertaining people- it's about him and I'm not interested!

		<fullReview>The brave men who fought and died to retake Guadalcanal and stop the Japanese advance in the South Pacific are dishonored by this mess of a movie that is more interested in inane voice-over psycho-babble than in a true depiction of their incredible sacrifice. It is all the more tragic because the battle scenes are among the best I have ever seen in a war movie. The camera snakes along through the underbrush at eye level to the soldiers,creating a terrifying realism as these men seek out a well hidden enemy. The movie begins nowhere,and,after the ridge is taken,goes nowhere. Guadalcanal was not a jungle paradise filled with multi-colored parrots and happy, dancing natives. Where are the malaria-carrying mosquitoes and the incessantly swarming bugs? The director is trying to spin some allegory about soldiers trampling an otherwise perfect Eden; he is not trying to present an accurate depiction of a monumental World War II struggle. Flash backs to better times in the States are repetitious and not informative; numerous cutaways to bits of jungle beauty are distracting. Both serve to further slow down a story that creeps along for an overlong three hours. With nothing further to say, the story meanders another needless forty-five minutes, then abruptly ends. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was painful to watch. It was by far the worse piece of doodoo to come from Hollywood ever. It's a 3 hour Calvin Klein movie. I expected Kate Moss to come out of the woodwork naked (even that would have been an improvement). When we went into the movie there were about a hundred people there - when we left there were only about 40 people remaining - all of us felt stupid for staying.About 2 1/2 half hours in to the movie I decided that if I really paid attention to what these people were saying I would really appreciate what this movie is all about... then came the line "(Whispering)People see a bird dying... (2 minute pause) some people feel its pain... (2 minute pause) other feel its glory." huh? what is that supposed to mean?! what glory?! What are you talking about?! and why does it take 4 minutes to say it? Another scene - 5 minutes fixated on a face half buried in dirt. Okay - symbolism - I understand that and appreciate good symbolism, but do we REALLY need to spend 5 minutes on it?! Okay people it's time to move on now... This movie is about 3 hours of this so called "poetry".This is not poetry. This is not art. This is garbage. This is rubbish. I would rather spend 3 hours in dental surgery than to see this film again.On the 10 scale I give it a fat 0 - I have never given a 0 before. There are NO Redemptive qualities of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're on the run from the law and need a place to hide for nearly 3 hours, I can see where you might choose to buy a ticket for The Thin Red Line. Otherwise, you'll just be angry at the whole Hollywood system for wasting your time and money. Never has a film made me so angry that I was still vehemently discussing how bad it was the next day! The film is so self-indulgent, with multiple shots of lace curtains blowing in slow motion not to mention countless frames of the sky as seen looking upward through leaves, that the only accurate term to use for it is celluloid masturbation. There are so many different shots of birds that I would swear the director simply placed a national geographic special in the middle of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone who came in late behind me echoed my sentiments when he asked me: "Is this Thin Red Line?". It starts off with a Robinson Crusoe-like abandoned island with two soldiers whom we find out 15 minutes later are AWOL. The whole Army is AWOL in this movie. I leaned to my companion and said: "They need to Kick it up a notch!".I cannot believe that I sat through the three hour marathon of an attempt to be artistic and masterful with cinematographic scenery and images. I hoped that it might get better but it never did. Unless you liked Ishtar, Home for the Holidays or Sharky's Machine then this movie plainly stunk!I am incredulously amazed at the inept reviewers who say that they "loved" this movie or that it even merited a viewing by any other member of the human race. Perhaps they are kow towing to the movie industry or are afraid of all the top name actors in their bit parts. These parts are flung together like a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle which do not fit together.Okay, there was one small part played by John Cusack that was meritorious as he and a handful of soldiers took the top of one hill. One good scene does not make a movie worth seeing!It was as nauseating to sit through as a scene where one soldier, with a handful of freshly pulled Japanese prisoners' gold teeth, tortures a Japanese general threatening with the same fate. Later on we see a scene with the same soldier languishing in anguish over what he has done but then the movie fades to another boring scene which was unremarkable. They never tell us what becomes or Mr. Teeth puller.Please do yourself and yor friends a favor and never see this movie, even on video tape. It is truly that bad!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know there is one main difference between Terrence Malick's version of ww2 and Spielberg's. The differnce is that Spielberg's was good and Malick's is the total opposite. Private Ryan was also entertaining as well as thought provoking while The thin red line just wanders aimlessly through a Thoreau defined world. I must say that any film that blatantly asks "what is love?" is in my book pretentious. The film also looks like a national geographic special on the animals of Guadalcanal except that National geographic specials are more fun to watch. The inclusion of all the different movie stars just turned the film into one big distraction with a "where's waldo?" effect with the audience going George Clooney's in this movie? Travolta? Cusack? look, it's Jared Leto! and did anybody else think this was just a big Calvin Klein commercial where everyone was whispering in overhead narrative. I could have sworn I heard Ben Chaplin whisper "Eternity, by Calvin Klein, available wherever immortality is sold". I have to admit I walked out of Private Ryan, but that is because the images were so hyperkinetic and induced such great feelings in me, i needed to breathe. I had to walk out of thin red line too but that's cause it sucked. Terence Malick I hear is a legend but I don't think he should have come out of retirement to stuff this pretentious piece of "art" down our throats (much like I was disappointed with Ronin by Frankenheimer. I don't know why I listened to all these film critics who put this thing on their top ten lists but I warn you not to see this film and if you do see it please tell me I am not the only one who sees it as a bad film. Oh there is one redeeming part of the movie. the part where the bird is crawling and slowly dying, I thought that image was very poignant, But at the same time I thought "what kind of sicko director would purposely injure a bird to make a movie????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And I wouldn't even say this film is "for fans of Malick only". I consider myself to be one of his fans, and still can't get anything out of The Thin Red Line. There are some interesting moments, but this exercise in existentialism just seems too out of place for a WWII setting. Trust me... everyone fighting in that war knew why they were fighting it, and they all knew the stakes. The Korean War or Vietnam would be better settings for the introspective wonder Malick tries to throw at us here.There are too many characters to spend time on here, but a few stand out in this whimsical account of the US invasion of Guadal Canal. Jim Caviezel as Private Witt seems to be the main focus of the "story". He is a dreamy soldier who apparently has a habit of going AWOL on his unit. We first see him living amongst a village of native Polynesians before being picked up by a patrol and brought back to the army. He is amazed at the lack of hostility he sees in these natives, even pointing out to the adults how even the kids there didn't seem to fight amongst themselves. By now, most casual movie fans are asking themselves, "when the hell are we going to get some war carnage? Spielberg didn't make us wait long at all in Saving Private Ryan!" Eventually we do get some battle action, but it isn't nearly as graphic or explosive as what many expect. Most of it focuses on following orders and whether or not an advancement against a well dug in enemy is worth the lives it will cost. During these scenes, we are treated to the film's best performance by Nick Nolte as an aging colonel desperate for a big win and a promotion to general. Nolte was still at the top of his game back then, and he chews the scenery to bits. He may even inspire you. This was before the flowered shirt mug shot debacle that his career has never recovered from.The film is pretty much stillborn whenever Nolte is off screen, though. Just too many cameos to keep track of, and some of them (Travolta) are downright embarrassing. How does an actor as good as Sean Penn become an afterthought? He had plenty of screen time, yet he never found his character. Malick's style never really lends itself to its characters, though. Nature is usually what stands out. Here the cinematography is fine, but how could it not have been? Few shots really stand out. The battle scenes are not blocked particularly well. This is common when you have a director not specializing in action. And to top it off, the movie is just dull. You won't care about these characters, and you won't really want to hear what they care about, either. All viewers, casual and serious, should be advised to avoid this film. Watch Days of Heaven instead! 4 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one starts sooo slow, and goes really nowhere... The most annoying thing about the whole movie is that you just don't care about any of the characters (at least I didn't) as the story just hops from one to another and back without you really getting to know the character. The other most annoying thing is the pretentious overwritten dialog, a lot of times it is spoken with such an slow overacted southern tone just to make you think the monologue is any good and deep (the 'narration' or what the character is thinking). The regular spoken dialogs between characters is also not that interesting.. And how about overacting of some actors who hoped to get an Oscar with it.. The movie runtime is about 170minutes, but most time is wasted on useless pan's and slow dialogs/monologues.. Also some scenes where so overly 'look at this' and really had nothing really to add to the story.If they had tightened the script, concentrated the amount of characters to follow it could have been one hell of a movie..The war-action is well done, but because of the slow pace of the rest it really makes you not care anymore or really excited..It's nothing like 'apocalypse now', 'saving private ryan', 'Full metal jacket' or any other kind of war-movie I have seen, it's just a 170 minutes long boring movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first got the movie in video format, I remember myself staring in astonishment the end credits.I was shocked!! Why?Just because I saw a movie of sublime quality I couldn't expect. I thought I was going to view a warlike film just like the others. I have to say that I don't underestimate this kind of movies; I consider myself a fan, but at that time I needed something different, something that was almost never been said before in this section, an alternative aspect and approach on the primeval destructive behavior of mankind.This film by Terrence Malick prepares the ground from the beginning. If you think you're going to face a total war movie then you have missed the point. "The Thin Red Line" is made in favor of emotions. It is an ode to peace, a "denudation" of warlike tactics, a total expression of human feelings of all kinds. From affection to disgust, from love to hate, from humbleness to arrogance, from heroism to the dread against duty, from keen action to catatonic acceptance of ghastly war reality.Only a look to the cast and you're sure for its grandeur. Check these names: Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, James Caviezel, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody HarrelsonElias Koteas, Jared Leto, Nick Nolte, etc...!! The performance? Equal to their fame as actors. "The Thin Red Line" bristles with lyrical, poetic structure, even though there's no ordinary plot. It bristles with amazing photography and wonderful dialog and monologues of Private Witt (James Caviezel).Even if you have a minor contact with cinema, see this movie. You can view it as internal quest...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard Terrence Malick had come out of a twenty-year sabbatical and made a new film, I was interested. After all, "Days of Heaven", was a decent movie that was well acted and filled with wonderful cinematography. I had also heard from someone that "The Thin Red Line" was poetry on screen-- an exquisite philosophical blend of the beauty of nature and the insanity of war. What I discovered for myself, after squirming in my seat for three hours on opening night, was cinematic masturbation with little respect to the subject matter of the story, and even less respect for coherent narrative. Somewhere buried within the layers of gratuitous shots of birds and swaying trees, non-stop pretentious voice-overs and ridiculous celebrity cameos, was a story worthy of telling. But sadly, this story never actually materializes and we are left with a dreadfully long, meandering LSD trip flashback, lacking any sort of truth or characterization. To its credit, "The Thin Red Line" has some beautiful nature photography, worthy of The Discovery Channel no doubt, and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer. But these things alone do not a good film make. After a two-decade vacation from filmmaking, Mr. Malick should have taken a refresher course in Story 101 before filling the screen with an unholy volume of philosophical mumbo-jumbo, and insulting the men who fought and died in the Pacific Conflict during World War II. I know there are many who swear this is a great film. I would say that they have been duped by Mr. Malick in the same way that he duped the studio into unloading so much money into this wandering hippie experimental piece disguised as a feature film.</fullReview>

Apocalypse Now did the "unreal" aspect of war well, Saving Private Ryan absolutely nailed the real experience of war, this movie is a confused meander between the two, it needs a new director and more time to in the cutting room.I wasnt terrified the way I was in the opening sequences of Saving Private Ryan, nor mesmerised as in Apocalypse Now by the absurdity of it all, just bored and irritated by this thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that just makes you sit back and think... about how much you'd rather be getting your teeth drilled than sitting through this. Terence Malick is easily the most overblown filmmaker ever, confusing "style" with endless shots of plants and animals in some vain effort to say some point about the horrors of war... blah.Unfortunately, I remember I paid the full amount to watch this in the theater and hence had to watch the whole thing through, hoping that at one point it would actually improve. Much to my dismay, the film gets more and more pointless as it goes along, with soldiers sitting around and philosophizing more than actually fighting and defending the country. I may be mistaken but the last time I checked, soldiers were enlisted during WW2 to fight a war, not to hang around a village wondering why humans feel the need to fight. What's the point of all this? It's not like America is going to completely change its view on the human anguish of war because of a bunch of random musings by dirty G.I.'s and once-great actors making vintage cameo appearances.If you want to see a decent war flick, stick with Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, or Platoon. Skip The Thin Red Line unless you really, really need something to help with insomnia... ZZzzzzzzz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes I do understand this movie and, yes it is boring and bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me a while to get around to seeing this movie after seeing "Saving Private Ryan." I knew there was a reason I was trying to avoid it. It is a terrible movie. How is it bad? Let me count the ways.Number 1, it is NOT poetic. If you think the mindless platitudes spouted by the various and indistinguishable narrators in this film is poetic, then you must think Brittany Spears is more poetic than Shakespeare or Frost. Doesn't it bother anyone that every narrator regurgitates the same mindless drivel? Could anyone tell, from narration alone, which character was speaking? The idea that these narrations are supposed to be the thoughts of individual soldiers is about as believable as guests on the Jerry Springer Show using more than one multisyllabic word in the same sentence. Real WWII soldiers don't think, "What is the face of nature? Do I know you? Are you my friend or my enemy?" They think, "How am I going to stay alive so that I can get back home to my family and friends?" It is an insult to real WWII veterans to suppose that they thought the same thoughts as shallow models in Calvin Klein Cologne commercials.Number 2, One can't care about the characters. Characters in this film seem to have been an afterthought added at the end, as if the director made the film then said, "Oh yeah. We need characters. Throw in a guy who fantasizes about his wife, a guy with a smirk who talks about inner strength, twenty guys who look scared, and a maniacal colonel. We'll pick up each character's story line at random, then dump it completely at the first opportunity. Characters, who needs 'em anyway?" At the end of the film I was still seeing just a bunch of faces under metal helmets, not being able, or caring, to distinguish one from the other. It is understandable that this happens in the beginning of the film. But if, at the end, it is still happening, it is unforgivable.Number 3, It is boring. No, you can't dismiss me as someone who needs action to be entertained. "The Accidental Tourist" is a great movie, yet its pace is slow and methodical. Slow and methodical does not mean pointless and meandering, which is what this movie was. It wandered around for 3 hours, not knowing where it was going, and ended going nowhere.Number 4, Didn't it bother anybody that every soldier narrator had a southern accent? Do they think that somehow that sounds more American? It ended up sounding annoying. I suppose they could have called this "The Thin Redneck Line."All in all "Saving Private Ryan" is light years ahead of this movie. That movie showed the daily grind and sacrifice made by soldiers, and in doing so was ten times more eloquent than the flowery empty language that tries to pass as poetry in "The Thin Red Line." Avoid seeing this bombastic, thoroughly forgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was horribly over rated. The first thing supporters of this film do is say how "the average person" won't appreciate it people were afraid to admit that they didn't like for fear of being labelled dumb. The cinematography is breathtaking in places but the plot is too convoluted for its own good. Instead of telling one story and telling it well they attempt to convey several and fail. If you want to watch a movie with some great visuals but a sadly lacking plot this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Sominex--the WORST war film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Saving Private Ryan", this movie is set in WWII, it's almost three hours long, has exceptional cinematography, and focuses on the travails of the regular infantrymen during that conflict.Unlike "Saving Private Ryan", this film is a SUPER-BORING, PRETENTIOUS piece of GARBAGE. It spends so much effort trying to be poetic and lyrical and elegiac that it never gets around to anything even close to resembling a cohesive storyline or character development.I've developed three film rules from viewing this thing:1. Never use more than one voice for voice-over narration. There's so much voice-over in this flick (and most of it in hushed delivery) that I thought they must be compensating for REALLY bad on-set sound recording.2. When you have to sit through 42 MINUTES of a war film before you hear any gunfire or artillery, you know you're in trouble.3. Any movie with Woody Harrelson in the cast should be avoided like the plague. (This includes his work on one of the most overrated TV series of all time, "Cheers".)I also have serious issues with a war film which attempts to put a positive spin on a lead character who is an AWOL-prone coward who should have been shot by his own superiors.The reason this movie got seven Oscar nominations (thankfully winning none) is because of this inbred Hollywood thing about the writer-director, Terrence Malick, a J.D. Salinger-wannabe who directed two films in the 1970s (the not-bad "Badlands" and another beautiful-boring-overrated flick, "Days Of Heaven"), then became a recluse, refusing interviews and photographs, etc. In fact, at the Oscars, when the Best Director nominees were announced, instead of the usual "director-in-action" clip shown for the others, they could only show an empty director's chair with Malick's name on the back.As far as I'm concerned, Malick can retreat back to the obscurity he deserves. This is the worst Best Picture contender I've seen since "Braveheart", and the worst war film since Ollie Stone's propagandistic "Born On The Fourth Of July."The ONLY reason this movie rates even a 1 is for the cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about World War 2 in the South Pacific. It is another war which is a very thin story line instead!The cast does what it can with the material, just it moves at a snails pace. The war is not the story very much. The movie is filmed wonderfully , just it need a editing job or something !!But many big name actors star in this movie John Cusack(Pushing Tin,Con Air), Sean Penn(The Game,U-Turn),George Clooney(The Peacemaker,Batman and Robin), Woody Harrelson(Play It To The Bone,EdTV,Money Train), Nick Nolte and John C. Reilly(Three To Tango, Never Been Kissed) all star in this candy coated war epic!!If you want a war movie go check out "Saving Private Ryan" instead and avoid this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The better war film of -98...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is ok to compare this film with Saving Private Ryan, or with any other film for that matter. Together they show something about war but even more about typical, grand Hollywood productions. Where Spr tries to tackle the visual side of ww2, Trl goes for the more thoughtfull aspects. I felt that Trl was better of these two large, war spectacles that in my opinion should have done more in order to achieve any kind of place as classics in the more intellectually enlightened world of today. With Trl I occasionally felt that Malick would have done right if he had not tried to tackle all the characters from the novel, sometimes it is not the right way to go. The film could not ultimately take the story and the theme far enough to make me genuinely appreciate it. If there was a lot of footage shot that did not make the film it would be nice to see it included in a directors cut or a tv version, I'm sure that would give a more fuller picture.</fullReview>

Terence Malick keeps repeating the same old Buddhist mantra about how the world is bound by a common soul to the point of self-ridicule. Like it or not, the film is set during the middle of a large battle--there is no plausibility in putting a man on a hill hiding behind the cover of grass as bullets strafe his posterior and pretending that he is going to go into a deep ponderance of the "oneness of the universe." How silly! There is a better version of the same theme in the Final Fantasy 7 video game that my students rave about. Aside from sitting through all 3 tack-eyed hours of this film I have also dedicated the last few minutes to typing out my anger towards it on the computer; you are wasting time reading about it now, too.

		<shortDescription>A Thick Red Morass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's MY fault. I finished the book, coincidentally, about a week before I found out the movie was being made. The book is perhaps the most stunning evocation of life during wartime I have ever read, and of course when one thinks James Jones film adaptations the first thing that springs to mind is From Here to Eternity. So, really, this movie did have a lot of space to fill in the shoes of James Jones and Monty Clift. And this job it did was horribly, preposterously, unbelievably, undeniably, unaccountably BAD. To be fair-- the trailers were excellent. And it seemed to me that the movie was begging for another three hours, so perhaps as a six-hour film it would have been brilliant. The acting was certainly top-notch in many cases; that is, when the actors were onscreen long enough to act (viz. George Clooney). But as the jumbled, unstable mess it was, it was just awful. Whole huge sections of central importance to the book disappeared; whole sections not a part of the book at all were added. James Jones is tapdancing with rage in his grave over the thorough mess made of what may well be his finest book. Read it. Avoid this morass of boredom like the plague.</fullReview>

It had a superb all-star cast; Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, George Clooney, John Travolta, etc.I went with three of my friends to a SOLD OUT showing on its first day of release and with the exception of one of the war scenes and when Woody Harrelson blows off his butt, the movie was TERRIBLE. The beginning was too dragged out with narative that was cliche. I will admit that the cinematography was excellent, but that alone can't hold a movie together.For me it was TOO much talk and NOT ENOUGH action. When I pay to see a war film, I wanna see dozens upon dozens of people getting blown to pieces. I want bullets flying every other minute and I want to see a hero with a big gun and a reason to come home. A BIG disappointment.1 star and a 1 on the IMDB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not once in my life have I ever walked out of a movie before it ended, but this movie came close to being the first. It is absolutely boring, repetitive and exhausting. The movie wreaked of too much effort. It's not even worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Saving Private Ryan.Malick's intoxicating use of inner monologues made the movie come across as a Calvin Klein commercial. Only the cinematography was worth watching. Malick also failed to convey the moral conflict of war....at least, he didn't do as good a job Spielberg did. Malick's version of war showed little horror to me, the extent of which would have been soldiers getting bombarded by their own air support, which didn't last that long either.Another problem I had with the movie was the way it was promoted. The production company advertised it as a war movie, yet there was very little action to speak of. They also headlined John Travolta, but he only appeared in one scene.Ultimately, this movie did not meet my expectations and I would have followed the 3 people that walked out when I went to see this movie but my foot fell asleep.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't the slightest clue WHAT the film industry was thinking when they allowed this "film" to go to press! I mean who's in charge over there? And do we want this person to continue to allow such garbage to be displayed on the "sliver screen?"This "film" by far has to be the worst movie that I have EVER seen in my entire career of movie goings. I have never once wanted to leave a film as bad as I did after a half hour into it as I did this one. It's no wonder that no one has heard of or seen the directors other movies, probably because they were not allowed to be shown in the United States, unfortunately this one got by.Those of you that think that this movie can even hold a candle to "Saving Private Ryan" must have seen a completely different movie than what saw. "The Thin Red Line's" "action" scenes are not even close to what I saw in "Ryan" and were no where near as exciting and/or adrenaline pumping. The only thing that "The Thin Red Line" had that Ryan had was the "big" names, and I think that was only to draw the crowd that would later leave out of sheer boredom and frustration from the film's constant over shadowing and character developments. As for the big names that made it into this film I can only say that when an actor or actress makes a decision to take on a role in a film such as this they can only go up, they would have had to have been at rock bottom to have agreed to make such a film with their name on it. I found myself wondering what the films intent was, what was the point of the movie? At first I thought that it was to take the island that they landed on and then to take the hill (a sort of "Hamburger Hill" rip-off), but then as the movie dragged on I realized that it was some sort of man getting in touch with his feminine side and to know how to constantly reflect and examine your previous experiences while fighting during a war. Now I can sleep at night!In conclusion if you have nothing better to do than to go and waste 3 hours of your life, whatever it is you spend on movies where you live and killing off a few hundred brain cells go ahead and go!! Otherwise I would suggest staying at home and watching the paint dry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess it's important to know people in high places, how else could one explain Terrence Malick actually having a "movie" like this as acclaimed as it is? I have quoted the word "movie" because it was a movie only in the sense that it was shot on film and it is seen in a theater. Otherwise it is just a plotless, empty, superficial examination of what Mr. Malick THINKS war would be like.How can this be considered for an Academy Award? There is NO PLOT; the "movie" continuously seemed as if it were building toward something and then...NOTHING."The Thin Red Line" would be better suited for National Geographic or a Discovery channel documentary, with its endless and tiresome shots of wildlife and foliage, and as if those were not bad enough in themselves, they weren't even placed well within the "moment." The only relevant shot of an animal in this "film" came with a bird struggling for its life amidst the battle. The opening scene is of an alligator while the music in the background is escalating and then...NOTHING. Two and a half HOURS later we see the alligator again, WOW! I got chills! What a great technique! Now I understand the meaning of life!I understood the theme which was explained in the first of what seemed like an infinite amount of narratives, "Nature is endlessly fighting with itself," or some philisophical garbage like that. But this "movie" tries to do too much and left me as well as the rest of the audience, or what was left of it, gawking at the screen in a state of confusion and disbelief when the credits FINALLY rolled.You can call me crazy, but I think characters are important, and if Mr. Malick hadn't intended to focus on any one character, then why did he add elements to the "film" (such as the cheating wife) that would make it seem as if he were but ran out of time?At least I wasn't so withdrawn as not to notice George Clooney's perfect hair in the MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thin Red Line: I am thinking more like a thin line between a movie and death itself. This has to be one the most horribly made movies I have ever seen. About 1 hour into the movie I just sat thinking to myself I have not had the urge to fall aslleep or commit suicide in a movie theater since I saw "The Big Lebowski" last spring. I think it stems from the the annoying narratives, by about the 3rd time he starts spewing out his plethora of attempts at some kind of poetry you want to go into the movie and order him to attack the bunkers just so you can at least sit in this movie for the next 3 hours without losing your sanity.And what is this fascination with the island people? Every other dream lapse was some naked islander kid swimming in the ocean, or it was the couple making love or whatever with their clothes on.As for the fight sceens, I admit I went to the movie to see that. I was thinking this would be a Pacific version of the movie " Saving Private Ryan" but it wasn't. Sadly I would think they had enough time to see the marvelous special effects and camera angles that "Saving Private Ryan" had they would want to keep up with it or top it. Well that didn't happen, I felt like I was watching Platoon all over, you know shoot from the hip kind of crap. The Americans wipe out the enemy with like, well in this movie 7 guys on that Bunker attack.Just not a really well put together movie at all, either do the war or do the sappy dreaming these people seem to do for most of the movie. Dont intermix them. The Cameo appearances should be noted as low spots for the big named actors. What are they thinking? It doesn't help the movie out. Just makes you think they must know this movie is not good so they added some big named people to get me to waste 3 hours of my life. I would have rather just sat at home watching the home shopping network or the Real World, so now you know how low the movie is. I mean the real world is about as low as you go.So in conclusion I don't recommend this unless you want to extract information from somebody and you use this as a torture method. And who is that guy who said 20 yrs this movie will be well known? It may be well known for ending the careers of a few talented actors.-Mike</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, before I go into how bad this film is let me state the director is a master when it comes to the battle scenes. They are superb. Some of the best ever. The rest is a waste o time. There are some good performances given the size of the parts, but they are far and few. Koteas, Nolte and Cusack are the only actors worth anything in the film, and neither of them have too large of parts. The director tries to get across some much in so much time but it gets lost in its own failed symbolism. This film is actually painful to watch because of that. You will find yourself praying for the battle scenes, and discover yourself muttering swears when a narration begins or a cut scene to a soldier's wife. If one were to ignore the "message" the director is trying to share and look at the film as simply a film to watch and be entertained by you'll find nothing. That is why the symbolism fails, the message fails, and the movie is hard to watch. Because beneath all the symbols and life questioning there is nothing. No plot, no real main characters to attach yourself to, or care about. It's just a march through a jungle. And perhaps that's what the director wanted, an insufferable march through the jungle, trying to show a viewer the crap each soldier went through, however it doesn't shine through, instead it's me guessing at perhaps that's the point. I love a film that questions life, and this film does that. However it does it as an old English novel would. The kind of novel near impossible to read because the language has changed so much in six hundred years. This film had a lot of potential, however it got lost in itself and became perhaps the biggest disappointment I've had in a long while.</fullReview>

How this movie happened to be classified into the first group, rather than the second, I cannot even start to guess.I didn't sit down in front of the screen expecting to see an action movie, and ended up being disappointed because of it. No, I knew full well what I was about to watch, a philosophical flick discussing the nature of war, and man itself. And let me tell you that this movie failed miserably at it. Some people have compared this movie to Full Metal Jacket, a movie that actually illustrated the horrifying nature of war.The Thin Red Line, on the other hand, was just a pretentious pile of cheap poetry, and repetitive, unnecessarily long scenes. The great soundtrack and good acting from parts of the cast weren't even near to saving this movie. Absolutely terrible, and an extraordinary example of "The Emperor's New Clothes Effect". I strongly recommend you not to waste almost three hours watching this flick, I you have nothing else to do, then, by all means, do nothing at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell asleep in the first 10 minutes of this film. It was so boring that I stopped watching it after the next 15minutes.Its basically an Anti-war "I hate war" "war is meaningless" sort of film written apparently by Sean Penn.This sort of theme may perhaps be used for other conflicts - insert your "I hate Bush" diatribe here. Or lets see, WW1 trench warfare.But the Pacific War was quite different. The Japanese military really were horrible. They slaughtered millions of innocent civilians. The Battle for Guadalcanal was vitally important as it served as a staging post for Japanese bombers to sink Allied ships heading to Australia etc..There were numerous historical inaccuracies in this movie. The battle scenes were not factually correct.In short, this film and the story of WW2 only serves to act as a canvas for an anti-war message, and for the director to insert platitudes about the "horrors of war" and about how the Japanese soldiers - the same people who raped an entire city population at Nanking before killing them - were really really nice people.In short, its a boring, preachy film filled with hippie 3am free form poetry. Watch this if you want to watch an anti-war film. The director might as well have substituted the Japanese soldiers for smurfs.</fullReview>

It came out right after Saving Private Ryan, which didn't help it, since SPR ruined all war movies to come after it (or so I thought, after seeing this..

They took it, and then the movie went on.. For no apparent reason whatsoever. I wish someone would tell me what I'm missing in this movie. Poetry it may be, but it is not my cup of tea.

And if all it is is showing different people involved in war, with no link between them and no actual story, well then, I'd rather watch a documentary about it. Review written 3-3-05.

		<shortDescription>Possibly the very worst movie I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to tag along with the popularity of Saving Private Ryan, a far superior film which deals with American soldiers in Europe in World War II, The Thin Red Line's advertising attempts to present this as a war movie about US soldiers in the Pacific theater (Guadalcanal- a turning point in the war against the Japanese). The actual war takes up about 10% of this overly long, completely boring and utterly inane piece of garbage. The rest of the movie is devoted to scenes dedicated to brooding soldiers; moronic voiceovers over what appears to be spare National Geographic documentary footage of the rain forest; abstruse philosophic ruminations which make this more of a series of disjointed monologues seemingly edited by first year film students; and just about every cliche of dying soldiers in agony. During the actual Battle for Guadalcanal US forces won a hard fought victory against fanatically dedicated and courageous Imperial Japanese troops defending an important airfield. One would wonder how any American soldiers accomplished anything based on this movie's relentless characterizations of American soldiers as terrified and reluctant, ill-lead and confused. There are banal references to incompetent officers (Nick Nolte), gratuitous but meaningless scenes with big-name actors which contribute nothing to this horrendus jumble (John Travolta, George Clooney) and Sean Penn essentially reprising his role as a Sergeant from that Vietnam movie with Michael J. Fox. The movie is interspersed with scenes of happy aboriginal natives, and bizarre "art school" flashbacks and stream of consciousness ramblings. I suppose this is supposed to stand in contrast to the war, but it simply looks like three different movies edited together in a blender. This movie is a disgrace, an insult to US veterans and a comlpete waste of time. It was one of the few movies that I not only wanted to leave, but also ask for my money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WWII according to the Hollywood Left</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie despite seeing the names George Clooney, Woody Harrelson and Sean Penn. I should have known...Even with all the cuts made, actors' roles left out, etc., the movie is way too long. What could have been taken out? Many of the scenes involving natives, the laughable scene with John Travolta, and endless parts where nothing is happening would do.Often the trouble with ensemble casts is that the viewer often can't identify with any of the characters because none of them are on screen enough to accomplish that. This movie is a classic example of that.The Japanese soldiers surrendering right and left without much of a fight sure doesn't seem to go along with their credo of never surrendering because that is dishonorable, etc.The parts of the movie where soldiers were questioning to themselves "Why are we here?", "What is all this for", etc. would seem to fit more with a movie about the Viet Nam War, not World War II.OK the movie wasn't "terrible" but I think it could have been much better. I'm not surprised it was nominated in several Oscar categories though, the Hollywood Left always has to look out for their own.</fullReview>

It disappoints in all ways possible; the only positive thing is the nice scenery.Anybody voting this above a 5 or 6 must have a dull life.There is nothing interesting at all about the movie, and besides that, there is nothing realistic about it either.A 'good' war movie, could have been with bad acting and scenery, with a slim storyline, but this movie has none of that, not even the good 'war' part.Lets hope people get some sense and start rating this movie for what it's worth - not for what they think it needs.</fullReview>

The very thought of seeing this trash movie makes me want to PUKE!!!I feel like I have been RIPPED OFF! Hey Malick, I want my money back!!!!!Why do these "liberal" directors continuously feel the need to apply 90's apathy, sarcasm, and distrust of the military and our leaders to a time and place when honor, patriotism, and love of country were real and tangible. What this film does to the memory of the REAL veterans of Guadalcanal on both sides is a disgrace. Malick; Like a drunk driver who has just taken a life, should not be allowed back in the drivers seat (read as directors chair). Shame Mr. Malick, Shame.I heard before seeing this movie (if you want three hours of junk a movie) that Terence Malick is supposed to be some kind of genius. After being subjected to the torture of watching the thin red line, I am not convinced.Plain and simple, the film sucked.P.S. Mr. Malick, if you want to see how to make a good (war) film....I suggest you see Saving Private Ryun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious rubbish with mediocre acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so many good things about this film, I decided to watch it to form my own opinion. I went into it with high expectations, but came out extremely disappointed. I thought this would be a good war movie, where great actors give great performances. But I was wrong.The Thin Red Line is supposed to be a war film, but it's not. It's like a documentary on Asian wildlife mixed with the thoughts of a confused pseudo-intellectual teenager, who is constantly high on acid and happens to be in a battle. The film doesn't really have a main character, but you could say that it's the character played by Jim Caviezel. His story revolves around two things. The first is his girlfriend who is back home. He regularly thinks about her in weird, meaningless flashbacks where she is on the swing or looking at the sea. The second thing his story revolves around is showing us beautiful nature scenes accompanied by idiotic philosophical voice-overs.In its three hours the film follows a pattern. First you get some nature scenes that look very nice. Then for a short while it turns into a normal war film with characters behaving rationally and actually fighting a battle, but then people with questionable acting skills take over and start behaving abnormally while uttering very strange lines. Finally Jim Caviezel's character shows up, and bores us with his opinion on war and stupid flashbacks that involve his girlfriend. Now I mentioned questionable acting skills, which brings me to the cast of this film. The film supposedly features big names like: Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, George Clooney, John Cusack, and many more. But don't be fooled, Sean Penn has a good deal of screen time, but gives an extremely bland performance, George Clooney shows up for about half a minute near the end in a role that could have been played by your next-door neighbour. The other big names just stand around in pointless scenes without adding anything. There is one exception though, and that is Nick Nolte. Nolte manages to squeeze in a good bit of screen time and make a stupidly written character quite interesting by giving a good performance throughout the film. In fact, I would award the film an extra point because of his performance.I did not like this film at all. It's a mess that tries to combine a World War 2 battle with a romantic subplot accompanied by pretentious, philosophical rambling. A lot of actors give mediocre performances, or just stand around without adding anything. The only good thing is the cinematography. There are a lot of scenes with beautiful shots of the surrounding environment, but unfortunately it doesn't save this abomination of a picture. I have rarely been so disappointed by a film, and I have never seen such a pretentious work of rubbish in my entire life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring film not worth the praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with high expectations because of the great reviews, the big names and the nominations.What a disappointment! I was treated to lots of boring, pointless scenes. The big names were not or hardly present with the exception of Nick Nolte and possibly John Cusack. Travolta? A short and silly scene. Sean Penn? Hardly seen him. George Clooney? A small scene at the very end.What was the director trying to do? Was he trying to do anything or was he just under the influence of some substance? What happened to the editor? Did he mix up a bad war movie with beautiful scenes from a documentary made in the tropics? Why did he also include some pointless shots of clouds? Why did he also include some shots of a romantic movie about some natives in the tropics in another part of the world? If (the character linking the war to) the tropics and the romantic parts was cut out, the movie would have been a bit better And then we have a great number of so-called philosophical voice-overs. These are extremely pretentious. Most of the time they seem to be written by Steven Seagal in his worst movies. Or produced by a very poor priest in a sermon filled with "philosophical" clich questions about life.I rated this movie 3 out of 10 including bonus points for some strong scenes by Nolte. Without that this film would really be dreadful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That this piece of garbage, littered with "big name actors" was nominated for 7 Academy Awards in 1998 (inc Best Picture) but not in the 'Best Actor' category says all you need to know about the apparent mindset of the makers...let's fill this thing to the gunnels with a multi million dollar cast...then we don't need to worry about the laughable script, laughable acting and lack of action. Indeed, I watched the death of Woody Harrelson's character and I felt sure this scene was an attempt at high comedy!! Nobody seemed able to die without making a big palaver over it. This film is best seen as an unwitting comedy because the viewer will never get those hours back. It's also best considered as one of those dreadful films of the 'modern era' that proves that the art of good film making died in Hollywood a long time ago. If you haven't already been suckered into buying a cheap DVD release, maybe my suffering won't have been for nothing if I can save you your time and money: DON'T BUY THIS FILM if you're expecting a straight (and sensible)war movie action flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how did this get an Oscar nomination?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I intended to see a world war II film, a film that was dubbed unique and packed with star power. What I saw was a National Geographic nature special with cameo appearances of known actors giving mediocre performances, save Nick Nolte. When comparing this "film" to this year's other WWII epic, Saving Private Ryan, I find it hard to identify any positive features of The Thin Red Line. In fact this movie is no "film" at all. It is simply the result of an uncontrolled director let loose. The movie's most laughable characteristic is the inclusion of George Clooney in one of the top credit spots. (he has, no joke, 25 seconds of screen time. This was an obvious low blow to the film's "artistic" nature in that Clooney's only purpose is to draw a female audience and therefore boost ticket sales, a truly "unartistic" endeavor. And who cares if Terrence Malick hasn't made a film in god knows how long? He should have stayed retired if he was waiting an eternity for something like this mess to come along. Where is the unity? Where is the theme? Does it deal with the disruption of nature as caused by war? Or is it just a really bad art "film"? Whatever the case, this movie is garbage, completely undeserving of an Oscar nomination. Fox must be having quality control problems or they simply were in need of something comparable to Saving Private Ryan. Nowhere close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The so called poetry of this film is out of place, the cut-a-ways to the girlfriend at home during a firefight, the long shots of birds and nature at odd moments, and the often lovely but daft musical score are just a few of the many technical difficulties that plague this beautifully filmed motion picture.Despite a stellar cast with some good performances, many scenes are marred by the director's desire to make a tragically poetic statement by lingering to the point of viewer exhaustion on solitary characters in crisis. If you don't agree, then ask this question: if you remove Nolte and his character from this movie, does the movie work? Does it succeed at all? My answer is no for without Nolte, the movie fails bitterly despite the excellent cinematography.There are moments of great film making here and there and the battle scenes generally work well, some brilliantly, some less so (the hilltop melee for example). In the end, war is war and not art or morality, thus the forced marriage fails. What a pity.</fullReview>

The movie begins with an AWOL soldier bumbling about with some of the natives and quickly moves to Sean Penn giving some garbage speech about how he's not going to court marshall a soldier. Then it moves to a boat where you see John Travolta with the worlds worst mustache rambling with another officer about a whole lot of nothing. I could continue to ramble on about how this movie talks about nothing but I'll save you the time.

		<fullReview>Less than five minutes in and this film had disappeared entirely up its own a**hole. I've never seen a more pretentious, indirect attempt at making something seem so much more important than it actually was. When you boil it down, the movie was merely trying to say what a thousand other movies have said - war is bad. The problem is that the movie goes about saying it in these smug, overblown, misguided little verbal vignettes that sounded more like Gomer Pyle deconstructing Nietzsche with a butter churn than the profound statements the conceited writers of this film tried to make them out to be. These simple soldiers would have conveyed much more emotion by just saying things directly like men of this caliber would say in real life - ironically much like the direct route they were ordered to take up that first hill on the island.Don't even get me started on the "performances". So many of my favorite actors here, thrown away and reduced in a pathetic sea of stilted dialogue and hackneyed action scenes. They make attempt after vainglorious attempt to make you feel empathy for these characters without actually laying any of the groundwork to justify it. The movie was chaos. It tried to "firework" into all these little sub-stories held together by a common, overriding theme yet only attempted to support that huge endeavor by randomly injecting celebrity roles instead of concentrating on a solid story that actually builds upon itself and makes the viewer emotionally attached to at least ONE character. Abandoned story leads, no quantifiable discernment of narrative along with random scenes with clearly different filmed elements made it even more patchwork.If you enjoyed this movie I truly feel sorry for the people in your social circle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malick's self-absorbed, anti-war rhetoric sinks "The Thin Red Line"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you march into director Terrence Malick's World War II epic "The Thin Red Line" expecting more of the same over-the-top, gung-ho heroics that made Steven Spielberg's predictable but entertaining "Saving Private Ryan" a multi-million dollar triumph, prepare to retreat! Loosely based on James Jones' mammoth World War II novel, Malick's account of the Guadalcanal campaign in 1943 is a dreary, drawn-out, message-laden maneuver. Despite its celebrity cast, its authentic settings (indeed, they filmed on the real Guadalcanal), and the artistic pretensions of its prodigal movie director who returned to Hollywood after a twenty year hiatus, "The Thin Red Line" hits the beach like a casualty. Clocking in at a lethargic two hours and fifty-five minutes, "The Thin Red Line" retreads in lush color what the more modest 1965 black &amp; white predecessor covered in a trim 99 minutes.Aside from their shared literary source, director Andrew Marton's 1965 version of Guadalcanal is more palatable than Malick's hopelessly platitudinous remake. For example, in Malick's version, more than a half-hour elapses before American troops start firing on the Japanese enemy! "The Thin Red Line" remake opens languidly, with a National Geographic prologue on a remote island with friendly natives where an insubordinate G.I. gone AWOL, Private Witt (Jim Caviezel of "Frequency") is hiding out with a buddy. The Navy nabs Witt about ten minutes into the action. Believe me, those first ten minutes crawl. You spend most of your time in "The Thin Red Line" waiting for something dramatic to occur. Meanwhile, the Army assembles off shore from the Japanese-held Guadalcanal, with pompous Brigadier General Quintard (John Travolta of "The Punisher") lectures Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Tall (rugged Nick Nolte of "48 Hrs"), a career soldier, about the importance of victory.As the nominal stars of "The Thin Red Line," Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin are relatively unknown and difficult to tell apart on the screen. Caviezel's Private Witt explains to his sergeant that all he wants is "to make a difference in life." The seasoned sergeant grimaces, "a man alone is nothing," adding, "you've got to shut your eyes and look out for yourself. Meanwhile, Ben Chaplin's Private Bell obsesses over the girl that he left behind. He worships her like a saint until he receives a 'Dear John' letter. Yes, you guessed it, she got a fly-boy Caviezel's Witt makes a difference in the end, but Chaplin's Bell is let to ponder his break-up.Some terrific actors get lost in the mix of Malick's self-absorbed, anti-war rhetoric. Nick Nolte chews the scenery as an ambitious colonel, while Sean Penn turns in a tight-lipped performance as a soft-hearted sergeant. John Cusack shows up long enough to lead a valiant attack on a Japanese machine gun nest. Other familiar faces such as Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly, George Clooney, Elias Koteas, Jared Leto, and John Savage appear in brief roles that hearken back to cameo-laden classics like "The Longest Day" and "A Bridge Too Far." Nobody gets a chance to develop a memorable character with whom audiences can identify as well as sympathize with during the films marathon length.Malick indulges in voice over narration which the actors deliver in the hushed tons of TV sportscasters at a golf tournament. "The Thin Red Line" depicts nothing that hundreds of other war movies haven't already shown. In his depiction of combat, Malick doesn't push the envelop the way that "Saving Private Ryan" did. Meanwhile, Malick departs from the rules of clear, concise storytelling. Plot lines that overlap with little clarity as well as sketchy characterization make "The Thin Red Line" difficult to follow. Nobody takes front and center presence like either Tom Hanks or Matt Damon in "Saving Private Ryan." Malick skips back and forth among too many characters for audiences to build a rapport with any single individual.Snobbish cinemaphiles who prefer the avant-garde approach that ignores basic storytelling and shuns sensationalism have fallen into ranks behind "The Thin Red Line." Now, if you're a media theorist, a humanities scholar, or a deranged cult movie iconoclast, "The Thin Red Line" will absolutely enthrall you. You'll rave about the film's Rousseauistic virtues, and you'll point out how Malick turns Guadalcanal into a corrupted 20th century Eden. No doubt, you'll belabor the obvious significance of a crocodile swimming free and later seen trussed up in the bed or an Army truck."The Thin Red Line" qualifies as more of a metaphysical than a mainstream movie. If "The Thin Red Line" were half of the classic that its intellectual advocates argue, Terence Malick's emergence from cinematic obscurity would be noteworthy. Alas, "The Thin Red Line" fails to provide a catharsis and lacks the minimal quota of heroes, villains, and explosions. Do not cross "The Thin Red Line" if you thrive on genre war classics like "The Naked and the Dead," "The Dirty Dozen," "Platoon," and "Sands of Iwo Jima."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SpoilersFirst, there was an hour of pointless new-age soul searching before the battle. Then they take the hill ? that was pretty cool. The End? No. There's STILL another hour of soul searching. Right now I can think of two hours that should have graced the floor in the editing room. At one point near the end, that guy from Angel Eyes (and the Passion of the Christ) is looking up in the trees with a weird far-away look on his face. Are there Japanese soldiers hiding up in the trees? Are enemy planes about to attack? No. He's just looking at TREES! And then they made him look so "enlightened" when he's contemplating his goofy Zen crap. Is this that Scientology stuff that Germany outlawed? "The Human race is really one big soul looking out of many eyes." I don't think a single American soldier ever thought that during the war. The movie had lots of big stars in it, thinking weird stuff like that all day. It couldn't have been cheap to make either. If you LIKED Saving Private Ryan, you are sure to LOVE some movie other than this one. Oh yeah, it felt much more like Vietnam than WWII. Overall, it blew pretty badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good "war" movie, I give it 7 of 10,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard quite a bit that Thin Red Line is a better war movie than Saving Private Ryan. Not for me. It doesn't have as much action, and is more of a study of how war affected the characters in different ways. Although I enjoyed it, I found my mind wandering quite a bit. For me, a war movie has to have almost non-stop action, and Private Ryan did that for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travesty of a War Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read many accounts from Guadalcanal, this movie is just a sham.First of all, it was the Marines that took Guadalcanal, not the Army, and any one of the Leathernecks that fought there would kick your ass if you gave the Army credit instead.Also, regarding the ending, Jim Cavizel must've run across the one Japanese soldier who took a prisoner in the entire G-damn pacific theater. The Japanese NEVER took prisoners.If you want something that's historically accurate, watch The Pacific. If you want a bunch of actors camping around looking for Oscar bait, watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tiresome meditation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reclusive director Terence Malick's first film in YEARS is a heavy-going vision of hellish war (I resist using the term "epic" since Malick's interpretation of mortal combat is frequently rather puny; he's better at quiet moments of contemplation than dealing with actors in volatile situations). Malick seems just about the worst director you could get to film a war movie, but his heart was in the right place I suppose, and--as it turned out--much of Hollywood's male A-list was anxious to work with him (more people must have seen "Days of Heaven" than we thought!). This visit to Guadacanal during WWII is indeed hellish for a group of young soldiers, but their personalities don't really take shape--nor are they particularly likable or interesting (and it's tough to tell from Malick's usual soft-sell if this was intentional). Soldier Woody Harrelson, just after much of his torso is destroyed by a grenade, complains of never being able to f**k again. This tips us off that Malick is contemplative of war as a macho, heterosexual experience, and the bitterness of this scene lingers longer than any of Malick's other intentions. Solemn film is full of dreamy remembrances and intense close-ups of handsome Hollywood faces, but these cameos throw off the film's mood, turning it into an old-fashioned foray (recalling "A Bridge Too Far"). Nick Nolte is simply tiresome as an officer on the verge of hysteria, though both Sean Penn and Elias Koteas come up with interesting characterizations. Otherwise, it's a mess. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Boring Ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited 10 years to see this film, the director waited 20 to make it. Seems we both should have done something else with our time.Boring, way way too long, an insult to all veterans(American and Japanese).Yes, nature is beautiful, war is ugly, I got that within a few minutes it wasn't necessary to remind me every few minutes.Perhaps if the film were shorter it would have worked better. Editing could be improved as well.Some fine acting here except for Nolte's Overacting. John Cusack is one of my favorites but I didn't even realize it was him until late in the film. Awful. Scenery and score were excellent.I want entertainment in a movie, even a movie with a "message". And if I want "poetry", I'll read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The WORST MOVIE EVER MADE, in any genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was like a bad acid trip, one that I WISH I would have never recovered from. I just wanted somebody to come in and shoot all the primary characters dead so that the credits would roll.The ONLY quality acting exceptions, and the only decent portion of the movie, were the scenes with Nick Nolte &amp; John Cusack. The rest was an unwatchable, absolute garbled mess.And before you say "you just didn't understand it." I DID understand it, I understand that it was a horribly made, acted, directed &amp; crammed together heaping pile of Hollywood stink.War movies can be done well, and with a very human angle (see: Saving Private Ryan, minus Matt Damon's acting &amp; several 70s &amp; 80s movies like The Dirty Dozen).This was absolute crap. I apologized OUT LOUD to my wife within earshot of the few other people in the theater at the time. Not one of them disagreed with me. They just nodded &amp; walked out, wishing they had not sat through the movie. Sorry, even 8 years after seeing this, and re-watching it on TV, it still makes my blood boil that I spent 7 bucks (times 2) sitting through it. Arrgh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest war movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE THIN RED LINE has been out for nigh on seven years at the time of writing, but I only discovered it three weeks ago. After seeing it in its entirety, I could do little but wonder why this was not basking in the heat of universal acclaim, rather than glorified bloody action flicks such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN.Rather than devoting itself purely to a single aspect of war, whether it be the combat, the fear, the love, or the intrigue, as most war films do, THE THIN RED LINE successfully combines all of the aforementioned into an awe-inspiring vista of epic proportions. The stage set is the strategically pivotal island of Guadalcanal, which US troops are attempting to capture from the Japanese. Whether the movie was filmed on the island itself or not, the scenery is intensely atmospheric for a war production, with impregnable head-high grass, squalid mangroves, chillingly open beaches, and towering hills. It's easy to see where Mel Gibson got his cinematography ideas for WE WERE SOLDIERS.All of the aforementioned aspects of war are comprehensively and breathtakingly explored by the excellent cast. The empathetic Captain Staros (Elias Koteas) locks horns with his bullishly inflexible commanding officer (an excellent performance by Nick Nolte) in an attempt to minimise casualties rather than win the field at any cost, creating a backdrop of politicking and intrigue for the intense emotion of the plot. Private Jack Bell (Ben Chaplin) is simultaneously encouraged, harried and disheartened by the memory of his betrothed back home (Miranda Otto), infusing an appropriately romantic element. US character-actor Dash Mihok imbues an element of wild terror into the atmosphere in a very strong characterisation. But the real stars of the show are the faceless ranks of soldiers (surprisingly well-played by individualistic actors such as Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack and a young Adrien Brody), who all melt into a shapeless mass of adrenaline, fear and aggression in the heat of combat.I have heard many complaints that this movie is too soppy, and that there is not enough action. I don't see how anyone can complain about a lack of action and adrenaline. The cinematography is nothing short of brilliant - one literally feels as if the bullets are flying past one's face. The acting enhances this atmosphere, which, in my belief, make it a war movie experience unlike any other I've seen.THE THIN RED LINE is a unique and outstanding film, that leaves action-based war movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN dead in the water. 10/10 for sheer brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insult to American Heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clooney? Penn? Nolte? Harrelson? Cusak? With these leftist activist America-haters in the mix, the outcome is predictable. Americans are portrayed as inept and incompetent. In reality, their bravery in the Pacific Theater in WWII was unbelievable. They fought bravely and died by the tens of thousands in places like Guadacanal, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and Tarawa. Upon viewing this film, one would think the Japanese soldiers were the good guys; superior to Americans. In reality, the Japanese rivaled the Nazis in their killing and raping of civilians, torture of prisoners, and unspeakable atrocities.All this film needed were more America-hating actors in the cast, with Jane Fonda portraying General MacArthur.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Thin Red Line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is called a very good war film, but I think I only wanted to see it for the amount of good stars appearing in it. By the way, The Thin Red Line is a term used in the war for something. To be honest, I was interested in what the battle was, just the battles themselves, and who was in them. Starring, in alphabetical order, The Pianist's Adrien Brody as Cpl. Fife, James Caviezel as Pvt. Witt, Ben Chaplin as Pvt. Bell, George Clooney as Capt. Bosche, John Cusack as Capt. Gaff, Woody Harrelson as Sgt. Keck, Thomas Jane as Pvt. Ash, Elias Koteas as Capt. Staros, Jared Leto as 2nd Lt. Whyte, Tim Blake Nelson as Pvt. Tills, Nick Nolte as Lt. Col. Tall, The Lord of the Rings' Miranda Otto as Marty Bell, Sean Penn as 1st Sgt. Welsh, John C. Reilly as Sgt. Storm, Terminator 3's Nick Stahl as Pvt. 1cl Beade and John Travolta as Brig. Gen. Quintard. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Director for Terrence Malick, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Hans Zimmer, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (also for Malick) and Best Picture. It was number 16 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Good, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Fought My Own War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline, "Every man fights his own war" does actually ring true for the people viewing this movie. I fought my own war, against sleep; as this is one hell of a boring movie. It could be said that being boring is to the movie's credit as it is a good way to cure insomnia. Personally, I'd rather have insomnia. Watching this movie to cure insomnia is like cutting off your head to cure a case of acne.The Thin Red Line, in a nutshell; "War is bad. It affects people personally, and it affects their personal lives". There is now no need for you to see The Thin Red Line.The Thin Red Line follows the story of a group of people that are supposed to be soldiers. Supposed, being the operative word; as most of these guys would be better placed in an agony aunt column. If they're not moaning about something, they're comforting someone else that's moaning; "there, there", they say. What?! This is war! Where's Rambo when you need him?! The movie plays out like a children's book; rather than making you think, it just tells you things, "War is bad", it says, "each man fights his own war", you are forced to believe. Rather than giving you food for thought so you can come to these conclusions on your own, it just sets them to some sad music; and that is not a masterpiece.The Thin Red Line is unique in that it is one of the few war movies that is actually worse than Saving Private Ryan. At least Saving Private Ryan attempted some character development, had some decent acting and portrayed it's message at least fairly well. None of that can, or will (by me anyway) be said for this movie. The characters are paper thin, some development is attempted by showing you things in the character's personal lives etc, but that's not actual development; that's just lazy background building stuff. The film also plays 'the long card' in order to win itself acclaim. Some people will rate a movie higher if it's long, and that's clearly what the producers of this movie thought, as it clocks in at nearly three hours; most of which is pure drivel.This movie does have one good moment though.... oh wait, I was thinking of something else.This movie is over-long, over-boring and over-rubbish and it should therefore, be avoided by everyone. After I spent three hours on this nonsense; I was annoyed with myself for wasting all that time. I could have seen two movies for the time it took me to watch this one, and as it happens I'd have been hard pressed to find two worse. Overall; NOT recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>contrary to many reviews, this is not the anti-"Saving Private Ryan"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Saving Private Ryan" came out, some critics complained that it glamorized war, and so "The Thin Red Line" would be the opposite: you get killed and that's it. As far as I could tell, that wasn't the case. While the movie focused on a contingent of soldiers fighting in the Pacific in WWII, it didn't look at the idea and ramifications of war in general - there was certainly no focus on the insanity of war. In a way, much of the movie seemed to consist of conversations between the cadets. I know that it's probably a good idea to show how individuals experience something as important as a world war, but I didn't find the movie particularly memorable. It was long and slow, if you will (Terrence Malick's next movie, "The New World", also was).Starring Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Nick Nolte, John Travolta and George Clooney.</fullReview>
