		<shortDescription>An underrated and undervalued Scorsese Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you're doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it. Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture. I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both. The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done. The acting is superb. I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino. Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now it looks like Disney Land"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best films of the 90's hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I'm not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew "Ace". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn't have much excitement. I guess also because I'm a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe's. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I've read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this "Goodfells Part 2". Is it "Goodfellas Part 2", in my opinion, no. Yes, it's very similar situations, but it's not the same plot. It's a little more gory and more bright. "Casino" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro's character says "It's more like Disney Land now". Actually that's true, it's not like it used to be. I'm only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60's and 70's. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta's in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I'm a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He's dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he's a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He's only 5' 6'', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. "You want me to get out of my own town?! Don't *bleep* with me, Ace!" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we're talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my "Rober DeNiro: A history of his films" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has "hired" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace "I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I'm telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song "Gimme Shelter" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I'm disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. "Casino" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don't compare this to "Goodfellas", let it stand on it's own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It's very violent, we're talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there's more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It's a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I'd like to see it in the top 100, but we'll see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most uncompromising studio picture of the 1990s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese's Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas' view was ground-level, telling the story of the "blue collar" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it's fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typically fantastic Scorcese film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever. Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the "great film" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorcese's normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.Scorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Being a child of the MTV age, I'm a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master. Scorcese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of "Satisfaction" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant. Being a complete film geek, I generally don't go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them. While this was probably the tenth time I'd seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I'm sure I'll notice more upon my eleventh viewing. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, "A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Can't-Miss Story No Matter How Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a lifelong gambler who has crossed paths with a few fringe types portrayed in the film, I'm well aware of the story, the culture, and the ambiance of the Tangiers, the fictional casino placed in the control of Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert Deniro). Rothstein is not a mob member, but a "moneymaker" for them because he's the nation's best sports handicapper. It was refreshing for a movie to finally show that not all gamblers are stupid, but instead one of those who takes advantage of the many who are.Rothstein's partner in crime is Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), who is far less convincing as a mobster than he would seem to like to believe. Sharon Stone plays the psychotic Ginger, a once-in-a-lifetime role in that it was the only time in my life I could bear to watch her on film. The supporting cast is strong, led by James Woods and Don Rickles (excellent in his dramatic capacity), and the movie is generally well-acted.If you are a gambler or know the "wiseguy" culture, the movie doesn't have to be explained, while if you aren't, you'll feel like you've stumbled upon the secret meeting place of the mafia and made privy to what is said, without anyone knowing you were there. This film is based on the true story of what happened when the mob tried to put its men in suits and have them heading a casino, and why it has never been tried since. The homage paid to the incestuous nature of Nevada politics was an excellent touch.Most of us wouldn't like a guy like Sam Rothstein, nor would we like to be him, but if we go to Vegas for a weekend and stay at a casino/hotel, we'll have a better experience if his watchful eye is ensuring that our stay is a pleasant one. The film's nod to how Vegas has been sanitized since those days is also accurate, and reflects sadness at a lost era, where the baby (the "old school" types who made Vegas great) was thrown out with the bathwater (the organized crime influences).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is by far my favourite film. I enjoyed good fellas, thought Raging Bull was great and enjoyed Taxi driver but this is a cut above the rest imoI have seen this film to many times to count and i am yet to become even remotely sick of it. The acting is flawless, story flows at a great pace for the full all but 3 hours, great narration and a great soundtrackPesci and De Niro play their parts so well as does Stone. When watching this film I started to wonder what PEsci is really like in real life. Is he a crazed man like he so often plays? After seeing Casino you are likely to wonder, he is that goodI also think the characters in Casino are far more believable then those in good fellas.Must see for any gangster film fan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie, thanks to its cast, top heavy with stars and fine direction of the "Oscar begging" Martin Scorsese. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are great, as always, together. But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who "stole" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose. The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film. However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters. Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert De Niro, an icon of the contemporary Hollywood crime film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese "Casino" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas? We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn't sleep day or night? De Niro's character, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, is based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper? He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country? Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them? As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys? 'Ace' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables?But he had a fatal flaw? 'Ace' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions? So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him? Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power? Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating? Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town? For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score? So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money? 'Ace' knew that but he didn't care?What he wanted was to marry her? Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild? She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires?Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops? He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer? (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect? Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty? 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf? Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer?The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening? They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story? 'Ace' was an extremely fastidious guy? And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings. Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that. This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime. You have to be objective when judging this movie and those of us who criticize everything that stands out amongst the grey background of that which is mediocre are fools who envy others' accomplishments and view them as insults to their own personal uselessness. Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's. In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time. Its moral is that no matter how tough you think you are there's always someone you answer to and that you ultimately will, indeed, if you screw things up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but not without flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is a very good film. If you're at all interested in gangster/mafia films, or if you're at all a fan of director/co-writer Martin Scorsese, novelist/co-writer Nicholas Pileggi, or actors Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods, then Casino is without a doubt a must-see. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I'm a fan of Scorsese and Woods as well. I certainly enjoyed the film.But I don't think that Casino is at all a "perfect" film. An 8 out of 10 may seem high, but if you're familiar with my reviews, you'll know that it's not that high of a score from me--it's closer to average from me. There are plenty of flaws here, and I'm going to spend some time pointing them out, particularly since the film receives so many 10's.Casino is based on the story of Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal and the Stardust casino in Las Vegas. The Rosenthal character is here named Sam "Ace" Rothstein and is played by De Niro. The hotel became the Tangiers for the film. The mob backs Rothstein but has to set up a false front while Rothstein "secretly" runs the hotel, because of his gambling charges back East. He falls in love with and marries former hooker/call-girl and current Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone), who remains in love with her pimp, Lester Diamond (Woods). Meanwhile, mob strong-arm Nicky Santoro (Pesci) heads out to Vegas to protect Rothstein, but eventually ends up running his own rackets and trying to effectively take over the town. Casino is the story of the relationship and political problems that this cast of characters and a number of associates run into. It's roughly a gradual road to destruction for everyone involved.The film is unusual in many ways. The most prominent oddity is that a large chunk of it is told via alternated narration from the two main characters, Rothstein and Santoro. The aim was probably to include a lot more of Pileggi's book, in a more literal way, than would have been possible through more conventional means. It's remarkable that the narration works as well as it does, especially because a lot of it is given a rapid-fire delivery. For at least the first 15 minutes, there is barely a pause in the narrational dialogue.One of the reasons it works is because of the style that Scorsese uses to accompany it in the opening. He employs a lot of fast cuts while presenting very stylized, documentary-like footage. The opening feels as much like an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at how the typical casino works as it feels like a fictional film about gangsters.Eventually, the film evolves from almost 100% narration to almost no narration (although the narration never completely leaves the film). This happens so subtly that one hardly notices. Scorsese's directorial style likewise evolves from the fast-cut documentary approach to something more conventional.This is all well and good, but on the other hand, the gradual evolution can only happen because the film is so long--it clocks in just a couple minutes shy of 3 hours. That's a bit too long for the story being told. By at least the halfway point, it starts to feel a bit draggy. All the material is necessary to the story, but it could have been tightened up a lot more.Another unusual aspect is the score/soundtrack, which consists primarily of pop hits from a wide time span--30 years or more. While I like the songs--I've owned the CD since it came out and I listen to it often enough--and the songs can help set the mood for some scenes, they become a bit too incessant and overbearing for the story after awhile. It begins to approach the dreaded "mix tape" mentality, where the songs are just there because the director wanted to share some bitchin' tunes that he likes a lot. A bit of ebb and flow with the music, and music better correlated to the drama, would have worked even better.Presumably, Scorsese was shooting for something like a sensory assault, since that's what you get in Vegas. The visuals are filled with neon lights, flashy clothes (I love Rothstein's suits), flashy people and such. The soundtrack is probably meant to match. But in that case, if I were directing, I think I would have went for a combination of commissioned music that incorporated a lot of casino sounds, or that mimicked a lot of casino sounds--the cacophonous electronic symphony of various machines constantly going through their modes--with schmaltzy show tunes, ala Liza, Jerry Vale, Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, etc.That Scorsese was trying to give a Vegas-styled sensory assault is also supported by the audio-visual contrast between the Vegas scenes and the scenes in other locations, such as Kansas City. So I can understand the motivation, but I'm not sure the final result exactly worked.Of course the performances are exceptional, even if everyone is playing to type, except for maybe Woods. The plot and characters are written and performed so that the viewer can see the disasters coming way before the characters can--and that's how it should be. For example, as a viewer, you know as soon as it starts that it's a bad idea for Rothstein to kowtow to McKenna to win her hand in marriage, but Rothstein is blind in love and he ends up paying for it. Everything unfolds almost a bit predictably in this respect, and another slight flaw is that we're shown the penultimate moment of the film right at the very beginning. It tends to make it feel even more stretched out, as you keep anticipating that scene.But the slight flaws shouldn't stop anyone from seeing this film, and of course, quite a few viewers feel that there are no flaws at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notify Mr Scorcese: Its show, not tell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the gravest sins of cinema is spending too long on exposition. For this reason film makers are given adages like: Show not tell, cut to the chase and so on. This lesson seems lost on Mr Scorcese.This films consists of nothing but expository narration through out the entire length of the film. I simply could not believe it at first. I felt sure that the two narrators, De Niro and Pesci, would stop talking at some point and the acting would start. This point never comes and you realise that this is what the movie will be: nonstop narration telling you what to think about a character, what the characters think, what's happening and what's about to happen.It is unbelievable that someone would set out to make a movie this way.In addition there is a constant 'commentary' of old songs through out. Some of this yet more underlining of the banal obviousness of a scene, such as when we see De Niro looking at Sharon Stone intently, the previous music is suddenly interrupted with "baby baby you're the one" and, just in case we haven't got it, we told in the narration that he has fallen in love. Is this film making for the under 5s? At other times however it seems that Scorcese is simply using the score as his personal jukebox and playing favourites from his own record collection. All of this limits what little character development there is. The characters appear on screen, we are told who they are and what we should think about them and then move onto something else. A case in point is the romance between de Niro and Sharon Stone. He sees her and we are told (in narration) he is has fallen for her. Next we see them together and he asks her for change which she says she spent in the machines. We are again told in narration that this is untrue. So much for subtlety and acting eh? Then we next see them, we see De Niro proposing to her (after a voice-over telling us he was proposing to her naturally).Joe Pesci does his usual schtick of an Italian-American psychopath, so we see him engaging needless brutality from early on. De Niro is his usual commanding self but the non stop narrative actually diminishes him as an actor. The same applies to all the other characters.I could not make it to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visit To Your Parent's House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I am not a votary of Martin Scorsese. I think he is one of the most overrated directors in American Cinema. He made one good movie: GoodFellas. So many of his films are just awful like his dreadful remake of J. Lee Thompson's great Cape Fear. DeNiro overacted on a level not seen since Nicholson in THE SHINING. Here he starts very well, the first half hour of this three hour film is excellent. We learn all about how the mob runs Las Vegas. It was fascinating; I was ready to rate this above Goodfellas. The problem is that it all comes to a screeching halt about 45 minutes into the picture. Ace marries the hooker / hustler Ginger and the whole movie inverts, the casino story is relegated to the background and AS THE CASINO TURNS commences with some kind of sicko twisto love triangle with Ace, Nicky and Ginger with Lester thrown in for good measure. The casting is an utter disaster. Don Rickles as the casino manager? Look, Sharon Stone was beautiful but she was always a dreadful actress. Do not believe me? Check out all the films she wiped out with her awful acting. Sliver, The Quick and The Dead, Catwoman, The Muse; these were not all other peoples' faults. Here she shrieks often at the top of her lungs setting your nerves on edge; when she gets her voice up it sounds like dumping the silverware drawer on the floor. The last half hour of the picture has nothing to do with a casino; it is THE BICKERSONS. The highlight is Ginger ramming her car several times into Billy Sherbert's Caddy. Is this what you paid to see? It sure is not what I paid to watch. It swings the wrecking ball on the picture. Look, if I want this crap I will go over to my parent's house when they were living. Please!! Martin always feels the need to gross us out; he says the world is a violent place. He feels the need to raise the bar every film. In Cape Fear, besides the lovely almost consummated pedophilia, nice touch Marty, we get a man biting a chunk out of a woman's face and spitting it on the floor. Bring the kids!! Here we get a man's head put in a vise and cranked shut until his eyes pop out. That is not enough for Marty, no we get to see Nicky and his brother beat to death with bats thrown alive into holes and buried. Hey, Marty, how about some cannibalism? Come on, something for the whole freaking family? The real reason Marty does this is he is one crappy filmmaker. His movies are boring; ever watched Mean Streets? How about Shutter Island? He puts in the depravity mainly to wake you up and distract you from how crappy his movies are. Please, if you love morons arguing and who is doing who, like we give a crap? if you do and your parents are alive just go visit save yourself some real money. They are more realistic; that is a real bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Martin Scorsese tells everyone that he puts this kind of repulsive, gory depravity in his movies because life is violent. He is just a mirror, don't blame him. Well, before you watch this overrated, boring, badly acted piece of poop here is what you can look forward to: a man's head put in a vice and squeezed until his eyes pop out of his head. Two men beaten half to death with bats, covered in blood, which is gushing from all openings in their heads, then buried alive while still groaning and moving about. A man stabbed in the throat with blood gushing out. Sharon Stone portraying a woman that you would have to go to the worst part of your city and I still doubt you could find anyone that was such a disgusting reprobate. The movie exceeds The Grifters for the absence of a single character who is not an immoral, depraved scumbag. The first half of the movie deals with the everyday robbing of suckers who fall for the bright lights, cheap food that lure them into their doom. It left just a couple of details out for you: Las Vegas has the highest number of pawn shops per square mile of any other city on earth that isn't a casino town. Do you know what I see when I look at it? Blood, like The Shining, blood running down the streets from all the people they destroyed and stole their money from.Yes, it could be worse; we do not see a man bite a chunk out of a woman's face and spit it on the floor like we did in Martin's crappy remake of Cape Fear. The second half of the movie devolves into a soap opera where we are supposed to feel sorry that Rothstein married a skank who steals for a living. Gee, whose fault was that? Why would I give a poop about his buying himself a hooker? Oh, she wasn't trustworthy or faithful? She ties the kid up to go whoring around town? Who would have guessed? See, the real reason Scorsese puts this depravity in his films is a secret, you have to whisper: he stinks as a director. Please, try to make it all the way through Mean Streets, Shutter Island or The King Of Comedy. The movie is an hour too long and is quite boring after the first hour. Martin knows this, that is why most of the depraved gore is found in this section of the movie. I admit the movie has sociological value: you know, a study of immoral, murderous, depraved maniacs. For anyone with ethics, the movie is like your toilet backing up into your living room.The movie is like lifting the man hole cover on your street and jumping into the sewage. Stone stinks it up here big time, beautiful but awful when she starts speaking. If you would like to spend three hours with a group of immoral depraved maniacs, hey, have at it, enjoy. Lots of scenes, which are unintentionally hilarious, of Rothstein yelling at local politicians for taking advantage of him and his casino. The man cheats people for a living; Hello? Ethically, the scene is analogous to the madam of a brothel yelling at a prostitute for taking advantage of her. Sorry, Sam just not getting misty eyed for you today buddy. The above reviewers are exactly right, it is a cheap, obvious attempt to regain the lost glory of GoodFellas, his only good movie. The scenes are so stagey and contrived; it has such a feel of unreality about it. Does Don Rickles look like a gangster to you? How about Tom Smothers as the crooked state senator? The best thing is, if you insist on watching it, to take a long cleansing shower afterwords. You are going to be up to your nose in human sewage; people who destroy others for a living. Forgive me, they just do not fascinate me, they disgust me. Like all of Martin's movies, do not show this to children. Yes, The Big S: The Movie Reminded Me Of Another Word Starting With S, And It Wasn't Scorsese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...or is this the darkest black comedy ever made? I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama. I also think that Casino is far, far superior to the over-rated Goodfellas. Even though it's longer, it passes in a breeze. Casino is just so colorful, multi-layered and intricate despite it's apparent simplicity. The film has three different characters narrating the story but none of it feels like exposition and it's never over-bearing.Adapted from a true story, the film focuses on the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. The boss is Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, his wife, volatile hustler Ginger and his psychotic 'friend' Nicky Santoro. All they needed to do was to keep the cash-flow at the Casino steady to satisfy the bosses back home. But it was just never meant to be. And everything implodes at the end.Casino is filled with dozens of sub-plots, tangent stories and brilliant side-characters. James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con-man who can't even win a fight with a ten-year-old girl. Vinny Vella also amuses as long-suffering Artie Piscano. But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie. Despite starring opposite loads of well-established male lead actors she owns Casino. She was absolutely robbed at the Academy Awards when they gave the Oscar to Susan Sarandon. Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less-important films.The violence will satisfy gore fans. In this lovely film we have a dope with his head in a vice (after getting icepicks in his balls), a truly brutal beating with baseball bats, some moron getting a pen shoved into his neck and a cheater getting his hand mashed by a hammer. Don't let this put you off, that was the old Vegas. Nowadays you just get told not to come back.I know most people will call it sacrilege to condemn Goodfellas but Casino is just the better film of the two, plain and simple. Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters. It just has so much going for it that Goodfellas did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is so fast-paced and entertaining, it doesn't even feel like it's 3 hours at all. Fans of Scorsese, DeNiro, and Pesci will love this. They're all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role). She's truly the crazy bitch you love to hate.It isn't all too original, it uses the same formulas as other Scorsese movies (particularly Goodfellas), but it just works. It's a fun movie. The camera moves as if it has a life of its own, almost every scene is set to great music, the dialogue and narration are top-notch, and everything is just perfect. What more could you possibly want?It's the closest thing to Goodfellas II, but it still stands on its own very well. Everyone should see this movie. It's 3 hours well spent.My rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is my favorite movie of the last decade of the last century. Just like in Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese rivets the audience to their seats without a real hero to root for. It's the power of the characters he creates.Robert DeNiro as the gambler boss of the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s and Joe Pesci gangster are long time boyhood pals from the mean streets of Brooklyn. Both move out to Las Vegas seeking their respective places in their related fields at the orders of the higher ups in the criminal world. But circumstance drives them apart and one of those circumstances is Sharon Stone.People descending into degradation is always a role that will get you noticed by the Academy. Sharon Stone's part as Ginger is no exception here. She's a high price call girl when we first meet her and her descent into drug addiction isn't pretty, but Scorsese keeps it very real.But the main story line involves DeNiro and Pesci. To see ourselves as others see us is one elusive goal not attained by many in this world. These two aren't an exception. Each can see how the other is screwing up and absolutely cannot see what he's doing.The key scene in the whole film is when DeNiro and Pesci meet in the desert where a lot of problems have been known to disappear. If you can get passed all the cursing which is how you would expect gangsters to talk, each is making very realistic assessments about the other one and neither is listening to a word the other is saying. This is why I love Casino so much. I've never seen that particular theme ever handled so well on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Story Behind Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Martin Scorsese film,Casino,depicts Las Vegas--it has a glittering, glamorous face, as well as a brutal, cruel one.It is based on the non- fiction book of the same name by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Scorsese.The movie stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as Ace Rothstein and Nicky Santoro respectively, mobsters who move to Las Vegas to make their mark, live and work in this paradoxical world. Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970's and '80's are revealed. Ace is the smooth operator of the Tangiers casino, while Nicky is his boyhood friend and tough strongman, robbing and shaking down the locals. However, they each have a tragic flaw--Ace falls in love with a hustler, Ginger,played by Sharon Stone, and Nicky falls into an ever-deepening spiral of drugs and violence.The movie is definitely one of the best made about the mob.It definitely ranks up there with The Godfather and another Scorsese film,Goodfellas. Excellent story and acting are both characteristics of the movie.The story was great in the sense that it focuses on the excesses of language, of violence, of ambition in the life-styles of the rich and infamous which makes the movie smart from start to finish.Also,great performances were given by the lead stars De Niro,Stone and Pesci. Finally,it reveals to us what is Las Vegas all about - inside and out. A movie that deserves a 10/10 rating!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just started Martin Scorsese's movies one by one. By far this is the best movie ever. After I saw this movie, I read about the goofs in this site and to be frank I observed only two of them and I watch movies very closely.This is one of the best examples where director actually glues your bum to the seat.Absolutely no highs or lows in the movie, the tempo is carried from very first scene, continuing in every frame until the last one.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone gave amazing performance. I felt jealous and pitied at Sam, frightened at Nicky and hated Ginger. Amazing performers and superb action. I never ever felt that it was a movie and everything is screen-played.With the naive experience in watching Marin's movies, I guess camera becomes a slave to Martin ( of course right after Coppola). Beautiful angles and wonderful screenplay.And of course Nicholas Pileggi is genius to begin with and Martin Scorsese is another to go into Nicholas' head and produce the same.A beautiful movie which actually defines an R rated film without any gross scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ossessione</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reprise of Goodfellas, mostly, as has been pointed out, and although long, not as tired or boring as some have felt. How could a movie with Steve Allen and Jerry Vale be all bad? People have wondered why Scorcese and Coppola keep coming back to mobsters, specifically the Mafia, and all that corruption mixed with loyalty. Of course no one knows, perhaps not even the directors. But I suspect there are at least three reasons: First, it works economically. It draws the audience in. There is power and violence and sex to appeal to the men's fantasies. There is loyalty, intrigue, sheltered family lives, and the excitement of a wealthy rogue male for women. Second, Italian-Americans may return repeatedly to stories of the Mafia for the same reason that Southern writers deal over and over with themes of minority relations. In spelling out the stories, they are explaining the odd customs of their subcultures to the rest of us. Yes, we are hung up on these obsessions, just as you believe, and here is how things work -- a bit more subtle than you'd thought, aren't they? Finally, in exploring these themes in the interests of the outsider's better understanding of them, they can explore their own conflicts in model form, as stated in the anthropologist John M. Roberts' conflict-enculturation hypothesis. When we view something with ambivalence we tend to poke around in it, to touch it, fascinated by it. If we can't actually DO the thing itself -- become a mobster, endorse slavery -- we can play games with the idea, constructing little mock worlds in which we can jiggle the concepts around. In conflict about having children? Well -- you don't really need to. You can nurture something that is a model or surrogate child. Cats and dogs will do fine. But if your conflict is more intense, you are driven to less recognizable models. House plants, say. And if the conflict is VERY intense, you can start a coin or a stamp collection. What, after all, do you do with a stamp collection? You conceive of the idea, you start it when it's small, you feed it, you watch it grow and get bigger, and when it gets too big, or when you lost interest, you sell it on eBay and it moves out of the house. Directing a movie means constructing a model world too, like the model social world of a chess game.In a movie, you lay out a plot, cause the characters to do certain forbidden things, and imagine how you might feel if you were doing them yourself. I'm not surprised that Scorcese made this movie, or that he's filled it with Italian-American actors. I'm not surprised that Faulkner wrote Intruder in the Dust, or that Judith Rossner wrote Looking for Mr. Goodbar, or that Philip Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint. These model worlds they've created deal with issues like crime, race, female sexuality, and ethnic loyalties that have kept Italian-Americans and Southerners and feminists and Jews marginal to the rest of our culture. The artists are trying to explain to us and to themselves how things look from the inside. If these issues ever disappear, which is most improbable, the conflicts will ease, marginal populations will no longer be prompted to produce such intense work, and the rest of us will be poorer for it.Maybe in this case Scorsese did too good a job of it. I found myself listening to DeNiro's voice-over telling us that the James Woods character was a "scumbag" because he was a small-time chiseler chasing dentists on the golf course, taking money from the whore Sharon Stone. But who is DeNiro's character to make such judgments? Woods is detestable because he's a vellicating minor hood with no money? Whereas DeNiro is morally superior because he's a major player with LOTS of illegal gains? We admire DeNiro because he is the more successful crook. The moral calculus is a little confusing. On top of all that highbrow stuff -- man, does Scorsese know how to stage a fierce family fight. I should know. Wow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese strikes again with this raunchy classic about the Italian mob taking over the city of Las Vegas. De Niro excels as he plays 'Ace' Rothstein, a classy business man, who throughout the movie gains success and popularity which soon leads to his downfall. Pesci plays tough guy Nicky Santoro, who has more of an old fashion way of solving problems, but none the less, gains power and succeeds throughout this film. Sharon Stone was a flawless gem in this film. Sharon stole every scene if it was with her laughing, crying, sobbing or living it up. Casino is the most enjoyable film on the 90's, a must-see classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some bad reviews on release, "Casino" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" (1995), a visceral examination of the Mafia's influence on the casinos of Las Vegas in the 1970s, is also the so-called "companion piece" to Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas" (1990). Both films star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and were written by Nicholas Pileggi.Some even go so far as to claim "Casino" is a semi-remake of "GoodFellas." And many critics found flaws regardless of its connections to the earlier mob film. "Go in interested and you may find your interest tested way past the limit," wrote Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle. "'Casino' is not about people, just Vegas. It's an ambitious film -- but also a scattered, unfocused one." Viewing the movie a decade after its release, it holds up well. The film's real strength lies in its narrative and unflinching examination of its characters. Sam Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro) isn't a nice guy, and never really gains our sympathy. Nicky (Pesci) occasionally exhibits acceptable behavior, but if the film has a villain, it's him. And Ginger (Sharon Stone in the best role of her career) is selfish, spoiled and depressing.Critics didn't get it. "'Casino' runs a little under three hours, but (you) will feel like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor Thelma Schoonmaker," wrote Internet critic Steve Rhodes. Rhodes, along with countless other reviewers, complained about the level of violence ? suggesting an NC-17 rating would have been more appropriate.Whether you will like "Casino" or not depends entirely on your tolerance for character-driven films ? and, of course, heavy violence. Ironically, despite its flaws, "Casino" is closer to Scorsese's older work than any of his other recent films ? "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" did not feature likable people, either. Whereas we followed Henry Hill's journey from youth in "GoodFellas" and felt empathetic towards him, "Casino" drops us square in the middle of Sam's story and there's no connection ? this will either alienate or enthrall you, depending entirely on your taste in cinema. I personally love studies of characters ? especially ones that examine the evil inherent in man, and Scorsese is brilliant at revealing these things.His movie exhibits recognizable elements ? a whiz-bang style with quick-cuts, rapid zooms, a diverse pop-and-classical music soundtrack (with no less than four or five Rolling Stones songs), and of course, his famous tracking shots (here, he stages an impressive three-minute examination of a casino without breaking until we exit the front door). But "Casino" doesn't confine itself to the restraints of Scorsese's styling. Here he goes hog wild with the visuals (more so than usual anyway), soaking up the vivid colors of Las Vegas, absorbing the dizzying array of flashing bulbs and tacky bright clothing.Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's long-time collaborator, experiments with digital editing for the first time here ? and employs some new techniques that are subtle but make a subliminal impact. The title sequence, designed by Elaine and Saul Bass, is simultaneously dazzling and haunting.The performances are almost flawless. De Niro is Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a legendary gambler who is chosen out of the blue to maintain a new casino for the Las Vegas Mafia. Sam explains the economics of the system ? the mob take their cut of the profits, the rest goes where it should, and everyone remains happy ? so long as nothing goes wrong.When Ace's old friend Nicky shows up in Vegas he begins to orchestrate a ring of violent robberies ? becoming the new leader of a vicious gangster force that threatens to destroy Ace's chances at cutting it straight. Since Nicky is a made man, and Ace is Jewish, he can't stop him ? but fears their new lifestyle will only lead to misery.In the meantime Ace falls for the beautiful call girl Ginger (Stone), who doesn't love Sam, but marries him for his wealth. Her heart really belongs to her ex-boyfriend/pimp (played by James Woods), and at first Ace believes he can tame her into submission; but her free spirit ruins their lives and destroys Ace's confidence.The movie does have its blunders, and is not on the same level as "GoodFellas," but would at least make the list a few titles beneath it. Some scenes seem unnecessary, and Nicky's violent attack with a pen does seem a bit reminiscent of an almost identical sequence in "GoodFellas" when Pesci attacks someone at a bar. And as enthralling and entertaining as "Casino" is, it never really matches the overall energetic exuberance of "GoodFellas" ? they are, despite their close ties, very different films in a cinematic sense.Still, this is a great film, well made and daring. You'll probably either love it or hate it, but there's no denying its powerful impact on the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie of 1995</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino(1995) is a fascinating and terrific behind the scenes look at the mob undergoings in Las Vegas during the 1970's and early 80's. It deals with things that were hinted at in The Godfather(1972). Casino(1995) received mixed reviews during its release which was due to ignorance from most film critics. This film is one of the reasons why Martin Scorsese is the best film-maker of his generation.The opening credits are beautifully done using colors to a greater effect. Casino(1995) is a film that was most deserving of a Best Picture award in 1995. It should be considered as one of the top films of the 1990's. This is an another example of Martin Scorsese being done in by the Academy Award voters as he should have at least five Best Director[Mean Streets(1973, Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)], and six Best Picture awards[Mean Streets(1973), Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)].The infamous "Batting Practice" scene near the end of the film is one of the five most brutal and vicious sequences in a Scorsese Flick. The first part of the film are a summary of events and the narrative does not begin until twenty minutes into the story. Its filled with multiple voice overs from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. It was written by the same man who wrote Goodfellas(1990).Casino(1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as Goodfellas(1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods. This film deals with the themes of excess, greed, power, and self-destruction. Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out unexpectively. Robert De Niro as Sam is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.There are a few scenes that were really masterful. One, the scene where Sam explains the different roles of the people working at the casino. Two, the murders during the climax of the movie. Three, introductions of the main and minor characters in the story.One asset of this movie is Scorsese's Utilization of music used to fit many scenes and situations. It deals with the end of an era when the mob controlled Las Vegas. The camera is always on the move as well as being fluid and steady. The difference between this film and Scorsese's early works is this film doesn't have the gritty of of his 1970s films.Casino(1995) is one of Martin Scorsese's three or four best films of the 1990's and that includes Goodfellas(1990), The Age of Innocence(1993), and Kundun(1998). Casino was the eighth coraboration between Scorsese &amp; De Niro. Many scenes(gory ones) were cut from this feature in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. Casino follows in the tradition of gangster epics ala, The Godfather(1972), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Scarface(1983), Once Upon A Time in America(1984), and Goodfellas(1990).One of the film's best lines is "Before she could start counting her money, the bosses back home decided to settle the case out of court, so they sent me". Everyone contributes to the excellent acting in Casino. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her life. In my opinion, Sam Rothstein represents Martin Scorsese and the mob bosses symbolizes the Hollywood execs.Casino is more a big budget lavish Independant film then it is a mainstream feature. Robert De Niro as Sam plays him with unusual restraint espically for Robert De Niro. Joe Pesci plays a more psychotic version of Tommy De Vito of Goodfellas(1990). After getting brutally beaten by a Pesci character in Raging Bull(1980), and Goodfellas(1990), Frank Vincent finally gets a chance to return the favor.Scorsese directs with the craft of an experienced pro. Sam Rothstein is based on career of professional bookie Frank"lefty" Rosenthal. This would be the final appearence of the mother of Martin Scorsese in one of his movies. Casino(1995) as many years pass is a movie that will be acknowledged as one of the director's all time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, unquestionably in my opinion, the best film of all time. I wont waste time outlining the plot in detail, I'm sure other reviews have that covered. The mixed reaction this film has been given has absolutely stunned me, reviews range from the worst film people have ever seen to the most impressive they have ever seen. This is of course the most underrated film of all time and not enough credit has been given to Scorsese, De Niro, pesci, stone and even the supporting cast including frank Vincent. The reason for much of this films criticism is its comparisons to goodfellas. This is not goodfellas or a goodfellas inspired film! (despite Nicholas peliggi's involvement). De niro and pesci surpass their performance in goodfellas with much to spare in this film. Pesci in particular has added more venom to his performance than seen in goodfellas (which was already as venomous as a venomous snake swimming around in venom).Enough of this goodfellas talk, casinos finest quality is the development of the characters throughout the movie. The decade in which this movie covers allows Scorsese to work his magic and has time to brilliantly lay out this fascinating tale of the mob's control of a las Vegas casino...and the las Vegas streets. De niro is at his usual best which means long time movie partner Scorsese can direct with ease because nobody is better than De niro at his best. His performance is cool, calm and collected and his character is easily likable and understandable throughout. De niro's casual performance means it is down do pesci to take care of the more brutal parts of the movie, and he does this very well. Scorseses directing skills combined with De niro's fine acting and laced with pesci's raw power, not to mention a sprinkle of glitter on top in the form of Sharon stone, means there is no level on which this film does not deliver. the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but it lacks bite and emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an "I'm a schmo" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's "Go Your Own Way" and The Animals' "The House of the Rising Sun" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie "Heat". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is entertaining, for sure, but just one attentive glance at the editing and you know Scorcese's struggling to make it work. The voice-overs simply function to move the plot in places where the filmed action can't take it. A film relying on voice-over for exposition is usually missing some pieces. Plus as a movie about how relationships can dissolve there really isn't much to work from. The Rothstein/Ginger connection is totally breezed over and you get no real sense of their relationship, other than "he's controlling" and "she's nuts." Plus Joe Pesci is simply reprising his role from Goodfellas. In fact it seems the entire movie is just a Goodfellas retread, but without the great pacing and script that kept that classic together. Just because Martin Scorcese directed it, doesn't mean it's good!</fullReview>

In addition, or subtraction, they'll also mention Scarface and, no doubt, The Godfather I, II or both. (Laughably, no one ever seems to bring up III without wincing.) Me? I'm gambling Casino will be my mobster movie for all my days.It's a safe bet. Revisiting Casino, for the first time in probably a decade, is like visiting an old friend. And for three hours, it's a ride I can't wait to take again. For, I've done it many times before.I'm not one to like very long movies, or movies that move slowly ? and before I go further, this is NOT one that ever moves a bit slowly. But, ever since it came out on video (originally on VHS, back then) I couldn't help myself. I literally watched this three-hour movie over and over. And over. To the point sometimes, when it went to credits, I would insert tape one (yeah, again, VHS, humph!) and start from the beginning.I loved?and STILL DO?this movie so much, in so many ways, it was easy for me to continuously watch it. With this third purchase ? VHS, DVD and now, BluRay, I can't wait to plug it to experience it another time.This movie is so near perfect on so many levels and depths, it's hard to sum it all up in one review. The movie's onion layers keep surprising me with each viewing. And it's bonus of two movies in one is fantastic.Movie One, or the first half, is made up of all-but fantastic, interesting and driven narration of how casinos work, the rise of the two best friends/street guys and the mobsters in 1970's Las Vegas. From all my research and first-hand experience, this mentality of the 1970's is fairly close to what it is today. In fact, it's almost dead-on. Naturally, some things do NOT happen today ? the place is now like Disneyland: any bad press is VERY bad for the place. So, good luck in smashing a cheater's hands and not having a hundred reporters/bloggers tearing apart your casino the same hour.Movie Two involves every bit of the mistakes these guys made in order to eventually rid Las Vegas of the mob. (There's a lot more to it than from this movie, but for this story, it's centered on these wise guys.) Originally, when I watched this countless times, I narrowed it down to one main slip-up: the firing of a connected relative. But, examining it this time, there were so many nudges to their house of cards, it's hard to add them all up. Each and every bump to the base playing cards had an involvement to everyone's downfall.To top it all off, it's enormously interesting, fun, exciting and suspenseful to see how this well-laid based on true events played out. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the acting.I never once saw Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone or James Woods (amongst others) on the screen. Ever. These people were truly Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, Ginger McKenna and Lester Diamond, respectively. How each of these excellent performances did NOT win Oscars is beyond me. Actually, while we're at it, how the movie didn't get nominated for, and win, for Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, etc...baffles me.I digress. These performances were mesmerizing. Each in their own way. All the way down to James Woods, whom I felt did the best of his career and Sharon Stone showing incredible depth.Beyond the incredible feats by the actors was the brilliant direction, cinematography, story, score, soundtrack and pacing. Never did this movie feel slow, nor did I ever "check the time counter" because it's nearly three hours. The movie just kept going and on the right course. The plot unfolds as it needs to and the recounting of events and voice-overs were just as interesting as what was on screen.This movie was so powerful, as were the performances, that I almost rooted for De Niro's Ace. His gal, Ginger (Stone,) not so much. On a side note, she was fairly despicable and we wouldn't have hated her so much, if not for Stone's great take on her. (Or, again, the weasel, Woods as Lester.)Normally, I would absolutely and readily admit that I love this movie ten times more than the already very good Goodfellas or Godfather series because I am a gambler and have always (since early teens) been infatuated with Las Vegas and its history. It would be obvious that I'm naturally biased because of the reasons just mentioned. But, I am being honest: past my obsession with both gambling and Vegas, I loved this movie on all levels. Yes, it does help that this gives me a much more in-depth view of a certain segment of Vegas' past, I still love the journey Director Martin Scorsese gives me each?and...every time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, two great actors, star in Martin Scorsese's underrated, and in my opinion, almost best, Casino. Casino is a very entertaining, very engaging, very well acted, very long,and very terrific film. DeNiro and Pesci play two mobster friends who's friendship dies when they go to Vegas and DeNiro becomes pit boss. Money and greed brings them up to the top. DeNiro gets married to Sharon Stone's character, who is kind of a criminal with a bad love past.I didn't give too much of the plot. Because a lot happens in the film's slow three hours.Magnolia,One of my favorite films, is three hours long. The Lord of the rings trilogy is three hours long. Schindler's list is three hours long. Titanic is three hours long. Those films are all three hours long. Those films are all fantastic. Casino is a fantastic film. But still, it's not quite as good as The Departed, which is my favorite Scorsese film. It probably comes in second place for me.Casino is a very engrossing,very well acted, very interesting, very long, and very great film. That is all I can say about it. I loved it. Despite it's length. That was the only problem I found with it.Casino:A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese strikes again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" -which just so happens to be one of my all-time favorite films- I had an urge to see his other movies.I'll agree with pretty much everyone and say that "Casino" is no "Goodfellas".But who cares? This is a fascinating and powerfully dramatic film with great performances by Robert De Niro and the unforgettably talented Joe Pesci who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in "Goodfellas". No one can play a more dramatic role and act as dramatic as Pesci.He can blurt the F-word several times non-stop and go absolutely berserk on screen, which really captivated me in "Goodfellas" and now has done it again in "Casino".I'm kinda upset with the movies rating on Yahoo by the film critics.Why and how did this movie get a B- by the critics.Okay, I'm with Roger Ebert on this one and I'm gonna say that it's an absolutely great film.Everyone else can go chop their schlong off and die somewhere.Not as good as "Goodfellas", but like "Goodfellas", it's a four-star masterpiece by the legendary Martin Scorsese and I wonder if he'll ever make another mob movie.If he does, I'm there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Casino" is a near perfect and almost classic crime film. Why "almost"? Well, in my particular case, it reminds me of "Goodfellas" way too much. You know, the plot, some characters, violence, etc.Being objective, I think "Casino" is very well made. It has excellent Direction courtesy of Mr. Scorcese who once again proves he's a top class act. He created a dynamic, slick, spectacular movie with the aid of avid camera angles and his well known style.The acting is superb. Robert De Niro demonstrates he's one of the most versatile actors in modern film history. His display of different emotions, courage, and temper is outstanding. His character required plenty of temper. Sharon Stone delivers a very good performance. She's a fine actress. Joe Pesci once again shows his incredible talent while portraying mobsters. James Woods and other supporting actors deliver memorable performances.The atmosphere is splendid. You really get to feel the vibe of a casino even if it takes place in another era. The whole gambling, tactics, and obscure interests behind the business is impressing. This should be considered as a classic crime film. The 90's had genre defining movies and "Casino" perfectly follwed the tendency. It brought to cinema something never explored that way and it generated plenty of follow-ups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just lately learned myself to dig Scorsese movies as much as I do. Casino is actually a very good example of what it's all about. A long movie (almost 3hours) with lots of characters, explicit violence, dark humour, beautiful cinematography and very good acting. Robert de Niro plays the jew Sam "Ace" Rothstein who's getting in charge of a casino in Las Vegas. After a good start things start messing up themselves. Rothstein falls in love with the wrong girl (Sharon Stone) and his gorilla (if you can call Joe Pesci gorilla) is getting way out of line. Casino turns out to a quite basic gangster movie. Robert de Niro reaches one of his best performances ever as Rothstein. Sharon Stone is very good as Rothstein's girlfriend. I guess the Academy at this point understood her potential since she got nominated for Oscar. With Basic Instinct she should've gotten it. Joe Pesci is as good as he always is playing the same character. He really got his way of pronouncing the F-word. Also there are a lot of smaller roles with older actors who really gotten themselves looking like mafia bosses. All in all a very good movie as long as you take the time to concentrate on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first off,Joe Pesci is the man i first saw in "my cousin Vinnie[1992]" a movie about a lawyer cousin saving his brother from the state court. he looked funny in that. way too funny but entertaining in the second half mostly.average though.good.fine.BUT, in Casino,he blew me off,totally. the man looked really angry in the movie.one mad man out for making money out of anything. really mind blowing anger portrayal by him. really great stuff.total gangster authority type and mind-blowing selfishness shown in his character.Robert De Niro as always, had godliness of some sort in his performance. i don't know he just does it every time, in every movie. Sharon Stone was good too,was really beautiful though she looked like a stoned whore most of the time.Too much of vulgarity coming out from her mouth didn't look appeasing. But all the same , she still looked good, added to the theme of the movie certain sanguine elements or though the storyline is a little complex to understand if you don't pay attention in the first 30 minutes,because that's when the action unfolds, us getting introduced to the world of money making in casinos.top of the line vulgar dialogs,hard hitting acting by the lead actors,and the helpful narration in between times in the film,really enhance the film's value. sharp and nice dialogs.totally different stuff. they all actually send you into the movie. you get into it and get the feelings the movie spurts out. totally brute and clear. so very mesmerizing. an altogether another genre in totality. seriously, couldn't expect much more from the director. he's done it many times. he's just natural at it. so natural. i was actually left wondering after the 3hrs of the film - if i ever had watched another such engrossing entertaining thrilling hard hitting flick ever of that too - 3hrs! worth a watch,no more than that. again i say out loud and clear to De Niro's fans - see this if have seen him in taxi driver,the fan(so much crazier then Nicky in casino),etc...totally this guy is so versatile. so very adapting to the roles.mind-blowing film. i give it 9/10. a great memorable experience. a must watch for all,for lovers of any genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen too many Scorsese films. I've seen The Departed, The Aviator, and 'most' of GoodFellas. I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had me on the edge of my seat most of the time. Pesci is scary period. Dinero is possibly the greatest actor of my generation. Throw those two in a greatly scripted film and surround them with great supporting actors and you cant help but make a great movie.I don't consider this Goodfellas 2 but its close. Its a variant with two actors carried over. Don't get me wrong, This film stands very well on its own merit. If you never saw Goodfellas it wouldn't matter.You can always tell a great movie when you forget you are watching one.The violence is very scary and powerful. I grimaced several times the first time I saw it. The realism is there in every sense.A great rise and fall movie. In certain respects its sad the old days are over. There was an aura about it. But on the other hand, the Mafia was just to damned violent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Scorsese's best and most disturbing films ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Casino again for the first time since around 1998. The thing that I remember most vividly from seeing it that last time is being thoroughly upset by the scene in the cornfield at the end of the film. Most of the rest of the movie was overshadowed by the memory of that one scene, so I wanted to watch it again because I love Scorsese's films so much that not knowing about Casino was just acceptable. So I watched it again and I loved it again and my respect and amazement at the quality of the movie and the acting and the story and everything else was renewed, and nothing was that bad during the whole movie, so when the cornfield scene was coming up I thought, come on, there's only maybe 8 minutes left in the movie, how bad could this scene really be? Still, my heart was pounding in my chest. It was bad, man. It was real bad.Now, when I say it was bad, I should clarify that it wasn't bad film-making, it was brilliant film-making. But it was too brilliant. It was so brilliant that it affects me as though I was watching what took place in that scene before me eyes in real life. Scorsese gets a lot of bad press about his films being too violent (from my mom, anyway), and Casino is no exception. In fact, it's probably the flagship of violent Scorsese films. I've been an avid horror fan for more than a decade now, so violence doesn't really bother me, but Scorsese's violence has a grittiness and realism that sets it apart from most other types of film violence. It is graphic and sudden and has a gravity and an on-screen affect that makes it look like a documentary depiction of it. Spielberg achieved this same effect in some of the murders in the not so well received Munich in 2004. Now, as I watch the end of Casino, I wonder what it's like watching the dailies with Scorsese, as he sees for the first time what they've captured on film. Do he and the other cinematographers that work with him jump up and clap each other on the back and pump their fists and yell, "YES!! We got it, that's the PERFECT shot!!" Or does Scorsese turn his head from the screen in disgust and whisper, "That's the one. Print it." I'm guessing (hoping) it's some combination of the two.(spoilers) Odd, by the way, that the cringe induced by the final scene should be caused by seeing what happens to Nicky (Joe Pesci), who is by far the film's most violent and out of control character. The brutality of his character is as thorough as can be, but Joe Pesci is just so COOL. He plays almost the same character as he was in Goodfellas (an infinitely more watchable and, in my opinion, even better film overall), and he just does it so well. Makes me wonder what he's really like in real life. He can't really be like that, but he can't be that different, you know what I mean? Sadly, no matter how good this movie is, I just can't watch that cornfield scene. I learned this afternoon that I don't ever want to see it again, just like I don't ever want to see that cop get his ear cut off in Reservoir Dogs. I think those are the only two scenes in any film I've ever seen that I really don't ever want to see again. Brilliant film-making though. I haven't said anything about the myriad of brilliant performances yet, so I'll just say that Sharon Stone plays your typical hysterical woman, always shrieking for her money, her drugs, and her jewelry, her jewelry, her jewelry, for crying out loud, and DeNiro is brilliant as well (and as always). But Pesci steals the show in every scene though, including that last one. Now I need to go watch Home Alone to get that image of him out of my head...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge movie fan. As of this writing, I am 35 years old and have voted on nearly 1500 movies on IMDb. I've been a movie fan as far back as I can remember. And the best movie I've ever seen? You guessed it...Casino.If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be "exquisite". From the images of slow rolling dice to the scintillating voice-overs of movie-legends Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, each second of "Casino" shines brilliantly. It is a glorious film."Casino" doesn't get the credit it deserves, unfortunately. It somehow takes a back-seat to gangster films such as "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas", two highly inferior films. In nearly every regard, from camera-work to writing to acting, "Casino" trumps all other gangster films. If you haven't seen it yet, I envy you (as I would LOVE to see it again for the first time). Repeated viewings get better and better, but I was star-struck while watching "Casino" originally...and I'm sure you will feel the same. "Casino" is an amazing achievement. Many kudos Mr. Scorsese.It would be a mistake not to mention the tremendous cast...and they all bring their best work to the table. Sharon Stone, in particular, was tremendously impressive. Put it this way: When I originally seen "Casino" for the first time, Stone was one of my least-favorite actresses. After the movie, she was my favorite. She didn't just play "Ginger", she owned her! If I was asked my opinion on the "Best Supporting Actress of all-time", my vote would be Stone in "Casino". One of the best performances of all-time. Not to be overlooked is some of the all-time film greats in Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and James Woods. I am having difficult coming up with adjectives worthy enough to describe their performances. It's just an outstanding movie, played by outstanding actors, with outstanding direction."Casino" is like a theme park for movie-going adults. It has it all...Violence (including one absolutely BRUTAL scene to watch), gangsters, drugs, sex and plenty of profanity. But it's also about loyalty, friendships and relationships...in a gangster sort of way. Ever wondered what daily life would be for a mob-dealing gangster? Or a hit-man? Or a married whore? Or a pimp and golf hustler? "Casino" covers it all! Just sit back with your favorite drink or cigar...and ENJOY!!! :) Thanks for reading...now go see Casino!JD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is based on 2-Disc Special Edition release. I have not read the book, nor did I know anything about the real people this was based(apart from what's on the Trivia page). And yes, in case you have heard... this is quite similar to Goodfellas. There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese and/or anyone else who helped make this. And that's that. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people I know haven't seen the true-story brutality that is Casino. Taking place in the early 1980s, two mob friends, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are put in charge of a Las Vegas casino. Their job? To make certain everything runs smooth and to make sure that the bosses get their black bag of money. What happens? To put it into a short context: things start to fall apart. The dysfunction represented in this movie is amazing, every little thing leads to something worse. The beginning shows the rise of the Mafia's empire in Las Vegas: from the towering casinos to the floors of the casino, you get a little taste of everything in here. What's really interesting is that if you played by the rules, they treated you like gold, but if you double crossed them things could get pretty ugly (see the hammer scene). Casino, put simply, is a great movie. The only problem I experienced was that there were parts that seemed to drag out. The movie weighs in at a hefty 2hrs and 59min so don't expect to go anywhere soon. If you haven't see this yet then give it a chance, it really is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's Casino is in my opinion one of the best movies of the 90s. Every character in this movie is believable because of the great performances of the actors. Especially Stone's performance as the con-artist trophy wife is truly memorable.Scorsese never fails to amaze me. From Mean Streets to Goodfellas I loved every one of his movies. His movies are usually dark and gritty pieces but in Casino I experienced a new side of Scorsese. This movie has a big epic feeling to it unlike other of his movies. And it works so well. The film is very beautiful to watch because of the great cinematography and score. Scorsese seems to have an ability to make movies with very different kind of looks. And in this movie, I think he mixed his directing techniques of Age Of Innocence and Goodfellas. Like Age Of Innocence, it has a clean look, but the characters and dialog reminded me of Goodfellas (maybe also because of the topic of this movie).Like all the Scorsese movies, this one is also a great character driven, sometimes dark and tragic, sometimes wild and brutal piece of cinema art. Each character of this movie is well developed and deep. The movie is 3 hours long, but it had me hooked from the (great) starting scene up till the very ending shot.Must see movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So GoodFellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first part, as we learn the ins and outs of a 1970s and '80s Las Vegas casino? taking us so close to the mechanics of the operation we feel part of the roulette table or the dice rolling across... is intentionally created in the same fashion director Martin Scorsese showed us the mob's operation in GOODFELLAS.But then something happens, or stops happening, or both.The main character, Sam "Ace" Rothstein, played by Robert DeNiro, is a man of mind, not action. He's to gambling what Scorsese is to directing? a natural? and the casino itself becomes an absorbing character: we feel pulse of the tables and machines, and the men behind the scenes, keeping the moneymaking beast alive while protecting her from cheaters, con artists, and crooked politicians.Enter Joe Pesci as Nicky, Rothstein's childhood friend: the muscle who's cocky, dangerous, and ultimately undependable. And the flavor of the month, Sharon Stone, as Sam's trophy girlfriend turned wife, Ginger, who becomes the wormed apple of his eye ? and soon, for a man who seemed infallible, nothing matters but trusting a woman who repeatedly warned him not to. The movie hits a wall with the escalating relationship between Sam and Ginger, but it was faltering beforehand ? DeNiro, Pesci, and some of the other shady characters, although colorful and formidable, aren't very interesting nor are they people to care about ? unlike GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, or TAXI DRIVER, they all seem more written than real.And the duel-narration, beautifully wielded in GOODFELLAS between Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco, works and it doesn't: DeNiro's metronomic account of the proceedings is fine in the beginning, giving us a firsthand account of how the casino runs from the inside, it becomes a rambling safety net for the lack of a streamlined plot: especially when his business luck turns sour. While Joe Pesci's counterpoint is completely unnecessary, sounding like a goon version of Bugs Bunny, filling us with details better left for the audience to figure on their own.And the last half runs itself completely ragged: juggling a doomed love story straight out of a nighttime soap with Ace and Nicky's doomed friendship that meanders to a predictably violent conclusion (and they never seemed that tight to begin with for an unraveling to really matter).If Scorsese and scriptwriter Nicholas Pillegi stuck closer to the Casino, perhaps the film, and characters, might have had more purpose. What we're left with is too much style without substance. So to pay homage to vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen's comment to Dan Quayle's comparison of Jack Kennedy: "I saw Goodfellas. I know Goodfellas. You, Casino, are NO Goodfellas." And (spoiler alert) has there ever been a character more deserving a bloody death than James Wood's pimp/hustler who not only repeatedly steals Stone from DeNiro, but kidnaps, and continually threatens, his daughter? While we witness the immense, overboard bloodshed of everyone else, James comes out with a few bruises. What the hell were they thinking?!For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Words: Staggeringly Overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should be clear to anyone who has followed Scorsese's career that he continues to fall back on several crutches in the construction of this film: casting his cute lil' mama, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and a boat load of the other goombas who ended up on "The Sopranos"; the utilization of character voiceovers (a totally lazy device employed by otherwise ineffective storytellers) and yet another boring and way-too-loud classic rock soundtrack handpicked by a guy still living in the 60's. We get it, Marty: you REALLY like The Stones.Take your pick, and I will show you several films for which Scorsese received well more credit than he deserves: the muddy, ponderous "Mean Streets," the mediocre "Taxi Driver," the execrable "New York, New York" and "The Color of Money," and the predictable duo of "Cape Fear" and "The Departed," the latter of which was utterly ruined by Mark Wahlberg's shrill, one-note performance. Additionally, Scorsese's overblown video to Michael Jackson's "Bad" was complete jive and gave the regrettable Wesley Snipes a stairway to stardom.Ultimately, "Casino" is poor relation to the superior "Goodfellas," which, along with "The King of Comedy," is Scorsese's only film worthy of the heaps of praise showered upon his overall body of work. I should also mention that Sharon Stone's performance in "Casino" is just plain embarrassing. Don't get me wrong, friends. I think Martin Scorsese is a decent filmmaker, but he sure ain't Cinema Jesus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good gangster movie that might remind you of Goodfellas. I found the script, directing, and performances all top notch. The opening scene of the car blowing up will stay with you for a long time. The trials and tribulations of gangster/family life is explored in this movie. See it if you get the chance.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An allegory for the way the world is run .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the fans of Casino, I see the whole film as an allegory for the way the world is run. Think about it. A bunch of mediocre and incompetent Italian gangsters send their cleverest Jew to take over the gambling business in Las Vegas. He does a great job and makes them rich. But these moronic and aging Italian gangsters send one of their own (a violent and psychotic Italian enforcer) to watch over the Jew. The Jew is doing a good job but he gets carried away and marries a beautiful but materialistic and drug addicted woman under the false notion that he can change her ways. He also pisses off another ethnic group when he refuses to take back an incompetent employee. Meanwhile, the psychotic Italian systematically undoes all of the Jew's hard work. Things get messed up. So like I said earlier, I thought the film was an allegory for the way the world is run. There are some really incompetent and mediocre people at the top. The really clever guys are in middle management but even they get carried away. Ethnic groups are perpetually involved in power struggles. And in the end, the large corporations and the squares replace these guys. The film is almost like an ode to the old ways (however mad and violent they might have been) before the corporations took over everything. The film predicts Wolf of Wall Street in the way Scorsese's films would be made and edited. There are two narrators who talk us through the sensory assault filled with interesting camera angles, fast cuts, violence, beautiful women and the opulence of Las Vegas. Three hours simply ran by. De Niro and Pesci are ably supported by Don Rickles, Sharon Stone and James Woods. Best Regards, Pimpin. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's underrated masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese is my favorite director working today. From his first great film Mean Streets to Wolf of Wall Street, he's given the world some amazing movies. Some are better than others of course, but I would be hard pressed to say that's he's ever made a bad film. Casino, when first released, was unfavorably compared to Scorsese's Goodfellas, and it's easy to see why. Based on another Nicholas Pileggi crime novel, the returning cast members Robert DeNiro, Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci, a long running time and "rise and fall of a gangster" plot. But while Goodfellas is my number one Scorsese film (Followed closely by Raging Bull), Casino has slowly become one of my favorites. The violence is still sometimes hard to watch, two scenes come to mind that in my opinion, rival anything in Goodfellas in terms of visceral, shocking brutality. The infamous torture scene is still shocking, comparable to the ear amputation in Reservoir Dogs. Scorsese's eye for detail and use of narration serves him well, and the acting is across the board excellent. Sharon Stone deservedly won an Oscar for her role as hustler Ginger McKenna. And Joe Pesci is on fine form as hot tempered, coked-up muscle Nicky Santoro. The eclectic soundtrack is great, filled with 70s classics like Jeff Beck's "I Ain't Superstitious" and Boogaloo Down Broadway. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing, capturing the gaudy style of the era perfectly. And longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker edits the film beautifully and doesn't shy away from the sometimes brutal violence. There are a few flaws. You could trim about 10 minutes of Nicky Santoro and his gang (We get the point, they're bad guys). And Robert DeNiro looks about as Jewish as Vladimir Putin. But these are minor complaints. A great film that i'll watch over and over for years to come. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a amazing movie with unforgettable performances.The film portrays Las Vegas at a time when it was dominated by the mafia, extremely well directed by Scorsese that film shows Robert De Niro as manager of the Tangiers Casino who have to deal with his unstable wife that used to be a high-class prostitute but who can not forget her pimp Lester and his childhood friend Nicky that is taking the city with extreme uncontrolled violence bringing a bad image to the plans that the mafia has in Las Vegas.Sharon Stone definitely give the best performance of his career in this film and the secondary characters convey very well the image of the great leaders of the mafia.Casino is a classic and a must-see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Scorsese classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story- The problems I have with this film mainly stem from the storyline (and they are very minor). Scorsese is an excellent storyteller, but I feel as if I he had so many ideas for this film, it was difficult to express them all without at times feeling incoherently conveyed. Goodfellas suffered from this issue as well, but not to the same extent as Casino. Some of the plot points weren't explained enough, and you really have to pay attention to understand exactly what's going on. That being said, the story is still excellent. It's interesting, captivating, and (similarly to Goodfellas) allows us to get an insight into a world most of us didn't know existed. Characters- Every single character in this film is excellent. Ace (as played by De Niro) is just a rounded and fleshed out character. He feels like a real human being. Nicky (as played by Pesci) was similar to Tommy from Goodfellas (and that's by no means a bad thing). He is what would happen if you appointed Tommy to mob boss, and needless to say, it's very interesting. He's also just so entertaining to watch. Ace and Nicky's dynamic is also excellently shown, and very interesting (as are most of the dynamics between characters). Ginger was a great character as well, not only being a standard love interest, but also being a primary antagonist. The rest of the characters are also somewhat interesting, but not very fleshed out.Performances- As to be expected from Scorsese, the performances are top notch. These are some of the greatest actors in Hollywood, paired with one of the greatest directors in Hollywood, producing some of the greatest performances ever filmed. De Niro and Pesci obviously do excellent, but so does the ensemble cast. Sharon Stone, James Woods, and Frank Vincent in particular showed their true talents. Pace- The pacing of the movie is very fast, due to the incredible amounts of information that is trying to be conveyed. That's not a bad thing, it makes the whole experience more fun. It takes away some of the emotional aspect, but really adds an entertainment value. I guess in the end it depends on your preference. I suggest you see Casino if you haven't already. It's a Scorsese classic. Yes, it has a few minor flaws, but it's wildly entertaining, extremely interesting, and all around an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Know I Am In The Minority When I Say This Was Much Better Than Goodfellas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former's flaws. Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated. Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam "Ace" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob's casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There's divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky's wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don't change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can't turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace's fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man's escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It first seemed like a difficult film to sit through, however, once again Scorsese's direction is always awesome...Robert DeNiro is awesome, Joe Pesci is fantastic and Sharon Stone was a very good surprise. The shots are fantastic, music is good, but there's always someone asking: "Is it better than Goodfellas?". Well, I say it is...Don't kill me okay? For me "Casino" is better just because of the pacing(I find it more funny). And I think it's very underrated for what it really is...WATCH IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jealousy. Greed. Ego. Desire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is currently the last film in the legendary De Niro-Scorsese pair-up, and has aged incredibly well, after being underrated and dismissed as a clone of Goodfellas upon release. Indeed, the film sometimes might seem a remake. De Niro is the coolheaded professional, Pesci is the crazed psychopath, as the audience are again taken on a trip into the criminal underworld that predictably falls from paradise to hell.Yet, it would be more accurate to call Casino a comparison piece to Goodfellas, as they match well while going off in satisfying tangents. The first hour of both is essentially the same setup. A glamorous exposition of their current gangster high-life, setting up the game and the players. Its quintessential Scorsese, with tracking shots, voice over exposition and a brilliant, catchy soundtrack. But here they diverge, as Goodfellas, the much shorter film, continues to deal with the work and its consequences, while Casino really delves into its characters as they lose themselves. Casino is certainly a character driven narrative (one could argue Goodfellas is instead a plot driven narrative made perfect by its characters). Our leading trio, the aforementioned males and Sharon Stone in a masterful portrayal of an enigmatic, destructive hustler, all inflate their egos with a deluded conviction of the correctness of their respective visions. In part because of being the lead, and in part as the least destructive character, De Niro's 'Ace' comes off best to the audience, but all are afflicted by delusions of grandeur and greed.The film juggles the character's conflicts and growths well within the three hour film, which is itself a gorgeous depiction of the 'classical' period of Vegas' history, lamented as a relic today. The design, the visuals, the mood feels a different time, and is arguably Scorsese's most well-realised world. The soundtrack adds further to that. And Scorsese's direction is on top form, as is expected, and one finds it difficult to forget Scorsese's masterful hand guiding the film.In terms of the performances of the leads, while De Niro is undeniably excellent, he is really the base from which the other two launch. Joe Pesci is at his very best here, surpassing Raging Bull and Goodfellas, and while the role is essentially a retread of the latter, it's expanded, deeper, and thematically goes with the film; the character is still a wild-card, but not nearly as much as a black sheep. His ego, his desire, they fuel him. Sharon Stone rounds it off, deserving of her Academy Award nom, providing a physical manifestation of Vegas: the money, the excess, the greed, the lure of self-destruction. Her relationship with De Niro is the core of the film.The film is certainly excellent. And one tries not to compare it too much to other Scorsese films, especially Goodfellas. Yet its unavoidable when considering their similarity in theme, style and even cast &amp; crew. Casino basks in its own excesses more than necessary- the length particularly. And it does many things right, but nothing much new. It's Scorsese at his most derivative of self, with the possible exception of being one of the few of his notable films to portray a strong leading woman (who is an independent character of herself) alongside the many men. The film is almost lazy in its unoriginality. And unfortunately it never matches the memorability of, say, Goodfellas.Nonetheless, Scorsese is on top form, with a fantastic setting and cast, and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Today, it looks like Disneyland."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese have gained a lot of respect and power through his films. Ranging from Taxi Driver to Goodfellas, his career have spawned one magnificent movie after another. His films are powerful, violent, well-crafted, well-directed and well-written. You can also say that in a lot of his films, there's a sense of ambition. In the case with Casino, it qualifies as another great piece of film-making from him.The story begins in 1973, where Sam "Ace" Rothstein, (Robert De Niro), is sent to Las Vegas to run the teamsters-funded casino called The Tangiers. In the Tangiers, the mafia controls every aspect of activity. Sam becomes the boss of the casino, giving him full responsibility to run it. His best friend, Nicky, (Joe Pesci), is also involved with Sam's business of running the casino, giving Sam all the protection he needs. But, when a woman walks into Sam's life while playing on the craps table and also causing a disruption, he spots his eyes her. The girl's name is Ginger (Sharon Stone). Soon enough, Sam and Ginger get married. But, what Sam doesn't know is that Ginger is a prostitute and her unfaithful actions to him comes from her long-time pimp, Lester (James Woods). When Sam finds out about Lester, he takes matter into his own hands. As the film progresses, Sam's dreams are shattered when he starts to lose control of his casino empire and everything becomes too complicated to handle or bear.The photography is very well done and it creates a sense of vibrant to the world of Las Vegas. Furthermore, Scorsese shows us how the casino operation works. There's one scene in the movie where Nicky narrates about what goes on in a specific room called the "Count Room." In the Count Room, casino managers count up all of the money that is collected from the players. It turns that the mob controls the casino and Rothstein is calling the shots. But, as the movie progresses, I felt that the film turn into a "How to" movie, where the viewer learns a thing or two about mob operations in Las Vegas.There are other parts in Casino that I really like. Another criticism that I have is the relationship between Sam and his wife, Ginger. In this relationship, we see that Sam really love her, yet what he doesn't know is that Ginger doesn't love him. Sam, as a person wants to do right and set certain things right because he wants them to be this way. However, in the case of his relationship with Ginger, he is trying to help her get over her drug addiction. But, like the casino business, he can't seem to control her, and therefore, the result is very fatal and destructive.Another thing that Sam can't control is his relationship with Nicky. Just like his wife and his casino managing, Nicky is a giant complication to Sam. He's out of control and throughout the entire movie, we see Nicky getting more and more arrogant about setting up his part in Las Vegas. That proves to be too much for Sam because he doesn't want Nicky get out of control. As a result, Nicky is becomes his own enemy toward the mob and that, his fate is ill-fated.What Scorsese does in this movie and also with Goodfellas is that the mafia world is being used as a crutch and that the main character of both films set their standards toward the mob. Yet, even though his promises are convincing, they are really not what they seem to be. In other words, what one would warned to another, another does the impossible. In Goodfellas, Henry Hill is told by Jimmy Conway to never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut. In the end of Goodfellas, that promise is broken, yet there is a sense of resentment and regret. In Casino, the characters are all infatuated by what goes in Las Vegas. It's almost as if Scorsese change the location from New York to Las Vegas. All the performances in Casino are astounding. Robert De Niro is excellent as Sam Rothstein, the man who wants everything done, but can never predict the problems that he has to face. Sharon Stone gives, I think, an Oscar-nominated performance as Ginger. This performance proves that Stone can act under so much pressure and destruction that creates her character to be convincing. Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his performance in Goodfellas, is effective as Nicky. Some people would say that Pesci is playing in the same field as in Goodfellas. But, Pesci is playing a character here. A character would can snap if he is push too far. All three performances really hold the movie together and all three should be given a certain amount of respect to their characters.Scorsese continues to make movies after Casino, with other future works like The Departed and Gangs of New York. But, Casino is his second boldest. I say that because his latest film, The Wolf of Wall Street, is probably his most boldest yet. With the evidence of Casino, he really scores high with this masterpiece. He captures the life and glamor of Las Vegas life, yet I have to say that this film and Leaving Las Vegas really brings us to the world of Sin City, where the bright and shining lights are covered behind a sense of toughness and crime. Another film that failed to live up to Casino or Leaving Las Vegas is Showgirls, which fails to capture the toughness of being in Las Vegas. Casino is bold, bloody and brilliant and its ambition takes us deep into the heart and crime of Sin City. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps The Best Gangster Film I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to give a bit of background, I thought I'd start by explaining what it actually takes for me to score a film 10/10, because at this point the top score on here has lost a lot of it's significance. Not that this is a serious issue obviously, but I thought I should open by stating exactly how good I think a film should be in order for it to justify a rating like that, and hopefully in doing so the point will be put across as to how highly I rate this film.For me, a 10/10 film is a film whereby not only each and every facet of is at least of a very high standard, but one that is so good that there is literally no single aspect of it that stands out as being even marginally weak, whether that be the acting performance of a character, a particular scene/section of the film, the dialogue or any other aspect that could be picked up on. Right from the off, the film must set a standard and a tone and keep on that course so as to at least remain within the same bracket of quality, whilst also excelling in every possible aspect along the way. Any deviation from this path represents an imperfection in terms of the way the film is balanced, and as such will prevent a perfect 10/10 score from being given.Given this criteria, take The Godfather as an example: a timeless masterpiece that is rightfully held up as one of the greatest films of all time. The acting is sublime, the plot is compelling and the characters are all well fashioned. Despite these strengths however, Michael's development at the start is not handled with the same precision and quality as the rest of the film in my opinion. It stands out as being more rushed and less carefully crafted when measured against the rest of the film, and I felt the opening stages were in need of a couple more scenes to bridge the early phases of the transformation with what followed. This stood out for me in context of the quality of the rest of the film, and I would therefore deduct half a point on that basis. The difference in quality here is enough for me to call it a sizable imperfection in a relative sense.Another example to use is Once Upon A Time In America, which is sometimes labelled 'the best gangster movie ever made', with people highlighting the exceptional plot and the wonderful soundtrack by Ennio Morrocone. These are, of course, valid points - the music is amongst some of the finest ever made for film, and the plot is as absorbing as it is complex. That being said, the acting is considerably lower across the board than in other classics in similar genres (Goodfellas, Godfather I and II, City of God, etc), and the score is often applied over-indulgently: the melodies of Deborah's theme and the main theme for example are destroyed by the end of the film, and scenes are sometimes made to seem exaggerated and jarring as a result. On top of that, there are occasions whereby these beautiful melodies are highly inappropriate, with one particular rendition actually making me laugh loud because of how bizarre it was (hint: the Cleopatra part of the film, after the...incident...in the car).For those reasons, despite it's strengths, that film is an 8/8/5 for me. Very good, but there are too many imperfections and imbalances.Anyway, I give that brief analysis of those two up there in order to illustrate my view that there are no literally no such relative imperfections and imbalances to point out with Casino. The film starts off well paced and sharp, and from the very offset it maintains an extremely high standard of acting, storytelling and pacing throughout.Even nitpicking, I cannot think of a single weakness, and on top of that the strengths are seriously strong. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, as usual, are fantastic in their roles, and I honestly can't remember ever seeing anyone play a character like Sharon Stone plays in this so well. For all the right reasons, she made me feel hateful, angry and unpleasant. I cowered and cringed because of how well it was acted, and I spent most of the time watching her thinking about how much I wanted her character to meet a horrible, yet just ending.Seriously... this film is a must-watch. There are a lot of unfair, unfavourable comparisons to Goodfellas in here, but I honestly think this is better. Does Goodfellas keep up the same standard of plot like this does throughout? I don't think so personally - the closing scenes are slower and weaker, where as Casino maintains an extremely high level, delivering accordingly right at the end. The ending is satisfying (for whatever reason - no spoilers here), and the tension that has been built up throughout is sufficiently capitalised on. Goodfellas, on the other hand, more peters out by comparison.That is obviously is not to criticise Goodfellas - as a film that's about as close to 10 as you can get without it being 10 in my opinion. It's just that Casino is better paced, more consistent and more complex and nuanced in its plot. As well as this, it gains from the greater emphasis on De Niro and Pesci, who both play superior, more fleshed out characters in this. The combination of these two and Sharon Stone in conjunction with this plot makes for an absolute masterpiece, and I highly recommend this film to anyone with even a passing interest in film and Scorsese. I was in awe of it throughout and think that, alongside Raging Bull, it's probably the most underrated film I've come across so far on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though "Casino" is not Scorsese's strongest hour, its vision of what mob-run casinos would be like is creative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After bringing us the 1990 hit crime drama "GoodFellas", critically acclaimed director Martin Scorsese, author/screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, and stars Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci team up again for another crime drama five years later called "Casino". What's interesting about "Casino" is that it's basically "GoodFellas" all over again only set in Las Vegas. It's a good thing no one came up with the idea of naming this film "GoodFellas in Las Vegas", since it would make it all the more obvious to us that they're trying to recreate the same movie. That being said, does the fact that "Casino" bares countless similarities to "GoodFellas" make it bad? Not at all. It's simply a way of summarizing the movie in a nutshell. "Casino" tells the story of a Mafia member named Sam Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) who is sent to Las Vegas to run a casino funded by the Mafia on behalf of mob families living in the Midwest. His friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is also eventually sent to Las Vegas to watch his back. The main reason they are both there is to oversee the casino operations which largely centers on illegal activity. Basically, the Mafia has rigged the casino so that none of the customers win anything, and they make millions of dollars off of their money without the customers knowing a thing about it. Essentially, Sam and Nicky are there to make sure that their "skim" goes according to plan. But all of that changes however when a fellow hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) enters their lives and eventually interferes with their business to the point where there's no way they could possibly fix whatever costly mistakes erupt. The first couple minutes of "Casino", when we're being introduced to the process of how these Mafia-ruled casinos work, are arguably where the most fascinating parts of the picture reside. We not only learn that the scamming this casino gets away with on a regular basis is supposedly normal, but we're also given the scary conclusion that wasting money on gambling is the main reason people go to Las Vegas in the first place. It makes people who haven't been to Las Vegas before question whether or not they want to go out of their way to a city in the middle of a desert just to lose vast sums of money. I know that it wouldn't be a town I'd want to go to yet based on what I've seen here. So I thought "Casino" had a fairly strong introduction based on the kind of world it was introducing us to. The rest of the film was pretty decent with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci turning in strong acting just like they did with "GoodFellas". However, I felt that most of the main narrative wasn't as compelling or focused as I wanted it to be. The storytelling simply felt a little fragmented for my taste, and the love story between DeNiro and Stone doesn't help with that either. For the record, I respect that the love story does contribute to the events that take place in the film's second half. Also, Roger Ebert's comments on how different this love story is compared with the love stories in Martin Scorsese's previous works are justified to a certain degree. Regardless, the love story didn't do much for me at all and I think a crucial reason for that is Sharon Stone. I don't think I've seen much of her work and the ones that I do recall seeing aside from this film are "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct", and "Antz". In my opinion, from what I've seen, she looks physically great, but her acting is too over-the-top for my liking. I'm having trouble placing my finger on it, but something about her acting just seems inappropriate for the movies she stars in. While I acknowledge that some of her roles including this one require her to be very dramatic, she has the distinction of being too childishly over dramatic that she ends up feeling way out of place in her films, this one included. While I still think Joe Pesci acts out his role reasonably well here, his role is maybe too identical to his work in "GoodFellas". And although I do feel that the story does lose focus around the halfway point, for some reason, I still find "Casino" watchable enough for me to recommend it overall. And again, this is mainly because of the theories this film shows us regarding how a mob-run casino would operate. There's a well-directed scene involving the casino managers asking a customer to leave because he is placing his feet on the casino tables. Without revealing too much, the payoff of this scene isn't quite what you'd expect at first. The same thing could be said for another scene involving the casino managers dealing with someone who is maybe having too good a day at their casino. If that scene doesn't scare you off from playing and winning too much at a casino, I don't know what will. If you're looking for a story and characters that will impact you the same way Scorsese's earlier films like "GoodFellas" did, you might be disappointed by what "Casino" offers. However, if you're looking for a picture with a fascinating premise that introduces creative theories along the way and will settle for something that is at least watchable, then I think you'll like this film fine enough. As for me, though I don't think "Casino" ranks among Scorsese's best by a good bit and I probably don't have that much interest in looking at it again, I was satisfied enough with seeing it once. Like Las Vegas itself, approach at your own financial risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made And One Of The Greatest Gangster Films Ever Made. Another Scorsese Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's Casino is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest Gangster films ever made that's filled with brilliant direction,excellent acting and a great Rock N' Roll soundtrack making this film another Scorsese classic,one of his best films and one of my all time favorite films.Set in Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s and based on a true story,Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein(Robert De Niro),an expert gambler connected to Gangsters and because of his success he is asked by the Mob to run the Tangiers,one of the biggest Casinos in Las Vegas and help steal money for the Mob. While in Vegas he marries hooker and hustler Ginger(Sharon Stone)and receives help from friend and gangster Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci). But as time goes on Ace,Ginger and Nicky discovers that their successes will lead to violence,death and betrayal and know that no one stay's on top forever.Released in 1995,Casino surprising received a mixed reception among critics and one of the criticisms of Casino is that the film was too similar to Scorsese's earlier Gangster film Goodfellas. But,thanks to showings on Cable TV,Home Video and DVD sales Casino has now been regarded as as a classic and one of Scorsese's best films and it's rightfully deserved. If Goodfellas was about the rise and fall of a New York Gangster then Casino is about the rise and fall of a empire. With Casino,Scorsese gives viewers a big and violent epic gangster film and shows viewers a different side of Las Vegas that most people probably already knew about but not many have seen where the city of LV is being secretly controlled by the Mob and where money and violence rule the glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. Casino is in many ways a tragic film where the characters in the film have success and money but there are many things that happen in the film mess up their own empire and value because when you listen to most of the narration in the film you feel like the characters are looking back at their past with regret and wishing they would have done something different. The rise and fall in this film is almost like a Shakespere play. One of the things that I always loved about Casino is the cinematography because Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson gives the film a beautiful and stylish look where the colors of the suits and production design just come off the screen and hit you in the eye. Scorsese cleverly tricks viewers with the beauty of the film and almost makes viewers forget about the violence and death that is in the air. The photography is one of the things that is different from Goodfellas because where Goodfellas seem more gritty and dirty,Casino is almost like Goodfellas glamorous and flamboyant little brother in comparison. The three main characters Ace,Ginger and Nicky,like in most of Scorsese films aren't always the most likable but have levels of depth and dimension that each characters shows throughout the film when things are happening around them whether it's buy their own doing with Aces' pride and ego,Ginger's troubled past and present,Nicky's violence or by someone else. You don't always like the main characters,but you don't hate them either. Although Casino is nearly three hours long the film moves at a quick pace and there isn't a wasted scene in the film. It's one of fastest near three hours you will ever watch. The violence in the film is bloody and deadly and Scorsese does not compromise or tone it down one bit showing what it's like when you're in the crime world. The violence in the film is so disgusting that you will never want to gamble or go to Las Vegas. Casino did for gambling and going to Las Vegas what Jaws did for swimming in the water. The ending of the film is great because it is a combination of violence,brutality and sadness which pretty much hangs over the course of the film and it is a classic Scorsese ending.The whole cast does great in their roles. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein,with De Niro bringing depth and intensity to the performance. Sharon Stone earned an Oscar nod for her powerful,sexy and fiery performance as Ginger,a hooker Ace falls for. Stone has great scenes with both De Niro and Pesci. Joe Pesci is brilliant,funny and volatile as Nicky Santoro,with Pesci stealing every scene he's in. James Woods is great in his role as Ginger's pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond. Frank Vincent is wonderful as Frank Marino,Nicky's right hand man. Pasguale Cajano is fantastic as Remi Gaggi,a top Mob boss. Alan King is great and memorable as Andy Stone,a head of the Teamsters. Kevin Pollock is Wonderful and smooth as Phillip Green. Don Rickles(Billy Sherbert),L.Q Jonesz(Pat Webb),John Bloom(Don Ward),Dick Smothers(Senator),Vinny Vella(Artie Piscano)and Phillip Suriano(Dominick Santoro)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Scorsese is brilliant and masterful,with Scorsese giving a big,epic feel to the film with powerful atmosphere and is always moving the camera and using great angles. Great direction by Scorsese.The film has an amazing soundtrack with songs by The Rolling Stones(Gimmie Shelter,Can you Hear Me Knocking,Heart Of Stone,(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,Sweet Virginia.),Devo(Whip It,(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction(Devo cover),The Moody Blues(Nights In White Satin),The Animals(House Of The Rising Sun),Fleetwood Mac(You Can Go Your Own Way),Rod Stewart(I Ain't Superstitious),B.B King(The Thrill Is Gone),Brenda Lee(I'M Sorry),Little Richard(Slippin' and Slidin'),Cream(Toad,Those Were The Days),Dean Martin(You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You) and more great songs. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Martin Scorsese,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas,Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci or Sharon Stone,I highly suggest you see Casino an unforgettable and powerful Gangster and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino (1995) Though Casino is not my favorite Martin Scorsese film, it is still one of his best films and of the best films ever made. Casino is intriguing, entertaining, and brutal.Casino is a somewhat long film but very easy to watch. It stays interesting the entire time and never really slows. It's a bit different than your average gangster film, concentrating somewhat more on the characters themselves than their business.To pick a favorite part of the film is kind of hard. Martin Scorsese's directing, and both Robert Deniro and Joe Peschi's roles are all fantastic. Scorsese does great with this film, and even though he has done many similar movies, this one is still fresh and new. Deniro seemingly plays the same role he usually does but it's a much deeper role than most, one of his best performances ever. Peschi on the other hand is definitely at his best, he is so intense he almost steals the film.Casino is a brutal and intense look at organized crime and Las Vegas, sometimes even hard to watch due to the violence in some scenes. It is one of the greatest films ever. Although some people know it best as the film that uses the "F" word more than any other, it should definitely be remembered for directing, acting, writing, etc, more than anything else. It is truly a masterpiece.The film will most likely be loved by anyone who watches it, as long as they don't have a short attention span. Any fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci, or Stone must watch this film. A modern classic that isn't going anywhere.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Gamble Needed, Casino Wins the Bet of Favorite Scorsese Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every scene, a thrill. Every shot, a beauty. Every line, a breath-taker. Scorsese's films are masterpieces and Casino is too. I've called Casino a masterpiece since I was seven hard to believe because I saw about half of it when I was younger and loved the look and feel of it all. Now seeing the whole thing again seven years later I love it and call it my favorite Scorsese film. A lot of people choose Goodfellas over this, but Im the opposite, I think Goodfellas was a great mobster movie and a real life look at the 50s Mafia, but I just love Casino for everything it is.The three main actors De Niro, Pesci, and Stone have all outdone themselves here. This is the best work for all three of them individually. They play their roles with power and serve a unique purpose. Without De Niro, the narrations wouldn't have the same effect and be less powerful. Without Pesci, there would be no Italian to swear as good as him. He swears with meaning and makes you fear him when he steps on screen. His cutthroat, no BS attitude is what stands out on screen. Just like the quote said by Robert Di Nero.Having heard that I repeated it to myself numerous times to get the full effect. It was one of the most powerful quotes in movie history to me. Last, but far from least, is Sharron Stone's portrayal of Ginger McKenna Rothstein. She takes the role in full effect by strutting her gorgeous self in front of the camera with every shot of her being a slick one. Her attitude the whole movie really sticks with you and the fights her and De Niro have are very shocking, yet powerful at the same time. Its a feeling, I've only got from this film.The plot is true and is about Sam "Aces" Rothstein (De Niro) working as a bookie at the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He takes his job beyond seriously and is usually caught in the minx of everything. His goal is to double Casino profits which is then skimmed by the Mafia which is then reported to the tax agencies. Whatever he bets on, he wins, thats that. He has never made a bet he wasn't sure he was going to win. Hes a smart guy and has never done a bet wrong. He is constantly bothered and put at risk when his buddy Nicky Santoro (Pesci, character based on the real life Anthony Spilotro) is sent to Vegas to assist Same, but winds up antagonizing all the casino members and his brash language and overall personality gets his name in a Black Book which lead to him banned from every casino in Vegas.Sam falls for the hooker and hustler Ginger McKenna (Stone) who he winds up having a child with and marrying. He gives Ginger his trust and puts her jewelry, and $2,000,000 cash money in a bank in which she can only access. Sam regrets it deeply when Ginger is still sneaking around with her ex con boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Their marriage soon crumbles, leading her to a strict and pervasive drug addiction with only Nicky to to.I don't want to go in full detail because the movie does have various surprises including the end, which I saw when I was seven and has traumatized me since. Seeing it again didn't have the same effect, but still scared me for life. This time, I cant say it's just a movie. This honestly happened. The events in this movie really happened and thanks to Scorsese is taken in a serious approach with characters that are in depth and to the point. Nobody but Scorsese could have done this movie. It is a true beauty and shouldn't be taken for granted.I play poker with my friend Mike using fake chips and having no real money involved. It something we do to pass the time. After seeing this movie it almost makes me not want to touch a card or chip again. Sure just playing slots, poker, Blackjack, Roulette, or any poker game wont put you in the position of Nicky, but it makes you think how much hot water these guys really sunk in. This is a job that depends on life or death and is not something I'd ever think to do. Money is one thing, risk is another.The movie is often shown on networks like Bravo and much of it has to be cut out because the f word is said exactly 422 times in three hours. Also because of the drugs and violence about thirty minutes is trimmed out too. My opinion is if this isn't shown in the raw, it shouldn't be shown at all. Profanity is common in this movie, but it shows you how strict Italians got. Various racial terms toward Muslims and Jewish people were brought up. Without the feeling or tense and frustration inside these people the movie is bland. It needs to have profanity to be true to the story of mobsters and gamblers. As well as the violence. Its jam packed with violence, but it needs to be there to show the full aspect. Without it, its tame and false.Casino is a genuine film that maybe overshadowed by Goodfellas and Raging Bull, but to me it's a one of a kind, gambling masterpiece with a four star cast, a four star plot, and a four star feeling after watching it. It has the rare effect of after watching it you feel like you lived it. A true masterpiece in the film industry and Scorsese's best film.Starring: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Sharron Stone, James Woods,, Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, and Alan King.

		<fullReview>"A lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes."I learned three things from Casino: running a casino is a tough business, Las Vegas is a complicated town, and a terrible wife makes life much harder.&nbsp;Casino is a lengthy movie about the rise and fall of a couple of Vegas big-shots, and &nbsp;the loss of the essence of old-school Vegas, itself. The story is told primarily from the points of view of Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niero) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), two guys who have known each other for years, and come to make money in Vegas in very different ways.Sam is a genius at all aspects of gambling that's tapped by the mob bosses back east to run a casino for them, while Nicky is a muscle guy who's there to protect Sam's operation. We watch them make a lot of money, and get into a lot of trouble because of their respective weaknesses/excesses. It's an entertaining movie, and the 179 minute runtime will pass by pretty quickly.Both De Niro and Pesci were excellent, with many other great actors supporting their performances. A lot of your enjoyment of this movie will hinge on your preference for the genre. Casino is very much a mob-type movie, though it's not a Godfather Part II Las Vegas re-tread, by any means. If even someone like me who's not a particular fan of this kind of movie can enjoy it, then that's a promising sign that most others will enjoy it, too. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino was a cool movie. I liked it because it didn't follow traditional lines of storytelling. It's almost like director Martin Scorsese keeps wanting to make "non-poetic" gangster movies as a rebuke to the Godfather. perhaps not. But his gangster movies are always "realer". And less likable. All the more reason as to why I enjoyed this movie very much.Dinero as usual gives and outstanding performance. As do Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone and James Woods. Don Rickles steals the movie. There is great tragedy on this comic's face. The Voice Over narration works well in this movie and I was interested in it all the way through. The songs also kept me interested. Where do they get all of these old songs? it was really great. The editing and pacing kept it moving very fast, but not so fast that you couldn't easily follow the story line.It's violent, sou you would want to warn any youngsters before you watch it with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangster Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 90's, Martin Scorsese directed two great rags to riches to rags again gangster movies. The first was 1990's "Goodfellas". The second was 1995's "Casino". Both movies are based on books by Nicolas Pileggi, and screenplays written both by Pileggi and Scorsese. The movie takes an excellent look inside the old Las Vegas when gangsters ran it. Robert De Niro is in top form as Ace, the main character that works his way up in Vegas. Joe Pesci is also excellent as Nicky, who seems to be a somewhat toned down version of his character Tommy from "Goodfellas". This is Pesci's best work to date. Sharon Stone, James Woods, Kevin Pollack, Alan King, Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, L.Q. Jones, and Dick Smothers round up the excellent support cast. The soundtrack to the movie is one of the best assembled. Robert Richardson, who did a majority of Oliver Stone films, does an excellent job at cinematography in his first Scorsese film. Scorsese regular Thelma Schoonmaker does another excellent job of film editing.This film, along with "Goodfellas" and "Blow" deliver the time old theme of becoming powerful, and then losing it all. I've always believed these movies are excellent at showing this theme way better than some films, especially Brian De Palma's version of "Scarface" (even though Al Pacino is excellent). After you watch "Goodfellas" watch this film right away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pure GOLD!DeNiro and Pesci were amazing together, and the whole story was perfectly written. I think if you haven't seen this movie then you are overlooking one of the best movies ever made.This movie is all the way up there with Goodfellas, Scarface, Carlitos way, and of course Godfather. Casino is unique in that its probably the first gangster movie that focuses on gambling. Pesci was extremely funny, yet assertive in this, and Deniro was brilliant. I have watched this movie over 10 times and still cant get enough. Sharon Stone was also great in the role she was born to play. I gave this film a 10/10. Those who loved the films recommended above will definitely not be disappointed. If you are one of those people that focus on the musical aspect of the movie, you will not be disappointed, as the soundtrack delivers one of the most influential songs of the century!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas revisited ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone seen Goodfellas? You know ... gangsters, violence, long story, Joe Pesci being a complete and utter maniac? Well, save your bucks. In a nutshell, CASINO is a total replica of a very good film. I'm not saying it's not good. It's just a replica.Sam Rothstein (De Niro) is the man; a gambling genius who (his Jewishness holding him back) becomes THE man in Las Vegas. The problem is that he isn't a made guy cosa-nostra-wise. Doh!! If only he had an Italian background, so many lives could have been spared. As it happens, the Vegas mob bosses insist on Mr. Pesci being there to 'take care' of business. In other words, sadistically maim any idiot who messes with our Sam's good business. Watch out particularly for the 'hammer from nowhere' and Joe's novel use of a Black and Decker workmate which will, guaranteed, bring water to the eyes.Much is made of Sharon Stone's tour de force in this movie as Ginger, Sam's moll. It's definitely a cut above her previous acting credits (who remembers Sliver? answers on a postcard) but at the end of the day, it comes down to her being given a decent script for once, and the chance to ham it up for all she's worth. If screaming and ranting on coke guarantees you plaudits, fair play. Worth a nomination? OK. The Oscar itself? Please.Scorsese is the best director around for this kind of film. You will come out of the cinema saying "Wow", "Yipes", "Cool" etc. Even after a good three hours. No arguments - it is hard hitting and scary. BUT Martin - it's been done before. By you. And with Goodfellas, it was so much more original and, basically, better. De Niro, Pesci and Liotta were seminal. Replace Liotta with Stone, and it's only semi-seminal.Casino will appeal to those who love a good shoot-up, blood and guts and plenty of actors yelling at each other. You will get value for your video rental, if that's what you're after.Let's face it - three hours! But if you want better value, hire out Goodfellas again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters in Casino are greedy and seedy crooks with hardly any good in them whatsoever. But with that said, the story (which is almost 3 darn hours long) moves in such a brilliant pace that you can put up with them. As expected, the acting by Pesci, De Niro, Stone, &amp; Woods is great, but unbelievably every minor character in the film is also on the ball. But, alas, this is a Scorcese film, and as usual it is done to perfection. The camera angles and the cinematography of old Vegas is awesome. This film captures a piece of American history albeit a grimy part of it. I am not a huge fan of mob films nor am I all that interested in Las Vegas, but I was drawn into this story.

		<fullReview>"Casino" explodes onto the screen like Martin Scorsese doing an overblown riff of a Martin Scorsese film. All of his hallmarks are here in spades as he weaves his epic and vividly detailed saga of organized crime in Las Vegas. Much of the style here is over-the-top, and when you combine that with three brand-name movie stars (DeNiro almost hilariously subdued here, Sharon Stone at the pinnacle of her appeal and showing an amazing range here as DeNiro's gold digging drug addicted wife, and an insane Joe Pesci doing a gonzo take on an insane Joe Pesci) acting to within inches of their lives, you get a wildly entertaining albeit over long three hour ride. Toss in some scenery chewing from Don Rickles, James Woods, and that hilarious Italian grandmother (Scorsese's real life mother) in the butcher shop, and you can't lose. However, when the central conceit of the movie is to explore the criminal underbelly of a city that legally peddles crime and sleaze as entertainment, "Casino" ultimately seems a bit redundant.</fullReview>

I'm not a big fan on gangster/mafia films (only a few exceptions), but this transcends my personal biases. The acting is phenomenal. De Niro, Stone and Pesci are perfectly cast and deliver performances with depth that is rarely seen on the big screen. Scorsese crafts this film with all of his usual intensity and the result is a masterpiece that certainly doesn't feel three hours long!

		<fullReview>I love Casino especially if I watch it from the beginning. Robert DeNiro should have won an Academy AWard for this performance along with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nicky's friendship is the crutch of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily surpasses Godfather and Goodfellas. The story is written very carefully and presented beautifully, with perfect narratives and dialogue throughout the movie.The characters are quite complex and display much depth, played by actors that live and breathe for these roles. Robert De Niro couldn't have been better; even though he plays similar characters in flawlessly in many other movies, this one hit the jackpot. Sharon Stone's performance is exceptional, especially during the end of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised if she really was on drugs just for the movie. Joe Pesci hits the same note as De Niro -the highest one. Like De Niro, he plays similar characters in other movies, but in this movie it fits in with the other characters and the story so obviously, it wouldn't have been the same without him, nor his character. Like all other mafia-type movies De Niro and Pesci have been in, their characters, in contrast, portray a wide spectrum of opposite attitude, feelings, and motivation that is simply entertaining to watch.In a style parallel to "Goodfellas" that's become the signature of Martin Scorsese, this movie might seem like just a repetitive sequel set in Las Vegas. But don't be fooled, this film is as underrated as Titanic is/was overrated, whether you judge by popularity, box office gross, or critics' ratings (or even IMDb's present user rating). Casino is a masterpiece and will not disappoint keen viewers.</fullReview>

Scorsese really pulls out the stops. The three-ring storyline is engrossing. And the casting might be the best I've ever seen ,especially the Remo character who's method-acting/ non-acting helps steal every scene he's in.

Once again partnering with the incomparable Robert De Niro and another of his favorite collaborators, Joe Pesci, he once again elicits superb performances. He also gets Sharon Stone to give the best performance of her career. The fact that the very talented James Woods would sign on to be the fourth wheel is a testement to Scorcse's reputation. Even Don Rickles adds something. He has an expression that if you mess with Ace, dire consequences will ensue. Great story, great attention to detail (eg. the spy plane running out of fuel), incredible acting = Sorcese masterpiece, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening 30 minutes or so of "Casino" embodies everything that I adore about pre-21st century Martin Scorsese cinema, most particularly the excellent craftsmanship he seems to have lost his grip in on recent years. As the picture begins, we get this fabulous quasi-documentary narrative with Robert De Niro, as the film's protagonist?nobody with any sense of morality can call a mob figure a hero?providing us all the details. What he's been given to say is fascinating, and the way Scorsese coordinates his camera is superb. The technique is pure, the edits are crisp and clean (there are none of those horrendous, in-your-face jump cuts that stabbed his 2006 film "The Departed" clean through the heart), and the amount of detailed information presented in an entertaining way. Scorsese and his co-screenwriter, Nicolas Pileggi, both of whom collaborated on the 1990 gangster masterpiece "GoodFellas," are certainly to be commended as researchers. In this fabulous first half-hour, they know just when and where to tell us data about how the mob ran a Las Vegas casino and when to show us. They tell us who watches who during a big gambling night, and show us, in splendid detail, how to get rid of a cardsharp by giving him a bogus heart attack.Unfortunately, for me, once Sharon Stone, as a prostitute who sets the protagonist's heart aflame, enters the picture, everything begins to drag. This is not a negative reflection on Sharon Stone's performance. Not only is this her best piece of work that I'm aware of?I personally do not think she's untalented as an actress?but she gives the best performance of the entire movie. There isn't a bad performance, really, but she does dominate everybody else in "Casino." So it's not her acting that wears out the movie for me; it's the pretentious and uninteresting melodrama that follows in her tracks.The pseudo-romantic dynamic between De Niro and Stone is, at heart, just an old-fashioned gangster-and-his-moll story, with the feisty woman first being pushed around, then pushing back, standing up to the boyfriend with the gun. Why does this dynamic go wrong? Because the screenplay tries to make something monumentally important out of it all. It tries to go deep, explore the psyches of both characters, takes them out of the casino and into the deserts and apartments of Las Vegas, and attempts to bring a psychologically fascinating angle to their relationship. Here, it completely falls apart, and the remaining two and a half hours of the movie?the middle in particularly?really begins to drag. The other problem with this relationship is that De Niro's character is not interesting when the movie tries to explore his depth as a person. He's much more interesting in the old-fashioned personality of the 'rough-and-touch, silent but deadly' casino manager who, save for his cameras, supervises everything that goes in his establishment. Once he gets all mucky and muggy with Stone, the fascination is wiped clean from the slate. As was my ability to stay interested.I wish that "Casino" had stayed inside the casinos and not gone into the deserts, apartments, swamps, of outer Las Vegas. For me, the heart of the movie was contained in that big, luxurious building with the omnipresent colors. And I do not see why the movie could not have just stayed there and told its story from that setting, venturing outside only when necessary. Obviously, it's based on true events, but since the true events, as told on screen, become this dull, what's the point? Even Joe Pesci, essentially repeating his performance from "GoodFellas," seems to have little purpose outside the casino. There's some promising sequences with him forcing De Niro to come down in the middle of the night to get him fifty million-dollar chips for a gambling rage, but, once again, once the story leaves the casino and starts getting involved with all the other stuff, it goes downhill.But to the filmmakers' credit, having Pesci narrate part of the story does make his denouement all the more surprising. I will not give away exactly what happens, but the way things unfold toward the end, with Pesci's narration almost completely eradicating De Niro's, really does leave the audience unexpected for what eventually turns out. It's a brilliant touch.I admired the physical production values of "Casino" as much as any great-looking movie I've ever seen, and Scorsese's flair as a director is very impressive. But even though the technique is pure, the storytelling seems half-baked and uninterested in itself. And that's the coldest feeling a movie can possibly give you. Whether it's representational or not, when you get the notion that the filmmaker lost interest in the story he was telling, it's all for nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have said that this was Goodfellas on a grander scale, and in many ways they're correct, but this isn't detrimental to the movie. The story is a fascinating look at how one of the most iconic cities came to be and how the influence and money of the Mafia built the world famous Las Vegas strip, how the Mafia's empire in Vegas came to be and in the end how (and in some cases literally) it came crashing down. The use of narration is well done and the acting is simply brilliant, Robert De Niro is in top form as the flamboyant bookmaker turned casino manager Sam 'Ace' Rothstein whose tyrannical no nonsense management style would contribute to his downfall. Joe Pesci picks up from where he left off in Goodfellas playing psychotic enforcer Nicky Santorio brilliantly whose violent temper ends up bringing trouble to just about everyone he comes into contact with. L.Q. Jones turns in an underrated performance as the deceptive commissioner Pat Webb, whose easy going good ole boy exterior disguises his real power and influence. Likewise James Woods portrayal of the sleazy pimp Lester Diamond while brief was well done. Onto Frank Vincent and I couldn't help but think he got some satisfaction over getting his own back on Joe Pesci when near the end he does to him what Pesci did to his character in Goodfellas, I think its safe to say he enjoyed that. But the star of the show is Sharon Stone who turns in an outstanding performance as the prostitute turned hustler Ginger McKenna whose devotion to her former pimp boyfriend, her drinking and drug addictions and her reckless behaviour would end up leading to her ultimate demise, Stone put herself through the grinder for the movie, losing so much weight the production team were actually worried about her, changing her hair styles and the emotional outbursts which were done brilliantly, and Stone's performance as a result was Oscar worthy. The portrayal of the mob bosses was also very well done, particularly Pasquale Cajano as Remo Gaggi, who gave a convincing performance as a ruthless mob boss. The rest of the supporting cast were all solid, Kevin Pollak, Alan King, Don Rickles and Billy Allison all turned in fine performances. The movie has got some criticism for its level of violence and profanity but this is the world of organised crime which wasn't exactly known for its eloquence and for its gentleness when it came to 'taking care' of things, so a subtler approach wouldn't have been an accurate depiction of the people and the events the movie is based on. So for those fans of gangster movies and even for history lovers like me this movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story feels very engaging. How Martin Scorcese tells it makes the audience leave the movie screening feeling enlightened. I really like how the movie used so many narrations as a supporting way to help the scenes build up. Add that with the clever and dramatic visuals using camera trickery, you get the astonishing look at the crime scenes. Particularly, the scene where the con artist gets his hand smashed is really neatly done.It's actually simple trick using camera angle and mock props, but the movie used it in a sudden way that is guaranteed to pull your eyes to the screen. The acting work is also great. Robert DeNiro nicely depicts the cooler mafia while Joe Pesci repeats himself as the great actor of the ruthless kind of the mafia. Sharon Stone did well in balancing both men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Martin Scorsese Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be annoying for Martin Scorsese when people call Casino Goodfellas Part 2 and understandably so; Casino, though featuring both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, is completely a film of its own. Goodfellas was a study of the middle class gangsters of New York; Casino is about the middle class making it big. It is a far more ambitious film than Goodfellas, strangely more civilised and tamed because of the glamorous setting of Las Vegas, which is revealed to be so hollow and controlled by a group of corrupt old men.Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro), a Jewish casino manager in 1970s Las Vegas. It revolves around the system of the casinos and how ultimately you lose more money than you gain, but also his relationship with his childhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his wife, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). It flows so beautifully, describing in rich detail through the voice overs of De Niro and Pesci how the casino works. Casino is such a classy film, each shot packed with glamour and the plot fueled by a great soundtrack and sharp dialogue. There are so many memorable moments and essentially it serves so much less as a biopic than Goodfellas.The acting is first rate - De Niro shines in all 180 minutes, playing a flawed and possessive man, but one who is weighed down by his loyalties to friends. Joe Pesci is on top form as the reckless Nicky Santoro, a mob boss. His performance is similar to that of Goodfellas, but there is something more classy and swish about it. Sharon Stone would steal the show if it wasn't for De Niro and Pesci, as her performance is one of perfection. You will not know whether to pity, hate, or love her character. This is what makes Casino so great. The characters are so complex and human, they are totally believable and you will be ever curious of their ultimate fates.This character driven story will get better each time you watch it and flows like a river, every scene a classic in its own way. If you are a fan of Martin Scorsese, then Casino is a must have. Even if you're not a fan, Casino is by all means worth watching and an instant classic in the crime/thriller/drama genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately, a mafia film about mafia men's attempts to colonize an unfamiliar environment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is less of a film about casinos and gambling and more of a film about two mafia men's very different attempts to build a new life in Las Vegas or build a foothold mafia colony in Nevada.The casino and the gambling industry is simply a backdrop to the story - the film could've been about any other industry with little changes to the main story, which is the two men, almost completely disconnected from the mafia bosses, who run things their own way in a bizarro-land.It is a bizarro-land in that what's illegal is legal (gambling and bookies are legal), the businesses (casino houses) are very powerful and have their own muscle, there is no mafia presence (other than themselves), no street crime, no rival families or gangs, law enforcement is not as organized, a different kind of government/way of doing things/getting permits and licenses that they're used to, and how they adjust to this completely different environment.If one were to group mafia films into categories: beginnings of an organized crime family, rise/decline of a family, rise/decline of an individual member/boss of the family, wars between established families, and so on, this would be its own category of mafiosos in a completely unfamiliar environment.The film is long, but doesn't feel long. It's packed with story - the scenes are short, dialogue is to the point, it is filled with events. It is a long story condensed and cut down to almost 3 hours rather than a short story stretched with long panoramas, filler, story threads that go nowhere, mood scenes and such. There is no fat in the film and the story to footage ratio is almost 1:1 - you can't cut anything without affecting the story.It's a great film, not just for its time, but for all time. It's not the most original film, but how original can a mafia film be nowadays? It's not high on originality, but it's high on quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a mob-connected casino operator in Las Vegas, attempts a civilised lifestyle with his money-conditional wife, ex-lady of the night, Ginger. Nicky Santoro, a boyhood friend of Ace and now a Made-Man of the Mafia, arrives in town with an ambitious agenda of his own that soon disrupts Ace's life.....The thing about Casino is that almost everyone who thought Goodfellas was a masterpiece would undoubtedly have monumental expectations for this, what could be classed metaphorically, as a sequel.Well while it never reaches the dizzy heights or beautiful character arcs of Goodfellas, it's still a solid movie from Scorcese, and proof that he and De Niro were a the top of their games when they worked together.Even though it's almost three hours long, it's just unmissable cinema. For example, it was on TV the other night and I thought to myself 'I'll watch this for thirty minutes before I go to bed', but it's hypnotic cinematography and soundtrack made me stay until the end.De Niro is wonderful as usual, channelling a little of Jimmy Conway's attitude, but this time, Sam is a little more of a coward than before, and although he has good intentions for everyone, where money is involved, you can't please or trust anyone.Pesci surprisingly is the weak link in the film. I'm not saying he's no good, the man is a phenomenal actor, but here, he's literally doing his Tommy Devito character, and when you channel a character as memorable as that one, it's going to get noticed.........much like his face being pinned back to make his look younger.Stone gives the performance of her life as the insufferable Ginger, when an actress can give a performance where the audience has not an ounce of sympathy, or empathy for the character she's portraying, that's a job done blooming well. She deserved every award going that year, her Ginger is a poisonous, money hungry addict, evil to the bone.It's beautiful to look at, the desert confrontation between Sam and Nicky is insanely intense, but at the same time beautiful.The film follows the same narrative structure as Goodfellas had, the main character narrating the story, and certain songs depicting the year, which again is a weak point, because you just keep referring to that film.So all in all, it's a solid film, beautiful to look at, with a career best from Stone, but it feels like it's trying too much to be Goodfellas, which gives it a little air of desperation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scorsese Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese has a penchant for making great movies and he literally owns the gangster genre. Casino shows the life of the mobsters who run the casino and the elaborate measures that they take in order to avoid being arrested. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci star in this movie and both of them leave a mark by playing nuanced characters with great finesse. However, Sharon Stone, who plays Ginger, the wife of De Niro's character, is the one who steals the show with a crazy, tumultuous performance of a greedy woman who has gotten mixed up in drugs, alcohol, etc. and has lost control over herself. She has irresistible charm but her egoistic tendencies manage to get the better of her.The direction by Scorsese is highly energetic with constant camera movements, beautiful cinematography and a voice over that suits the movie. The first half, in particular, is highly entertaining as the audience is shown how a casino works. The movie is a tad bit too long clocking at almost 3 hours. As a result, it loses a bit of steam towards the end. If you cannot stomach violence, then this is not the movie for you. But, if you liked Goodfellas, you are going to love Casino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1983, Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) leaves his casino and gets blown up in his car. Ten years earlier, he's running Tangiers with money from questionable sources. The money is getting skimmed and delivered to Kansas City for the mob bosses. Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) is the manager. Andy Stone (Alan King) is the head of the teamsters and Phillip Green (Kevin Pollak) is the front man. Sam falls for con woman Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who has a weak spot for her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is his violent childhood best friend who comes out to Vegas and causes problems pushing his weight around.I'm not always good with narration. The constant narration could have thrown me off but it fits perfectly. This is simply Ace and Nicky teaching the audience the way of their world. De Niro and Pesci are terrific. Sharon Stone brings something different to this. The movie is stretched out a bit at 3 hours but it never loses the tension. Scorsese brings a real beauty to this Vegas landscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese makes fresh an old trick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy to forget Martin Scorsese's Casino, or to dismiss it as derivative from his previous works like Goodfellas. But in my honest opinion as a moviegoer, that would be a horrendous mistake. I had more fun with Casino than I have had with every Scorsese movie except Taxi Driver. Casino extends for almost three hours, but unlike Gangs of New York, it doesn't sprawl - every scene is necessary, interesting and well-done, from the first to the last. A great deal of Casino is exposition, but its good exposition - and enough interesting stuff happens during it that it is still a lot of fun to watch. The most distinctive element about Casino is the casting of Sharon Stone. She is simply superb as Ginger, with a remarkable range displayed throughout the film. Her debut scene is cheeky and flirtatious, and I was as hooked on her as DeNiro was. Throughout the film, she convincingly descends into alcoholism and substance abuse, and she more than holds her own in her many screaming fights with DeNiro.Casino reunites a lot of the elements of previous Scorsese films, as well as a lot of the elements, but it manages to bring a lot of fresh material to the table. The voice-over doesn't get distracting, and I loved in the final scene where Pesci's gets cut off just as Nicky's fate is revealed to the audience. Its almost as if the narration is coming from the future, and the future dies the second the hit men lay hands on him. The tracking shots, freeze frames and excessive violence are all here, but he uses them for a reason - because they're effective.The interesting element of the DeNiro/Pesci/Scorsese partnership is that between this film, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, the combination is always shaken up. In Raging Bull, DeNiro is the dominant to Pesci's submissive. In Goodfellas, they were more equal. Here, Pesci completely runs over DeNiro. The two guys are capable of such great things and are convincing no matter what side of the partnership they are on. As I already said, Pesci is brilliantly belligerent, exuding power and arrogance far exceeding his performance in Goodfellas. There are subtle changes in their performances, but ones that bring a whole new dynamic to Casino. One of the most important things I felt was the total dominance he had over his lovers - he would kiss them once and then force them to perform oral sex. He is in charge.DeNiro gives a very under-appreciated performance here as Ace, because its so refreshing to see DeNiro claw for his power and not be 100% in control at all times. I also really bought his love for Ginger - Scorsese wisely refrains from his protagonist's usual womanising ways in developing Ace, and as a result, it brings a lot to his personality. It made their love story so tragic. Casino's screenplay really should have been nominated for an Oscar. It helps a 3 hour film remain thoroughly engaging. It is packed full of killer dialogue, wicked insults and eventful story archs. I loved every moment of the relationship between Ginger and Ace, and I loved the fights between Pesci and DeNiro. I loved the exposition about the FBI tracking Pesci. I loved the running of the casino scenes and the voice-over. My favourite line in the whole movie was the "holes in the desert" surrounding Vegas explanation. It was so well done, and I'd never thought of it before.I loved Casino. I could easily watch it again and not get sick of it. DeNiro and Pesci and Scorsese work fresh takes into old moves, and Sharon Stone and the screenplay are simply amazing. Any Scorsese fan, put this on your to see list far far above his more famous The Aviator, Gangs of New York or The Departed.</fullReview>

Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating? Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best- known hustlers in town? For her, a guy like 'Ace' was the ultimate score? So the way to Ginger's heart was clearly money? 'Ace' knew that but he didn't care?What he wanted was to marry her? Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild?

To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with 'Ace' or didn't give him the proper respect? Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that 'Ace' didn't get his hands dirty? 'Ace' witnessed several beatings on his behalf?

		<fullReview>I'm usually not a fan of the way narrative films are. So this movie was a pleasant surprise. This is a true story (with names and places changed) depicting the life of Sam "Ace" Rothstein and his friend Nicky. Sam is a great gambler, and works his way through the years, eventually landing a job running a casino in Las Vegas. He watches for cheaters and uses his friend Nicky (a man in the Mafia) to get rid of problems using violence. The Mafia protects Sam in return for scamming money from the casino. When Nicky starts to get careless with his tactics (even getting kicked out of Vegas' casinos and put on the infamous blacklist) and Sam's wife gets hooked on drugs and is cheating, things start falling apart. The FBI comes after the Mafia hard, and the Mafia in return starts to come down on everyone. As the story goes on things fall apart more and more. Sam and Nicky stop being so close, and violence gets worse and worse. This was a well put together movie. Excellent acting, great directing, and an amazing story come together perfectly.Soundtrack: 8- Most of the time the music works for the movie, but there were a few moments where the music didn't fit in the film.Script: 10- The writer knew how to write mobsters well. The writing was smart, and believable. I really liked this element.Originality: 10- Yes, this is a gangster film. But when you watch this, you never know what to expect. This isn't your average gangster flick. There were all kinds of new elements, and it was well done.Cinematography: 7- Martin Scorsese has a very specific style to his cinematography. It isn't necessarily bad, but there are some moments that disconnect me from the story.Casting: 10- Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro playing in a movie about the Mafia. Need I say more? Acting: 10- The actors put so much emotion and perfection in this film. I was never bored, and I was so engrossed in the film so deeply that I constantly forgot I was even watching. It was so real, and these actors should all be congratulated for their work.Overall: 9.2</fullReview>

Sharon Stone won a Golden Globe but really did not get the attention she *or* the character deserved. we see more DeNiro's legs than hers.another issue is that the two leads are somewhat schizophrenic to the point we wonder if there was not enough story conferences before the shoot. in CASINO, Henry Hill is the shall we say reluctant accessory to murder, a guy with a good heart. DeNiro here is a Jewish guy, schooled in 1950s hoodlumism, but his "Jewishness" is confined unfortunately to the stereotype who lets others fight for him and is actually worried that his best fiend Pesci won't stop filandering with his wife. "what if he doesn't stop?" he whispers to Stone, in a very bizarre scene.Stone's character is also a mite mixed-up: she can work the system down to carpet fibers in the lounge, is a lying thief like all her friends and clients, but is initially shy on the idea of marrying a multi millionaire who can secure her future 500 times over? think I'll toss my VHS in, one more time, you know, just to review.........................</fullReview>

Their acting is good and the script is awesome. Robert Deniro worth the Oscar performance and Joes Pesci is cool. But, surprisingly, it's Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn't agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who "stole" the Academy Award from under Sharon's nose. The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film. However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters. Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.

		<fullReview>"Casino", remains another superb masterpiece by Martin Scorsese. Sadly this film is not really talked about enough, or at least among my peers. Many seem to acknowledge it's brilliance and just say "Oh yeah, that's the head in a vice movie".Like "Goodfellas" (1990) before it, the film is based on another True story. Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), is called by the mob to oversee the day to day operations of the most successful Casino in Vegas. As we see, "Ace" is constantly on duty, yet successfully is running the business to it's full potential. Along the way we meet Sam's old friend Nicholas "Nicky" Santoro (Joe Pesci), an extremely volatile man who would kill you if you even made eye contact. Later he is also introduced to extensive gold-digger Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), whom Sam falls for and eventually marries unaware she's still with her slimy con man boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Ultimately these encounters mean doom for every one of them, among the inevitable collapse of the mob's power."Casino", maybe just for it's length is an epic movie. Showcasing both the familiar tropes of violence and greed, which leads to the downfall of any human being. But the genius is that all these people suffer different forms of fatalities, both seen before and some surprisingly original. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are as great as ever in these kind of movies. It's great to see both tread familiar grounds, read exposition while the story continues and still assume different characters. James Woods was extremely subtle in his role, which works well for him as I did not recognise him in the beginning. Finally Sharon Stone's character is somewhat the emphasis of the entire movie, and she delivers that Oscar nominated performance so tight as the object of lust it's astounding. Funny enough is that I absolutely hate her in these kind of roles because she's so good at them, all in all making her the perfect choice.Final Verdict: Though the film is long, those who can sit through it are in for another great piece from Scorsese's filmography. 8/10.</fullReview>

One thing you do have to expect from this movie is violence, sex, and a lot of cursing, because with Casinos those things happen in them all the time. Violence isn't bad but with a movie that has a title like Casino, that's what's to be expected. I remember when I first watched it, and since I was pretty much used to some violence, profanities, and obscenities, like I do watch Internet reviewers and YouTube Poop stuff which are already full of that kind of stuff. All in all, good movie and a very violent one but I wouldn't recommend showing it to someone under 15 years old, or people who aren't used to violence and obscenities (that also pretty much goes for the other Di Niro/Scorsese movies too).</fullReview>

The real truth here is the heart of mankind, which is filled with evil. The perpetual lure of sex and violence, end of the world hypocrisy, the false faces that cover the insatiable lust and love of money. Man's inability to avoid corruption, the ease with which he walks and rides roughshod, to roll in destruction and without remorse. The real world extremes of what people are capable of. Of what seeds are planted in the soil of the human heart, and the flowers of evil that are nurtured and grown. Martin Scorsese is an end of the world prophet here, and this underrated masterpiece is one of the brightest sermons he ever delivered. A latter day warning to mankind that the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Play the movie, Mr Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese's brother film to Goodfellas, is a longer engrossing film with a few similarities. Deniro and Pesci, reteamed again, share the narration. Here's another true mafia related tale, about the corrupt vices behind a casino, where it's new boss, Sam Rothstein, (a more gentler soul to Deniro's semi frightening Jimmy Gent in Goodfellas) has a close call with death, via a car explosion, where too the Ace as he was known, survives many interrogations, and some terrifying moments of paranoia, not knowing if he was going to be the next body dropped in the desert. We see him take continual hounding by the FBI, but the Ace always managed to beat him. Of course, Deniro's faultless, his mate, mafia cowboy Nicky Santoro, (Joe Pesci, solid) bares some similarities to the incredibly frightening Tommy in Goodfellas, though I know who I'd pick, if I having to choose a room alone. Stone is at her shining moment, playing the junkie pro Ginger, who became Mrs Sam Rothstein, despite having to a constantly cling on to a scuzzy low life pimp, Lester, (Woods in one of his best performances) who maintained this sort of hold on her. Again there are violent moments that shock, one as excessively illustrated by the big boys upstairs, to players who rig games, another one involving insult, plus Pesci's foul mouthed antics, and womanizing, even doing Stone. Even more enjoyable than Goodfellas, it's running time had me worried, stretched out to nearly three hours. Casino, sort of has an excess feel to it, judging by some themes, that have us questioning if they were true, but again it's just another engrossing Scorsese hit. I dare him to make one that it isn't. A great night at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film follows Sam (Ace) Rothstein, who is called by the Italian Mob to oversee the day-to-day operations at the fictional Tangiers casino in Las Vegas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1995 true crime film Casino directed by Martin Scorsese isn't just one of Scorsese's most underrated films but also one of the most underrated films of the 90's. Both Robert De Nero and Joe Pesci are at the top of there game, making it nearly impossible to look away from the screen. the narrative in the film is genius and allows the audience to go behind the scenes per say, to watch how a mob takes over the city of Las Vegas. The film contains the classic violence an brutality that Scorsese films are notorious for. Every actor from De Nero and Pesci to James Woods and Sharron stone deliver a performance of a lifetime. I highly recommend this film to any Scorsese fans out there</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is one of the best films made by Martin Scorsese. Casino reunited Scorsese with Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent. Casino tells the tale of Sam "Ace" Rothstein (DeNiro) a New York bookie and his pal, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) who move out to Las Vegas and create an empire. However ones money hungry wife (Stone) helps to bring it down.The first third of this film features almost constant narrations from Ace and Nicky. These narrations play a great role in the film because it takes you far in depth to Ace and Nicky's Las Vegas operation.To those of you who really enjoyed Scorsese's 1990 film "GoodFellas" there is no doubt in my mind that you will enjoy this film. It features Joe Pesci playing almost the same character he played in "GoodFellas". This film also features Sharon Stone, who was nominated for an academy award as hooker Ginger McKenna. The film also features Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, James Woods as Lester Diamond, and Don Rickles as casino manager Billy Sherbert. If you are a big fan of Scorsese, DeNiro, or Pesci you will no doubt enjoy this film. This film deserves a 10/10 rating and is a must watch for any DeNiro, Pesci, Scorsese, or mob movie fan who has never seen this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainingly intense crime drama from Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Casino came out it wasn't too well received from what I can remember. It reunited director Martin Scorsese, writer Nicholas Pileggi and actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci from Goodfellas. The obvious similarities between the films were used negatively against it. It was essentially seen as a lesser re-run of that earlier film. Well, I guess critics need to say things like this to indicate they know what they're talking about but for the rest of us such details are sort of irrelevant and we are only really interested in whether Casino was any good on its own right. And the answer is that it sure is. Maybe not of the standard of Goodfellas but it sure is in a similar ball-park. Like that earlier film it's based on real events, although in this case even more characters have been re-named, probably for legal reasons. It's a rise and fall crime film about the workings of a 70's Las Vegas casino, in which the Mafia skimmed millions of dollars.From the great opening credit sequence from the legendary Saul Bass, this is a tour de force of technical excellence. It' visually very impressive with great period detail. Scorsese is a master at this kind of narrative and commands our attention with his customary dynamic direction. The story is propelled by a fair bit of narration from De Niro and Pesci, who respectively play the man who runs the casino and the Mob enforcer. Both actors are on the top of their game and are impressively supported by a career best turn from Sharon Stone as a high-class hooker who gets involved with De Niro's character in a loveless marriage. None of the principle characters are especially likable or sympathetic but the top class acting from them ensures they are always compelling. Scorsese certainly has a knack of presenting damaged people on screen in convincing and enthralling ways. Like others there is a focus on harsh domestic relationships and the De Niro/Stone coupling does make for intense viewing at times. Pesci, on the other hand, is absolutely full-on and authentic as a very bad guy. In fact, Casino tops any other Scorsese film in the grim violence stakes. This is a film not exactly for the faint hearted at times. It also showcases another facet of the director's with a soundtrack of pop and rock tracks from the period, except this is his most extreme utilisation of this scene setting musical approach with song after song strung together relentlessly, underpinning events with very few gaps of silence in between. If I had to level any negativity against the movie at most I would say maybe it's a little bit overlong but even then it does have a cracking pace and keeps the attention regardless.It does seem that over the years Casino has garnered a better reputation and is now looked upon as another excellent Scorsese picture and this is the way it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best gangster movies from the 90's. Actors and Actresses in the movie did an unbelievable acting job. The director of the movie Martin Scorsese definitely picked right actors/actresses. The plot of the movie is great. It was very entertaining from the very beginning to the end. I think an 8 out of 10 is little underrated. I'm sure this movie does not show 100% of what really happened in real life but I think the point of the movie is to entertain audience and grab their attention from the beginning to the end. Even though this movie is almost 3 hour long, it didn't feel like it was that long. Must See for Gangster Movie Lovers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese is and always will be a legend. With Casino, Scorsese shows us his ability to keep producing masterpiece's. His specialty is with mob-based films and with his resume including Goodfellas and Gangs of New York, Casino is right on the dot. Its a masterpiece of friendship, destruction, and betrayal. Casino takes many chances with the plot but it is wonderfully voiced-over by Ace and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci). I believe the voice-overs makes Casino interesting because it feels as if we are eavesdropping in a secret place. We hear voice-overs at the mob bosses dinners, at Ace and Ginger's (Sharon Stone) wedding, during Santoro's burglaries and multiple other occasions. This film is a must see and i definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is a fantastic movie with a very long and detailed storyline that stretches out to nearly three hours but it never stops being interesting and enjoyable.The cast of this movie is all brilliant and inspired,Robert De Niro,Sharon Stone and of course Joe Pesci all deliver very impressive performance,James Woods is also very good in this movie as usual but I was disappointed that he wasn't really in it that much,I thought he would have a much more important role in the movie because i've always found his acting very impressive.My only problem with the movie really is that it could have been less detailed and also,my same problem with Goodfellas,is the fact that they get different characters narrating,it should all revolve around one characters point of view so we can hear their story instead of different peoples point of views.It should have all been Robert De Niro's point of view and not changing it to Joe Pesci at times and some other characters as well.A must see for fans of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro movies.Story of Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) as they begin running a casino business and let their greed get the best of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the first Movies I can recall watching that gives a little insight into how the Mafia make a living out of legitimate Business. along with titles such as Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas and the Godfather, which I enjoyed each immensely, Casino doesn't only show the dark side of organized crime but the ups and downs of their personal lives too.I watched Casino for the first time with my crew at the Cinema, we loved the outfits that De niro wears and his head for perfection as Casino Manager it really made us chuckle, one of the funniest bits was the bit about everyone being watched by someone: The dealer watches the player, the box man watches the dealer, the pit boss watches the box men, the floor manager watches the pit bosses, the casino manager watches the floor manager, I am watching the casino manager. and in the roof are about a dozen cheats watching everything because they know every trick in the book, and the eye in the sky is watching us all. This would make you think there is more chance in play in a Casino than skill or good luck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been intrigued but never been excited watching an Italian gang themed movies except this one.The movie is based on the life of real life character Frank Rothenthal played by Robert Di Nero. Sam Rothstein (Di Nero) basically isn't a bad guy asides from his talent to sell gambling to the would be gamblers. But because of his underworld connection, he gets into more trouble than he deserves, including an attempt to assassinate him. This is one story that what actually happened is more exciting than any fictitious story. I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen when I first saw it. It's certainly one of the best movie director Martin Scorsese ever produced. Joe Pesci was spot on as Sam's friend Nicky. He really looked like the character in real life he was portraying. The gory ending would be climactic for a movie, but to think that it actually happened in real life is inconceivable.If Martin Scorsese had to choose a character to make a movie out of, he couldn't have chosen a better one than these two. The story is explosive at every turn, and is one of THE best mob based movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very similar to "GoodFellas" but is that such a bad thing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's "Casino" found him treading very similar ground to his film of five years earlier, "GoodFellas". From script to actors to storyline to narrative devices, the two films share several common elements. While that makes for a somewhat unoriginal movie, there are certainly worse templates to go by than "GoodFellas".The story is once again based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi. This time, we're treated to a fictionalized account of the rise and fall of Las Vegas casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (modelled after Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal). Some liberties are taken with the facts but the movie is generally true to life. Like in "GoodFellas", voice-over narration is employed throughout the film.Returning from the cast of "GoodFellas" were Robert De Niro &amp; Joe Pesci. De Niro was more in the spotlight this time and delivered a characteristically excellent performance. Pesci's performance is also good but could certainly be seen as a rehashing of his previous, Oscar-winning role. Sharon Stone rounded out the stars and she delivered the best performance of her career; one that resulted in a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination. Besides these there are several other notables in supporting roles including Frank Vincent (another "GoodFellas" cast member), James Woods &amp; Don Rickles, to mention just a few.Visually, the film is exceptional. Robert Richardson's cinematography was worthy of an Oscar nomination and Scorsese's direction is great as always. Like "GoodFellas", Scorsese also made excellent use of music (mostly popular) throughout the entire film. The sets &amp; costumes also show remarkable style and attention to detail.In the end, "Casino" won't win any awards for originality but it's hard to fault the film when many of its strengths are shared with "GoodFellas". The movie might be a bit too long for it's own good but, other than that, I think it compares quite favourably with the vast majority of crime dramas.</fullReview>

When Sam makes his way as Casino manager, he, Ginger and Nicky's life become consumed by crime, drugs and violence. Woods (Once Upon a Time in America) plays Ginger's ex-boyfriend &amp; pimp, Lester Diamond whom she's is still in love with.

		<shortDescription>Casino, at cut above most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese collide in their eighth and final (to date) film in their partnership in this true story about gangster who get it all wrong. Based on the true story of Frank Rosenthal and Tony Spilotro this was bound to be good and by geez it delivered. Voiceovers, constant background music and also constant swearing (423 f-bombs!) result to make a very powerful film that is very well acted and also is told brilliantly. Scorsese uses a method which he also used in Raging Bull where he begins from near the end. The first voice-over really gets you interested, as soon as Robert De Niro's character says this you know the film is going to be good: 'When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, I believed, that's the kind of love I had'. This first line got me interested immediately and I am sure it will make most viewers want to watch for the whole three hour period. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci come together in a film for the third time and once again they click instantly, De Niro the successful guy who runs the casino, Pesci the man who stops anyone get in De Niro's way, it really is great stuff and you really start to believe that they are the characters and are not just acting. Sharon Stone showcased her talent like no one thought she could in this film and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and get you into the film with such ease it seems like you can't see or hear all the carnage that is going down on screen. Music plays a huge part in the film and in fact there are 61 different songs used in this film, most of them actually being proper songs that are not soundtrack songs. The one criticism for the film is that sometimes the music was on at unnecessary times and you could occasionally not hear as well as you might. To compare this to other Robert De Niro-Martin Scorsese films would (in my opinion) put it third on the list and this was certainly an amazing film. Comparing it to other gangster films is a bit different but I would still say it it up there with such masterpieces as The Godfather, if not possibly better. Watch this if you are not disturbed by scenes of ultra-violence and world record swearing, it will be damn well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On a par with Goodfellas in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is fair to say that Casino is overshadowed by Goodfellas, which was an enormous success on release. Many see Casino as simply a continuation of Goodfellas, after all it is set in the decades succeeding the events of Goodfellas. However, I feel Casino stands out as an equal to Goodfellas as a crime drama and in some ways, it fell it may be superior.Casino follows Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), a gambling handicapper, who takes control of the fictional Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Along with friend and mob boss Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), Sam ensures the money keeps rolling in and makes sure the bosses 'back home' get a little extra by 'skimming' from the casino's profits. As the years go by, Sam marries working girl Ginger (Sharon Stone), thinking that he can ensure her trust. However, money, drugs and betrayal ultimately get the better of them...I think what I really like about Casino is the destructive love triangle of Sam-Ginger-Nicky which dominates the second half of the movie. I think their is a greater sense of ambition and the individual than Goodfellas, which was mainly concerned with the family. I also sympathised more with Sam than Henry Hill, as Sam has to cope with Ginger, who is troubled by drugs, alcohol and former lover/pimp Lester (James Woods).Whilst it may be difficult to live up to Goodfellas, I think Casino does a pretty good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two people whose movies I try to avoid are Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone; Pesci is a one trick pony with a very tired act, and SS just nauseates me. So, clearly, I held off seeing Casino for many years. The other day it was at Half Price for a dollar so I picked it up. I always enjoy stories about Vegas; it's fun to peek behind the scenes of the casinos. This was one of the last good roles DeNiro had, before he descended into the Valhalla of romantic comedies with the likes of Ben Stiller. The good is simply the story itself, which is essentially true. (It is certainly NOT true that the mob was not skimming in Vegas until the 1970's). DeNiro was good, especially when he tried to deal with an old friend who he realized and always knew was an out of control idiot. DeN was clearly ready to jettison Pesci if that was what it took to keep the casino running, but was afraid he could not do so because Pesci was a made man and DeNiro, a Jew, was not and never could be. The scenes "back East" with the big boys were always well done; good supporting jobs by all involved. Don Rickles was good. The bad, aside from Pesci and Stone, were: the soundtrack; I felt it got in the way because it was continuous, too loud, and often at odds with the tone of what was showing on the screen. The lighting; in many scenes Scorsese put a hot spotlight on a character or a desktop. I just can't figure out what he was trying to do. The running narration was not needed after the first few scenes. All in all, I'd recommend it. Get a bottle of pure strength ammonia to sniff whenever Stone appears on the screen and you will be OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Almost three hours long with some 150 character references or credits in it the film "Casino" has to do with the rise and fall of big time Las Veges operator and Tangiers Casino manager Sam "Ace" Rothstein, Robert De Niro, who's fate remains uncertain until the movie is just about over.We see Sam in 1983 getting in his car and then blown to pieces as a bomb exploded as soon as he turned on the key to start the engine going. As Sam is put, by the explosion, in some kind of state of suspended animation, floating aimlessly in outer space, he tells us in flashback what lead to him getting into the situation that we find him now in. It all had to do with Sam's boyhood friend Mafia made-man Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, who was brought to Vegas by the mob to be put in charge of the casino's security. It was Nicky who's strong armed actions like beating and clubbing the customers fond cheating, as well as showing disrespect, on the floor of the casino that brought the heat, cops, as well as local politicians down on Ace Rothstein. This made things hot for Ace who with his criminal record now being scrutinized,instead of being looked the other way, to see if he can qualify to have a license to run the casino.Things get even worse for Ace when Nicky after being banned by the State Casino Commission from ever stepping into a Las Vegas casino or gambling establishment still pesters him about getting his job back! That would cost Ace his job as casino manager for just associating with the blood thirsty little psycho. Things really come to a head when Nicky starts to warm up to Ace's old lady ex Las Vegas showgirl and part time hooker Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone. Ginger is also still involved with her pimp ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond, James Woods, who's been leaching off her 2 million dollars in cash &amp; jewelry that Ace gave her as a wedding present. This lead Lester to get worked over in a restaurant parking lot by Ace's goons with a terrified Ginger forced to watch.As Ginger got more and more into snorting coke she became easy pickings for Nicky who got her to become his squeeze or woman in him supplying her, through his mob connections, with the white stuff. Soon Ginger got so hooked on both drugs and Nicky that she started to abuse her and Ace's 9 year old daughter Amy, Erika Von Tagen, by tying her up in bed as the two were out at night painting the town red behind Ace's back. It's when the word came back to Nicky's boss back east that he's fooling around with Ace's wife it was decided that he, despite being a made man in the Mafia, was more trouble them he was worth. A hit was set up for both Nicky and his equally psychotic kid brother deli owner Dominick, Philip Surian,who likes to spit in his costumers food especially cops whom he was forced to pay off. In a secret meeting site held in a deserted Indiana corn field both Nicky &amp; Dominick were met by mobster and good friend Frank Marino,Frank Vincent, and his boys to talk over business. What was later to happen to the two sadistic creeps is far too brutal and shocking to be put down on paper!***SPOILERS*** When the film "Casino" is just about over we finally get to see what exactly happened to the what looked like at first the late and dismembered Samuel "Ace" Rothstein who's doing all the narrations in the movie. But by then with all the action and sub-plots in the film Ace's fate wasn't anything to write home, or in a movie review, about anyway! By then he was yesterdays news in him only being worth while to wrap fish or line your kiddie box with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that I have watched 50 times. And all I want to do is watch it again.Let me start of by saying, a lot of people keep saying 'This is not as good as GoodFellas'. Well that's simply not true. The movie is based on the real story of the upbringing of Las Vegas as we know it today and the main people behind it. This in itself is one the most fascinating mob stories of one of the most fascinating places on Earth and Martin Scorsese and all the actors have really brought this story on screen so incredibly well.The movie will keep you glued to the screen and it's incredible detail,acting, voice overs and sets are nothing short of the work of a true genius of film making.Robert DeNiro plays the role of Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal and he portrays the character to perfection (seriously, it's inch perfect) along with Joe Pesci who scares the life out of you when you watch him in this movie. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci's character) is the real muscle of the mob gang at that time in Vegas, and boy we can see that through Joe Pesci's incredible portrayal of the real life character.It is important to mention the incredible performance by Sharon Stone as well. She pushed herself to the limit with this role and this role really needed someone at the limit, so they way she carried herself through this role is incredible.Martin Scorsese, your detail in this movie is out of this world. There is not a second of the 2 hours and 50 minutes that is off key. It is perfect to the dot.Phenomenal movie. A must watch. One of the all time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Excellent Movie on Crime,Greed,Money and Power based on a true story by Martin Scorsese where he shows the dark side of Las Vegas and the Gambling Business in the Casino with quite a bit of violence in the type of movie in which he is a perfectionist, along with great performances and narration of the story from Robert De Niro And Joe Pesci who are the main backbone of the film,along with a great performance from Sharon Stone and a good story and great background music which is so common in Scorsese's movies.The Story is about Two Mobster Best Friends of one(De Niro) is a Casino Owner and a great gambler, and the Other(Pesci) is told to keep his back,and it shows us how Nicky(Pesci) becomes obsessed with money and power after coming to Las Vegas and how he becomes a wanted gangster, while that friendship between him and Sam(De Niro) affects Sam's reputation quite badly and how they slowly become enemies,while Sam having to also deal with his alcoholic wife Ginger(Stone) and family after his wife is frustrated of him and wants to end the marriage and is greedy for a big amount of money kept at a bank in her and her husband's name. This Shows how Money,Greed and Power can change a human being into doing very bad and horrible things.The Performances from De Niro as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein who is a very excellent and clever gambler and Pesci as Nicky Santoro who gets obsessed with money and power after coming to Vegas are excellent as they Potray there characters perfectly and at times acting like real mobsters, their chemistry in the movie in the scenes together is great and the dialogue delivery of both throughout the movie is also excellent and they narrated the story perfectly..Sharon Stone also does a very good job as Ginger McKenna who gets frustrated after some years of getting married with Sam and gets greedy of the money which is in the bank, she portrays her role very well as a alcoholic greedy for money, with a bigger influence to the movie in the latter part of it, making the movie a three sided battle between the actors.Martin Scorsese does an excellent job in directing this and showing the dark side of Las Vegas and the Casino world with quite a bit of violence and abuses but at the same time keeping the viewers interested in the movie,and how the city can make a person obsessed with Money,Power and Greed, with helping the characters adapt to their roles very well,and also helping Sharon Stone give one of her best performances of her life,also utilizing a good story which he also had a part in writing very well in making a great crime movie in which he is such a perfectionist in.The Story which was actually based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi was excellent and reveals the dark side of Las Vegas and shows that it always is not the greatest place on earth, due to an excellent screenplay from Screenwriter Pileggi himself and Martin Scorsese. The Background music in the movie is also excellent as it is in any Scorsese movie and great job from the legendary director and Robbie Robertson in giving some great songs in the movie which suit the scenes perfectly.This Is A Great Crime Film on how Money,Power and Greed can absolutely change a person into doing very bad and horrible things,and its perfectly shown by Mr Scorsese along with a great acting from the acting trio.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"He'll keep coming back until one of you is dead"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repetition occurs in cinema at every level. If something is successful, highbrow or lowbrow, there is a good chance that those responsible will simply rerun the formula to get the same result. In 1990 iconic gangster movie and filmmaker's favourite Goodfellas was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by Nicholas Pileggi, and starred Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. In 1995 gangster movie Casino was directed by Martin Scorsese from a script by? You get the idea.Admittedly Scorsese and Pileggi did work well together, the director illustrating the writer's every word with a well-placed pan or close-up. It's a bit dizzying and the constant musical switching gets a bit tiresome, but you still have to admire the craftsmanship that goes into a picture like this, especially in Scorsese's meticulously planned tracking shots. There's one near the beginning where we follow the skimmer into the casino, and the camera eagerly overtakes him as he heads towards the counting room, really engaging us in what's going on. Or there's the tracking shot at the wedding, where Sharon Stone's flick of her head seems to propel the camera on to the next table. It's a very artificial, obtrusive way of making a movie, but it is nevertheless carefully designed to involve us in the story's world.This was the eighth, and to date, the final time Robert De Niro has starred in a Scorsese movie, and this is predictably familiar ground for him. Sam Rothstein is really just a slightly more relaxed version of the De Niro character in Goodfellas. De Niro can at least do menacing without using his fists, and of note is his articulation of the word "dead" when he threatens his wife. Joe Pesci's role here is nigh-on identical to the one that earned him an Oscar in Goodfellas. He's good at it though. Look at how he stabs up the man with the pen; he really gives the impression of a little guy who's had to get the kicks in quick to survive. But reliable as these two are there is very much a sense with De Niro and Pesci that they are going through the old familiar motions. The real standout in the movie is Sharon Stone. For this part she has to be angry, tearful and drugged-up, as do a lot of actresses, but to do so for such a large chunk of the movie and remain believable throughout, never slipping into over-the-top hysterics, is admirable.Being a repetition of Goodfellas doesn't necessarily make Casino a weaker movie. It has almost all the same merits and flaws as its predecessor. It is perhaps a little more lacking in true drama and comes closer to a documentary, at times being little more than a list of anecdotes, which makes the nearly three hour runtime a little wearing. One area which, for me, made Casino stand-out was its costume design. Garish as they are, there's a mad kind of co-ordination in Rothstein's suits. There are plenty of other tawdry yet outstanding outfits throughout the movie, such as an Ace of Hearts dress worn by a bit player. Sharon Stone's leather suit in her climactic scenes is memorably striking, and as such helps to highlight the fact that she's been in the same clothes for several days. For me, it's the clothes more than anything else which evoke the misguided glamour of Casino and its denizens. Unfortunately, this isn't what people tend to consider in the gangster movie, so it seems to have gone largely unnoticed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pretty decent film from the Scorsesee lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not had the pleasure of seeing many of Martin Scorsesee's films, and this might actually be the first. I have heard that he is a well known director with a unique style, but as I have not seen any of his films, I cannot comment on it; but if they are anything like Casino then so far I am impressed. I heard of Martin Scorsesee not from watching movies but from a Alternate band named King Missile (known for a song which they wrote about as certain part of the male anatomy that a person was able to remove, and then ended up losing, and finding it again and having to fork out $20 to buy it back - weird group). I will not go into the details of what their song was about and what they wanted to do to Martin Scorsesee even though they said that he made the best films.Casino is a movie about people and about how that begin with everything and end with nothing. The movie is based around Sam (Robert DeNiro) who is made the director of a Casino by the mafia. His childhood friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) comes to Las Vegas to apply his business - thuggery - to the town almost untouched by thugs. It is set in a time when the gangs ruled Las Vegas and gambling was a game of skill, and enticing people out of their money was done by the way one arranges their poker machines. The conclusion shows us that those days are passed as now the corporations own Las Vegas and the casinos only exist if their theme is worth it.As I said earlier the movie is about people, and to explore the movie we must explore the people and the relationships that they have with each other. There are three main characters and they are Sam, Nicky, and Ginger. Sam and Nicky do not change where as Ginger does. This is important because the Ginger and Nicky claim that Sam has changed, but this is differential to the nobility of his character. One might ask how can Sam be noble when there is no honour among thieves? Well, in this time there is honour and this honour his held at the point of the gun. There is a way that the mafia does things and if people don't do what the mafia tells you then you will find yourself buried in a hole in the middle of a corn field. Yet the problem with this honour is that it works on the assumption that might means right, meaning that once somebodies power exceeds your own then either you comply or suffer the consequences.Sam's character is the central character. He is clean, an spends the whole movie clean. He is a man that does not take risks, he only takes certainties. As is said at the beginning of the movie, he is a man that when he makes a bet, the entire bookmaking industry changes. As such he is the perfect man for a casino because he knows how to make money. Now he has a record in illegal gambling so it is difficult to get him into a casino, but as long as you treat the authorities in Las Vegas okay, then they won't happen you - the minute you step over the line and upset somebody, then they can put the pressure upon you.As I said before, Sam does not take chances. He is a man that runs everything his way. He is obsessed that everything runs smoothly. He does not pay people to think because their thoughts are not his thoughts and they don't know how to work the people and the floor. The example is the poker machines. He puts the big jackpot machines in plain view rather than hiding them. Hiding them keeps people away and as such they don't run the risk of hitting the big jackpot, but having them in plain view brings more people to them so that they waste more money trying to win the big jackpot. Of course his obsessiveness with things running his way is very much a flaw, as he wants to always know where his wife is, and this leads to distrust and finally to the breakdown in their marriage. It was not all his fault as he tried to marry a woman who was not meant to be married and it ended up destroying him and her. The blueberry muffin affair is another instance where is compulsiveness goes overboard.Casino is about power and the question of who really rules. In one way we see that the mafia rules Vegas from the east, while on the other hand, the authorities are so corrupt that they let them, yet if you upset the authorities then they can and will tighten their fist. Or is it the king of the thugs - Nicky - who rules. It seems like he does, but in the end he only finds himself in a pit in a cornfield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's most visually stunning film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese has been hailed as one of the greatest modern directors ever to take on the Silver Screen and for good reason. With a unique style that involves strong themes of crime and redemption, virtuoso camera work, quick pacing, and violent imagery; Martin Scorsese has carved his name into the crime genre and the movie world as a whole.Now, many know Scorsese for his gritty and violent crime films like Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and The Departed, but I think the Scorsese style (at least the visual style) shows through best in his Crime epic, Casino.In Casino, Martin Scorsese uses some of his best camera work and his most stunning compositions to pantomime the feel and atmosphere of an actual casino. The quick movements, the flashing lights, the almost schizophrenic nature all comes together to form one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.IT doesn't just stop at the camera-work. The way the story is told also plays a big part in this subtle dance. The film almost seems like one gigantic vignette as Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci narrate for good chunks of the film as it lays out the story. It seamlessly glides between Vignettes, montages, and narrative story telling to almost make it like watching a novel.If there were ever films to come so close to being like paintings it would be The Seventh Seal and this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is definitely one of the best films of the nineties. And when you take the time to think about it, that is quite an accusation, when it is competing with films such as:GoodFellas The Shawshank Redemption Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction American BeautyIt is brilliantly told and brilliantly acted. Although Stone and Pesci are impressive, De Niro once again steals the show for me. The scene when he drags Ginger out of the house is one of his best scenes to date. Pesci once again takes the roll as De Niro's best friend Psycho/Ladies man killer. He is excellent, although his performance in GoodFellas was his finest hour. Stone gives her best performance to date. You really hate the character, as Martin Scorsese intended. I do believe, that although it is similar to GoodFellas, it is different in its own way, as GoodFellas makes grit look glamorous, and Casino makes glamour look gritty. And so, I leave you with this. I think that Casino's story is actually better than GoodFellas. I'm not saying that it is a better film, but in my opinion, Casino has a better and more thought out story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get Ready To Gamble with 'Casino', the 1995 Martin Scorsese directed classic. Scorsese brings a flick where his characters are cruel, intelligent, conniving &amp; brutally violent. It's a roller-coaster ride, but it surely doesn't belong to the faint-hearted.'Casino' is loosely based on Frank Rosenthal's life. Rostenthal was a professional sports bettor, former Las Vegas casino executive and organized crime associate, back in the 1970's. It's his devious, violent &amp; mind-numbing journey that unfolds here.'Casino' works because Scorsese doesn't fumble in any step. Sure, the length could've been trimmed, but the handling of the subject otherwise is top-notch. Scorsese is a limitless talent who has proved himself time and again. Scorsese goes down as a legend in films, for being, probably, the least conscious storyteller of his time!Robert Richardson's Cinematography is stunning and captures all the moments with precision. Performance-Wise: Robert De Niro as Rostenthal, is Outstanding! Joe Pesci is bombastic, while James Woods has been wasted. But the person who steals the show and quite frankly is stunning, is Sharon Stone. As Mrs Rostenthal, she delivers a sensational performance that deserves the highest praises.On the whole, 'Casino' is not meant for the faint-hearted, At All. But those who can stomach such gore and abuse, I suggest, you check this one out soon! Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Vegas that no longer exists. maybe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>watching Casino for the 4th or 5th time now. it's like a clip out of the history file; the remnants of mob ownership of the famous casinos of Vegas (all of which have been now demolished for the new 'what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas'.Sharon Stone truly impressed me with her Oscar nominated performance of the hustler that couldn't quit. it was in her blood. DeNiro on the other hand in my opinion should have earned a nomination as well as Sam Rothstein the casino owner. Quote: 'back home (east coast) they would have put me in jail, out here they give me awards'. a city awash in cash, proof of the adage 'a sucker is born every minute'.I personally have never been to Vegas and have no intention of going. I have however been to Atlantic City and can understand how the glitter and jingle of the slots can be so mesmerizing, or more precisely saw just that happen numerous times. I never felt the tug, my suspicions confirmed one day at the local casino when I popped a token in a machine and lo, it came up 'bar' 'bar' 'off by one'. Confirmation that slots are PROGRAMMED to commit way more 'near misses' than statistical average would dictate. So I guess the 'hustle' has merely gone digital.Very entertaining movie. Watch it before you go to the casino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can quite confidently say that this is one of the best directed films I have ever seen. The way Scorsese has it a Ace's recollection of past happenings and has narration whilst the plot unravels is really clever and works so well. It kept my attention throughout and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Despite the fact that it is quite a long film, there wasn't ever a point when I thought it was slow or boring.Some great acting from De Niro and, like in goodfellas, Joe Pesci plays the blood thirsty tough guy perfectly. Sharon Stone also plays a great part but makes herself very unlikeable (at least that's what i found).Overall, it was a very enjoyable film with strong storyline, great acting, perfect directing and also made in the year I was born. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in Scorsese's films, and Mafia films, unless they dislike the use of swearing or violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of the 1990s was a glorious, competitive time for mob films. Okay, so we started off with the disappointing (but far from terrible) The Godfather: Part 3, but later that year Martin Scorsese released GoodFellas, which many people consider to be the definitive gangster film. In that same year came Miller's Crossing, and Quentin Tarantino added to the palette with both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. In 1995, Marty hit back with Casino, redefining the blockbuster genre in a way that wasn't emulated until some twelve years later, when Nolan got his hands on the Batman franchise.Comprising of an all-star cast headed by the incomparable Robert De Niro, Casino tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, America's finest bookmaker in the 1970s and 80s, whose knowledge of the industry lures him to Las Vegas. At the behest of the Mafia, he becomes the executive manager of the fictional Tangiers casino. Childhood friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes along for the ride, and all seems to run smoothly until a desire for women, wealth and the very essence of Vegas sends the gambling empire into a tailspin. Expect nothing less than utter professionalism in the direction department. Scorsese gives the audience an excellent look into the luxury, excess and emotion that defined Las Vegas for so long. The visuals are striking, displaying the bright lights of the city in external scenes, and giving the film a glossy undertone during internal scenes; a highly unconventional technique, but one that reflects the tone perfectly.As with most of Marty's masterpieces, Casino is unique in the way that it dosen't follow a structured plot. Rather, the film is, for lack of a better phrase, a whole bunch of 'things' that happen, and how they impact on (or are caused by) the main characters. In fact, a positive aspect of the movie that isn't recognised by most is just how much influence the characters have on the story. The first half of the film is concerned with how Ace and Nicky run the casino: turning over profits, keeping customers happy and dealing with cheaters. The second half deals solely with each character's personal issues, and how they destroyed something so valuable from the inside out. We see how Ace's hustling wife Ginger (Sharon Stone, in a career-best performance) turns two former friends against each other, while slowly killing herself as well. There is no doubt that the events of the second half are on a smaller scale to those of the first, but so much more emphasis is placed on the former because of the magnetism and excellent performance of each actor.Drama is on high supply for the film's entire three-hour run time, but allows for some well- written comedy to complement the pace. For all the excellent younger actors Scorsese has worked with in the past decade, none of them convey the effortless on-screen chemistry of De Niro and Pesci, whether they are joking with each other, or wishing death upon one another. At its simplest, this can be called the ultimate guy's movie. It features shooting, swearing, suits, money, fast cars and even faster women. Delve a little deeper, and you'll appreciate the practically flawless acting, indulgent cinematography and a cautionary tale just as critical of greed and the flaws of human beings as Wall Street or Scarface. I take issue with this film's tagline: 'You don't stay at the top forever', because it will take one hell of an effort to knock Casino off this movie-lover's list of top 20 films.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one stays at the top forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a modern tragedy, 'Casino' is downright intoxicating. Every Martin Scorsese film is a wonderful gift, even the ever-so-slightly disappointing 'Shutter Island'.'Casino' charts the rise and fall of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) who is assigned the task of running a Las Vegas casino. Things go decidedly pear-shaped when his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) decides to join him in the gambling capital of the world. A real firebrand with a very short fuse, Nicky is violent and erratic and attracts too much negative attention. Soon things are spiralling dangerously out of control.Sam courts and marries a beautiful hustler named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in the performance of her career). But her surreptitious ongoing relationship with sleazy ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond (a wonderfully oleaginous performance by charismatic character actor James Woods) pushes Sam to the outer limits of his endurance.Like 'Goodfellas', 'Casino' is based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi. And while 'Casino' does not reach the dizzying heights that 'Goodfellas' did, it is still well worth your time. Sharon Stone steals every scene she is in; casting her was a big risk - she was perceived as more of a sex symbol than a serious actress - and it paid huge dividends. She delivers a bravura performance and is a genuine pleasure to watch. As Nicky, Joe Pesci simmers with that deadly rage which made his character of Tommy DeVito in 'Goodfellas' so frightening and so electric to watch. And in a straight role, Don Rickles is very good as Billy Sherbert.Clocking in at just under three hours in length, 'Casino' never feels overlong. And, once again, Scorsese fills the film with wonderful songs by artists such as Fleetwood Mac ('Go Your Own Way'), The Moody Blues ('Nights in White Satin'), and - of course - The Rolling Stones ('Long Long While' and 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking' (which opened the film 'Blow'). Lavish, violent, and almost operatic in its dramatic scope, 'Casino' is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Scorsese's underrated masterpiece. Party because it follows the better Goodfellas with the same actors playing similar characters and partly because of the subject matter. I read this book and the movie is pretty close. It's a good story - of course the real Ace wasn't the stud De Niro is but that's how movies go.I'm no Sharon Stone fan but she was good - can't help but feel after seeing her so many times this wasn't too far of a stretch for her. Oscar-worthy? I sure don't see it.Overall, great movie, I hope Scorsese can revisit this subject matter at least one more time in his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goodfellas and Casino are amongst my top 10 films of all time. Set in decadent yet trashy Las Vegas, Robert De Niro manages a casino and falls in love with Sharon Stone. Life is good, but the past soon catches up with you and endings aren't always happy. De Niro plays an outstanding performance, as does Pesci, these two really work well together and Sharon Stone also holds her own. The film successfully pulls you right into their world and you will be immersed in it. Scorcese is the master of this genre, and rightly so. Excellent story-line and a superb cast, directed by the Godfather of mob films - it simply ticks every box. I've watched it many times and NEVER tire of it. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God provides everyone what they deserve but doesn't fulfill their greed.. This statement holds truth for today's youth who wish to attain the height no one has ever reached without doing the required hard work.. Casino depicts this thought beautifully.. 2 Things.... This movie is FRESH cause it has an ensemble cast which looks good together.When I went to watch this movie, I thought this would surely be a copy of any Hollywood flick, but was surprised to see that it is not. Awesome... Brilliant... Superb... were the words coming out of the mouths of those coming out of the theaters after watching this movie.. Honestly speaking Casino's strengths lie in the chemistry amongst the main leads, as well as the little moments of nostalgia and cheeky references put in to good effect. It's not the perfect film, but it has plenty on offer especially when learning how to make it good while doing all the bad things, which at times does call for a certain stretch of the imagination to work, sprinkled with doses of humour in between the more exciting scenes of witnessing Bolly DeNiro's bold plans unfurl.

Nicky, played by Joe Pesci brings back the Tommy from Goodfellas in an even more sadistic but leadership kind of way. May not be the same wisdom as he had in Goodfellas, but much more of a brutal, ego filling mobster - at first protecting, but jeopardizing all the Mob influence had in Vegas which was the beginning of the end for them controlling casino's and their teamster ties. Scorsese masters the filmaking of these longtime actors, with Sharon Stone coming along for the ride, with truer feelings than in any other mob movie he has made. This was more, of a drama - soap opera than what can be called a mob movie. If you haven't seen it which is doubtful. You must see this movie which is probably the best casino movie of all time let alone, top 10 gangster movies of all time, with a comedic tone that never goes away. Fabulous as most are from Scorsese</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only seen about half of Scorsese's body of work, but I don't believe I would be too wrong in sticking my neck out and saying that Casino is probably his most entertaining movie. 'Cape Fear' was pretty much a solid thriller as well, but that film was a little too tense and frightening. This is really his one film where you can safely switch off your brain, and just relax and watch Scorsese do his thing. The fantastic visuals, the humour, the incredible sets and of course the masterful editing all together contribute to what is finally a lavish and jaw-dropping feast of a film. The way Scorsese directs his actors and sets his scenes with such utter perfection - the whole thing just makes you giddy with delight and blows your senses. Also, this movie is going to make you love 70s' American music - I guarantee it ! All the actors are a pleasure to watch here. In particular, James Woods as the "country club golf hustler" is hilarious - strange, why doesn't Scorsese cast him more often ?? Sadly the film is unable to keep up the kinetic pace of the first two hours, and becomes somewhat dull and overlong near the end. BUT - this film very much falls into the category of must-sees.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More influential than its given credit for being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is at its best when its essentially just a very stylish, masterfully done documentary on the history of Vegas and the back-room dealings with the mafia. The primary plot of the movie is good, but doesn't have the same kind of replay value and ultimately just above average.The film's dramatic story is good stuff, but what's important about "Casino" is the overarching information it reveals about Vegas, and the amazingly sleek and fun way it does so. Nearly 15 years after Casino, the story depicted in this movie has become essentially the official version of the history of Vegas. It's assumed that something more or less like what's depicted in the movie is what really happened in Vegas from the 1960s and 1970s. Most people don't want any more information - Scorsese's version of history is good enough. And why not? Some of the fine details are wrong, but Scorsese basically used a feature film to unveil to the public for the first time a generally accurate history of organized crime in Las Vegas. In many ways this is what Coppola did with the Godfather - no, every fact isn't true in either film, but both create a narrative, the general gist of which the public accepts as the story they want to believe about a certain chapter in the history of crime.The second reason "Casino" is so influential is purely stylistic. This movie is chock full of very indulgent, flashy scenes with very overt camera work, heavy narration, catchy music, busy scenes with dozens of characters at times, and generally a style that is very forceful and exciting. This sort of style seems to have become a mainstay of Hollywood films that were big-budget and looking for box office returns, but also wanted some respect from the critics. Some of the major films that fit that description over the next few years - Boogie Nights and Ocean's 11 pop to mind - hang their hat on scenes directed very much in the lavish, showy way Scorsese does so well in Casino.Altogether, "Casino" stops just short of delivering on the promise of its stellar first hour. Perhaps Scorsese wanted to avoid reusing too many of the devices he used to wrap up "Goodfellas", but unfortunately, with Scorcese putting away the cinematic fireworks after intermission, I think people remember all of the excitement of the first half, and the second half is just a blur of the stars gradually heading downhill in the predictable ways. Still, with a first half like that, the full film can't help but be a classic, if an uneven one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review: Casino (1995)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's Casino isn't as polished as his previous mafia masterpiece Goodfellas, but it is, nevertheless, another extraordinary entry into the director's astonishing body of work. Relying heavily on voice-over narration from both of its stars, the movie is a little sluggish in spots, making its running time of 178 minutes its most glaring flaw. However, the captivating performances of the three lead performers and the unrelenting violence overshadow enough of the film's minor flaws to make for a gritty, realistic experience of life in Las Vegas.Scorsese regular Robert De Niro stars as Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a gambling perfectionist who is hired by the Chicago Mob to run the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. Joe Pesci, in another psychopathic performance, co-stars as Rothstein's longtime friend Nicky Santoro, who is also sent to Vegas by the Chicago boys to keep the peace. After a very successful start in Vegas, Rothstein meets, and eventually marries, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).Ace starts his inevitable decline just about the time he convinces Ginger to marry him. Ginger isn't totally committed, and is in fact still seeing an old pimp (James Woods), while Ace is forced to trust Ginger with his life. This turns out to be his critical mistake as Ginger spends his money about as quickly as Ace steals the cash.While dealing with the Ginger fiasco, Ace also has to deal with his hot- head friend Nicky. By consistently cheating in the casino, Nicky puts himself in danger of not only being black booked, but also of tarnishing Ace's name. The friendship of the two men eventually decline over time as the power of greed effortlessly stars to control their lives.I cannot say enough about these three lead performances. Pesci gives a performance that is on par, if not better, than his Oscar-winning turn in Goodfellas. De Niro gives another controlled, almost mechanical performance. Even though it seems so effortless for him, the audience is still captivated. And then there is Sharon Stone playing the former call girl, drug-addict wife of a crooked casino manager. It a loaded character, and a loaded performance, but they come together perfectly.So much of the movie is built on the scenes of confrontation between the main characters, and they are done to perfection. The movie is about greed, lying, deceit, and double-crossing the people you are closest to. There are bound to be multiple scenes of altercation, and if they weren't done right, the movie would've lost a lot of steam. One scene in particular comes to mind of an argument between Ace and Nicky. The scene I'm thinking of features Pesci in a polished suit and De Niro in a striped robe (his wardrobe is unbelievable in the film ? in a good way), and I was in disbelief while watching the quarrel. The scene had to go on for about five minutes, and I'm sure a lot of the dialogue was improvised. The two actors, reminiscent of their roles in Goodfellas, are so perfectly cast that this brilliant scene seems so natural.The movie is filled with moments that remind us how polished of a filmmaker Scorsese is, and how polished his lead actors are. Some might argue that the main flaw of this movie is that it is almost a recreation of Goodfellas?Well, there is some truth to that, but that doesn't mean that after I finished this film I wasn't wishing for more of the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Triumph of Martin Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been fascinated by the Mafia underworld and I have admired Martin Scorsese's work since a young age. Scorsese has brought us several good gangland films, like Goodfellas in 1990 and The Departed in 2006. In between the two, he brought us Casino in 1995.Casino tells the story of Frank Rosenthal (Portayed by Robert De Niro under the name "Sam Rothstein") and Anthony Spilotro (Portrayed by Joe Pesci under the name of "Nicky Santoro). The film's subject is the 1970s casino skimming the mid-western Mafia families built an empire on. The movie is basically about two hoods from Chicago who get to the top of the world, only to be dragged back to the ground.The film is a first person narrative, much like Goodfellas. It is told from Nicky Santoro and Sam Rothstein's perspectives. One of the many attracting factors is that the film is Nicholas Pileggi, who wrote the novel of Casino and the novel of Goodfellas as well as being involved with both screenplays and Martin Scorsese, who directed, also wrote. The result of these two geniuses in their fields working together was a great script.The performances were also great. I believe Sharon Stone was nominating for an Oscar for her portrayal of Ginger McKenna (based on Geri McGee-Rosenthal), Sam's greedy wife. Joe Pesci, playing a similar role to what he did in Goodfellas, comes back with a vengeance as a brutal Mafia hit-man. And of course, Robert De Niro is great lead (as always), as the smart and cool Sam "Ace" Rothstein. The film also has a great supporting cast, including Don Rickles and Frank Vincent.All in all, Casino is a great movie. The movie is not as good as Goodfellas, but almost reaches the point to being just as good. I enjoyed both of them.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life's a gamble!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Running a casino is a very risky job. You'll make friends, you make enemies, you'll meet all sorts of characters. Robert De Niro plays Sam, a no-nonsense casino owner who will not tolerate any outside hustle. They take no guff in spotting a cheater. I like the part where the crew tortures one of the cheaters with the ball peen hammer to his hand. Joe Pesci is always at his best at playing a hot-headed ruffian. He seems to be the kind of person who don't tolerate disrespect. He takes out anyone, at anytime, anywhere. He's the problem solver so to say. Both DeNiro and Pesci are back as a team again since "Goodfellas", only this time it's mob free. However, Pesci's character is a lot shadier. So when he gets cut off, he goes berserk and tries to off him. He had to learn the hard way, on who his "friends" were when he and his brother were taken out in the cornfield and was whacked. Great movie great cast. Sharon Stone was at her best, James Woods was great, Don Rickles was neat. Enjoy this piece of work, because life's a gamble in Sin City!5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movies that will surely withstand any test of time , a modern gangster classic that is also a must-study material for any student of drama ,for any acting school, or a necessary reference for the quality adaptation of a high quality literature by N.Pileggi on par with M. Puzo's The Godfather! Everything in here has its place , meaning , reason ,the characters have their psychological depth ( e.g. : Ginger's pathological dependence on her low-life pimp, who doesn't have to raise a voice for her to fulfill any of his junkie whims combined with her obsession with jewelery , expensive clothes , cars, drugs ,and consequently her indifference towards her own daughter ). Las Vegas is shown as hell on Earth ,where all the glitz , music , the most beautiful dancers and most popular entertainers are but a dream , a facade , that must lure as many 'suckers' as possible ,who simply cannot win ,and even if they do , measures as taken to bring them back to the pools and tables ,where they are destined to lose more than they might have won the previous night , and no cheap gambling tricks of any kind are possible ,as everything is constantly watched by ex-cons now in employ with the casino, with the god himself ,Mr. Sam Rothstein , flawlessly portrayed by R.DeNiro,while the money is coming,and the casino itself is but a money-churning beast with areas sealed off even for the manager himself, and when the coffers are on time and full, 'cappi de tutti capi 'are smiling and satisfied regardless of the number of unmarked graves in the desert around !And this dream has to come to an end ,and when this happens ,everything goes , the guilty and less guilty are disappeared ,as is the case with one of the most disgusting graphic scenes ever towards the end ! M.Scorcese at his best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe It's Warmed Over "GoodFellas," But Left Overs Can Be Good Too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time, people largely dismissed "Casino" as a re-tread of "GoodFellas." Consensus was that Martin Scorsese had done it all before and done it better.There may be some truth to that claim, but "Casino" is still one hell of a wild ride, and it's impulsively watchable.Just as "GoodFellas" had nearly documentary-like segments devoted to the details of Mafia life, "Casino" takes the viewer behind the scenes of the gambling industry, and it's fascinating.The cast is uniformly fine. Sure, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are good in typical Scorsese-movie roles, but the standouts are Sharon Stone and James Woods as a loose cannon wife and a sleazy lover, respectively.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino shows us how cruel the Mafia really is. The betrayal,jealously,and greed. Pesci might play the exact same copy of his role in Goodfellas, but he is electric. Pesci was Cagney like in the role.Deniro the last time he worked with Scorsese. Is nothing but the same Deniro. Great,eccentric,and throws a twist in every scene. Some say the role is his last best role. Even though I beg to differ, but still brilliant.The shocker is Sharon Stone. Playing along Robert Deniro so well as his crazed wife. She was greedy and surreptitious. Just couldn't take your eyes off Stone.Of course the great direction of Scorsese. Even though Casino isn't anywhere near Goodfellas. But it is the utmost typical Mafia Film. But of the cleashay, it is the best of the cleashay. Much like Scarface, over the top. But still a great movie.</fullReview>

The story is something that will keep you on the edge of your seat a complete drama that you won't ever want to miss. When i first bought it because i had heard it was a great movie. After it was over i came out in a daze. It was so much to take in. In one great movie. I couldn't stop watching it after that and i watched it every day after that. The cast was incredible and well picked. It had something in store for anyone who loves a good gambler movie. It shows Las Vegas at its baddest. It shows you what you really want to know. Joe Pesci was a great Nicky. He did a good job at being the crazy bad boy. Robert Deniro, did an amazing main character. This is my all time favorite Deniro movie and that is saying a lot because he is an amazing actor. A most see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First 1.5 hours and last .5 hours are a solid mob movie with good story and acting. I'm not always the fan of these movies, but with history as a back drop, it's interesting in Casino. Well produced, interesting, multiple points of view, some insights into how Vegas worked before the corporations took over.Then there's that one hour which is a melodramatic piece of junk with Sharon Stone over acting, DeNiro under acting, Joe Pesci being Joe Pesci, and a lot of divorce and relationship garbage that nobody cares about. Are the story points necessary for the film? Maybe. But they could have been handled in 5 minutes of scenes, not an hour of blech. I don't know what Marty was thinking here, but it keeps this movie from being one of the better films of all time. It's not something you can watch over and over because of this shortcoming. Well, I suppose you can just skip that whole hour...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Destruction Of A Criminal Empire - 70's Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When released in 1995, Casino was dismissed by many as Scorsese attempting to remake his own GoodFellas. But the movie, although quite similar to GoodFellas in many respects, stands on it's own. A most fast-paced 3 hour movie containing no unnecessary tedious scenes to slow it down, never failing at any opportunity to fascinate and entertain the viewer. Enter Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a brilliant sports handicapper who takes his talents to Vegas. Ace's uncommon expertise and success with making the world of gambling pay off naturally attracts the wrong type of people in the likes of old hometown buddy now heavily connected with the Mob Nicky (Joe Pesci), and the romantic object of his affection Ginger (Sharon Stone). Sam unfortunately takes a gamble on these two and the results don't pay off as well as he would have liked. Neither Ace or Nicky are a match for Ginger, who gets in between them and ultimately plays them both for a couple of tricks.One of the film's remarkable achievements is how expertly the story is told, and Scorsese's ability to cram so many rich details into such a short amount of screen time frequently throughout. An example of this is where DeNiro's character catches on to a couple of card players using a sophisticated cheating technique so they can communicate with one another morse code style to inform each other of their opponents' playing cards which they can see from opposing tables. The way Scorsese can illustrate such rich details during a brief montage showing how the players are able to incorporate this scam to the beat of the Jeff Beck Group's "I Ain't Superstitious" is like watching a master teaching a free class to show how it's done for other director-wannabes.Casino also of course features fine performances from the cast - many of whom also actually happened to appear in GoodFellas. Watch for a clever nod to Frank Vincent's "Billy Batts" role in GoodFellas towards the film's conclusion.A masterpiece in direction, film editing, and storytelling, Casino contains scenes which may be considered by some as excessively violent, and must also hold some sort of record for the amount of "F" words ever said in a film. Literally every line of dialog contains the word or variations on it. The easily offended may want to steer clear.Certainly one of the great films in the Scorsese canon which makes for a fine companion piece for his groundbreaking classic GoodFellas. I hope Scorsese makes one final mobster film with DeNiro and Pesci. Casino proves that, as far these three are concerned, you can't get much better of a combination as far as movies go. Should my wish come true, hopefully Mr. Scorsese can find another classic rock song to put on the soundtrack to fit the mood of the story besides "Gimme Shelter" - also featured prominently in GoodFellas and The Departed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The obvious is obvious: gambling is not as great an evil as once thought, gangsters make for good entertainment, and Scorsese is a master of keeping a yarn from getting tangled. The real star of the movie is not Scorsese, not Joe Pesci's great turn as an out of control mob boss, not even Las Vegas herself, which is such a great focus of the film. The star of the film was De Niro's talent and sensitivity in portraying a man who is never sensitive himself. Rothstein is fascinating, and as a character should stand Hamlet's modern equivalent in complexity. This movie draws a lot on the noir classic "Gilda," except without the indulgence of a good guy. Despite all of the action and violence, this is a very deep picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves 10 out of 10 but i gave it a 9 because it had a point where the movie dragged a bit. Bottomline is this movie is brilliant and beautifully written. One thing i absolutely loved about this movie is the narrative style that the director employed in this film, it gives the viewer the capacity to meticulously understand and follow what is going on the movie and why certain people (Joe Pesci) are just the way they are. I must give kudos to Sharon Stone she was absolutely brilliant in this film. Robert DeNiro was and is mostly always absolutely brilliant in every movie he's in. But for me Joe Pesci stole this film he was absolutely hilarious. Don't get me wrong this movie was in no way comedic, but Joe somehow made you laugh the way he had absolutely no respect for anybody whatsoever, thanks to him i now know what a "Sand Ni*ger" is (ha ha ha)....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Career-best for all involved. The three hours will just fly by</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese's follow-up to Goodfellas is a monstrously entertaining drama about a mafia run casino in Vegas. Robert De Niro plays the chain-smoking control freak Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of the Tangiers casino by his mob buddies, most notably Nicky Santoro. Santoro is played by the one and only Joe Pesci, who may very well have topped his performance in Goodfellas. Nicky is a killer, thief, gambler, and muscle-man, who wants the world and is willing to go over the heads of his bosses to get it. Sharon Stone completes the trifecta of immorality as Ginger, a hustler who Sam convinces to marry him even though he knows she doesn't love him. Though the movie is largely the story of the mob embezzlement of Vegas, and the inner-workings, dynamics and politics of running a casino, the relationship between the three main characters is key to the plot.The plot is told unconventionally, and as the story takes place over the span of ten years, many of its scenes feel like anecdotes. But each one adds something great to the whole story. Everything builds to something, there's not one wasted second in the entire 3 hours. It seems to go by very quickly because it is so entertaining. The three leads are absolutely flawless and the drama that unfolds is truly engrossing. All three change as the movie progresses. Ginger starts off as a happy, free-spirited woman, but when she marries Sam she starts a descent into darkness. Sam's controlling tendencies are largely to blame for her slide into drug abuse, greed and compulsive lying. She resents him controlling her, he doesn't trust her enough to give her any space. She spirals further by running away with their kid and Lester, then later tying the kid to the bed when she went out to drink. Sam is the kind of person who tries to do the right thing in all situations, but with Ginger he sometimes overreacts and escalates problems further. Their deteriorating relationship threatens to sink the whole casino scam.Meanwhile Sam's over-protectiveness of his own casino lands him in hot water with the gaming commission, and Nicky's own actions make him a target for the FBI. Both are unable to let go of the monster that they created, Nicky refusing to leave town to let the heat on him cool down, and Sam unable to step out of the limelight of running the casino. The relationship between Nicky and Ginger is interesting because for once we see a human side of Nicky. She ends up sleeping with him, complicating things further. When the house of cards quite literally comes down, the bullets fly in classic Scorsese style. Only Sam is left unscathed, somehow coming full circle, hopefully a much wiser man.Scorsese directs this movie at full-speed, tearing open the rotten underside of Vegas in the 1970s for all to see. From taking us into the inner workings of casinos, to mob shakedowns, husband and wife quarrels, political manoeuvring, and tying it all together, you're always involved. This is a must-see film and one of the best of the 90's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the great Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese released Casino, a very similar movie with a few of the same actors, and I think I actually prefer this one to its predecessor, by a small margin. Casino is embellished with a lot of flashy overhead shots of nighttime Las Vegas, but underneath all that, you'll find a compelling and gritty drama full of great characters, a complex and winding plot that will have you stuck to your seat for the full three hours - not an easy feat, I might add - with multiple subplots that all remain interesting. They intertwine and twist into the great drama that is the individual man's life, and there are countless scenes here that will remain memorable: the introduction of each major character, Joe Pesci interacting with his young son, Sharon Stone interacting with her leeching ex-boyfriend, the scene where Robert DeNiro stands in the desert as the dust from Pesci's car kicks up around him, and the countless scenes of upper-class suburban Los Vegas juxtaposed with the chaotic, grimy personal lives of those who inhabit it.This movie is pretty long, so if you are not the type who likes to sit down for three straight hours, then I wouldn't recommend this one to you, but for everyone else, feast away. Martin Scorsese's Casino is always realistic, stirring and memorable, so go see it if you haven't already. Superlative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating movie yet a bit too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I have to admit Martin Scorcese hasn't disappointed me yet. After having seen Taxi driver, Raging Bull(two of my favourites) and Goodfellas, I began to watch Casino expecting to be disappointed(because it can't surely be as good as the three I mentioned!). But it is quite impressive. The basic plot line is about a man named Sam "Ace" Rothstein(Robert de niro) who is put in charge of managing a profitable casino, one of the biggest in Las Vegas.Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci) is sent along with him to Las Vegas in order to protect him. Sharon Stone also stars as a woman named Ginger whom Sam later marries. The movie first details the intricacies of the casino business and the fake unlikeable nature of the people there. It then details the fall of Ace Rothstein and his buddies. I was quite surprised with the detailed description of the casino business. This is something that I had not expected(I had expected a straight forward gangster story and instead I get a fascinating portrayal of the casino business. I was enthralled by the working of the casinos(maybe sometime I have to travel to Las Vegas!). Any person interested in the gambling business and the crime network in US should watch this movie. It is interesting to watch the way these casino owners "skim the top of the profits" and masquerade it under the legitimate business banner. Another aspect that I liked about this movie is the totally unlikeable characters. Only Raging Bull(of scorcese movies) has this kind of a unlikeability and most people are likely to be turned off by that. I do agree it has shades of Goodfellas but I don't agree that it imitates that movie. There are many differences in the characters themselves. For example, the character of Nicky Santoro is quite different from Tommy of Goodfellas. Nicky is a cold, calculated person who doesn't mind doing the dirty work. But he isn't exactly egoistic or impulsive. He is mostly level headed. Sure he resorts to violence in the same way as Tommy but Tommy had different motives. Nicky is quite clever and not impulsive. The performances are quite noteworthy. I was most impressed by Sharon stone's portrayal of the gold digger Ginger. It was a multifaceted performance that showed the different sides to Ginger in this movie(It is weird we don't see much of Sharon stone nowadays, she had so much promise). Ginger is not just greedy, she has a sensitive side, she has weaknesses, she is just human. She is not portrayed as any worse than the rest of the cast. Most of the time we don't sympathize with the main characters because they are so unlikeable. Robert De Niro's performance as Sam Rothstein is quite good and he excels in the scenes where he is totally clueless and exasperated as to how to handle his wife. His contrast to the cool and calm type of character in the first half of the movie is noticeable and that adds to the excellence of his performance. Joe Pesci(he is fast becoming one of my favourite actors) is quite exceptional in this. The scene where he confronts Ace is an example. One of the things that may trouble viewers a bit is the complexity of the plot. There are many characters and incidents and sometimes people may not be able to keep track. But I loved the complexity aspect and it just reflects the amount of hard work put in by Martin scorcese and the crew. So what is the negative aspect? It might be the length. It is too long(even for a Scorcese epic) and it might be a bit too much for some people who are not used to such long movies. I don't mind long movies but I feel the length could have been shortened. But I don't understand which can be removed as almost all scenes are central to the character development. My rating 9/10(the length is somewhat of a problem)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any film that start with Bach's St Mathew Passion either has delusions of considerable grandeur or is going to be a tragic tale of moral comeuppance. Fortunately - we've come to the cinema to be entertained - we get both in equal measure in this Goodfellas-in-the-workplace drama. Joe Pesci continues the concentrated streak of spittle-flecked nastiness with which he burned evry brightly in the early 90s. Robert De Niro is very effective, slow burning and unsettling.The big draw for me is the surprising, standout performance of Sharon Stone, remoulding the Pfeiffer/dePalma/Scarface moll as a sassy opportunist. For, in fact, Casino isn't primarily a film about gangsters but about a casino: the game, the society, the power struggles. It shows how in trying to twist fate to work unfailingly and consistently to advantage, corruption is as inevitable as mildew. To this end I also like the considerable support cast, be they heavies, players, feds or extras playing with realism. Scorsese keeps the film zippy for all its length (it's a good movie to compare with The Departed) and Bach is just the opening gambit in another fine soundtrack selection. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino can be considered as one of the best entertaining movies ever made. Martin Scorcessee keeps you tied to the seat throughout the movie. Usually, I don't like Joe Pesci's work, but the role he played in this one can be considered as the performance of his life. No other actor has scared the sh*t out of me as Joe Pesci does here. In real life, I'd never like to come across someone like Nicky (Joe Pesci). Not to forget Sharon Stone. I am pretty sure that no other actress could have played Ginger. Again, this can be considered as the best performance by an actress. DeNiro is as usual at his best. As for Scorcesse, he's made one of the Hollywood's greatest movies of all time. I give 10/10. This should be listed in first 5 on the IMDb's list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Absolute Favorites!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ranking along with my all time favourite films, Casino is based on the true story of Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal and Anthony "The Ant" Splitoro renamed Sam "Ace" Rothstein and Nicky Santoro for the film.Playing Sam Rothstein is none other than Robert De Niro, supported by Sharon Stone as Ginger Rothstein, Sam's wife, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, Sam's friend. There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?!De Niro is fantastic (as usual) and really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board, easily one of his greatest roles.This is also Sharon Stone's best performance, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with horrific consequences, Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nomination.And of course there's Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing, hilarious yet completely disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker, It's an incredible performance and ranks up there with his best.The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything to the viewer without ever making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.Overall, this is one of my favourite films of all time and definitely one of my favourite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino its my favorite casino movie,but my favorite casino online is www.s7vencasino.com Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my "Rober DeNiro: A history of his films" that Sharon over shined both Joe's and Robert's performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has "hired" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace "I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I'm not protecting you anymore!", you get scarred and can't help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what's coming to her, that's what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casino,,, vegas style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First i don't think that this is a sequel to Goodfellas in any way shape or form,, I loved this movie from start to finish,, i am a big Deniro/Pesci fan,, i loved seeing Don Rickles in here as well,, Sharon Stone was hot in here as per usual. This movie is based on a true story as well,, It takes place in the 70's at the Vegas heyday,, when the mobsters were right in the thick of things in the Casino industry,, the Teamsters Pension fund to be exact.. The cast of characters in this movie is just endless,, like James Woods a small role, but very effective in here. The plot is very good ,, the bosses give Sam "Ace" Rothstein a casino to run,, hire a front man,, to make things look on the up and up,, and then the midwest bosses start skimming the casino,, ie. doing short counts,, losing fill slips... and what really does it for me, is the accuracy of filming in the count room,, i used to get in the count room when i worked the casino's "back east" in the late 80's and 90's, and it's pretty accurate,, cept for maybe the guy in the suit coming in and walking back out,, that would never happen,but hey,, it's pretty accurate,, the hard count room,, soft count room,, the cage,, all of that is real casino stuff,, i spent 10 years in one.. anyway back to the movie,, i thought that it was wonderful,, Robert Deniro has all of the class , charm , and charisma you could ask for ,, Joe Pesci,, steals the shows for me,, as the muscle in the movie,, i mean puttting a man's head in a vice,, very neat idea ,, if you wanna get information out of him,, all in all i would recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of gangster movies.. 10 of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Italian Trilogy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third movie in what I call "The Italian Trilogy", 1)Raging Bull, 2)Goodfellas, 3)Casino. Every time it comes on Bravo or USA I find myself trapped in front of it (despite the bad dubbing). I used to think the movie was just Scorsese's manufactured form, but I believe now the movie is inspired from start to finish--from Deniro's silhouette floating in the fire during the opening credits and operatic music to him at the desk with the giant eyeglasses at the end saying "And that's that." Stone, Pesci and Deniro were all good enough to be nominated--too bad Sharon didn't win. Even James Woods was good as Sharon's old boyfriend. Its just one great scene after another for the whole three or four hours, peaking with their meeting in the desert ("...you're only out here because a ME!") The movie works on every level, the acting, screenplay, directing and everything else in between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scorsese spell...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During its first forty minutes, Martin Scorsese's "Casino" is pure narration, except for little spoken moments. It's a risky move, but then Marty has always been risky, and this movie may be the ultimate example to prove it. Closing in at three hours duration time, it takes its characters on a roller-coaster ride that not everyone might appreciate; from the advantages of recurrent fortune to the regular Scorsese tragedy.That's cutting it short, because there's a lot in the middle, but without telling you 'what' exactly goes on in "Casino", I'll tell you how you can approach it as a film. When Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is put in charge of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas, he sees it as the perfect chance to erase the obscure past we call carry with us. However, his best friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) is not fond of legitimacy; and when he settles in Vegas to protect him, it's not long until he starts doing some business of his own. As Nicky himself puts it: "The dollar?Always the dollar". But if we go back, Nicky also expresses at the beginning: "It was perfect. Sam was the perfect guy to run the casino and he had me, his best friend, and Ginger, the woman he loved". We see Ginger (a monumental Sharon Stone) at first as Sam sees her, a light in the middle of the room (there's one scene where this translates literally in images, with Robert Richardson's cinematography-that contains a wonderful use of light-putting the rest of the room in a mild darkness, while De Niro stands in awe as Stone walks and works the room accompanied by a constant light), but she is actually the most complex character of the film.If you approach "Casino" as a movie to see the inside movement of the casino business and its ups and downs (a subject the film manages perfectly), you may not notice the complexity of Stone's character and her performance. But then, if you view the film as the study of the consequences of an arranged marriage and life, you might miss the best element of the film: Joe Pesci's creation of Nicky; something that's indeed better than his work in "Goodfellas".Ultimately, you may choose to take "Casino" as the story of a long-time friendship and the betrayals that come with the years because people change and want different things from life. Again, this (as the marriage thing) is a subject that the film dominates. That's how brilliant Nicholas Pilleggi's-together with Scorsese-adaptation of his own book is; it covers everything with every detail. They did the same thing with "Goodfellas" and it was so rich that you could get lost in the 'mafia' universe. Here, as in "Goodfelas" (both film share many similarities, more than anything in the ongoing decay of certain characters and images that seem obvious copies from the 1990 film and speak by themselves, about how great both movies are and that these similarities don't change that fact at all), you have to try to follow every plot line in order to witness every scene exactly as what it means in the movie. It's the only way you'll enjoy the many conversations between Sam and Nick that lie between the best of the film and, besides showing that De Niro is the best when it comes to calming someone down and/or persuading him to make another decision; but Pesci is better because his stubbornness allows him to evade discussions and therefore cause the other more trouble (also that both know each other by heart so the work together is pure pleasure), are crucial to its development. The narration comes and goes during the film, in present or past time, generating more confusion for the viewer. This is all after the first hour and a half, and if you're not hypnotized by the film's spell at that point, something must be wrong. Is the movie too long? Yes, if the spell didn't work on you; but if you're already connected with the characters and don't want to get out, it makes no difference if it lasts three or five hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"For guys like us, Las Vegas washes away our sins. It's like a morality car wash"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps proving the theory of cinema bringing to life the dark desires audience members dare not act out, the American film industry and audiences alike have always demonstrated a perverse fascination with the crime epic - films detailing the illustrious life of those prospering off a life of breaching conventional codes of ethics. Such is a theme that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese has returned to time and time again: demonstrating the pros and cons of a life lived on the other side of the law. And while Scorsese's mob classic Goodfellas charted the rise of a lowly hood through the ranks of the mob, Casino details the contrary: a life of luxury at the top of the mob, the consumption of man's soul by greed, betrayal and maddening violence, and the inevitable plummet which ensues. Although comparisons to Goodfellas may prove inevitable, (given the similar subject matter, stylistic narrative and cinematic techniques, use of brutal violence and even the re-use of actors De Niro and Pesci) to fail to recognize the staggering accomplishment that is Casino, similarities or not, would be unforgivable. Ultimately the two are entirely different animals, as Casino, despite its glitzy exterior, demonstrates a distinctly darker storyline throughout, as its meticulously constructed, precariously balanced criminal organization begins to be torn apart from the foundations, with cataclysmic outcomes. The script, written by Nicholas Pileggi (working from his own source novel) and Scorsese himself is a fiercely memorable piece of work, punctuated with harshly realistic characters and scenarios, and a slew of maliciously well crafted lines. Although De Niro and Pesci's dual voiceovers can be slightly distracting, leading one to believe that the film might have benefited from the elimination of the Pesci voice-over all together, they do provide intriguing contrasting sides of the same story, and one can hardly fault the writers for experimenting. The legendary Scorsese is operating at the top of his game here, bringing all of his trademark meticulous professionalism to play with devastatingly effective results. By moving his film along at a steady, blistering pace, yet still taking his time, allowing his characters to slowly unfold throughout and giving the audience plenty of time to drink in the seductive yet tainted luxury of the lifestyles of high profile casino officials, Scorsese uses his film's hefty duration to his advantage, immersing the audience within his story in a truly peerless fashion. With typically superb neo-noir style cinematography (with many lengthy sweeping shots, capturing the breadth of the casino in all of its hedonistic glory) and editing, and enormously well complimented by one of his patented soundtrack amalgamations, Scorsese's work similarly excels on a technical front, making for a supremely impressive piece of film-making. As per usual, Scorsese extracts riveting intensity and realism from his cast, with captivating results. Robert De Niro inhabits the role of casino owner Sam 'Ace' Rothstein with a masterful conviction and charisma, dispelling all fears of him coasting by on such an admittably familiar role. Joe Pesci runs the risk of being forever typecast in a role only a shade away from his performance in Goodfellas, but fiercely proves his peerless status in inhabiting psychopathic loose-cannon mobsters. Sharon Stone delivers a surprisingly powerful performance as Rothstein's endlessly greedy drug-addict trophy wife, entirely believable as her character arcs from smoothly manipulative to dizzyingly cocaine-addled and truly pathetic. Don Rickles is a charming presence as Rothstein's right hand man in the casino, and Frank Vincent gives a strong performance as a suspicious fellow member of the mob. James Woods proves grotesquely memorable as Stone's past pimp boyfriend, and Woods shines in his few scenes, chewing the scenery with disconcerting aplomb. Kevin Pollack also impresses as a smooth talking "front man" for the more sinister undertones of the casino.Brutally intense and endlessly fascinating, Scorsese's crime epic delivers a sufficiently flooring clout to easily merit distinction from Goodfellas' shadow. A masterclass of brilliant writing, blistering acting and disturbingly realistic thematic content, Casino proves another towering accomplishment from the incomparable Scorsese, one worth seeing by any in search of searingly powerful and impeccably crafted film-making. -10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had bought my-self a copy of Casino a while back ago but never did get round to watching it, however on Sunday I did as I thought I would keep up with my gangster movie phase I am going through, however unfortunately whilst watching it , my disc messed up and I got annoyed as anything (never purchase second hand DVD's). However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10 You Don't Stay At The Top Forever...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is my favorite movie of all time. It captures the glamor of Las Vegas and its films like these that I yearn to go. The film is about how the mob controlled Las Vegas and how at the end it brought them down at the end. This movie is in a way like Goodfellas in that is was directed by Martin Scorsese, based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi who also wrote the screenplay, has Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent and is about rise and fall in the mob. I think its better than Goodfellas even though Goodfellas is also amazing and would be my 2nd favorite film. Casino is so great. It has a colorful feel to it and shows the wealth in it. The performances are unbelievable. Robert De Niro is great as Sam "Ace" Rothstein the head of the casino. Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing as Nicky Santoro the psychopath who is sent to protect Sam. Sharon Stone is in a career best performance as Rothsteins wife. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and Scorsese's best. Casino is my favorite movie and Scorese's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In typical gangster films what is the common theme and emotion that you get from them? the answer is you tend to not feel to much emotion towards the gangsters actions however Casino is much different I Felt so angry, upset and so sorry for Bob Deniro in this as his role played to perfection as always. Did anyone else wanna go into the film and beat the s*** out of Sharon Stone ha ha. Thats exactly what i am trying to get at. The acting is on another level, so amazing that These emotions were brought out by the audience watching! Sharon Stone's Excellent performance as Ginger i thought stole the show. A straight up lovable hustler turned drug addict. Stone not only en captivates the role and fits the image, she also nails what i think, is the best performance of her career.Robert Deniro as Sam Rothstein once again consistency is the true mark of a great actor and Deniro nails this role to a tee as always. I see Sam as the Good guy of the movie! A good man who just wants a quiet life we as the audience feel compassion towards him throughout and i sense of sorriness as he loses all of his riches Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro amazing as always in this film i see him as the Lovable character, the moments of comedy, the vicious streak all together make such a great personality This film could be Scorsese's best however many opinions will fly around and at the end of the day it becomes hard to say which is his best Casino 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is yet another one of Martin Scorsese's gangster masterpieces that went platinum. The delivered performance by the actors, the perfect shooting locations and the wonderful directing by Scorsese makes it a true Oscar dramatic film. Robert De Niro portrays Sam "Ace" Rosthein, a powerful casino owner determined to run his Tangiers casino as smoothly as possible. He meets Ginger McKenna, a passionate high roller whom he gets infatuated with at first sight and is also faced with a threat; Nicky Santoro, his childhood friend and a violent man. As the Mafia game rolls, Ace plays by the rules but Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat and try to scramble their way to the top. Slowly, bit by bit, the mob starts to fall apart and the FBI gets aware of everything that goes on. A brilliant film based on a true story. Sharon Stone won a Golden Globe for best actress. It also happens to be Martin Scorsese's last collaboration with Robert De Niro with Scorsese as a director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made by Martin Scorcese in the mid-1990's about Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is an undeniable fact. Unless he made some other movie about Las Vegas around the same time that his name wasn't attached to. Like Leaving Las Vegas, or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or Vegas Vacation. Even some dull video for the city to attract tourists would have been an improvement.Imagine Goodfellas without Ray Liotta and his oddly charming narration. You'll end up with something like this. Basically a remake minus the only interesting character. It'd be like making Pirates with just Orlando Bloom and that anorexic girl and her freakishly long neck. EAT SOMETHING! Wear shoulder pads too. Every time I see the end of that movie where she's standing way up over the rocks it looks like her head is going to fall right off that skinny neck of hers. I just can't watch it. And I can't watch this either, but that's not her fault. It's just two guys doing the same thing they've done a million times before sleepwalking for 3 hours so they can pick up an easy paycheck while that guy with the big eyebrows sits back and tells them to hurry up and get it over with so he can ditch them and start a new life with Leonardo DiCaprio. And who can blame him. Leo is younger and much more handsome.</fullReview>

As you watch the movie, you start to feel sympathetic for him and all his problems. Its also great because the current Las Vegas Mayor, Oscar Goodman, plays himself in the film.

The reason this is especially true when De Niro and Pesci are ideally placed for comparison between both movies and they were better in Goodfellas.With this in mind, the acting is generally excellent even though the characters are pretty unlovable ones.No one in the entire story has any good qualities to speak of, which tends to distance the audience from them.The story itself is weak and a tad extended, stretching (as it does) a 2-hour story into a 3-hour epic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese is a director who keeps on delivering every time. This is a movie set in 1970s Las Vegas and involves Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a man who is given a casino job. His reflections on Las Vegas are timeless like when he compares it to Disneyland. His life is constantly ruined as well. His old friend Nicky (the brilliant Joe Pesci) is a violent psychopath who makes his mark in Las Vegas as Ace's muscle and as a complete madman. His most violent escapade includes stabbing a man to death with a pen. Nasty Stuff. He ends up betraying Ace by making love to his wife. He dies in a cornfield with his brother. The love in Ace's life is a prostitute by the name of Ginger Mckenna (Sharon Stone in a brilliant role). She constantly betrays Ace by trying to steal their daughter and leaving with her boyfriend Lester (James Woods). They leave each other and she dies a loner and a addict. All these elements screw his life up and his casino is demolished he returns to his old job as a sports handicapper. All in all a great movie but not Martins best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is a film about the mob empire that secretly ran Las Vegas in the 1970's and early 80's. Casino follow's Sam "Ace" Rothstein(Robert Deniro), a professional gambler who is given the task by the Mafia to run a casino in Las Vegas. His good old neighborhood friend, Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci), is a wild, demonic gangster that is assigned to watch Ace's back. Ginger(Sharon Stone) is a hustler and ex-prostitute that Ace falls in love with. All three main characters have flaws. Some have minor flaws while others have major flaws. Each character's flaw leads them to their own demise. Casino is a film about money, power, and greed. This gripping tale show's how something good can go straight to hell.The characters are well developed. Ace is a cool character. He is a pretty smart guy and is a perfectionist. He is the best at what he does and he knows it. And what he does is illegal, but he does it in a clean way. But Nicky on the other hand is not a clean guy. His business is roughing people up and stealing. He is the muscle of the Mafia in Vegas and his job is to make sure know one messes with Ace and that know one messes up the money making scheme. Both Ace and Nicky are street guys who have been given the chance to do something big with their lives. When they each moved to Vegas they both had their own small goals and then one main goal that they both shared and that was making money for the Bosses back home. Then Ace meets Ginger. And everything gets turned upside down. Ginger is a hustler with a rough past, but Ace is drawn to her. Her beauty and style mesmerizes Ace. There is something about her that makes Ace go wild. Ace falls for Ginger and they get married. But even before they get married the viewer sees some instability in Ginger. And when she finally is married all of her instability is put on display. Half of her instability comes from her continued relationship with her ex-pimp, Lester Diamond(James Woods). Lester is a true sleezeball. Lester continually uses Ginger for money. His actions and even the way he dresses completely sells him as a sleezeball. These four great characters intertwine through the film creating great drama.Ace is the main protagonist. Ace has to push to get his gaming license in order to run his casino. Nicky creates a bad rap for Ace and the casino because of all his suspicions in crime. Nicky eventually ends up starting his own gang and begins robbing the locals of Las Vegas. Meanwhile Ace has a troubled marriage with Ginger. Ginger becomes more and more unstable. Ginger becomes an alcoholic and eventually a drug addict. She cheats on Ace with Lester and eventually with Nicky. Ace suspects that this is going. But he cannot stop loving Ginger. No matter how crazy she becomes he always gives in. Ace thought he could change Ginger by marrying her but all she wanted was his money. Ace himself becomes absorbed with the casino and his power. And Nicky is overwhelmed by greed. Nicky's goal is to take over the thrown in Vegas. In the end the Mob empire in Las Vegas collapses as do the lives of Ace, Ginger, and Nicky. There is one criticism I have on this film. I would like to comment on the narration. The film is filled with narration. The first narrator is Ace and the other is Nicky. The first hour of the film is like a documentary of Las Vegas in the 1970's. There are brief pauses with actual dialog but they are only brief. The narration continues through the movie but lessens in the second half. But never goes away I might add. The narration did do a good job of filling in the gaps. Sort of like Goodfellas. I liked Ace's narration but I felt annoyed by Nicky's. I didn't think it was needed. Deniro's voice is smooth while Pesci's voice is kinda annoying. But who am I to criticize Martin Scorsese. If he wants two narrators then he can get two narrators. ACTING4. Joe Pesci plays the usual wacko gangster like in Goodfellas and he has it mastered. I have never met Joe Pesci and I'm sure he doesn't act like Nicky but he is so believable that you start to wonder if he acts like that in real life.3. James Woods plays Lester so wonderfully. He is the definition for creepy and slimy. He does a great job of being a low-life looser.2. Sharon Stone is the only woman who could play Ginger. I know a lot of people hate Sharon Stone and find her annoying, but in Casino you are supposed to hate her. And she does a good job of being the person you hate.1. Robert Deniro was in my opinion the most impressive in the film. I think this is one of his best if not the best performance of his career. He plays Sam "Ace" Rothstein so well. I cannot say that I like Ace but he's pretty cool. Deniro is so smooth. Even when he gets angry he is smooth. Deniro's performance was the best.OTHER ACTORS-- Don Rickels, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, and Frank Vincent also star in Casino and they do a great job with their more minor roles.WARNING!!!!! Casino is a very dark, brutal film. Full of very Strong, graphic, and brutal violence. There is also very strong language that is said through out the whole three hours of film. To finish I would like to say that Casino is a great film all around. With great acting, directing, and with a great story that is similar to a Shakespearean tragedy. Go watch it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow....just wow....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has gotta be the most underrated film ever. I think the reason why people don't consider this a classic is because everyone has to constantly compare this movie to Goodfellas and because of this they say that Casino is somewhat of a rip off of Goodfellas, WHY? Because it has a similar cast? BIG DEAL. In my opinion I actually think Casino is better and more enjoyable and not to mention more realistic, in the movie pretty much all the gangsters are extremely violent which is what gangsters are in real life, this case, you've gotta point out the character Nicky (Pesci) for that since there's a scene where he actually stabs a tough guy with a pen and makes him begging for his life and another when he crushes a guys head in a vise. And Ace (DeNiro) when he caught two cheaters in his casino and had one of them get his hand smashed with a hammer.The plot is very, very easy to get into. It explains how the Mafia controlled the casino in Las Vegas which created a sort of a multi-million dollar gambling empire and at the end the entire empire crumbled, just like that. It's a great story, I love it.The acting is excellent, Robert DeNiro is as good as ever, Joe Pesci always good at playing the violent psychotic gang member. And Sharon Stone should've won the Oscar that she was nominated for her flawless performance.This film is without a doubt worth watching and is one of Scorsese's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an movie what an movie. Shows the exact reality of life. You want to become a wise guy you want to reach the top,one thing you should never forget when you reach it is to not to forget where you started. When people who comes from streets become big wise guys when they have all the things they need they get f*** in there head. That what happened in this movie to Nicky. Ace kept his head up all the way except when he fell in love with a h****. That was a big mistake he did that cost him millions. As they always says never trust a woman, she'll make friends in to enemies take your money and give it to some other punk etc etc.. All these happens in real life. The only real wise guy in this movie was ACE. kept his head high never panicked. Only thing that went wrong for him was trusting his f***** wife too much. This movie was simply a work of genius. Great story line simply just flows with reality of life. Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci 's was outstanding in this movie. You can really get into the movie. My hats off for these three great actors. Martin Scorsese sir thank you for making this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise and fall of the Vegas I knew and loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, this film answers the question of what happened to the Las Vegas of the 70s and 80s that most of us experienced and loved. Ace makes the correct statement that now Vegas is the another DisneyWorld where you can take the whole family to be entertained. I remember when it was a little more adult entertainment - a great floor show, 99 cent T-bone dinners, and reasonably priced rooms - all subsidized by gambling. But what about the movie itself?... While watching the movie, I was reminded of a Saturday Night Live skit called "Low Class Italian Theater" presumably based on the film Raging Bull. The skit satirized movies with Italian men using the f-- word and accusing each other of sleeping with each other's wives. While I think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best films with superb acting by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone, I can't help but feel it is a little flawed by the constant verbal assault which is not totally germane to the movie. In fact, I heard more anti-Semitic remarks in this one movie than in my entire life. Furthermore, while Sharon Stone's acting was nothing short of brilliant, I think the pace of the movie could have progressed faster and the movie shortened if they had cut out much of her neurotic screwed-up wife routine. I also feel there was an audio assault with the excessive soundtracks. The acting and story line really spoke for itself and did not need every song that was added for dramatic emphasis. Nevertheless, in spite of these alleged shortcomings, I loved the movie and felt I was actually looking at a newsreel from 1973; it seemed that realistic. As mentioned before, the acting was superb and I can't believe there were not more Oscars won here. The fact that it was based on a true story only adds to its aura of a great film. Watch it when you have three hours to spare!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Ten Best Movies Ever Made !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a rare gem of a film which is based on the true story of Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal and Anthony "The Ant" Splitoro renamed Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro for the film.Playing Sam Rothstein is none other than Robert De Niro, supported by Sharon Stone as Ginger Rothstein, Sam's wife, and Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro, Sam's friend. There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?! De Niro really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is to women. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board this is arguably one of De Niro's finest performances This is also Sharon Stone's best performances, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with a certain horror Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nom But im afraid the real show stealer here is Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing and hilarious, yet disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker he should have won the Oscar that year without a doubt his best performance.The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything the viewer without making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.Overall, this is one of my favorite films of all time and definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film, valuing it has one of the ten best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From another reviewer about Joe Pesci: "He can act but he isn't all that good in the bad guy role. I dunno it just wasn't that good. It isn't worth the buy." Huh? Are you OK? Pesci is the perfect bad guy, and the film borders on perfection in my book. I love Rickles cast as the manager, and his joke about the private jet problems, "Hey, better down here than up there, you know what I mean". Pescis' scene rousting the 2 hoods inside the Tangiers is just typical of his acumen as an actor. The final scene of Sharon Stones' demise backed by the over-echoed Animals song "House of the Rising Sun" is sheer brilliance. Solid 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No One Stays at the Top Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not an easy task making my list of ten best films ever. In fact, the list is rarely altered. Martin Scorsese now holds three of those spots. His 1995 film, "Casino," is cinematic poetry and heart-wrenching tragedy rolled up into one. It is one of the best films ever made.Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a professional gambler, and one of the best of his time. The setting is 1973. Rothstein is connected with the Mafia, who wish to open a casino in Las Vegas. They realize Rothstein knows the business and they put him in charge. His boyhood friend, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) wants to give Vegas a try, and Rothstein has no objections. Eventually, the De Niro character falls in love with Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who may or may not have the same feelings towards him. As time passes, Nicky starts taking over the town of Las Vegas through murder and extortion. He is labeled the local mob boss, and this begins to cause trouble for Rothstein. The public exposes him and the casino of being mob-lead, and this movie is about how something so glamorous, can be turned so ugly, simply by the actions one decides to partake in.I don't think there's any question; Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors who ever lived. He manages to piece together perfection each time he makes a film. They are entertaining and magical, but remain harrowing and relevant. All film students should watch his technique carefully. No one, however, could impersonate his genius.The acting here is beyond great. Robert De Niro is absolutely fantastic as Ace Rothstein. He is one of the best actors who ever breathed, and he gives another example as to why. Sharon Stone does a wonderful job as the emotionally disrupt and confused wife of Rothstein. Joe Pesci as Nicky Santoro is superb. He is nothing short of brilliant in Scorsese pictures, and here, his streak continues. Great supporting performances from James Woods, Frank Vincent, and Kevin Pollak.One of the greatest things about this movie is the story. It all started brilliantly, and then it all turned around, simply because these people choose to live their life as they do. They're in it for the money, but what's the point of money when you lose everything because of the life you chose? The story is all the more fascinating knowing it's based on fact.The screenplay by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese is without flaw, and the dialogue is stunning.When you wrap everything together; the directing, the screenplay, the acting, and editing, you are reminded on the film's tag-line: "No One Stays at the Top Forevor." That may be, but this film might be at the top forever. Magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Cannot Buy Happiness Even at a Casino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The characters of Casino have everything that money can buy: beautiful cars, beautiful clothes, beautiful houses, and yet it is still not enough. The people that win the most money at the casinos are not the people that get the jack-pots. The money ultimately goes to the owners of the casinos. As pointed in the film, even the jack-pot and Black Jack winners end up being losers eventually if they play long enough.In the film "Casino" not even the people running the casinos win either in the end. They also eventually lose as if they had also played too long, which seems to be the message of Casino. Because no matter how much money is gained, the characters always want more, and they resort to acts of unspeakable cruelty to keep the money flowing, for themselves and their mob bosses back in Chicago who are financing the casino scheme.This is possibly Scorcese's most disturbing and violent film. The characters are compelling but none are particularly sympathetic. Rothstein, perfectly suited to actor Robert De Niro, seems the only character to at least have some kind of sensible code. But even he is not above resorting to acts of violence if anyone is caught cheating at his casino, The Tangiers.In addition to De Niro, the acting of the other cast members is equally first rate, with a tour-de-force performance by Sharon Stone as the most tragic character of the story. Her character, from the in-the-know casino hustler paying off the valets to the dependent drug-addict giving thousands of dollars to her old pimp and junkie, is completely believable from beginning to end. Pesci also turns in another fine performance very similar to the character he portrayed in Goodfellas as the ruthless jewel robber and murderer.The film is somewhat hampered by voice-overs that last too long in some places. The beginning voice-over makes sense as De Niro describes the operations of the casino. But then other characters chime in and it gets over burdensome. Also, the violent is incredibly graphic, even for Scorcese. Definitely not for all tastes and certainly NOT for children.Still, despite some misgivings, Casino is still a great film. Maybe neither an Oscar winner nor Scorcese's best but certainly the director's most ambitious project.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese knows how to make an interesting movie. What's great about Casino is how real the violence and emotions of the characters are. First is the acting. Sharon Stone gives a terrific performance and Ginger, the out of control don't-you-know-she'll-be-trouble-girl. Robert DeNiro as Ace is also a very wise choice, because DeNiro can play the complete opposite of his character in Goodfellas. Jimmy in Goodfellas was a strong and intimidating man, while Ace is always hiding behind Nicky. Speaking of Nicky, Joe Pesci gives, I think, an even better performance than in Goodfellas. His character doesn't look like much, but his acting makes him so much bigger. Also, the chemistry between the three is outstanding. For example, when Ace confronts Ginger after they leave the restaurant. You see Ace's absolute disgust of Ginger. And, when Nicky and Ace meet. Joe Pesci doesn't give 'forced anger' like so many other actors. The viewer feels like they are watching their conversation.Next, the story. Pileggi and Scorsese really tap into life in the Mafia. We see what really happened during those times, and how corrupt the whole system was. We also see how the mob dealt with its problems. Through violence.Next, the violence. Scorsese shows us the twisted way the mob dealt with its problems. The torture scene is incredible. I found myself disgusted with it, but at the same time, I couldn't look away. Scorsese knows how to draw the viewer in. We may not like what we see, but we are attracted to it anyway.And finally, the music. The music really fits with the mood of the scene. The 'I can't get no satisfaction' song goes perfect with the confrontation between Ace and Ginger after they leave the restaurant. The music is basically telling the story for us. Ace 'can't get no satisfaction.'Truly a wonderful film. Scorsese creates another visual masterpiece for the ages. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you expect when Rob Deniro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, James Woods and Martin Scorsese put their heads together to make something for the viewers? Right, a masterpiece. Flawless, beautiful, bad ... brilliant is what Casino is. Las Vegas, the late Seventies, early Eighties, a place in the middle of nowhere set up only to make money for the big bosses and the fast hustlers. Just like Deniro puts it: the players don't stand a chance. Of course with lots of money comes lots of trouble ... and lots of killing. Joe Pesci is Nicky Santorro, a rough-and-ready but nevertheless smart bully with his own gang ready to hit the jackpot in Vegas by robbing from every booky he can get his hands on and stealing jewelery from the rich gamblers. Paragraphs of words that you wouldn't say in the presence of your parents come and go like little children in a candy store. It's the dialogues and the way they are thrown in your face that makes this movie so impressive, really. If you you like strong dialogues, genius and hysterical acting and are totally in for the maffia way of life on screen then you should get a hold of this one because you will be blown away, I guarantee you. Goodfellas was fantastic, but in my opinion this one is even better.</fullReview>

Great acting job by the whole cast, being born and raised in Vegas and having a dad on the police force who has told me stories of the way Vegas was really ran I know this story is as close to reality as you can get. Granted the Tangier's casino in the movie was actually the stardust that still stands to this day right next to the frontier hotel and casino, which is now considered a slow part of the las Vegas strip. If you love mafia movies at all or are just interested in what made Las Vegas more than just a desert I suggest you watch this movie because it is based upon an era that may no longer exist. I also suggest people who may want to come to Vegas just to gamble, watch this movie because Deniro say's it best when I quote "we always find a way to get it back" end quote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that I love about Martin Scorsese's movies is their more-dimensional portrayal of characters. I often have both, feelings of sympathy and feelings of revulsion towards the people in his movies. The same feeling occurs towards Las Vegas and its casinos in "Casino". On the one hand Scorsese glorifies the old casinos. When Ace laments in the end, that today Las Vegas is nothing more than a gambling Disneyland, we suffer with him. It's a place run by emotionless businessman. On the other hand, however, Scorsese knows about the victims that the old system claimed, about the abyss behind the shiny surface. The film is acted very well by the "Goodfellas"-duo Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, while the biggest surprise for me was Sharon Stone. For me Ginger is a victim of this system, although some people might argue that she herself is responsible for the situation she's in. In the end, she is not the only victim and many other problems will be solved in the desert surrounding Las Vegas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing Casino, you may never look at Las Vegas in quite the same wayDuring its three-hour running time, Casino tells the story of two men's intermingled lives they were friends and co-workers. He researched all his bets carefully, and rarely made a bad pick. His winning tendencies gained him popularity and favor with the local casino mob.Now that Ace has moved to Vegas to manage the Tangiers Casino, Nicky isn't far behind. And, while the two gravitate to opposite sides of the law, with Ace keeping his fingers clean and Nicky taking over the local crime scene, their paths continue to cross, and their encounters become increasingly less friendly. Stirred into the mix is his girlfriend, Sharon Stone, who attracts men like flies. Although she agrees to marry him, she continues a liaison with her former pimp while encouraging Nicky's affections. This is a must see movie, The swearing is rough but a good movie in general Casino will inevitably bear comparison with Goodfellas, especially when De Niro and Pesci are ideally placed for comparison between both movies.Gerald Ferreira www.crazyvegascasino.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic vision from Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is a three hour look into 1970s Las Vegas, and how the Mob once held vicious control over how it operated. Robert De Niro, in one of his finest performances, plays a well-to-do perfectionist whose obligation is to get things done right. A superman for running his Casino, his kryptonite is Sharon Stone. She's a sultry casino hustler who makes her way in big bills by making sure all the "insiders" are taken care of. De Niro is in love, but she warns him she doesn't love him, but still agrees to marry him. There's also Joe Pesci, playing a loud-mouthed, violent buddy of De Niro's, who will jump on anyone who makes him feel threatened.All in all "Casino" is a terrific ride, and also very long. One is of course, reminded of "GoodFellas", because Pesci plays basically the same role he played there. And of course there's all the violence and destruction, but we like this. For three hours, I was never bored. I was aware how long I had been sitting, but I never found myself tapping my fingers. Scorsese knows how to keep his audience intrigued, and this is a good thing at 180 minutes.Then there is Sharon Stone. I must say I was very surprised with her performance. She is over-the-top in many scenes, but her character is initially an annoying child. So this is how she is supposed to play it. Trust me if you don't think Stone can play it cool, watch "Basic Instinct" again. Although she never has had a very impressive career, she has had her share of good roles (Along with "Casino" and "Basic Instinct", watch her in "Total Recall", "Last Dance" and "Gloria"). She earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and deservedly so. I think her performance is astonishing, and definitely puts "Casino" into a higher league then it would have been had it not had her in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is one of the greatest movies in film history and a genuine modern work of art. I don't say that lightly, as there are a lot of great movies and mankind has done a lot of amazing things for us in the past 100 years, but Casino really is one of those movies that you would like to think every other movie since its release should try and live up to in terms of quality. The performance out of Sharon Stone is just amazing, Scorsese uses her to her best and you really feel that any other movie Sharon Stone has done just might have been wasting her true talents. Of course Scorsese is the real talent here and Casino is way up there with Goodfellas (although not as good as Goodfellas, but the fact that Casino is still one of the great movies of our time is just a testament to Scorsese's skills.Of course this is an R rated movie, it has liberal use of violence, language and drug use, so it is not one for your kids. But even though it has a lot of violence and such, not once did I feel I was offended, only that I was experiencing the movie exactly as Scorsese intended it. And I think it's safe to say that he intended it to be a masterpiece.You could point out a billion technical faults with Casino, but I would never see anything wrong with it. Although I don't feel it does it justice, as it seems many critics are happy to give full marks to any old movie, I give Casino an honest 10 out of 10, five stars and a highly recommended tag.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I am a lover of gangsta films and casino is one of my favourites just behind goodfellas. In my opinion better than The Godfather. Casino is a mob story about a multi billion dollar casino operation that Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) owns. He is joined in Vegas by a mad mob boss; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) to make sure no one messed with Ace. Both De Niro and Pesci give fine performances. Joe Pesci as usual plays the mad man absolutely brilliantly. Even though these two were on top form, Sharon Stone gives a unforgettable performance. Stone was robbed of an Oscar and this film also deserved an Oscar. If someone can tell me a better film in 1995 I'd like to know what it is because it would take something special to over shine this masterpiece. This film, even though so brilliant and watchable was rated 18 for a good reason. There is about 400 f-words mostly used by Joe pesci and the c-word is used once by Robert De Niro. Also this film has some of the most disturbing violence I have ever seen. In one scene the mad Joe Pesci puts a guys head in a vice and squeezes it until the mans eye pops out. Thats just to name one violent scene, believe me there are many more.Besides that the film is amazing . The acting is brilliant and the film is highly recommended to any gangsta movie fan, or even if you don't like gangsta movies you will enjoy it. Fantastic, but not for the young ones.</fullReview>

Every movie with gangsters in it will have the same kind of characters because that is the characters the mob is filled with, smart ones, raging bulls, good earners etc. There is a Nickey character in every mob, a hard raging machine that you just don't mess with because he will fly off the handle, their is someone like his boss Remo who seems calm and cool but was the most important man in the mob and he just needs to push a button and thats it lights out, then there are good earners like Ace who may not be Italian and cant be made, but they are around because they are useful and smart and great at making money for them. So you see these characters are not just good for the movie they are real life characters and the Director Scorcesse is brilliant at portraying them. Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly entertaining, mafia movie masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i was 15 years old my aunt Lisa had a garage sale and gave me this when no one bought it from her collection. along with a new reclining bed. at first i only put this movie in out of boredom because i rarely have ever seen a movie that accurately portrays the realism that a mob film demands. so there i was on a Saturday night and i put this movie in and started watching it. the opening scene where ace walks out of the casino and heads to his car, and suddenly as his words ring out "when you love someone, you've gotta trust them there's no other way. you've got to give them the key to everything thats yours. otherwise whats the point...and for a while...thats the kind of love i thought i had." then his car explodes as he turns the ignition. then as he falls in a bottomless pit and a dramatic opening scene hooks you with a yearning to see more i was hooked in the first five minutes to see more. i sat and watched as the film unveiled itself. to say the least this film like a fellow commentator of this film said should be in the top 250 films of all time. in fact I'm amazed this film isn't in the top ten. it wasn't the unedited brutal violence that made this film, it wasn't the accurate facts and great visual affects alone. it was the skill of its leading offensive line of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. to say the least without them this film would have never gotten the credit it so dramatically deserves. the character of Robert De Niro, Sam "Ace" Rothstein although a somewhat flamboyant character made you want to be him. a man of skill, intelligence, a boss of an ever growing casino, and a wealthy ladies man. this character in my opinion would have been a complete disgrace without the unchallenged skills of the lead man who so brilliantly portrayed him. Ace was a hell of a fun character to see. as the film evolves you see a lot of drama in the world of ace and it goes from great to good to bad to worse and Robert De Niro rolls with the punches and fights fire with fire like no other actor i know of could have done. not since The Deer hunter has De Niro starred in a film that captured my emotion on such a scale. an absolutely brilliant character played by an absolutely brilliant actor. the character of Nicky Santoro being a quite versatile role required someone who could be sensitive, funny, bold, brilliant, scary, intimidating, and admired in the same character. well they cast the best choice for my money when they cast Joe Pesci. aside from the brutal heartless side of him that comes out when someone interferes with him or his job he was an admirable character. someone who could do what it takes to get the job done while at the same time being a good friend to Ace and also having a wife and a son. its not easy being such a serious character I'm sure but only Joe Pearce would know how challenging it was to tackle this role. when someone told his friend to stick a pen up his A**, well let me tell you he didn't have one shred of decency in his character. he took the pen and stabbed the man at least three dozen times. such a moving character, who has a popular restaurant of his own where he was in some eyes more famous than the famous people there had so many traits that were evolved in this film. hands down this role was handled beautifully and masterfully by the skills of Joe Pesci who in my opinion is the best choice for such a serious mob role. Sharon stone takes her role as the money obsessed, drug addicted, alcoholic, whore Ginger. she only cared about money and a boyfriend who took it from her. for some reason even when Ace proposed she was still tied to that loser lowlife pimp who ran her life. in the film she even tries to finance his bullshit by taking Aces money. when Ace finds out you almost wish he had killed both of them. because when the good pl' boys beat him down and leave him in a mess in his car ginger cries and sobs like he didn't deserve what came to him. tell me honestly do you think you would deserve getting beaten by three men at once for sneaking around with the wife of a casino boss with mob ties, then trying to take 25,000 dollars of his money. well you decide for yourself. each character gives you a reason to like or hate them. but only good actors can assure that you will feel both throughout the film. if you haven't seen this film i highly recommend it. if you have like mob movies you will love this film. And even if you don't love mafia movies but enjoy a movie with good acting, good storyline, good accuracy, or any one of the above and more you will find this movie quite to your liking. without doubt a two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mafia......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You just do not mess with the Mob. When are all these people going to realize that. You see all these movies with these tough guys who think they are bigger than the Mob and everything the find out they aren't, usually by getting whacked. I thought this was a very good Mob movie, ranking right up the with the Godfather and Goodfellas. This movie would have gotten a perfect 10 had it not been for the narration style of the movie. I didn't really like the way De Niro and Pesci just kinda told the story. It would have been better if they left all that out. But other than that this was a really good movie. I think everyone should go see it, it's a great acting job by De Niro, Pesci, and Sharon Stone (she is absolutely NUTS in the movie by the way and plays it perfectly). Not the greatest Mafia movie but ranks right up there with them. If you haven't seen it then what are you waiting for? Go check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese is one of the leading directors in the world. His films which are usually violent and brutal offer intriguing stories based around greed, power, obsession, love, religion and individual personas.Casino is a glitzy, glamorous and bloody look at the mobsters that controlled Las Vegas for a few decades. Robert De Niro is supported by a great cast that includes Sharon Stone in her most significant role ever and Joe Pesci as a violent psycho maniac in one of 1995s best films."Glitzy, bloody and beautiful.

		<shortDescription>One of the best mob movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating look at the corruption and violence that lurked behind the glamorous facade of Las Vegas in the 1970s and 1980s. Robert DeNiro is completely believable as casino operator Sam Rothstein, and Joe Pesci delivers a frightening performance as the psychotic Nicky Santoro. With great attention to detail, great historical accuracy, and graphic realism that will make all but the most hardened movie- goers cringe, Scorcese delivers a full- throttle look at the mafia in Sin City before their fall in the mid- 80s. Definitely worth your time, if you can handle brutally realistic violence and non- stop profanity. The only thing that prevents this from getting a 10 out of 10 in my books is the fact that I personally found the character of Ginger, Rothstein's wife, to be slightly too prevalent, and to have received too much screen time. Still, that's all I can think of to complain about in this well- crafted, brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The usual comparison with GoodFellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, you definitely need to be in the mood to see this movie. I can watch a three hour movie no problem but with this movie It can really feel like three hours if you are just watching it for the sake of something to watch. Comparison with GoodFellas is inevitable and personally, I think that both movies are just as good as each other. Casino has certain qualities that GoodFellas lacks and GoodFellas has certain qualities that Casino lacks. Casino doesn't quite have the density of secondary characters that enriched the world of GoodFellas. It really felt like a community but then, that was the point of GoodFellas; that Henry Hill was being invited into a big family of sorts and that he would witness it's love and appeal but also it's horror and debauchery. Casino is more centred around 'Ace' Rothstein and Nicky Santoro. The secondary characters are there to provide their cog in the story and then go home. However, Casino has more grit and really conveys the pomp and greed surrounding the so-called "high" society of Vegas, not just the pathetic punters. It is also a benefit to hear of how the casinos work under the gaze of the Mob through the heavy use of voice-oveR. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are a fantastic double act and one cannot hide a certain envy towards Scorsese that he is able to wield the acting might of these two in his movies. Just seeing them having an argument is an acting tour de force (whatever that means, but I know it's positive). It's amazing that, like Temeura Morrison in 'Once Were Warriors', in that little scene with his son, Joe Pesci can make Nicky Santoro seem sympathetic. This must surely be the hallmark of a great actor. These are two actors at the top of their game under one of the greatest directors of all time, not just today. Enjoy. That said, Sharon Stone is as good as the madonna-cum-whore, Ginger, who starts the movie as a real figure in the world of gambling but ends up as a spiteful junkie, not even caring towards her child. I have not seen many of her films but I am sure that, just like Bruce Willis, if given the right roles or right director, she can act as good as the best of them. The supporting players such as; Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and L.Q. Jones manage to make their characters fresh and interesting in the time space given to them. The violence is one thing that people always comment on when it comes to this film. There is no doubt that it is pretty strong violence but what gets me is that the scene where Nicky stabs that man with the pen never gets a mention whereas the 'head-in-a-vice' scene always does. I see the pen scene as being a whole lot more graphic and shocking than the vice scene. This is because, with the vice scene, you get a couple of big warnings before hand so you know what will happen (also, the violence is more suggested, even though you can see what is happening to the victim, you do not see the gory details). With the pen scene, however, it takes you totally off guard. The close up of the pen entering the neck is more akin to Hostel than GoodFellas. It certainly took me off guard. What I want to talk about, finally, is the climax. Is it a climax? If so, it is a very played out climax. Maybe because it concerns the fates of several characters in the movie as opposed to just one big bad guy. Certainly Nicky's fate is drawn and bloody and the re-invention of Vegas is a part of that climax. It is a frank and final ending to the film and probably very fitting, as it shows us that crime doesn't pay for some people. In conclusion, I think that Casino is a definite Scorsese classic and one that should gain as much praise as his more lauded works. Despite some minor quibbles, it is up there with the better of Hollywood movies and hopefully will mature as time goes on rather than being regarded as the naughty younger brother of GoodFellas</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stand-alone classic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is often regarded as a second-rate Goodfellas. It's seen as a bloated sequel to Scorsese's gangster masterpiece. But personally, I think it's just as good as its predecessor. It's an amazing film.However, I can kind of see where people are coming from when they criticise it. Yes, it's excessively violent. Yes, it's bloated. Yes, Pesci plays a character similar to the one he played in Goodfellas. And looking at individual scenes you can make comparisons between the two films: Sam (De Niro) falling for Ginger (Stone) is remarkably similar to the scene where Henry Hill falls in love with Karen after she screams at him at the cab stand, Nicky (Pesci) beating a man with a pen can be linked back to Tommy beating Billy Batts, and the final half an hour where Sam is battling with his wife is filmed in the same frenzy as the day of Henry Hill's arrest. But rather than hurt the film, the familiarity works in its favour. After all, the films both deal with the same world. Therefore, if you've seen Goodfellas, you can plug straight into Casino. But while Goodfellas was about the street level Mafioso, Casino goes one step higher. It's about a more powerful branch of the Mafia. And because the film is dealing with Las Vegas, a city that is loud, brash and devoted entirely to money, it's appropriate that the film is bloated and over the top. Vegas is no place for restraint.The film starts with Sam being blown up. Then the titles kick in and Sam spirals through a neon hell. But rather than see Las Vegas as an ugly, unnatural city, the city is described as paradise on Earth. And really for someone that loves money, someone that is devoted entirely to the accumulation of wealth, it is indeed paradise. And there's a fantastic shot at the beginning where you see Vegas at night through the clouds. As far as Sam's concerned he's looking down on an Earthly heaven. In this place anything is possible. And continuing the operatic theme of the film, the gangsters in Chicago, the guys who have entrusted Sam with the Tangiers casino, are described as gods ? and with the way the sequence is filmed they could be looking down from Mount Olympus.But although the film starts as a dream it eventually becomes a nightmare. And of course, money, sex and drugs are the corrupting influences. But as grim and violent as the film is, it's also very funny. I mean, Pesci as Nicky, whether intended or not, is a laugh riot. I could just listen to the helium-powered Lilliputian actor rant and rave all day. One of my favourite scenes has to be when he confronts Sam in the desert. It's beautifully built up as a dangerous showdown ? Sam looks for holes in the desert and then Nicky drives through the dust (there's a wonderful shot of Nicky's dust trail reflected in Sam's sunglasses) ? but once Pesci begins mouthing off, I can only smile. "You Jew mother******, you!" Another great Pesci scene is when he puts someone's head in a vice. Again the content is less than savoury, and Pesci is entirely convincing as a psychopath ("Don't make me be a bad guy," he says with a wonderful sense of the absurd), but Pesci's screaming fills me with joy. "Charlie M? You made me pop your f****** eye out of your head to protect that piece of s***? Charlie M? You dumb mother******!" And then there's the scene where Nicky is talking to some showgirl. He's talking about food (pounding pink veal, no less) and then once he's led her into his car, he applies pressure to back of the woman's cranium and lies back in the time-honoured way that men do when they receive blow-jobs in movies (there's a similar moment later with Pesci and Stone, which also has me laughing, such is the way the scene begins with the characters bitching about Sam and then descends into rampant horniness). But Pesci has even more great moments: the bit where he insults the dealer, the way he intimidates a banker, the stabbing with a pen and the line "Peek-a-boo, you f***s, you". Oh, and there's also the bit where he murders one of the casino's business partners. What I love about the scene is the way that Pesci laughs as he narrates the killing "?the boys decided to settle out of court." It really shouldn't be funny, it shouldn't amuse you to see someone treat life so casually, but that's one of the strengths of the film: the way it refuses to take a moral stance; Pesci's character gets a kick out of the killing, so that's the way it's portrayed.But of course, a scene that isn't funny is Nicky's killing. Although having said that, I do get a chuckle out of the way that Nicky's narration is interrupted when Frank Vincent hits him. But the beating is incredibly brutal and actually does something rather extraordinary and makes you feel a small measure of sympathy for Pesci's character, especially when he's imploring his friends to stop beating his brother.And it's also quite extraordinary that the film makes you feel a little something for Ginger (Stone is excellent). After all, by the end she's a completely repugnant character ? she even does coke in front of her daughter. But rather than being just a bad person, she's portrayed as someone who has been messed up by Las Vegas and her relationships. Therefore, although it's easy to hate her actions, it's harder to hate her as a person.And it's the relationship between Sam and Ginger that gives the film its heart. Sure Pesci's antics are the most entertaining, but buried beneath the violence and the squeaky cursing, you have a perverse love story, and a very affecting one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally Under-acknowledged! Definitely one of Scorsese's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is not even on the top 250. It's a pity, what with so many lame movies getting much higher ratings.Wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this epic tale (based on real life incidents) unfolds with the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a mob-backed guy who is brought in to Las Vegas to operate the Tangiers Casino, owing to his expertise in the same. His boyhood pal, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) also moves to Vegas with criminal plans of his own. Sam does his job really well, exposing cheats, disposing of the weaker employees, making sure he isn't robbed of money, and ends up making big bucks for his mob bosses "back home". However, things change when Sam falls for Ginger (Sharon Stone), a hustler. She already has a no-good boyfriend Lester (James Woods, in a small albeit important role). Inspite of his knowledge about her manipulative nature, he marries her. She is an alcoholic, and all she ever wants is money and security. Meanwhile, Nicky continues his criminal activities."Casino" is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese. The film runs for almost three hours and events take their time to unravel, and rightly so. The performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact! In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'. He appears super-cool as the Casino operator and you cannot help but sympathize with him in some later parts of the movie when he is having a bad time because of various reasons. Trust him to play an all-in-one character: a mob-connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time! His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of mind-blowing!Joe Pesci..what can one say about this guy! Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F-words with a one-of-a-kind punch is something only he can do! He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy-hood friend, Sam. Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role.Sharon Stone: Superb!! I never thought I would feel that about her performance, but indeed, she gets a hell of a chance to act here..and she does it exceedingly well! The drunk hustler who cannot find happiness is played to perfection by Sharon...I guess it is also kudos to the director for bringing out the actor in her.Then there are some wonderful, but small supporting performances by James Woods as Lester Diamond, Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Alan King as Andy Stone and Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) as Phillip Green. Special mention here, of Pasquale Cajano, who is superb as the mob boss, Remo Gaggi.The soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas. And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime!The dialog is brilliant. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing. The wonderful screenplay for the film is co-written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book. As mentioned before, the film runs for about 3 hours but there is not a single moment when you'd want to take your eyes off the screen.An under-rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics.</fullReview>

Although founded on shifting sand, it came as a shock to me when they were arguing at the restaurant, and Ace came out with - "Listen you f---g c--t!" That was the first time I had heard that combination of words used in a film, and was delivered with such venom that you knew right there there was no going back for them.And another scene i liked was when the sheriff held up a magazine, that had a story on Ace in it, and says -"Of course its true! Its right here!" pointing to the article....Blueberry muffins, an EQUAL amount of blueberries in each muffin! And the chefs exasperated reply -"Do you know how long thats going to take!" ha ha haAnd, a tip for life"be a man! and not a f---g pimp"Had a lot of laughs.

		<fullReview>OK where do i begin, i'm flabbergasted! that Casino doesn't get the attention it deserves. Most critics will say ooo it's just a rehash of Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The film has similarities yes, he uses the same actors playing similar characters yes, but don't you think Scorsese realizes this, don't you think he casted them for this very reason! He not only uses the same actors, he uses the same songs on occasion, he even repeats shots, but in order to give the shot a different meaning. For me Casino is the third and probably final installment of his mob trilogy. With each film he climbs higher up the ranks! Mean Streets starts with local hoods, Goodfellas to the more organized gangsters and Casino to the very top of the chain. I think Casino is probably the finest out of the three, it is certainly the best to look at. The cinematography and use of sound in particular are almost unparalleled. He even uses music from Jean-Luc Godard's Le Mepris, which contrasts the two relationships that are falling apart. Do you really think Casino is just an overlong sequel, do you really think Scorsese would stoop that low. The editing alone is probably the best of his career. Critics are always afraid to pride new films over the classics (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull). Now they are great films don't get me wrong, but i believe Casino deserves to be up there with them, more so than Goodfellas. Some critics have gone on to the say the film fizzles out after the first act? What film were they watching, do they know nothing about narrative pacing. If the film were to continue the pace of the first act i think the majority of the audience would have heart attacks, if they don't anyway. Now get this, it's from the Rolling Stone review. OK, 'What trips up Casino is its straining toward art'. So what exactly do they think Scorsese should be straining for, it doesn't sound like they need a great deal of straining for their reviews. It's little comments like this that really get under my skin. OO Casino's too long, if you think you can put across that much information in a shorter time then you're welcome. OK, that's enough for one night, Casino is an epic gangster masterpiece. A landmark of the 90s. It's not Goodfellas no, in my opinion it's better. However, it does require the viewer to have seen Goodfellas to completely understand what Scorsese is trying to say. I hope time will give this film the recognition it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pesci, De Niro, and Scorsese again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like all the time when De Niro and Pesci work together, Martin Scorsese is the one who is always there. This time they work in what I think is the most detailed film of the mafia. Based on a true story.De Niro stars as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, a former gambler who has been given the job as head of the casino by the mafia back in New York. Sharon Stone is Ginger, a casino hustler who basically uses Sam for his money so she can give money to her poor low life friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods). Joe Pesci is Sam's right hand man Nicky Santoro, who basically did not want to help Sam operate but make money by cheating with Sam knowing. Sam did not mind but one day Nicky got caught cheating and he is not allowed into any of the casinos. After that he starts working with the mob and starts to become one of the heads. Sam later has scandals going on with publicity that now he cannot control the casino no more. Ever since then, he has now been having trouble with Ginger and Nicky.Very heavy movie indeed. Sharon Stone has indeed done the best performance of her career. I would have given her the Oscar that year instead of Susan Sarandon's "Dead Man Walking". Pesci does in a way resemble his same Oscar winning character in "Goodfellas". Pesci is one of the biggest villains around in this movie. The violence, the swearing, and the drugs is a little too much in this one. That's its only problem. A very little bit less would give it the shot. I'd give it a 9.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Knowing Martin Scorsese's movies (particularly "Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull" and "Goodfellas"), you may think that you're prepared for "Casino". Well, you're not. "Casino" has some scenes that will outright shock you. The story of mob boss Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert DeNiro) becoming a kingpin in Las Vegas exposes the fact that contrary to all the glitz associated with that city, the whole place is one of the most violent cities in the country. Ace's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) gets sucked into the slimy business and is poisoned by it, while mafioso Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) never abates in his nastiness. Ugly as hell, but unfortunately, it's all true.A strange irony to the movie's serious tone is Nicky's speech: he curses like mad. It sort of comes out funny. But make no mistake about it, this is not a movie that is intended to produce any laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casino: the funniest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "Casino" at least half a dozen times now and I have to say it is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Largely unintentionally, it is hilarious. "Casino" is probably the blackest of black comedies. After I'd seen it about the fourth time or so, I found myself cracking up over the non-stop cursing, the meanness and pettiness, and the over-the-top violence. Of course, I'm a big fan of all of Scorsese's New York movies, and the Sopranos.My pick for the funniest scene in "Casino" is the scene where Rothstein is meeting with the bald, fat businessman at his home when Nicky Santoro shows up and demands his money back the guy, then threatens to crack his skull open if he doesn't get it back.Of course, pretty much all the scenes with Santoro in it are hilarious, as are all the scenes with the James Woods character.Anyone else think "Casino" is a laugh riot?

There are hundreds of movies like that, but Casino is another movie is a very special one.As usual in a Mr Scorsese picture the acting is great, the three main characters, De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pecci are outstanding, how they mix, how they make alliances and how they break it is just marvelous.The story of the rise and fall of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein must be seen more than once to appreciate all the details of the story, from the dialogs to the costumes, everything fits in its place and is central to the story.This is a great Martin Scorsese Picture, as good as he can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "Casino" is a graphic, realistic, and hilarious examination of a city controlled by corruption, violence, and avarice. The performances by Robert DeNiro as the tycoon scapegoat Sam (Ace) Rothstein, Joe Pesci as the wiseguy, menacing "big man on campus" Nicky Santoro, and Sharon Stone, as the emotionally disturbed, afflicted, and ballistic Ginger, among others, lend way to perhaps the most amusing and engaging story ever captured on film. I felt a great deal for these characters: their successes, troubles, and demises, as "no one stays on top forever", and I received an indelible conception of the operation of the mob in my residence of Las Vegas in the early 1980s. The script is fantastic: hilarious at times (this humor especially driven by the brilliant Joe Pesci, who can perform the most grotesque, audacious acts and still come across as hilarious), yet also serious and interesting, in examining down to the bare core the details of the mob underworld and its operation of casino empires. The direction by Martin Scorcese is definitely Oscar-worthy: rich, sincere, and relentless in focusing on various themes chronicling the volatile story. I especially appreciated the music, correlating with the film's themes most befittingly: light, heavy, dark, comical, etc. This film, besides being an engaging, amusing, and captivating tale about the body of the mob, is an excellent, and almost impeccable, production, wherein everything, from the direction, the acting, the screenplay, the music, and the editing, compliments whatever theme a scene is trying to achieve. Not for everyone, especially for those who might be allergic to obscenity (as this is perhaps the most profane film I've ever seen). Yet if you enjoy hardcore, serious, and comical stories about success, greed, and personal destruction, "Casino" fits the bill perfectly. For me, this is the best "mob" film ever, and a genuine classic in style, story, and deliverance. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>suberbly crafted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superbly crafted often sickeningly violent mafia must-see. Directed by Scorsese, starring De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone in a stand out performance The true story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro), a shrewd, Mafia-connected casino operator, whose assured, mannered existence is undone by his devotion to his flighty wife, Ginger and his boyhood friend Nicky (Pesci), a wild card who fancies his chances on Ace's patch. De Niro and Pesci narrate the extended opening, detailing the mechanics of skimming money from the casino to pass onto the bosses back home. This sequence ends with the glorious introduction of Sharon Stone's showgirl hustler Ginger, all fur, jewels and blonde ambition, who casts gambling chips into the air. On a security monitor, De Niro watches her exuberant transgression, and falls in love. So begins his downfall, and the end of Mob rule in Vegas. Where Goodfellas explored the allure of being a Brooklyn wise guy, with a hair-trigger comic sensibility, Casino emphasises the remorseless fear and grind of a mobster's life, all its attraction purged in two horrifically violent set-pieces. One, a torture scene with a vice, has been rightly condemned as gratuitous - but it is the closing beating that truly disturbs, two men brutally disfigured by repeated whacks with metallic bats that, as they are tipped into the grave, their featureless faces frozen in a contorted howl, it's almost as if a new species has emerged from the violence, only to be suddenly, cruelly, aborted. There is no romanticism in this view of the mafia. Scorsese making a gangster film with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro raised no eyebrows, and led some critics to accuse him of hitting a rut. All the same, with its ferocity and maturity, particularly in the responsibilities weighing upon the wise guys, Casino can be seen a closing chapter in the evolution of a gangster community, from its street heyday in Mean Streets to its adjustment to the new drug trade in Goodfellas to its final giving way to the power of the corporations in the Eighties. Verdict The closing chapter in Scorsese's American Crime trilogy, Casino is superbly acted and quite astonishingly obsessive about detail, money, and the mob's decline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched Casino more times than I can count and it never gets old. It's right up there with Goodfellas though with Casino there isn't the same level of irony and humor that you find with Goodfellas but it's entertaining nonetheless. This is a tale of unchecked greed, out of control egos, excessive behavior, and ultimately self-destruction that occurs as a result of all the money, power, and obsession. The violence is right on par with Goodfellas maybe even more so and the violence is VERY necessary (including all the head shots) because it is both crucial to the story and faithful to what actually happened in real life. I love the two old guys in jogging suits running around killing everybody (they were Felix "Milwaukee Phil" Aldersio and Charles "Chuckie" Nicoletti who were credited with 36 killings). This was a tremendous performance for Sharon Stone and I'm sure it was the best of her career. She makes you loathe her, despise her, and hate her but she somehow manages to make you feel sorry for her by the end. DeNiro is dead on as usual and Pesci puts on a show that almost rivals Tommy DeVito. Casino may not have been as popular as Goodfellas but I believe the acting was just as good and the story was just as gripping. Scorsese must have been proud of himself and this was my favorite movie of 1995.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a lot of holes in the desert...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply one of the best gangster films out there with an excellent "true" story yet strangely underrated. Casino is a masterpiece of a mob film from Martin Scorsese, and in my opinion better than the well received Goodfellas...and I don't know if I could tell you why, that's just the way I feel. There are many obvious similarities since they're both created by Scorsese, both have DeNiro and Pesci, and in both the s*** hits the fan in the end. They are frequently compared in reviews so I'll say, for the record, that I enjoy Casino much more. I think most of the reason Goodfellas is rated higher is because it came out first and some people see Casino as a rehash. I do not care about that myself, they're both great films.I've seen this film over a dozen times and it still has yet to get old. It's filmed beautifully and the music seems to fit the time periods and helps to establish the overall environment of it all, as it should. DeNiro and Pesci were conceived by God himself to play their parts in films like these and are always a joy to watch. Sharon Stone as Ginger is a definite standout. I honestly didn't know she could act until she was in this movie. She portrays the drug addicted ex-call girl turned wife of Sam Rothstein, the mob friendly casino boss. The film is quite violent and some denounce it for being gratuitous as if the mob goes by the same standard. It's just a movie and if you enjoy watching films in the same genre, then it shouldn't be too much to handle. The language is also fairly harsh, mostly from Nicky (Pesci), but it helps give it a gangster feel. Plus, it doesn't help that there's so much voice over in the film, which is were a lot of the profanity comes from. That's just how mob guys talk, come on now. Didn't you know? All of the wise guys that I know do the same. Even though many consider voice overs a cop-out in filmmaking, I honestly can't imagine the movie any other way. It definitely works and at least it's not Ray Liotta's voice.As previously mentioned, the cinematography is beautiful, all that panning and sweeping...love it, and it works. I particularly enjoy the opening sequence in which the operations of the casino are explained.......also the intro to the meeting in the desert where the camera focuses on Sam's sunglasses as Nicky drives madly across in the reflection, stirring up a storm of sand. Simple, but great. Even more interesting are the true parts of the story. I did some research and the film does mix and match some things around, but for the most part it is true. In actuality, the true story was much crazier and it involved the skimming of four casinos, not just one, one of which was the Stardust....all were ran by the real Sam Rothstein, Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal. And yes, the character that is supposed to be Nicky (Tony "The Ant") really did do what he did in the movie with a vise. The fact that it's based on a true story does make it a little more enjoyable to me, especially since it's pretty damn close.What it all boils down to is one of my favorite films that I've seen, and one of the best mob movies ever...just like Goodfellas. I think most just don't give it a fair chance. Had Casino been released first, I think it very well could replace GF in the Top 250. Some will hate me for saying this, but when it comes to this category of films, Casino is only second to the Godfather films. Now watch my body turn up in a cornfield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mob Classic!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is one of the best Mob films of all time. In a way a it's bit like Goodfellas. It has got some of the greatest actors of all time in it. Robert De Niro (Sam 'Ace' Rothstein), Joe Pesci (Nicky Santoro), Sharon Stone (Ginger), James Woods (Leicester Diamond) and Don Rickles (Billy Sherbert. Robert De Niro plays Ace, who has been sent to run a Las Vegas Casino in the 1970's. Joe Pesci plays Sam's best friend Nicky Santoro, who is a ruthless Gangster, in fact proberly the most ruthless on screen. Sharon Stone plays Ginger who is Sam's wife. James Woods plays a Pimp called Leicester Diamond and Don Rickles plays the Casino manager Billy Serbert. At the start Sam, Nicky and Ginger have it all but by the end of the film they've messed it all up. Sam and Nicky become enemies, Nicky begins having an affair with Ginger and Sam loses his Casino license. Casino is a brilliant mob film that takes you right into the heart of Las Vegas. You learn about Greed, obsession, Power and Money in this all time classic. Casino is also one of the most violent films ever, but that's what makes it the film that it is. I recommend Casino!Rating - (10/10) *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas in Las Vegas. Every bit as outstanding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both 'Casino' and 'GoodFellas' are the greatest ever mafia movies. Both are the work of the genius that is Martin Scorsese. A truly great director who has made 2 truly great films. The same double act that did so fantastically well in 'GoodFellas' repeat it again here. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both outstanding actors and it is proved again here. The film graphically portrays the casino business in Las Vegas and what it meant to reach the top. As I have said in my review of 'GoodFellas' if you haven't seen either film then you simply do not know what you're missing. Both are classic masterpieces and simply cannot be missed by any film lover. So if you are a film lover then these films must be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally cast, shot, and told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino in no way should be compared to the film "Heat", as I've read in other reviews- with the exception that it uses two of the same well known actors. It's release date is irrelevant, however similar, since stories make up movies, not release dates.With that said, Casino is a striking and glittering rise and fall epic depicting the mafias' crooked grip on an early Las Vegas. Based on a true story, it stars Robert Deniro as Sam "Ace" Rostien, a dead-on and almost obsessively methodical gambler used and highly appreciated by mob bosses to run an efficient money machine named The Tangiers Hotel and Casino- an establishment, like all others at that time, whose initial investments were OK'd by the mob. Joe Pesci stars as Nicki Santuro, who works under the same bosses to protect their golden child, while Sharon Stone plays Ginger, a high-end Casino hustler who sooner than later wins Ace's rare affection in one sparkling moment while in his Casino. James Woods reaches the pinnacle of genuine sleaziness as Lester Diamond, a childhood friend of Ginger's and bottom of the barrel moocher and hustler. The film, using voice over and gliding explanatory takes, encompasses a brutal and almost "behind the scenes" type story of what went on in the early years of sin city, before commercial giants put their foot down and legally out financed everyone else. Under the guidance of Martin Scorsese, rich characters are proudly lived out by Deniro, Stone, Pesci, and Woods even in his small role, who all fit their character to a T. Thanks to Robert Richardson as cinematographer (The Doors), Casino not only excels at being an exceptional tale of money and trust, but also arrests the viewers attention with whirring motion, glowing color, and beautifully composed framing and lighting. The ever popular Soprano's has nothing on this movie. Music, locations, and editing serve the story as well, making it one of Scorsese's most solid works to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beneath the Casinos, Lights, Shows, and Amusements Lies More to Las Vegas Than Meets the Eye!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS! HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE? DON'T READ!] Our story opens in 1983 when Sam "Ace" Rothstein get's into his car which blows up as soon as he turns the key. How and why did this happen? Let's go back 10 years earlier to 1973 when our story really opens in Las Vegas, Nevada. A new casino, The Tangiers, has just opened and was destined to be a multi-billion dollar operation. Sam "Ace" Rothstein was put in charge of the entire casino by big bosses Remo Gaggi and Andy Stone. People entered the casino rich and left poor, as most people do at casinos, then all the money is taken into a top secret room called The Count Room. The money is all sorted out, and then a man, John Nance, keeps a few mill for himself and takes it to a Kansas City market and gives it to another big boss, Artie Piscano. Though Ace didn't have a gaming license, he still ran the casino and often changed job titles so the commission wouldn't let on. Ace's assistant was casino manager Billy Sherbert, but Ace wanted to send for an old friend from back home: Nicky Santoro. Nicky was the muscle and Ace was the brains. Nicky once brutally killed a man with a pen because he sassed Ace over it. Nobody messed with Ace. I mean, no one. If he caught anyone cheating, he'd have their arms broken or threaten them with saws; Nicky, his wife Jennifer and son Nicholas, soon came to Las Vegas. Nicky considered moving there but Ace wasn't so sure. Then one night, Ace met the love of his life, Ginger. The two immediately hit it off and three months later, well actually 9 because she gives birth to a beautiful baby girl, Amy, Ace and Ginger get married. But Ginger kept a secret relationship with her old boyfriend: idiotic pimp Lester Diamond. Ace was jealous. Ace also wanted to put all his trust into Ginger, so they put two million dollars and fancy jewelry into a safe deposit box in a Los Angeles bank and Ace trusted Ginger with the only set of keys. Nicky continued to hustle the casinos with his pals, which began to annoy Ace. Pretty soon, Nicky got himself banned from all the casinos in Las Vegas. So Nicky decided to start his own casino the desert: The Gold Rush. He brought in his little brother Dominick, his pals Sal Fusco, Jack Hardy and Bernie Blue. Well, Ace's marriage began to shatter because Ginger was a heavy drinker and drug user. If they divorced, she wanted full custody of Amy but Ace would have nothing of it. Ginger and Amy go to Beverly Hills for a while, but what Ace didn't know is that she met up with Lester Diamond who wanted to use Ace's money to go away to Europe. He also treats Amy badly. Ace managed to convince Ginger and Amy to come home. And they do. Apparently Ginger had spent $25,000 of Ace's money and refused to tell him on what. Nicky began to get worse and worse. He was overcome with power. He wanted it all. So he bumped off or badly hurt anybody who he felt was a threat. He and Ace also have a terrible fight. Two actually. Ace and Ginger have a terrible fight so, but consoled in Nicky--who develop a relation ship and proceed to do the horizontal mambo! That did it. Ginger left Ace, and took their safe deposit box. But then the FBI who had been monitoring everybody, showed up and busted Ginger. They also busted Andy Stone, Remo Gaggi, Pat Webb, Phillip Green, even Artie Piscano--who died of a heart attack at that moment. As for Ace, who was denied a gaming license in 1980 unanimously, have started his own Las Vegas TV show and one morning, three years later, got into his car and it blew up when he turned the key. Due to the faulty car manufacturing, Ace survived. He know who planted that bomb: Nicky, who at that moment met with some men out in the cornfield with Dominick. Immediately those horrible men, lead by Frank Marino, beat the bejesus out of Nicky and Dominick with bats and buried them alive. Bernie Blue was shot by the police because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun. As for Ginger, she dropped dead from a drug overdose. John Nance was killed at his home in Costa Rico. As for Ace, he is now back where he started: as a regular, blue collar betting champ. Well, what can I say about Casino? Great performances by Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, but especially Joe Pesci! He deserved another Oscar! But this movie really isn't one I'd see again. It's got tons of violence, lot's of swearing (422 consecutive uses of the F-word), and lot's of extreme moments. Great drama. This is like Goodfellas to the extreme! That scene of Nicky and Dominick getting killed was very tough to watch. Even though Nicky was a merciless killer shark, you still liked him for an odd reason and so you felt sorry for him when those hoods got him. Lead by Frank Vincent, who Joe Pesci killed in both Raging Bull and Goodfellas. But anyway, if you like Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and movies about the criminal underworld, then to you I recommend Casino. It's not for everybody. If you don't think this movie is your type, then to you I recommend Goodfellas or My Cousin Vinny!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classy modern classic from Scorsese.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CASINO (1995)THE GOOD:--The three leading characters of this film are immensely intriguing people, all with an interesting dynamic or relationship. I found that the relationship between Ace and Ginger the most intriguing, it was so layered. Ace's softer side is shown when we realise that he just wants Ginger to love him, but she cares only for money, which makes their relationship extremely complicated and it turns into one violent outrage after another towards the end of the film. Ace and Nicky's relationship was also very interesting and multi-layered, particularly in the latter part of the film where their friendship takes a much uglier turn. Nicky and Ginger's relationship was another one that had me hooked, I guessed early on what was going to happen between them but it didn't dampen the effect on the film for me at all.--Before watching "Casino" I was really peeved at the running time (171 minutes) which I thought was going to make the film boring. Let me say that this film absolutely sped by and I never lost interest. This runtime was very necessary to the movie and allowed for all relationships and plots to be explored deeply and with a high intrigue factor.--At the time of watching this film I have not yet been to a casino or even to Las Vegas, so I found it very interesting to see the inner workings of casinos, and the corruption, greed and deception that comes with living the life of a casino man/woman. --There were little things in "Casino" that made it all the more worthwhile seeing, for instance those cute subtitles during one of Ace and Nicky's phone conversations, which swap what they're saying for what they really mean (you'll understand when you see the film - which you should, NOW!).--It's no surprise that Scorsese does a terrific directing job, and once again pulls some tour de force performances out of his cast. Robert DeNiro is the perfect choice for Ace, I don't think I can ever get sick of this guy. He plays the character with a politeness and also a quiet rage, which was fascinating to watch. Jo Pesci was as great as he'll ever be, the guy can just epitomise cool whenever he wants to and is constantly entertaining. I was also surprised to see that he made such a great villain, being the little and seemingly harmless guy that he is. Size doesn't matter, people, and Pesci proves that here! However, the stealer of this show is most certainly the rather dee-lish Sharon Stone as Ginger, she was very powerful in the role and really turned it into her own. She wasn't the hot woman here but also showing a very dark side of her character as she is constantly spiralling more further into drugs, greed and helplessness.--As the movie plays out, we're always hearing great tunes playing away in the back, some great 70's and early 80's numbers. I loved all these songs and they perfectly fit the mood of the film for me, and add something extra to some very affecting sequences. I want the soundtrack!THE BAD:--During the start of the film I was convinced that it wasn't going to be very good. I wasn't all that interested in it and the narration annoyed me. However, this quickly went away as the stories really came into play and I was gripped throughout the film after the weak beginning.RATING:9/10 - Another classy and masterfully constructed modern classic from Martin Scorsese.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Analyse This (6/10) Ocean's Eleven/2001 (9/10) Road to Perdition (10/10) Snatch (7/10) Taxi Driver (9/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town Will Never Be The Same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After films such as Cape Fear and The Age of Innocence, Martin Scorsese returns to his roots where this would be the final film of Scorsese's mob trilogy (his first two were Mean Streets and GoodFellas) before his prequel (Gangs of New York) in which we get to see Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent in their last collaboration with Martin Scorsese before adding DiCaprio to the mix. Life in Las Vegas will never be the same.The film's prologue has Sam "Ace" Rothstein (De Niro) going to his car where he narrates about sacrifices about love, than his car blows up leaving him flying in the air. After the credits have rolled with his body flying, we get to see Rothstein before his death smoking a cigarette where he narrates about how he ran things very successfully and that he was a bookie who changed the odds for everybody; also we are introduced to characters from Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) who is Ace's best friend watching his back and says they screwed up the whole plan to take over the casinos; Ace's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is shown as innocent until we get to know her later as a street hustler who robs men for their money and hangs out with her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods).The film is very different from GoodFellas and Mean Streets were both films talked about the territory of the mafia life such as nobody dating anybody different than their races; murders becoming an exception; damaging things when somebody doesn't pay; etc. Casino is more of a document on how organized crime controls what goes on in Las Vegas. It shows people in the account room counting money; all of the managers, dealers and bosses watching one another to see if they are doing their job, rob the rich people, take care of the high officials in the city and make sure that nobody tries to cheat in the casinos.The character of Rothstein is a genius in terms of trying to take people's money and helping others get money. After his character is in charge of The Tangiers, Nicky narrates on how Sam got information on what went on with sports; he find out if the quarterback got his wife knocked up, if they did cocaine, crooked referees, even the wind velocity for the field goals. Nicky says, "The boys back home didn't care if he enjoyed himself because Sam was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money." The character of Nicky Santoro is like Pesci's Tommy DeVito from "GoodFellas" where they are volatile when not doing things their way. We see that in Nicky's character when a patron is verbally abusing Sam when all Sam asked was if the pen next to him was his, Nicky stabs the guy in the neck until the patron starts wheezing. Sam explains, "No matter how big somebody is, Nicky would take'em on." His appearance in Las Vegas worries Sam because he was going to be taking care of Sam along with his partner, Frank Marino (Frank Vincent) for which they scare most of the people away from Las Vegas and play their own game.Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) has been a call girl all her life for which she steals chips from her Iranian boyfriend while having a camera zooming in on her and is being watched by Rothstein. He goes to the craps table where he sees Ginger wanting more money from the boyfriend and than tosses the chips to the floor where Rothstein has fallen in love with the call girl. "In Vegas," he says "for a girl like Ginger, love costs money." Indeed it does, as Ginger robs Rothstein like Peggy would rob Al on "Married?With Children" where she would take his money, when telling him that she is going to play some slots; Ginger also gets most of the employees on their knees as she drugs Andy Stone (comedian Alan King), one of the people working with the mafia; and gets most of the casino workers to give her things as long as she covers them; from clothes and cars, she had everything except her old boyfriend Lester Diamond who was a hustler stealing people for cash.In a movie full of serious actors, there are three comedians playing supporting characters in this crime drama; Alan King is Andy Stone has I had mentioned, he works for the mafia in which he has conversations with them about how they should control Vegas; Don Rickles plays Billy Sherbert, the Casino manager who doesn't do much except waddle around and gets hit by Nicky; Phillip Green is played by Kevin Pollock in which his character is more of the reticent for which he can't do anything or say anything just because the teamsters gave him 62,700,00 dollars, it didn't mean anything as long as he pretended to be somebody big.As much as performances go, the spotlight belongs to Sharon Stone in a great performance. Sharon has often portrayed the lured of affection for which we see her take her clothes off or try to appeal in a sexual situation. In Casino, she plays the character very mature and most likely will be her only serious performance; she'll be herself once we stop watching this film. Another spotlight belongs to Joe Pesci who won his Oscar for GoodFellas, yet he steals the show as a main character instead of a supporting character for which he gets to tell the point of view.Casino proves to be another hit in the Martin Scorsese collection with an awesome soundtrack as its own theme, performances that shine, and bad guys that people like to root for.</fullReview>

Along the way, DeNiro finds interest in a hustler (stone) who could very well be a problem to the whole operation.that classic case of 'nobody stays on top forever' is redifined in this in depth and interesting piece of drama. it takes time to watch, and the annoyance of all the 'F' bombs may get to you, but the overall effect will leave you dazzeled.the rich score, the heavyweight acting from Sharon Stone, the twists, turns, dangers and violence are all the factors that hold this movie together. if you've got a lot of time to kill and enjoyed previous works such as goodfellas, Scarface, Donnie Brasco, Reservoir Dogs, or even Pulp Fiction, you'll enjoy this movie.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can sum this movie up in one word: explosive. Excellent directing by Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci once again deliver. The voice-overs work perfectly on De Niro, while Pesci gives the most explosive performance of the film, even better than he is in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone is perfect and should have won the Oscar. Amazingly, this film is the telling of a true story, based on Nick Pilleggi's novel. Great storytelling and the supporting cast is good,too. Scorsese doesn't use score, he uses source music, just like in Goodfellas. The use of source music fits in this story as it covers the 60's to the 80's. Underrated movie, although Stone was nominated, but nobody else, give me a break. Another thing I like, none of the acting is over-dramatic, they deal with the issues as they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sombre Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cruelly referred to as Goodfellas: Redux by some, Casino deserves (nay, demands) to be see in it's own right. It isn't as good as Goodfellas, however, mainly because it tries to outdo that wonderful movie with extra lashings of gore (some of the violence is unwatchable), foul language, sex and music, to no avail. It's also inhibited by a narrower scope, taking in only the 70s and the early 80s and by the end, the script dithers as much as Sharon Stone's druggy showgirl. However, Scorsese pulls several impressive tricks, De Niro is effective as a outwardly dull but inwardly seething Jewish gangster, and the dialogue is occasionally inspired. If you can stomach the length of it, this is high quality Scorsese, but only just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i just love this movie, i have surely seen it 30+ times now and i cant get enough ^_^ Strong performances by de niro,pesci and stone, i dont see what the fuss is about james wood being so good here, he has like 5min screen time in this flick.. and i dont hes very good at all. i like the "action" scenes the most,like when nicky(pesci) stabs a guy in the throat with a pen, putting another guys head in a vise, and then theres this last scene which i wont spoil but its great and well, see it :) too bad theres a cut version of this movie where they have cut out some "too violent" scenes like the one in the end. This is great movie if u liked "Goodfellas" though i like Casino more for some reason. And its better the "The Godfather" !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino chronicles the lives and times of three people, "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a super bookmaker, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, a sexy ex-prostitute who loves jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first part details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick them apart piece by piece. Casino is one of my favorite films ever, DeNiro and Pesci are excellent in this. I love Pesci he was just ruthless as Nicky, if you haven't seen this yet do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is one of my all time favorite movies. The narration is great, the music is wonderful, everything is just great. The movie always gets back to the point. Goodfellas showed us that real gangsters weren't about "whacking" everyone; it's about making money. Casino shows us the same thing, all the lights, all the comps, it's all been arranged just for us to get YOUR money. Even much later in the movie Nicky remarks, "The f*%ckn' bottom line here is, cash". The music in the movie is so fantastically placed that the movie begins to resemble a musical in some points.A few things I have always wondered: 1) Why oh why isn't this movie on the top 250 list??? 2) Why are the names changed form the book?In goodfellas, the names are the same. Henry Hill is Henry Hill. In Casino (the book) Sam "Ace" is actually Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal (If I remember correctly).This is such a great movie. The pace is so fast and the dialogue and narration are so tight that all 3 hours just roll by without notice.Probably my favorite thing about this movie is that it has major replay value. It isn't a rental. I can watch this movie a few times a month or even in a week. Some movies get stale after one or a few viewings. I feel that all of M Knight's (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) movies fall into that category. They're great movies, but you just can't watch them over and over. Casino is one of those special few that you can pop on and enjoy, not just fall asleep to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SCORCESE AT HIS FINEST HOUR!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a Martin Scorcese fan. I did not like TAXI DRIVER. Even as much as I love mob films, I didn't care all that much for GOODFELLAS. Back in 1995, I wrote movie reviews for my college paper. One of the movies I had to see was CASINO. My first thought was, "oh damn, I have to sit through a 3-hour Scorcese movie." It is strange because I didn't like GOODFELLAS, but I love DeNiro and Pesci. In CASINO, DeNiro and Pesci made the movie as great as it was.Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstein, who is an expert gambler. He is asked by the Midwest Mob to take control of the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas. He immediately cleans up the casino of crooks (in one scene, a man who is caught cheating has his hand beat with a hammer) and brings in a lot of money for the bosses. During this time, Ace meets Ginger (Sharon Stone), who is one of the most notorious hustlers in Vegas. He falls in love with her and they marry, even though she is still faithful to her ex-pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods.) Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is called in by the Mob to protect Ace and make sure no one messes with the casino. All is well for a while until Nicky begins causing trouble and that's when all hell breaks loose.This movie is almost three hours long, but the time flies right by. The supporting cast is top notch. If you are a fan of mob films, you can't miss CASINO.Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>undoubtably scorcese's finest film. however true to the real story the film may be, scorcese asserts hegemony over the position of "the best man for the job" in telling a gangster story. perhaps what is best, is how pesci and de niro show the true colors of method acting. while watching, the viewer does not see pesci and de niro, they see santoro and rothstein. sharon stone even managed to rise to the occasion. outstanding documentary styly story, with all sorts of convincing tricks: voice-overs, brilliant camera-work, exquisite editing. the overall picture for me is a nine out of ten. brilliant film-making!</fullReview>

Both are about the moband both star De Niro and Pesci and are directed by Scorsese andwritten by Pelligi. That's about the extent of the similarities.To quote Roger Ebert, Casino is not just concerned with itscharacters but with history. This is historical fiction. This movietakes you inside Las Vegas. This movie knows.In the end, it may not be as appealing or popular as GoodFellas.But it isn't fare to call it an imitation because it deals withsomething completely different.This movie is worth seeing. De Niro, as always, is flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE "Gone With the Wind" of gambling flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Oscar-winning actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci reunited for this three-hour epic tale of the rise, fall and resurrection of a casino proprietor. Set in Las Vegas from 1973 to 1983, "Casino" tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro, in one of his most underdeveloped roles) who makes his mark as one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He has money, notoriety, connections, everything...except that special woman. Enter Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone in a knockout performance that earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination), a flashy, high-maintenance, money-driven cocaine hustler/prostitute who eventually becomes Mrs. Sam Rothstein. Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is Sam's hotheaded friend who become a major player on the gambling scene himself, until greed and distrust bring their glittery (albeit volatile) decadence to a monumental halt. With all of the film's star power and energy, it still just takes a long time to get where it's going (wherever that is). Whether it was Scorsese's handling of this particular material, or Nicholas Pileggi's inability to adapt his own novel to the screen, "Casino" is just a few notches short of achieving real meaning and depth. However, the film certainly deserved more nominations than it received (its only one being for Stone's characterization of Ginger): Pesci's explosive supporting role, Robert Richardson's vivid, colorful cinematography, John Dunn and Rita Ryack's costumes and Jack G. Taylor Jr. and Rick Simpson's Art Direction/Set Decoration all went unnoticed by the Academy. Artistically, "Casino" is a visually sumptuous masterpiece. Storywise, the movie fails to deliver in certain areas. An uneven mixture, but it IS a handsome production. *** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly cannot believe that Goodfellas is seen as Scorcese's best film, Yes of course it is a classic, that I am not disputing but surely Casino should be heralded higher than Goodfellas.Firstly, Casino is a far more ambitious and therefore more difficult movie to pull off than Goodfellas.Yes Goodfellas is ambitious, it follows the entire true life story of a Gangster, but Casino tries to analyse in detail the entire inner most workings of a money spinning empire and its downfall during the early 1970s. Secondly,the plot is more complex as a result. It interweaves the lifes of gangsters, professional gamblers, pimps into the corrupt day to day workings of a las vegas casino and thirdly the ending has far more conclusion to it than goodfellas.Yes Goodfellas has a better Soundtrack but casino has epic classical music which symbolises this idea of extreme power, the casino being a form of heaven and the casino manager(Robert Deniro)playing a metaphorical god.It is certainly underrated and certainly should be placed higher up in a pedastool.Believe me this film is stunning, this film is a classic and this film is the best of all gangster films. Believe me it works!Watch it now!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie over the course of a weekend. I played it once. Played it twice. I played it a total of 4 times.This movie is one of the most incredible movies ever to be seen by any stretch of the imagination. If you've ever been in a casino then this movie will really let you appreciate all that goes on in the background.This is a story about love, obsession, greed, ruthlessness--most of all this story chronicles the life of a Casino manager, Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert DeNiro), and his ascent to power in 1970s Las Vegas. Sharon Stone stars as Sam's debutante, Ginger McKenna and Joe Pesci is the crony, Nicky Santoro. Much of the story revolves around these three altogether very different characters. Unlike Goodfellas, where the crew was trying to get money, power and women, the crew in Casino already had it--they were trying to keep it from competitors, law-enforcement and most importantly--each other.This movie is severely, SEVERELY underrated. There are moments when it would be safe to assume you'll know what will happen next but, other times (and I won't mention anything specific--except the corn field that is) you won't know what hit you.The camera work is incredible, the story is fantastic and the characters are nothing less than superior.Overall, Casino is not a movie for the faint-of-heart but, a story that is gripping, moving and deeply entrenched in mob tradition.9/10 stars!</fullReview>

Ace (DeNiro) and his struggle with the gaming commision and Mafia business going on in his casino. The person who leads these casino crimes is a violent mental midget (Pesci) who is a made guy. When Sam marries a casino tramp Ginger (Stone) all hell breaks loose for him, especially when she tries to get in touch with her old scumbag boyfriend (Woods) and smuggle some money from Sam to him. When all this crap is going on Sam only can really trust one person, his next in command for the casino (Rickles). For mafia fans, this is a great movie. Rent it right now. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fascinating look at the mob-operated Las Vegas casino industry, Casino is a success on every level. Despite being three hours long, it never gets boring ? it's driven by brilliant direction, superb acting, and an interesting screenplay. Covers familiar ground but never really feels like a retread of Goodfellas, although some make that claim. The only real similarity is Joe Pesci's character ? while he delivers a fine performance, I can't help but feel that his presence is largely their because of his success in Goodfellas. Regardless, it can hardly be considered a flaw in the film, and it works very well. An excellent addition to Scorsese's already impressive body of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent gangster film!---9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this and Goodfellas i have come to a theory: All movies should star Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. These two geniuses can turn any movie into a masterpiece. They can make you laugh and cry pretty much at the same time. The film follows Ace Rothstien (De Niro) when he gets the biggest prize a gambler can get: his own casino. Of course he has to pay the mobsters who gave it to them. He also has to deal with the violent and costly exploits of his friend Nicky (Pesci). Joe Pesci again perfects the loud mouth loose cannon character as he did in Goodfellas, but i think here he was given a more important part. Robert De Niro can not fail. You can see the stress and anger in his eyes in this film. Martin Scorsese is the world's greatest director. Screw the Academy. He should have won the best director Oscar several times by now. I would love to see him do more work with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. This is a classic gangster picture that is always compared to Goodfellas. I think they are two different stories and two excellent films. 9/10</fullReview>

I loved the Sid Vicious "My Way" at the end of Goodfellas, but Sam Rothstein bemoaning how Las Vegas has become a faceless Disneyland built on junk bonds is touching ("now when a whale comes in with a suitcase packed with millions, some high school student wants to check his social security number..."), especially when he takes off his shades at the end, and gazes sadly into space, reminiscing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert DeNiro Triumphs Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro has yet another great role in this 1995 Universal release. He portrays Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a professional gambler who becomes the boss of a mob operated casino in Las Vegas during the 1970's. He gets married to a smart mouthed and money driven casino hustler named Ginger (Sharon Stone) and makes a longtime friend named Nicky (Joe Pesci) his business partner in casino operations and dealings. Nicky is very defensive of Sam and would do anything to help him make money and stay in business. He especially doesn't mind beating bloody pulps out of people who refuse to cooperate with their demands. Sam is a little more restrained and only really cares about making money so he disapproves of Nicky's highly volatile behavior on several occasions. Meanwhile, Ginger just can't seem to leave her days of greed behind and forms an alliance with Nicky and other high rollers in a quest to help her get a huge share of the casino business profits. It's a lengthy film with an abundance of graphic mob violence, drug use, sexual content and some rather colorful profanity but it still ranks as a very high point in recent cinema and a very fitting follow up to "Goodfellas." Director Martin Scorsese follows up on the "Cape Fear" and "The Age Of Innocence" fiascos with a film that finds him very much back in his signature element, the epic crime drama. Nicholas Pileggi, the man who wrote the novel "Wiseguys" that eventually became the film "Goodfellas" once again adapts his novelization stories into film form and just like "Goodfellas", this film is a dramatized and fictionalized account that's modeled after a true story.</fullReview>

Some people say that Casino is a replica of Goodfellas but I don't see that at all.

Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are great. Sharon Stone outshines them all. She is the best actress ever to perform in a Scorsese movie. She beats Juliette Lewis in Cape Fear which was kind of a hard thing to do but Sharon made it look easy. The movie's story gets a little complicated towards the end, I forgot who ratted on Joe Pesci and got him and his brother killed. Overall, An excellent movie about the mob in Las Vegas and Scorsese's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 years in the life of Vegas...Embellished slightly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how some shows tend to glamorize my adopted hometown of Las Vegas...How everyone who lives here has tons of money and the best of all indulgences under a sunny sky and neon nights. Well, "Casino" gives everyone a good primer on what NOT to do if you are a local. I particularly liked Rothstein's narrative on how everything is choreographed and coordinated to separate the happy tourists from their money. A little cynical, but otherwise very accurate and enlightening. Anyway, the movie is an entertaining look at the way life was out here, back in the 70's. A lot of the old-timers (some of whom knew the actual players on which "Casino" is based) tell me that they miss the good old days when the town was cleaner, less crowded and safer to live in. It gives a slight thrill to see the glamour and excitement, but never fails to remind us that there is a gritty and seamy side to the town. Then again, almost every American town has a "City Confidential" of its own. Even the real people that these characters are based on had a lot of just day-in, day out routine. Anyway...DeNiro did a great job portraying Sam "Ace" Rothstein, even though Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal was not a particularly exciting person in real life. Joe Pesci played a very convincing Nicky Santoro, but a little more over the top than what Tony "The Ant" Spilotro was supposed to be like. Sharon Stone was even more compelling in her role as Ginger McKenna, because she was very accurate in her portrayal of Geri Rosenthal, Frank's beautiful but troubled wife. The timeline is a jazzed-up and high-compression version of Vegas from '73 to '83, thanks to Scorsese's action-packed touch and all-star soundtrack. I thought it was a crowning touch that most of the filming was done at the Riviera, as it is one of the classic "old Vegas" joints and definitely was in the same league as the Dunes and the Sands once upon a time. All in all, a great movie that tells a great story...Just remember that you have to remember that for once, fiction is a little more entertaining than truth.</fullReview>

If you like hearing all the versions of "f***" about every minute or two, sometimes three times in the same sentence, you'll enjoy this movie. If you don't mind seeing about 30 or 40 guys getting wacked in the most bloody way conventionally possible, this movie will work for you. To be fair though, that's what this story was all about so it had to be there. If this movie is ever on TV, it's about as big a joke as putting on "Scarface" on TV.

		<fullReview>I have not yet seen the last hour of this movie - it's sitting on a video tape at home. But last night I sat through the first two hours, and although I wasn't bored, I was reviewing what I had seen in my mind, and frankly it didn't add up to much, really. It was almost the same rags-to-whacking-people-to-riches-to-whacking-each-other-to-rags story of Goodfellas, without the sense of humour.More seriously, for Scorsese as a filmmaker, was the absence of any real involvement in the relationships between the characters. Why Ace and Nicky are best friends is never really explored - all we really see between them is animosity. Sharon Stone is a beautiful woman, but I was hoping to see something more to indicate exactly why it was Rothstein fell in love with Ginger, other than him telling us so. The line about trust at the very start of the film is important, but never really seems to be followed up, as it is clear that not only did Rothstein not trust his wife from day one, he was never given the remotest reason to. Ginger's obsession with riches and jewellry is demonstrated, but never explored, other than perhaps to indicate that she had no taste in jewellry!I could see absolutely no reason for this movie to be as long as it was, except that it included a lot of scenes that, made by a different director, would have ended up on the cutting room floor. The whole sequence about the bosses getting annoyed about being skimmed from their skim, to the KC operator moaning about his expenses, to his mouthing off to his parents in the Kansas store, was an utter waste of time (and the faux-reality acting of the mother complaining about his swearing, was a major change in style which only served to jerk you out of the movie you were watching.)Scorsese made his name by handling different films with different styles, but still making them inimitably his own: Mean Streets is different from Taxi Driver, is different from Raging Bull, is different from The Color Of Money, is different from Goodfellas. Not many directors have sustained such diversity and originality over 20 years. But Casino lacks the originality of its predecessors, and it lacks the emotional heart which is essential to any good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many consider this film as a sub - GoodFellas (1990) rip off, due to the style of the film and the nature of the violence and dialogue. While I agree that there are certain similarities, it must be considered independent from Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece. Indeed, Casino expands on GoodFellas and improves it.We are now forced to care about Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his downward spiral. In GoodFellas, we viewed the world of Henry Hill, but we were never really cared about him or his friends. Joe Pesci's performance as Nicky Santoro is, for me personally, far more disturbing than Tommy De Vito. Santoro is more vicious and is prepared to back stab Rothstein over business and his wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone, in an Oscar nominated role, and rightly so). Even the violence is considered more graphic. I know a few people who were distressed by the intensity of the violence and had to stop watching the film. This is, surely, a success on the part of Scorsese and his cast on the fact that they are able to get such gut reactions from people who have been raised on slasher films, such as Halloween (1978).There's also more of a story to Casino, which makes it a more engaging tale. No detail is too small for Rothstein, even down to the number of currents in a bun. It's a fascinating view about the rise and fall of the mob in Las Vegas, the playground of the world. The interesting thing about Rothstein is that he isn't actively involved in the violence, but he certainly doesn't condone it. Watch his face as the guy's hand is smashed with the hammer.My only complaint is that James Woods is pretty weak as Lester Diamond, Ginger's former pimp. Considering his performance as a gangster in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), we know he can do much better than that. I don't know what Scorsese was thinking there.Other than that, I give Casino a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!Casino is the best "family" movie ever. The movie takes in Las Vegas,the gambling capital of the world. We follow the rise and fall of Sam "Ace" Rothstein,played by a brilliant(as always) Robert de Niro. He becomes boss of one of the biggest casino's in town,the Tangiers. As an old master gambler he knows all the tricks of the business,so that in a short period of time the Tangiers becomes the biggest Casino in Vegas. But then the problems start: first of all he meets a girl,Ginger played by a beautiful Sharon Stone and then an old friend comes to town to help him with the casino,Nicki Santoro(Joe Pesci in one of his greatest performances!). Nicki brings Ace into a lot of problems because of his aggressive way of solving things,like molesting a guy with a pen and putting someone's head into a vice. In the meantime Ginger can't keep away from drugs and booze while she also still has a relationship with a pimp,Lester Diamond(funny performance by James Woods).Above that all,she also starts to screw Nicki. At the end Ginger dies of an overdose,Ace survives a car bomb and Nicki(who set the car bomb) gets viciously murdered in the desert, he gets beaten with baseball bats and is buried alive.casino is a beautiful movie about love,money and deceit in a sinful town. We get to see a great view inside the Casino and look at things that we otherwise would never get to see. The shots of Las Vegas are especially nice to watch,just look at one of the first shots of the movie,a great view over Las Vegas in the middle of the night.Here you can really see what a small city it is and that it is surrounded by absolutely nothing.The performances by the actors are without exception high-class,especially the leading players:De Niro,Stone and Pesci. Joe Pesci is my favorite in this movie because of his quick dialogues and his unstoppable swearing. The directing by Martin Scorsese is as always flawless. His movies with Robert de Niro are of an unreached high level,just look at other films like Goodfellas,Raging bull,Cape Fear and Taxi Driver.Although the movie can be really brutal at times(the scene in which Joe Pesci gets killed is really sick) the humor in some scenes are absolutely ingenious.Watch closely at the scene in which de Niro is behind his desk in his underwear and the scene in the grocery store with the old lady who can't her son swearing all the time,hilarious!Overall,Casino is one of my favorite Scorsese movies and it is a shame that it is so underrated,also in this database. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rated Casino a 9 because of it's appeal on many levels. It has the mafioso saga story that The Godfather mastered, but is combined with the setting and story of early 1970's Las Vegas. This unique combination is what appealed to me the most, not to mention the all-star cast. It is a terrific story that, like most great films, is dramatic, funny and thought-provoking all at the same time. Any male in the 20-35 year-old demographic would probably enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is brilliant, it really is. It is underated and overshadowed by its predessesor 'Goodfellas'. Martin Scorsese really is the master of gangster movies, no doubt about it, yet the novelist Nicholas Pileggi deserves kudos too. People say this movie tries to hard to be like Goodfellas and I think thats a terrible description. The reason for this I think is that Joe Pesci's Nicky is too much the same character as his Tommy in Goodfellas. If they had of put someone else in that role, possibly Benicio DelToro or an Edward Norton with an Italian makeover, then Casino would have gotten more individual praise. To me, this film is on equal par with Goodfellas. Well done again Scorsese &amp; Pileggi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gains five stars because it is nothing less than perfection. Robert De Niro is at his personal best as he give a white hot performance that could melt the varnish right off you kitchen table. Never has a man delivered his lines with such power and personal angst as this man, he is truley one of the most gifted actors on the planet. But it is not De Niro himself he is also giving an amazing script by Nicholas Pileggi, the same man who brough us Goodfellas and one of Americans greatest directors of all time Martin Scorsese. Joe Pesci is also fantastic as a violent mobster who is like a walking time bomb. Sharen Stone and James Woods are also in top form as well. It is the three hour plus story of the owner of one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. We go through his ups and downs of life and his business. This is by far one of the grestest movies ever made and I am shocked at how even though it is over three hours long it never becomes boring and in fact even blinking might make you miss to much of this amazing gritty and very powerful drama. I have also found that out of all the actors De Niro is one of the only people who actually make swearing sound cool and you better believe there is a never ending stream of it here. If you like Goodfellas this movie is not to be missed since it follows the same basic formal just on a much larger scale. Not to be missed at any cost</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Martin Scorsese, Nicholas Pileggi, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci unite for another epic mob movie, based on a true story. Casino tells the story of Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of a mob controlled casino. Joe Pesci plays his friend, Nicky Santoro, from back home years ago who comes out to A) Protect Sam and the casino and B) make some cash for himself. He does just that. Along the way, Sam begins a relationship with Ginger, a hustler at the casino played by Sharon Stone. It tells the story of how the mob controlled casinos, and how people like these helped mess it up. From the opening scenes, one can see that Scorsese is following the Goodfellas format of flashback/voiceover work, but this benefits the movie. DeNiro and Pesci are on top form again, as is Sharon Stone surprisingly. Over all, a very well written, acted and directed film, the only drawback being it's length. Word of warning, this film is very violent at times. You would have heard of the vice scene by now as it helped garner this film some notorority, but it isn't the only one. If you can handle the violence and language, then this is a very rewarding film experience.Best scene: DeNiro busts some yokels trying to cheat at the casino, and proves that a hammer and a kind word work better than just a kind word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is like a follow on to Goodfellas (not a sequel just a similar movie) but not quite as good though. It begins with Joe Pesci's and Robert De Niro's characters as best friends and full time mobsters,Robert De Niro's character gets himself a managing job at a casino and his Joe Pesci's character becomes jealous.He then falls in love with a hooker and betrayal and violence begin in numerous ways. Casino is a gangster movie like Goodfellas,uses terrible swear words,compulsive violence and a dangerous feel to the whole film. One of the best parts of the film is the opening sequence (made by Saul bass) in which we see De Niro's character go to his car and as he starts his car up it explodes.We then see an animated sequence of him being blown away slowly and then it goes through pictures of the casino signs with very dark and haunting but at the same time beautiful music. From the beginning of the film to the end we are gripped and by the end disturbed (especially by the corn field scene near end).Although Casino might not be as good as Goodfellas it still succeeds in entertaining audiences and keeping you on the edge of your seat and Robert De Niro s just great. I reccommend renting it first just incase it's not your cup of tea,but I award it 5/5.</fullReview>

Also is a wonderful example of life in Southern Nevada in the 1970's. (If you want to know what life in Nevada is like, watch The Misfits, Casino, and Pay It Forward.) Further Sharon Stone should have received the Oscar for Best Actress. Her performance in Casino is flawless, believable, and 100% dead on!

		<fullReview>I am one of the few film fans that does not adore "Goodfellas". I never thought it warranted the high praise it garnered. Therefore I had low expectations for "Casino" when it came out (actually I wonder why I even bothered seeing it considering all the similarities). The story here is tight and Deniro and Pesci are in their element, but Stone really drives the flick to it's depraved destination. She was excellent. And unlike many I loved the voiceovers and thought they provided a wry nexus to the work.I presume that most reading these reviews have already seen this movie, but a word of caution to those who have not: The violence is blatant and HARSH (though not gratutious) so be prepared to be somewhat disturbed by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When you love someone, you've got to trust her, there's no other way. Otherwise what's the point? For a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had...." just then, Sam Rothstein was thrown into the bonfire caused by the explosion of his car. As the extremely sorrowful melody of Bach's St. Matthews Passion slowly brought us into the fanscinating world, where it's the paradise for gamblers, drug dealers, prostitutes, gangsters and killers - Les Vages, 1973, the story unveils...This film is not just a crime drama, but indeed a tragedy as well. I know that De Niro, Pesci and Scorsese have made crime films together, "Goodfellas" for example. However, I don't really have anything to say about De Niro and Pesci, since I'm not their fan and haven't really watched a lot of their films. I only know that they both are pretty serious actors and have played killers or leaders of the underworld. But I do admire the talent of Martin Scorsese. This one and art film "The Age of Innocence", which he directed and made uncredited cameo appearance. He skillfully directed both films with different styles, and has made both of them wonderful!I remember I was still pretty young when this film was released. And I couldn't stay in the theater to finish it because of all the dirty languages and cruel shooting and violence. But years later, when I found this film in the local video store, I rent it and this time, I could appreciate and understand this film much better. I was amazed by the flawless, perfect direction of Martin Scorsese, and especially by the powerful, excellent performance of Sharon Stone! This is undoubtedly the best performance of her career! And a must-see for her fans! Golden Globe and The Academy Award nomination that she won for this is the best proof of her success!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the question a lot of Martin Scorseses' fans, and a good many critics, have been asking is - having already made a widely acclaimed, near-classic gangster biopic with "Goodfellas" - did he really need to make "Casino"? It's a moot point, but for all the superficial similarities between the two films, I, personally, am mighty glad he did. Whilst it is commonly regarded that "Casino" is inferior in comparison to "Goodfellas", I vehemently disagree, and while the oft-misapplied term masterpiece is something I hesitate to attach to any film ( not personally subscribing to absolutism in something so subjective as love of cinema ), I consider Scorseses' twin mafia epics to form a combined masterwork oflow-life tragicomedy and high art. I prefer to see both films as companion pieces, which I think is how Scorsese would intend them to be seen. I think that the predominant reason for so many having a lesser regard for "Casino" is that the characters are less empathetic or "likeable" than those in "Goodfellas". Whilst GF is unquestionably savage at times, it is also oddly engaging, nostalgic and often laugh-out-loud funny in a pitch black kind of way. It's a mob movie with an absurdist screwball slant. "Casino", on the other hand, lacks the disarming small moments of humour that helped humanise the protagonists in "Goodfellas" ( although I personally find Nicky Santoro's (Joe Pesci) indifferent brutalising of the "degenerates" he shakes down outrageously hilarious at times ). Ray Liotta's great contribution as "Goodfellas"' Henry Hill being that manic on-the-edge whooping laugh that cut through so many scenes, complemented by Pesci's psychotic jester. The characters aren't as sympathetic because, well.....they just aren't . Yet that doesn't mean they lack depth, or that the performances are not accomplished. On the contrary, the acting across the board is exemplary, and includes numerous inspired cameos. The tone of performance for Pesci and De Niro is subtly different here. Pesci's Nicky is far grimmer and junkyard-dog meaner than the more affable, though insanely hot-tempered Tommy de Vito of GF. Tommy was, as Henry Hill said, "a funny guy", but Nicky's too busy busting balls and robbing Vegas blind to crack wise ( at least in any way that doesn't imply violence). De Niro's Ace Rothstein is a buttoned-down pro, a control freak who watches his casino with an eagle eye (so the takers don't get taken), and he's far from the smoothly dangerous Jimmy Conway from GF. Unlike GF there's no baby-faced ingenue Liotta-substitute to lighten the darker shades of both their characters. A lot of people seem to think these subtleties are so minimal as to be negligible. If you can't appreciate the film for that, well, it's your loss. Foremost, "Casino" is a tale of seduction and selfishness. Las Vegas in the 70s is the land of milk and honey for the mob, and anybody who is connected is guaranteed a piece of the action. It's a done deal......as long as nobody gets too greedy or makes waves. Famous last words indeed! Of course it all goes mightily to hell and you just KNOW it'll all end in tears. The trio of leads - Ace, Nicky and Ginger (Sharon Stone) - are all players with their own agendas, tenuously connected by vows of love or friendship, but gradually pulled apart by the glitz and neon promise of Vegas, and ultimately ruined by obstinacy, pride and naked greed. Many seem to focus on Nicky and the havoc he creates, but no less significant in the disaster that unfolds is how Ace - straightup, reliable, no-risk Ace - throws caution out the window, investing in the longest of long-shots, the love of a beautiful callgirl, Ginger.Like all Scorsese movies "Casino" is a technically flawless piece of work. Other than this there are other factors which separate it from its more esteemed predecessor. In "Goodfellas", Joe Pesci whacks Frank Vincent, whereas here Vincent whacks Pesci (and how!). It also contains the mysterious double-D factor, which is, of course, Don Rickles and DEVO. I'd give "Casino" an extra star just for including "Whip it" on the soundtrack. Bravo Martin! Yes, the violence is typically brutal and uncompromising, but it's necessary. "Casino" is a ruthless and violent tale based on very factual ruthless and violent events. That shocking "head in the vice" scenario really occurred, and, unbelievably, Scorsese DOWNPLAYS IT ( at least you'd understand that if you'd read how it's described in Nick Pileggi's book). I love Scorsese's beautiful-terrible riff on Vegas; in many ways a dirge-like ode to America's mythic history and future, where a gaudy, sleazy temple of Mammon has risen up out of the timeless, secretive desert - shining like a beacon to drive away the ghosts of buffalo, injuns, robber barons and Bugsy Siegel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Martin Scorsece's hit "mafia" film, depicting the rise and fall of group of mobsters in Las Vegas. Rob Deniro and Joe Peschi give top notch performances as the lead mobsters running the Tangiers casino in Vegas. In the first half we are shown how Deniro's character tightly operates his casino. He knows all the tricks in the books that hustlers try to pull, however noone can pull a one up on this guy. Peschi is his hitman who does most of the dirty work, but is eventually banned from all casinos. Turning in a fiery, top notch (Oscar nomination) performance is Sharon Stone as a drug hustler who enchants Deniro one day as she shows up at the casino. They marry and he hopes to "make" him fall in love with her one day, because her true love is a pimp (played by James Wood). Needless to say the last hour or so of this movie is vicious as we see the FBI crackdown on all the schemes the mobsters were trying so hard to hide in the casinos. Stone and Peschi, in particular have brutal demises. 9.3/10 extreme profanity, violence, and partial nudity. Excellent acting, direction, plot, and soundtrack. Only down side is the length of the movie, running well into above 3 1/2 hours.</fullReview>

The script, the direction, the performances, the photography, the music, the editing, the sets---all perfect! A flawless film and even better than "Goodfellas". At three hours in length, there is never a dull moment. Deniro's most heartwrenching performance! We really feel for his character. "Goodfellas", to me, slows down considerably once Joe Pesci's character dies. Not this film. Scorsese keeps the movie flying until the very end! Many people have missed the boat on this film. They say "it's too much like GOODFELLAS" or "It's too long". These people are wrong!! In time, this movie will be considered one of the best, if not the best, mafia film of all time!! It is a masterpiece in every sense and needs to be viewed many times to take in all the information. Stunning!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Goodfellas" or "Casino", "Casino" or "Goodfellas"... Which is the better film? This may never be decided. Both chronicle the lives of gangsters throughout their years, both good and bad, leading up to their eventual demises. "Casino" is an unforgettable tale of people caught up in the Las Vegas lifestyle. The overindulgence and excess of the town is explicitly portrayed in this movie. DeNiro plays a well-meaning odds-maker who is placed in charge of a casino, while Pesci acts in a perfect role as DeNiro's protective but jealous keeper. Sharon Stone turns in the role of a lifetime as the mentally-instable, paranoid, and jealous (ex-hooker) wife of Stone (DeNiro's character). The movie comes to a head in a frenetic battle between DeNiro and Stone, and the results are delicious. This movie, along with "The Godfather" and "Casino" must surely rank as the top three gangster movies of all time. Which one is first depends on one's own tastes. "Casino" certainly makes its case for number one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dizzying climax to Scorsese's Mafia trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Oliver Stone's "JFK" and Tim Burton's "Ed Wood", Scorsese had created a bit of monster for himself when he released "Goodfellas" in 1990. He created an undisputed, instant classic for which all of his subsequent films - as well as all other Mafia films - would be measured against. As magnificent as "Goodfellas" is, it can be considered a curse. This is evident in "Casino", Scorsese's more-or-less follow-up to the life depicted in "Goodfellas". It is an impressive achievement, even more dense and visceral than "Goodfellas", but it has received some derision over the years by those who have accused Scorsese of "copying himself." (How can a filmmaker "copy" himself anyway? Nobody has moaned about Spielberg constantly re-visiting the days of WWII.)Merciless in presenting his strict attention to detail, Scorsese chronicles the rise and fall of Las Vegas under the grip of the Mafia from the early 1970's to the mid 1980's. Utilizing endless freeze-frames, multiple voice-over narrators, incessant music, swirling cinematography and eye-bruising set decoration, Scorsese brings us deep into the diamond-crusted bowels of the big business of Las Vegas and how the mob "skimmed" all they could from it for over a decade. Robert De Niro brings a subtle gravity to the role of Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a genius gambling pro from Chicago recruited by the Mafia to manage and operate the four largest casinos in Vegas. Rothstein's insurance arrives in the guise of childhood friend Nicky Santoro - now a hotshot Mafia captain (and rendered with crushing brutality by Joe Pesci). After years of successful slumming as a mid-level gambler, Rothstein sees Vegas as his shot at legitimacy. He tries to solidify his dream by marrying a high-class Vegas prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), who despite her glamorous exterior and sturdy attitude, is ultimately emotionally lost and still desperately hung on her greasy pimp / boyfriend, Lester Diamond (nicely underplayed by the eternally sleazy James Woods). Ginger tires to escape Ace's marital clutch while still enjoying the perks of being the wife of the most powerful man in town, while Nicky disregards Ace's "nice-and-neat" policy of running business in favor of violent extortion and rampant thievery over everyone else in town. Ace sees the coupling together of his rocky marriage to Ginger with Nicky's aggressive attempts at taking over Las Vegas as problematic, but pride &amp; greed prevent him from acknowledging the true severity of the situation. When Ginger and Nicky's frustrations with Ace inadvertently turn them toward each other, all hell breaks loose.There are probably very few other films that hit the three-hour mark and fly by as quickly as "Casino". Longtime Oliver Stone cinematographer Robert Richardson gives Scorsese's Las Vegas a polished, glossy look; bathed in neons, pastels and solids of every color imaginable. God's gifts to Editors - that being Scorsese's number-one partner in crime, Thelma Schoonmaker, creates a smooth but frenetic pacing in Scorsese's storytelling. The music - which encompasses a bizarre brew of blues, swing, classical, doo-wop, rock and even punk - works wonders. Only Spike Lee is as skilled as Scorsese at utilizing music to re-create an era instead of merely advertising the film's accompanying soundtrack. De Niro's take on "Ace" Rothstein - who's obsessed with doing the job right - allows Scorsese to splurge on showcasing the in's-and-out's of Vegas. We see Ace chastise reckless dealers, slightly overweight dancers, and beleaguered chefs in excruciating detail. This is not limited to Ace's perceptions, Scorsese explains how money is won and lost, and how it is stolen - whether by the mob or by the players. The first hour of "Casino" could easily pass as a documentary on the mechanics of operating a gaming establishment.Aside from the usual mainstays, De Niro and Pesci, Scorsese has assembled a stellar cast. Both Sharon Stone and James Woods give fiery interpretations of their tortured characters. Stone really surprised everybody with her performance here, but really - how many people would agree to act in a Martin Scorsese picture and sleep through it anyway? Vegas comedy legends Alan King and Don Rickles also appear in straight roles as a casino manager and a mob front, respectively. The great character actor/comedian Kevin Pollack also offers his talent as the mob's squeaky-clean front man. No performance falls flat here.One way to angle the film for yourself if you're at all put-off by its structural similarities to "Goodfellas" need only regard this - "Casino" is basically an explanation of what would have happened to the characters in "Goodfellas" had they succeeded beyond the middle-class comfort of where they roamed. The film also contains the novelty value of displaying De Niro's ability to juggle! I try to be concise when writing reviews and not ramble as I have done here, but it is difficult to do so with a film like "Casino", because it is a film so crowded in its presentation. It's a traditional American Mafia story about gluttonous, reckless, greedy people. Nonetheless, it is another Scorsese masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are different levels to appreciate this work of Scorsese. Pileggi and Scorsese could be presenting an accurate social and political study on the manner in which casinos are run in USA. But it is also a study of how money buys power and success, and corrodes one's humility. It is written in the manner Greek tragedies were written showing the climb to power and the inevitable downfall of the powerful following the state of hubris (here the firing of an incompetent employee with the right connection}. Compare Ace (de Niro's character), thoughtful about mundane details such as alerting a stranger about a good pen that he could well lose at the bar and who winces at Nick's subsequent violent actions, to the later Ace, who is insensitive to violent actions he himself orchestrates. Compare Nick (Pesci), who seeks permission from Ace to live in Las Vegas, to the later Nick, who drunk with power refuses to acknowledge he once asked Ace's permission. In many ways 'Casino' is a director/screenplay writers film than an actors' film. Performances, though commendable, take a back seat. Is it a mere gangster film or is the film using the gangster and hustler backdrop to offer the audience another perspective of America beyond the obvious? The social commentary here is somewhat like Altman's films "Nashville" or "A Wedding".The religious Christian motifs of redemption underlie much of Scorcese's work, unconsciously or consciously, and Casino offers a viewer several perspectives, if you choose to assess his films in that perspective. (Scorsese is an admirer of Terrence Mallick, whose film "The thin red line", which incidentally also was pregnant with religious motifs--e.g., tattoos of Biblical references).One can also appreciate Casino as an example of good movie craftmanship. Take the sequence of Sharon Stone's introduction in the film, where she is obviously aware that Ace is staring at her. It is so well done that one notices Sharon Stone visage and actions, while the editing and direction are really top notch as well, which contribute to make the sequence superb. Sharon Stone gives a riveting performance, as do De Niro and Pesci. Kudos to Scorsese on the appropriate 70s music at various stages in the film's progress. While I appreciate Scorcese's choice of Ace's voice over commentary, I was surprised at Nick's commentary intertwining the voice-over of Ace. This method does makes sense if both are alive at the end of the film; not otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see this as a quasi-sequel to "Goodfellas", where we followed the life of a newcomer to the mafia and crime. In this movie, we start already with the characters in a crime world, and the movie changes setting to Las Vegas, where in the 50's and 60's the Casinos where ruled by an ellaborate web of bosses and dirty businesses. The police tried to stop it, but it was their money which was bringing the city to life. De Niro is great, as usual, Pesci is a show-stealer, and Stone, a novelty in Scorsese's work (as Ray Liotta was in "Godfellas"), has a much-earned oscar nomination in the role of an empty woman whose path leads to decay. Scorsese's direction is fantastic (I recommend this as an introduction to his work), flamboyant and lusty as it has always been, and this is to me one of his best works. See it and marvel at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems Casino is the third in the trio of scorsese mob films, and the epic of the three. From its wonderfully insane characterisation to its stunning mise-en-scene to its rolling narrative, i truly beleive this is a strong contender for movie of the century. Where citizen kane gripped you for the duration, casino equally grips you but with an added touch of wit and shock. citizen kane DOES look dated now, and whether it is all round perfection is debatable. i think orson welles' extensive contribution and its controversy at the time attributes to its enormous success. casino, however, has been largely looked over since its release, but many believe it holds its place as the greatest film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing film from start to finish...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: A film chronicling the rise and fall of a gambling empire in Las Vegas during it's heyday. Sam "Ace" Rothstein has been personally appointed by the mob to head a casino which he proves himself, but at the same time a relentless obsessive whose meticulousness reaches so far as to the number of blueberries in muffins that the casino sells. His childhood friend Nicky Santoro has moved to Las Vegas with his crew to start up a business. In the midst of it all, Sam meets Ginger, a woman he eventually marries, but in a downward spiral of power and greed, they all find themselves in the middle of it all.Review: Absolutely one of the best films of 1995, "Casino" is a truly good film with top notch performances from DeNiro and Pesci as usual, but the real surprise is Sharon Stone, completely eschewing her sex symbol from "Basic Instinct" to playing a woman who lives in her dark side. The cinematography of the film matches the tone and look of the story with it's best performances from the entire cast. Unfortunately, Don Rickles and James Woods are wasted in fairly small roles but still provide depth to the film nonetheless. Leonard Maltin didn't know what he was talking about when he reviewed this film, because it's an engrossing story that needed to be told in a three hour length. It's not something you'd pay to see in a theater, but it is something you should see on VHS or DVD. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of Frank Lefty Rosenthal, this is a moving and violent masterpiece. Scorsese and De Niro teams up again and Joe Pesci in his first collaboration with them after Goodfellas(1990). Sharon Stone is a standout in this film and also received and Academy Award nomination for best actress in a supporting role. Writer Nicholas Pileggi's (aslo wrote the book Wiseguy which Goodfellas is based on) screenplay which he co-wrote with Scorsese is very sharp.I'm not going to tell you what the movie is about, but the fact that it's a true story is amazing. Scorsese is an absolute favourite of mine and De Niro is equally impressive. Joe Pesci is splendid as the short-tempered, violent Nicky and Stone is brilliant as Ace's wife GingerPerhaps the best film of the 90s, if not the century! Marvelous!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweeping epic about a couple of households in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweeping epic of nuanced history, resolutely focused on DeNiro, his wife Sharon Stone, and his childhood friend Pesci. It fit like a jigsaw piece into my aggregate understanding of how organized crime worked in Las Vegas a few decades ago. I found it amusing that DeNiro plays a casino boss with all-encompassing power, just like Tony Curtis' character in "Forty Pounds of Trouble," a distinctly different movie in countless ways. Also amusing is Don Rickles' stone-faced portrayal of the casino manager--he hardly says a word, let alone a wisecrack.The film is extremely violent from the opening minutes. It is also rather long (nearly three hours), but the cinematography is so beautiful--and one is always flinching, preparing for the next gruesome confrontation--that the time moves quickly. I wasn't impressed with Sharon Stone (I liked her more in "Total Recall," if you see what I mean) but this film made me want to rent more Scorcese and DeNiro movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a great fan of mob-movies, I have seen a lot of them. Casino ranks right up to the top-list along with Godfather and Goodfellas.Yes, the movie is long.. It lasts for about three hours, which might be a bit too long for a movie to last. How to keep one's interest up? Casino involves a lot of talking and only brief glimpses of action. Fortunately, the plot is interesting, yet easy to follow. This does not mean that the plot is stupid, though..And the action.. Well, don't come looking for any of that "Bam, your dead" -kinda action. Be set up for some really gory executions. This movie is not for the fainthearted..Sharon Stone was really surprisingly good, she was really annoying.. which is just what she should be. Every actor did his/her role accordingly, it is kind of hard to say anything about De Niro.. His character does not show that many feelings, but De Niro is still one of my favorite actors.Excellent movie, just takes some time to watch. If you are into mob-things, you will surely like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film ever ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a modern movie buff (meaning my movie history starts with films like Scarface and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, not Casablanca or From Here to Eternity). I have seen close to 500 movies in my day - everything from DC Cab to Fast Break to A Bronx Tale - and Casino is without a shadow of a doubt the best I have ever watched. DeNiro is sublime, Stone gives the best performance of her career, and Pesci is at his obnoxious, menacing best. The costumes, the score, the dialogue. My brother and I can have whole conversations with each other talking only in quotes from the flick: ("Mr. Clark I don't think you understand what it is I do. ... About the time I'm coming out of jail, hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma. And I'll bust your head wide open again. Cause I'm f***in' stupid.") There was a time when I thought nothing could touch The Godfather II as the ultimate mob drama with a real plot and authentic characters who make you care. Then I saw Casino during my sophomore year in college, and, for me, nothing has come close cinematically. If you loved the gore of The Untouchables, then this is for you. If you loved the tragedy of Carlito's Way, then Casino is for you. If you loved the authenbticity of Donnie Brasco then this flick is for. Hell, if you loved the warped, anal retentive Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets, then Sam Rothstein will blow you away. Whatever you want in a movie, you got it here - with the notable exception of minority actors, save a few Japanese "whales" inserted only for storytelling purposes. I challenge any true movie critic to name three movies with more depth, a better plot, a better narrarator, better actors than this epic. After 50 plus viewings I'm still searching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie on the big screen when it was first released, I was overwhelmed, and not in a pleasant way. The only other Scorsese film I had seen in a theater was The Age of Innocence. Casino simply had too much dirty words, blood n guts, insanity, strife, drugs, and messed-up stuff in general for me to enjoy on an initial screening at a movie theater. The surreal lighting didn't help matters. However, I recently watched it (on a much smaller screen) and liked it. Robert DeNiro's character, Ace Rothstein is likable, even though he could be a jerk. He never once hit Sharon Stone's character, Ginger, unlike Joe Pesci's character, Nicky Santuro.SPOILER ALERT I guess what I liked about Ace is he never really changed, despite the fact that Ginger and Nicky agreed to the contrary just before one of their disgusting love-making marathons. He really was a tight-wad even before becoming big in Vegas, and he knew Ginger and Nicky were slime right from the start. He saw the good in Ginger, and that's what he was attracted to when he decided to marry her. She wasn't just a call girl to him. Unfortunately for her, she must have not valued that good in herself enough to stay out of trouble and stay alive. As for Nicky, when he first decided to come to Vegas he DID consult Ace. Ace's gut was against it, but he decided to agree because he and Nicky were friends. If Ace had trusted his instincts to begin with, he might not have gone through the same troubles he had. In the end, we see that Ace goes back to doing what he did before he "became big", which helps prove he never really changed- he just acted on his instincts in the environment he was in. He made some big mistakes, to be sure. But the beauty of it is, he didn't "play the game"- he was himself. And basically, that's what this movie is about- an environent in a particular time. Ace, who, besides being an excellent gambler, really has no outstanding qualities and is something of an everyman, chronicles what it was like to be in his position in a way that people can sympathize with.Ginger's demise is, to say the least, the most satisfying of the movie. I found nothing about her character appealing, except for perhaps the first scene in which she appears. From then on, she personifies fakeness, emptiness. It's really sad that the one person she kept running back to was such a sleazebag (James Woods).Nicky's death was pretty tough to watch. The setting in the corn rows is creepy and the images are very grotesque. Sharon Stone and DeNiro are suberb in this movie. The tension between them in certain scenes is incredible. It seems like some of the scenes are improvised, they're so dead on. Well-acted, well-directed, well-written, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is an underrated film that sits in the shadow of other Scorsese greats like Goodfellas. However, I honestly think this is Scorsese's best picture. It has the best ensemble cast out of all his films, and each character is opened up more than in Goodfellas. Sharon Stone's role is amazing and very enjoyable to watch... Pesci is his same great self... and De Niro shows us once again why he is the best actor of the last few decades. I found that this story was very engaging and the insight it offered behind Las Vegas, crime, and casinos was very interesting. The direction of this movie is superb... each scene carries emotion and brilliance. I truly believe this movie deserves to earn a much higher IMDB rating. It deserves to be among the top 250 movies, if not much higher. In fact, along with Pulp Fiction and American Beauty, Casino is among my 3 favorite dramas ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Casino" is a great film, but it's a film I can only watch rarely because it's so depressing. In contrast to the always-entertaining "Goodfellas," Casino has the same high production values and excellent acting, but in my opinion the plot is somewhat weaker and it's just so depressing. The first half of the movie is very entertaining, but once everything starts to go downhill the movie becomes almost painful to watch, and viewing the ending scenes is like being slowly bludgeoned by a sledgehammer.Great job, almost too good. After developing an affection for these characters, we get to watch them slooooowwwllyyyy deteriorate in their own rot. The effect is something like watching a loved one die slowly of cancer.Well, I like and admire this movie (and own it on DVD) but I just can't watch it too often. 8/10 -- maybe it deserves a 9 or a 10, but I have to include overall entertainment value in my ratings, especially a picture aimed at mainstream audiences.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro, nothing shy of what should have been an Oscar nominated performance. Joe Pesci is great in another Scorsese classic as is, surprisingly, Sharon Stone, who earned the only film's Oscar nomination.

		<fullReview>Casino, is an ambitious project from Scorsese, but the backbone to this story is reinforced by exemplary performances from De Niro, Pesci and Stone. He then glosses their inner-relationships with magical camera work, and a soundtrack which captures the essence, and emotion of the era. Although, essentially a mob-drama, this film is about the relationships of the main players, and their relationship with the mechanics of the mob. What people think about the mob is that they go around killing people indiscriminately. However, the intrinsic reason is the money, they want to continue seeing the kickbacks, the green. I think De Niro gives an honest portrayal of a Casino boss who just wants things to run smoothly; the casino, his marriage to Ginger, and most importantly the machinations of the mob. He is outshone here though by both Stone and Pesci, who's captivating, repulsive characters, makes for a sympathetic viewpoint of De Niro's character. My only fault here is the ending, which in its entirety resolves the fates of the other characters, but with De Niro's it ends so matter-of-factly that it compromises the outcome of the film.A veritable feast of film. 9/10 7/10 if you don't like swearing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(The first of which being "The Godfather", of course) Martin Scorsese's "Casino" is a film that you can watch in all of its grand length and not feel as though you are watching a marathon. Just about the only thing there to remind you that this is a 3-hour film is the fact you have to get up and change video cassettes 2/3's of the way in. While the film is not as great as Scorsese's other mafia epic "Goodfellas", it is told in the same narrative style and lets you view the other side of the mob in Las Vegas. DeNiro is once again dynamic in his role as a Casino operator and Joe Pesci (one of the most underrated film actors of his generation, save for the Oscar he got for "Goodfellas") gives one of his patented high energy, ruthless and funny performances as the Mafia enforcer from New York who is sent to Vegas by the mob to keep things in line in Vegas. Sharon Stone also does a surprisingly good job in her role as a strung out gambler and former call-girl that becomes the apple in DeNiro's eye, easily the best performance of her career. But the film is not about individual performances, per-se, like "Goodfellas", the film is an exercise in brilliant story telling, style and superb filmmaking skill. The visuals, colors and images in this film are among the most mesmerizing of any Scorsese film since "Taxi Driver" and as many IMDB users have noted, the soundtrack of the film is among the best in film history and is used perfectly along the way and plays an important part in the storytelling. This is among an elite class of mob movies and an excellent film on its own rites. How Martin Scorsese has never won a "Best Director" Oscar in all these years of brilliance is Hollywood's greatest mystery. Lets hope he's due for a "Lifetime Achievement" one pretty soon. I give it a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting Coda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The feeling of revisited material notwithstanding, Martin Scorsese's close of his New Mafia trilogy ("Main Streets" and "GoodFellas" were the first two chapters) is striking for its last-gasp desperation and depletion: when it runs out of steam it simply expires--there's nothing left. The expulsion of the Mob from Las Vegas also serves to reinforce Scorsese's recurring themes of redemption and ascension; here both are mutually exclusive and to be redeemed and delivered from hell means an existence in purgatory. (Heaven, meanwhile, is reserved for the blue-haired innocents who have become the guests of the corporations that have purged Vegas from sin.) By the time it's over, Scorsese seems exhausted; he doesn't have anything left to say on the subject and it looks doubtful he ever will. Still, if he never makes another masterpiece, this will be a fitting coda on a remarkable subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino, by Martin Scorsese, is the result of 100 years of cinema. It's like everything is here. Who could have done it if not Martin Scorsese, the filmmaker that is equally in love of watching movies just as he is in love of making them.The plot of Casino is simple: mafia running Las Vegas, things going great, mafia gets screwed, things go terrible.The individual details: the doomed love relationship between a gangster and his wife, and the doomed friendship between a gangster and his pal.In the meantime, we have three hours of incredible filmmaking: pans, cranes, dollys, freeezed frames, all of them used in some amazingly creative visual solutions; supported by the best use of the soundtrack i've ever seen on any movie.There's a scene when we have a freeze frame of sharon stone, and the soundtracks go "baby, oh baby you're the one", as de niro's watching her... What else? Top performances by everyone involved, even in the smallest roles. Sharon Stone and James Woods, however, steal every scene they're in to.Scorsese, again, gets religious, and emphasizes the metaphor of paradise (casinos, las vegas) lost by sinning (look around for all those capital sins references).It's entertaining, violent, funny and dramatic, it has all the elements there, and even if it's long you wish it were longer to see more creativity dripping from the screen. Casino is one of the best films of the century, certainly of the 90's, it's a pity how critics and audiences weren't prepared for it...and it's a pity than, with CASINO on the map, the best picture oscar went to Braveheart...it's just ridiculous, at least they should have nominated this movie...don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese is great,and so is Casino!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I thought it was very good, but nothing special.When I saw it again I thought it was maybe the best film ever made.The way it`s told and what amazes me the most is that the story is true. I love Scorsese and Robert De Niro and this is their best film together after Raging Bull.Sharon Stone is very good in this film and as always Joe Pesci is very convincing.This film deserves a place in the top 250 and it also deserved some oscars. The movie lasts for 3 hours,but it feels like 1 hour, I mean...It`s never boring and I can watch this movie every day and not get tired of it. It`s absolutely a brilliant film and the acting is beautiful and thank you to Nicholas Pileggi(co-writer and the book).The movie is so realistic in every way and it`s truly a masterpiece.Robert De Niro handles the role as "Ace" perfectly and this is maybe he`s best role after Jake La Motta(Raging Bull). Joe Pesci is always great together with De Niro and this role is very similar to the role as Tommy in Goodfellas(also directed by Scorsese). And last but not least,Sharon Stone. She really deserved that oscar because in this film she is so great and manages the role great.So you have to see this film,it`s one of the best ever.It` really a bit touching to because in the end they lose everything. The music also is absolutely great and this is a clear 10/10. Scorsese+De Niro=SUCCESS!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As films of around 3 hours go, this is one that will be able to keep you glued to the screen from start to finish - and it is easy to see why.Looking first at the director, Martin Scorsese, he has once again turned out another masterpiece through not only his standard creative cinematography but through the use of an extremely clever and entertaining series of narratives from both central and cameo roles.The lead actors have also done themselves proud in this film. Each of them allowing you a truthful and honest insight into their individual persona's, giving the viewer a closeness to the characters and their plight that is rarely seen in films of today.This film is frequently compared I think unfairly to 'Goodfellas'. Although the underlying theme is similar. 'Casino' has much less down time for the viewer and allows you to work away feeling less empty than 'Goodfellas' does.With some of the most violent scenes since 'Reservoir Dogs' it is certainly not for the squeemish but certainly well worth a look.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Scorsese masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino, like Goodfellas is based on a non-fiction book by Nick Pilleggi. Director Martin Scorses reunites with Robert DeNiro. Joe Pesci, a co-star in Raging Bull and Goodfellas also stars here. This film is another great piece in the legendary career of Martin Scorsese. Casino is almost 3 hours long, but is very riveting and intense. Scorsese was robbed yet again at the Oscars. It's not as good as some of Scorsese's other films, but is still very good.DeNiro and Pesci are midwestern mobsters who get involved in the casino business in Las Vegas. Sharon Stone plays a showgirl who marries DeNiro's character. We always knew Sharon was sexy, but here we find out she can act, too. She is great in this film, which also includes James Woods and Don Rickles among a large supporting cast. Casino delivers all the things we've come to expect from Scorsese: a long but exciting movie with great action, interesting characters played by top actors, popular music used effectively and alot of violence and profanity. Martin Scorsese is the best director out there today. His name on a motion picture is a virtual guarantee of a good time. Casino is just another in the long line of masterpieces he's given us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Good, Awesome Movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this on TV a bunch of times, but I finally borrowed it for DVD. Un-edited. OK, so it was pretty profane. However, this movie was very underrated, and was a great film! I'll mention some points. POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! Martin Scorcesse has many gifts, but one of them is knowing how to put the perfect music in a scene. The songs in the movie were perfect in every scene. Especially "House of the Rising Sun" at the end, when everyone got whacked. Another point was great acting. Deniro should have been at least nominated for an Oscar, and Sharon Stone did a very good job. The best acted scene in the movie was when RD went to that restaurant, and met SS after she tied up their kid. Deniro was SO good in that scene. It's brief, but great!! ANOTHER POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! Also, the violence was brutal, especially at the end. Where you see about 5 people get shot in the head. Nasty. Also... BIG SPOILER!!! is when Pesci and his brother were beaten to death with the bats. Very bloody, and gross. However, I REALLY love this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese creates a vivid sense of time and place, and gets terrific work from DeNiro, Pesci, and especially Stone in a career-best performance. The behind-the-scenes depictions of Las Vegas are amazing. The only flaw is that the film is at times too reminiscent of the director's own Goodfellas" (1990). But when you're being reminded of such a fantastic film, is it really a flaw?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually wonder if Goodfellas was a prequel to Goodfellas or the sequel to Goodfellas. Believe or nor, it was one of the most violent films of all time and a great one thanks to maverick director Martin Scorsese. Every movie he makes, it earns an Oscar nomination or two. For example, this film earned Sharon Stone and oscar nomination. But this is the only film I known that had tons of "F" words. There was a rumor that it had 362 "F" words. There was no film that had extreme rapid-fire profanity. But this film had. I think that one of the most violent ever filmed was the scene where the mobster take Nicky Santoro and his brother to the cornfield and they beat the crap out of him and his brother. And the other was the scene where Nicky Santoro puts someone in a vice and squeezes his hand you that his eyeballs popped out. Part of that scene is cut to avoid a NC-17 rating. If you haven't seen it, SEE It. You will never forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if you had all your wishes come true and then lost everything? Casino winds its way through a rags to riches to rags story better than any movie I have seen. It is a dream becoming a nightmare.In some ways Casino is better than Goodfellas and in others it is similar. This similarity could be seen as a drawback but for me Casino is the sequel to Goodfellas. Both are based on true stories about the mob written by Nicholas Pileggi and are an achievement that can only be compared in quality to The Godfather 1 and 2. The magnificent opening of Casino shows Martin Scorsese using a more grand style. The wide open vistas of the desert are contrasted with the neon world of the gambler and the old neighborhood of the mob bosses. Robert De Niro is very effective in being the "rational" one who pleads that if everybody just follows the "rules" they would all be winners. His irrational equal (including in acting ability) is Sharon Stone who will not be tamed and helps to bring the whole house of cards down. In the Godfather films and in Goodfellas there are winners as well as losers. Casino is about losing it all.I felt Pesci's limitations were shown in the "romantic" scenes between him and Stone. Still, I can't think of anyone else who can do a better job playing a ruthless thug. And this drawback was more than made up by the excellent James Woods as the slimy boyfriend. Great stuff.Casino juggles success, corruption, vicious violence and farce in a broad sweep that never fails to impress. It's tale of destruction in some ways leads to sympathy. For these characters are like children who can never learn. They can never see the cause of their downfall, themselves. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be regarded as one of ten best films of the decade. Martin Scorsese brings light to the powerful underground of the Las Vegas community which fuels the city. Scorsese captures the glitz-and-smoke-and-mirrors feel of the city with his outstanding cinematography and visuals. DeNiro and Pesci play off of each other brilliantly. With Pesci's out-of-control acting and violence and De Niro's calm, calculating manner - you can see why they reunited for this epic picture. Sharon Stone also holds her own as the manipulative, drugged out Ginger. Definately her career's best performance.From the explosive opening scene, through the casino operations, exploring the strained relationships of the characters and finally to the disastorous ending - Scorsese takes us on a wild ride through one of the best crime movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken alone, this was an excellent movie, very watchable, if a bit long. However, a lot of this movie obviously plays very close to what some of the people involved in it have played before. De Niro's character is eerily similar to Al Pacino's in "The Godfather II", and Joe Pesci could easily be playing himself in "Goodfellas". This is another solid effort from Scorcese and crew, but it lacks originality.There were some interesting points. Sharon Stone was excellent, but once again, she seems to remind me of Talia Shire's Connie in "The Godfather". The same could be said of James Woods, who plays a Fredo-like scumbag (maybe Fredo wasn't that bad, but still....). To top it all off, we've got De Niro AND Pesci doing Ray Liotta's over-voice shtick from "Goodfellas".All in all, I would recommend this movie, but I'd also recommend you see the other movies I've mentioned here first. The acting here is good, the plot isn't lacking, the only negative side is that it does get a little violent. All the same, if you're familiar with Scorcese's work, at times you feel like this movie is basically Henry Hill narrating the Corleone family history. It's hard to see this group be so good without quite reaching the greatness they've achieved in the past.</fullReview>

It's a magnificent film, and though many draw similarities between Goodfellas and Casino, the only connection i see is Pesci, who frequently plays Pesci, and plays him well. Sharon Stone shows amazing dramatic range, Deniro shows amazing restraint in the lead role, and Scorsese's restless camera shows the viewer everything. the inner-workings of vegas and the casino business, carefully researched by nicholas pileggi (in a great book!) eventually filtered through Scorsese's masterful cinematic eye, make Casino one helluva good movie, and one of the rare 3 hour movies you wish would just keep going...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that I believe that Scorsese and De Niro make a great pair might lead some people to think that I started watching this movie with the idea that it was going to be good, in other words, that I had a certain assurance that it was good. Well I didn't. However, I could have had one and the movie would still have reached my expectations. I thought it was absolutely brilliant with some funny scenes and some great acting. The movie talks about, as it says in the title, a casino. But it's not just a casino. It's THE casino ran by Sam "ACE" Rothstein (De Niro). Ace is the best football handicapper in the country but is so good that you could say he cheats when he bets. Plus he never bets unless he is sure to win. But in Las Vegas, running a casino requires help. So his bosses in Kansas City send down one f his best friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), to watch his back. As usual, Pesci plays a rather crazy character who seems to be particularly fond of being a gangster.  In Vegas, Ace marries Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and complicates his life by doing so. Sharon Stone is incredibly brilliant in her Oscar-nominated role as the woman who begins the whole catastrophe and is as beautiful as ever. However, things between Ace, Ginger and Nicky spice up and lead to disasters and multiple murders. "Casino" is one of the best Scorsese-De Niro movies. The script by Nicholas Pileggi is as good as the one he wrote for "Goodfellas". It's excellent. Now enough said. It's up to you to see it.</fullReview>

The movie Casino was still THAT vivid in my mind.I don't know anything about "House odds" or professional gambling but I still couldn't help watching the casino staff ....you know - the dealer watches you, the floor manager watches him, the cameras watch...etc.When a limo driver said to us while driving,"...you know this place was alot different when the mob owned it.." I replied "yes I know. I've seen the movie!"it's scary how some movies are just entertainment and others make you stop and go WHOA! I'm just glad I didn't witness any heart attacks (electric cattle prod anyone?) or else I would have been really freaked.I loved Las vegas. The whole city is one big movie soundstage! Scorcese really knew a diamond in the rough when he signed on to make this....and at half the price of waterworld, just shows you can get quality without big money but you never recoup big money without quality.PS Joe Pesci just cuts me up. The funniest gangster ever, even better than his Goodfellas role, and that's high praise indeed!10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas remake????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I've seen a lot of films. And I have seen a lot of gangster films. But Casino...what can I say. I've heard people say that this was simply Scorcese's attempt to remake Goodfellas in a different part of America. I would say that while the idea behind it is the same, this has a very different feel to it. Goodfellas was pure gangster stuff. It was Liotta's "Hey, this is a cool life" description of how everything happened. Casino was more "How we f***ed everything up" from the view of the cool De Niro. Scorcese simply used a winning formula, his usual winning cast and his usual classy soundtrack technique to put together what is the most absorbing film I have ever seen. It may be very complicated to understand how the 'skims' work and which boss is which, but that's unnecessary. The harrowing scenes with Pesci remain in the mind and De Niro's ice cold reactions as Stone falls apart make this a brilliant film. Watch it. Watch it again. And I promise you, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

If anything sets the tone of the movie as a fun-loving, Las Vegas vacation, it's the 50's period music. Of course, it's not a Las Vegas vacation spot they're talking about; it's mob-control of the casinos and some foreshadowing of another film -- "Leaving Las Vegas" which earned an Oscar. This one is more palatable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught a little piece of this on TV and had to run out and rent the widescreen version. (Look for that edition--don't waste your time on the pan-and-scan version.)First I have to say that "Casino" is a striking and engrossing film, but there are several graphically violent scenes which--although they may be appropriate in the context of the movie--are completely sickening. Consider yourself warned, but don't cheat yourself out of watching a masterpiece. Just keep the remote control handy.In this film, both the camera and the soundtrack are characters in themselves. Scorsese's lens clings lovingly to De Niro, who gives one of his best performances. I agree with other comments that the first 40 minutes are outstanding and completely draw you in. After setting up this universe, Scorsese literally demolishes it. What really struck me was the haunting sense of inescapable doom the viewer feels as everything unravels right before your eyes. I felt positively hunted by the fate that was descending on the screen. I didn't really like "Goodfellas," but this film is superior in every way.</fullReview>

Scorsese tells this one on many different levels-running the casino, behind the casino doors, who really gets your money, and what NOT to do when you visit the casino. As well as great performances, there is a great soundtrack, setting and cinematography.

		<fullReview>People always tend to say that Casino can't be a classic because it's too similar to Goodfellas. Obviously, there are quite a number of similarities between the two but why does that drag Casino down? The direction alone makes this movie worth watching. Scorsese simply makes all other gangster films inferior with his mastery. You can leave this film on mute and still really enjoy it. But then you'll miss the best dialogue of any gangster movie in 25 years. It's overwhelming how quotable this movie is. People that write this film off need to explain where the weakness in this film lies. Even the soundtrack is incredible. The acting is ridiculously good and should be the measuring stick for all films within this genre. It clearly belongs on the shelf next to The Godfather series, Donnie Brasco, Scarface, Miller's Crossing, and of course, Goodfellas.</fullReview>

When I watched this, I remembered when the Simpsons were watching Casino on TV and they said, "Casino, starring Joe Pesci, due to violent content, Joe Pesci will not be seen." Its so true. But even though Pesci's character was extremely violent, they showed the good side of him, making breakfast for his kid every morning. Sharon Stone finally shows she can do drama, and be believable. She shows that there can be slums in Las Vegas, while everyone around her is doing just fine. Then there is De Niro who stands as the calm, sensible guy that only f**ks everything up by making few very small mistakes. But ironically, he is the only one left, and continues his gambling life, and by what it looks like, succeeds.Great Movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The name DeNiro alone automatically guarantees the movie to be a classic, add the name Scorsese and well, you have instant gold on screen.The most recent teaming of the masters of film has produced a very entertaining and thought provoking story of life in Las Vegas when it was at the mercy of the mob.DeNiro turns in a flawless performance as Sam Rothstein, a professional gambler who was like a cash register, he was put in charge of a large CASINO bye the mob. His performance as a perfectionist gambler who tries to run a casino and make an honest woman of his wife (played perfectly by Sharon Stone), was worthy of an Oscar (As has every other performance he has done).Pesci once again joins his Italian friends DeNiro and Scorsese to turn in a performance as a psychotic maniac who has an obsession with inflicting pain. The genius of Pesci is that he can play a clumsy funny annoying character, such as Leo Getz (Lethal Weapon 2 3 and 4) and then flip the script and play a truly scary maniac such as Nicki in Casino.The next time DeNiro and Scorsese work together will once again undoubtably be another movie great.Truly a great movie, not to be mistaken as another Goodfellas, but to have it's own place upon the mountain of movie masterpieces.</fullReview>

Sharon makes an already great movie even better, with her outstanding performance as De Niro's alcoholic and drug-abusing wife. She's amazing to watch. That performance remains as Sharon's best performance to date. This film has all the elements of a great film. Where "Goodfellas" was boring, this movie is exciting.

Even Scorsese's mom (God bless--I know this was her last appearance) seems to be atypically hamming it up in this one, with the "Ay"s and "'atsa matta you"s. A movie that ventures dangerously close to self-parody. And Scorsese's worth more than that.</fullReview>

I felt in Goodfellas the characters reached a point where they had it all and then they went down but in Casino they kinda had it all at the beginning then went completely downhill from there. I've always enjoyed Scorsese's use of violence. Sudden and brutal. But the "Head in a Vice" and the beating with bats left a bad taste. After you see them you say "Why Oh Why didn't he just shoot 'em in the head.". However it is an entertaining epic, a credit to all involved.</fullReview>

I came into this one expecting a rehash of his other movies, but came away pleasantly surprised (not to mention disturbed by the ultra-violent scenes, especially a sickening scene at the end with Joe Pesci and his brother, but it's what's to be expected in these types of movies; it definitely did not detract from the movie).Great performances by Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and an underrated performance by Sharon Stone, but the real star here is the terrific soundtrack, which not only adds much to the movie but is also a great listen-to on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be difficult to find a flaw in this film. It has been criticised for its violence - its a violent story, its language - the characters swear a lot, and even that it has all been done before - is there a completely original idea anywhere? I really liked the use of the narrative too.I must admit, I saw a television version so a great deal of the language and violence was removed, but this was still a polished and classy film with an engaging story-line and talented cast. This film of paradise slowly unravelling is an interesting morality tale. Definitely worth a watch. My vote 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favorite mob movie. Say what you will about Goodfellas, this is better. The documentary style filming by Martin Scorcese during the first 40 minutes delves deep into the inner workings of a mob run casino. The first 40 minutes is brilliant. From there the movie chronicles Ace Rothstein's marriage, his business of running the casino, his hitman pal Nicky Santaro, and his wife's affair with Nicky. I really, really love Robert DeNiro and here he has a great supporting cast: Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles, James Woods, and Frank Vincent. All of them put on great performances. I love mob movies anyways but this one rocks. It's got a great soundtrack. Frank Vincent and Joe Pesci steal the show with the two best characters. And the ending scene of Joe Pesci and his brother being beaten to death with baseball bats in a corn field then buried alive to the tune of Eric Burdon's "The House Of The Rising Sun" is probably five of my most favorite minutes in film ever. And it will give you nightmares. I have the soundtrack, I have the movie. They both rule. #7 on my top 100 favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese strikes again with as much punch as Goodfellas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that I do have my qualms with Martin Scorsese on a few levels. Sue me, I was not totally blown over by Raging Bull and The King of Comedy was a little too zany for my satisfaction. Goodfellas, however, really impressed me, and Casino, following in the same tradition as Goodfellas, scores big time as well. Like Goodfellas, it knows how to tell an intriguing story, makes its characters complex, and does not establish any heroes within its cast. The actors work remarkably well as an ensemble, not letting either of the three be the star, and displaying reality and charisma to their roles without becoming campy.Casino works in the same way as The Godfather did, telling a fascinating tale of the mob, murder, corruption, and power. It does not give us anything that we don't want, having spectacular camerawork in the traditional Scorsese fashion, but not removing anything from the actual story. Going against what some have stipulated, De Niro and Pesci do not reprise their parts from Goodfellas; these characters have their own meat and style to them. Casino reminded me of the reason why I love movies; hopefully Scorsese will continue in the same tradition as this in the future, and not jerk me around like he sometimes does. Casino is one of the best films of 1995. Rating: Four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone think this could be anything but a great movie when you have Scorcese, Pesci and DeNiro in the same 3-hour film? If so, they should be arrested.I recall hearing Scorcese describe this movie a year before it was released. It made me want to buy tickets then. I ended up seeing it 4 times in the theatres when it came out. 12 hours of amazement.Granted, I am a huge fan of all of the main actors and have a great interest in the Las Vegas scene, Mob films and the Mob's involvement in Vegas. So, really, I could not lose.The photography was fantastic. There are many, many scenes that I can watch over and over with the TV on mute and still be amazed.Scorcese is a master at capturing the body language and facial expressions that are so crucial for this type of movie. With ANY other director, this movie would have been a different beast altogether.Basically, go see this move now....or there is gonna be trouble. -JJS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much one can say about perfection and greatness which definitely go hand in hand with CASINO. Marty Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi have struck gold once again in this tale of power, lust, and greed in the adolescent Las Vegas of the 70's. The rise and fall of the mafia's strong-hold in Las Vegas is told brilliantly as if its the Holy Roman Empire. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci together again, what more do you need? Now I loved the voiceovers in GOODFELLAS because it kept a good pace going in the film. Same goes for CASINO, along with excellent cinematography and lighting. Some scenes may be a little too gory for some viewers, but I loved them, it really made the atmosphere more intense and raw. I've heard different responses to Sharon Stone's character, I thought she did a really good job, it's hard to get engrossed in a shallow, heartless role like Ginger. This definitely goes down as one of my all time favorites, a brilliant masterpiece by far. "....And one by one the dominoes began to tumble...."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this film, in its entirety, three times, and it keeps getting better. The first time I saw it it seemed tired and "done-before", like a rehash of "GoodFellas" and "Scarface", but now I think it's one of Scorsese's best. In fact, it takes suggested ideas from those two films, and others ("The King of Comedy", "Vertigo", etc.), and expands them, explores them, and gives us an entirely new perspective. I always appreciate a director who gives us things we haven't seen before, or at the very least, gives us a new way of looking at things we have seen before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very violent, but also very entertaining. Pesci, DeNiro, and Stone are great-also the supporting players- especially Rickles and Vincent. Pesci is the great little tough guy of our generation. The movie is certainly a drama, but there are also many comic components. I like the continuing interplay across several movies between Pesci and Frank Vincent. In Raging Bull, Pesci attacks Vincent. In Goodfellas, Pesci kills Vincent and buries him. In Casino, at the end, Vincent kills Pesci with a baseball bat and then "ships" and buries him. I believe most people like the violence- they just don't want to admit it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to say? Casino is a great movie. Maybe some people don't know it, but Casino is the third part of Scorsese's trilogy about the mob. The first part was Mean Streets (1973), the second GoodFellas. I liked Casino because of the story and the fabulous music. Besides, Casino is based on a true story. For the first time in her life, Sharon Stone shows that she is a good actress. Pesci and De Niro are excellent(as usual). It is really a shame that Casino didn't get an Oscar for Best Picture. But you know the story: "It's not always the best movie that wins an Award..." Isn't it Mr. Mel Gibson-Braveheart?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert de niro , joe pesci and even frank vincent turn out together in another movie following the highly under-publicised (though not underrated) raging bull, and goodfellas. They are put on the Las Vegas stage with beautiful precision by the best director never to win an Oscar, Marty Scorcese. This time Sharon Stone joins in this tough, violent and very foul-mouthed gangster movie, plotting the fortunes and eventual misfortunes of a Casino manager (de niro), his mob friend (pesci), and Ginger, a Vegas hustler (Stone).Despite being about forty minutes too long, this film is a superb mix of scorceses documentary style on how the casino never loses money (if only I'd known that before going to Vegas!!), and how Stone literally sent the two main men in Vegas (de niro and pesci)to failure.Although probably not as well flowing as Goodfellas, Casino has many of its own qualities. The music is superb, the subtleties in the script very impresive on about the third viewing, and the violence more bloody and horrific than I have seen in most Hollywood mainstream titles.As much as I love Scorcese gangster films having marvelled over this particular one, and of course Goodfellas (forgetting the slightly disappointing and amateurish Mean Streets) I hope this does not end the partnerships of the actors and director in movies. Note how without De Niro or Scorcese, Pesci has failed to play a very serious (main charachter) role in a blockbuster Hollywood movie!!</fullReview>

The characters are perfect, you can love them or hate them as if they were real. De Niro and Pesci both do great jobs, but Sharon Stone is outstanding. I think that in Casino she has achieved her best performance ever. I'd recommend this film to everybody. Either you've seen it or not. If you 've not seen it, because you are missing a wonderful picture. And if you do have seen it, because each time you watch the film again, you can discover new things. I like it much more every time I see it. The story is perfect. One event leads to the other and there are no gaps or unexplained things once you've finished watching the movie. Dialogs are very real. The relationships between characters are very well developed. I think that if you like Scorsese's work, this one is a must-see film. At least, that's the way I see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scorcese Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorcese really knows how to make movies. Every one of his movies are just well-done classics worth watching over and over again. Casino is no exception. I'm kind of surprised that no one seems to have seen this movie. I guess it's just overshadowed by other Scorcese's films with greater hype such as Goodfellas or Taxi Driver.This movie is almost a sequel to Goodfellas. It goes much more in depth in the lives of the gangsters more than the fore-mentioned movie did. This is about how the mafia placed a guy in charge of running a casino. This guy wants no unnecessary problems, but unfortunately that happens in the way of his new wife.The acting is very good. Robert de Niro is one of the greatest actors of all time. Joe Pesci is great as the cursing, ugly slimeball. The only weak link is Sharon Stone. I'm not a big fan of hers.The voice-over narration in the movie works. That kept me hooked throughout. Also this is one of the most violent movies ever and that is also good.Overall, this is a fine depiction of the mafia. Despite it's length, I would see it over and over again. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it me or is it impossible for Scorsese to make anything but a great movie. This movie is no exception made by Martin and followed by his usual cast of gangsters Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro.This movie follows Deniros character as he tries to leave his life as a mobster, go to vegas and open a casion to try to go straight.He finds out however that old ties to oraganized crime and old relationships will come back to haunt him. His Character meets a women (Sharon Stone) they fall in love and have a kid. As the movie progresses he finds out his wife was not who he thought she was. With a wife who doesn't care for him (Stone) and a old friend(Pesci) making his new life very difficult he has to find a way to to put his old life behind him and make a good life for his daughter.This is another masterpiece by Scorsese, mind you it may not be as good as goodfellas it is still a very well made movie with a solid script and fantastic performances from all the actors involved. If you like Scorsese, Deniro or mafia movie this is a must see for you.</fullReview>

The thing I like about this movie is that it shows you how Las Vegas came to be and is no longer. This movie has an excellent cast of top-list actors including Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Robert De Niro did an outstanding job portraying the main character Sam 'Ace' Rothstein. He was based on a real person named Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal who was a sports handicapper and who also ran a casino in Las Vegas for the mob. Joe Pesci was just amazing as Nick 'Nicky' Santoro, Sam Rothsteins friend. I also liked Sharon Stones performance as Ginger, Sam Rothsteins wife. Although the film was nearly 3 hours long, I thought it was very well done, the cinematography was excellent, the acting was top notch, and it was very well paced. It is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>odds in favor of Marty fans....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Goodfellas" takes Vegas sees Scorsese's usual players meandering their way through the expected labyrinth that is Lost Wages, Nevada. The mob portion is kept very brief near the front end, with DeNiro then heading West to man a mob-run casino. There's your basic dealings with skimming, teamsters, the feds, cheats, and whatnot. Pesci is then thrown into the mix as an enforcer to keep everybody who threatens DeNiro, in line. For good measure Stone arrives as an all-flash bimbette who placates well-to-do men with her wiles.My main problem with the film lied mostly in the Scorsese going shockingly against type. First, we have one of the most passive DeNiro performances of his Marty career, as a (Jewish??) guy I kept screaming at to take some freaking action. He allows those who pose a threat to his world to just walk all over him at an alarmingly high rate. Namely, Stone, whom he inexplicably has some undying love for, despite her personality not going beyond a hot blonde of opportunity. That he could be so incessantly forgiving, made me nuts. I kept praying for the explosive Bobby D. we all know and love to show up, but he never arrived.Then you have Pesci, basically aping his own "Goodfellas" character, as a leprechaun-esque tough guy whose main fear-striking device is drop F-bombs at top volume. Or kicking the sheeyit out of guys as long as he (Pesci) has others there to watch his back. At least his character takes an unexpected turn that we're told is a huge no-no in the mob culture.People have always been vastly divided on Stone; some hated her, some were surprised and vaunted high praise. I was pretty much on the fence with her, as her two-note (sexy or drunk) offering had your standard indifference to it.James Woods is wasted (and realizing who his co-stars were, seemed to go into Pesci mode for the one scene he was allotted), Rickles and Smothers are thrown in for some Vegas flair, with your usual assembly line of reliable Scorsese Italianos rounding out the supporting roles.Then there's Scorsese himself as they guy at the helm. I've never really been a fan of forced or tortuous violence in a film (the Freddys and Jasons were always quick about it), but where was it here??? Where's the Marty Scorsese of old who covered his filmstock in off-putting gore? The fact that he (finally) shoehorns in some toward the last reel was a real let-down.The film hardly drags, and the narration was an acceptable technique, but in the end I couldn't have cared less whatever happened to any of these people. Unlike "Goodfellas," where, though the main characters were "villians," I felt so awash in their journey by film's end, that you feel you've really been taken to another place by the actors. Casino, not in the slightest.At the very least Joe Bob Briggs had more than one scene. Because the drive-in will never dah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorcese is a film legend. No matter what anyone might say about any of his films, his reputation is unimpeachable. Even his misfires have terrific scenes. "Casino" isn't a misfire - far from it - but only manages to be a good film weighed down by the ponderous style and overly didactic expressionism that is Scorcese at his worst."Goodfellas" was a Scorcese classic. This isn't "Goodfellas," but it sure feels like a mediocre extension of it. For what it is, "Casino" is enjoyable. Unfortunately, one of the hurdles that lesser Scorcese films face is that they bring to mind his better work. This is especially a problem when one of his films uses similar themes and even actors from his classics. Here, we have Joe Pesci from "Goodfellas" doing his angry mobster shtick again, and Deniro also reprising his standard wise-guy turn. Further, we have crude hoodlums increasingly turning on each other, having mundane personal problems that cross over into their "work," and exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior after starting out seemingly in complete control. Sound familiar? Well, it probably does if you've seen "Goodfellas" or many other, better Scorcese films.Robert Deniro, who at times is brilliant and at times seems to be suppressing a smirk in his "love" scenes, overall is fine as a middle-level mob boss who mistakenly begins to believe he is the top dog. So, we have the age-old theme of the inevitable mistake of taking your actual bosses for granted. Throw in Joe Pesci as his old friend who reaches the same conclusion about himself, and watch events unfold. Anyone who's seen mob films stretching at least back to "The Godfather Part II" on down the line has to see this train racing down the tracks. No real surprises, standard decline-and-fall stuff relieved by the usual Scorcese flourishes which, alas, went over much better elsewhere.Sharon Stone is the empty center of this film, despite the fact that it supposedly is about Deniro's character. As the antagonist out to smash Deniro's controlled world, she is set up as the biggest thing in Vegas. She has to be for her character to work. Unfortunately, but none of that comes across, at least it didn't to me. Not enough time was spent on her character to show why at first she was so popular (which is odd, considering how long this film goes on), so her inevitable decline doesn't strike the emotional chord it should. Reviewers like to say she deserved the Academy Award, but I don't see it. She does get numerous histrionic moments, but then leaves huge gaps in her devolution. Her character lacks continuity. Stone gives two performances, one as a reluctant bride (why?), and then one as an increasingly unhappy wife (again, why?). Admittedly, she does a good job of acting, but it all seems forced and like, well, acting. Her character didn't grab me.The single most annoying aspect of this film is a self-indulgent Scorcese trademark that reached its nadir here and in "Gangs of New York." You may find it charming, or helpful, or entertaining, but to me it is downright distracting and needless. That is a banal historical (this is "semi-fictional" in the worst way) explanation and constant narration by the Deniro and Pesci characters which continues right to the end. A little of that works, but it gets way out of hand. The characters repetitiously "explain" things that don't need to be explained. For example, the narrator will say, "And then she hit bottom and blew her money on drugs and pimps," and we see Stone stumbling down a hallway, doing her mighty best to show herself "hitting bottom." "And when they found her body...." and she immediately falls down in the hallway, right on cue. Nice acting, Sharon! The technique is patronizing. It is as if Scorcese is directing the film toward people who are complete blank slates, and know nothing about people, or history, or motivations. But, in reality, the audience is not stupid. It can be trusted to draw the appropriate conclusions, given a story rather than a monologue with accompanying moving pictures. I think Scorcese forgets himself sometimes. I think most viewers would find thinking things through themselves more enjoyable.In other words, skip the quasi-documentary stuff, and this would be a far superior film.Despite my major quibbles, I enjoyed the film because it does transport you to another time and place, Vegas in the early '70s, before, as Deniro the narrator so unnecessarily (but characteristically) explains, "It became Disneyland." The fashions (Deniro sporting a gold lam suit is a riot) alone are worth the time. Just try not to compare this film to true classics.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro delivers yet another Brilliant Performance. Joe Pesci's character Nicky is similar to Goodfellas Tommy. Once again Pesci delivers a Superb performance as the violent Nicky. Sharon Stone looks sexy as ever and surprisingly delivers a Good performance. Casino Entertains Big time thanks to De Niro and Pesci working together. If you look at Pesci in Goodfellas and Pesci in Casino, which one is mightier. Both characters are Violent and a little crazy you can say. Pesci's Casino Character is slightly rougher then Tommy. Anyway Casino is a Must see, if you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another gangster film in the same flavor as Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese show's us the ups and the downs of gangster life from Kansas City to Las Vegas and back again. The film is Casino, based in Las Vegas in the Seventies, the original Sin City, we are now presented with the dirt of the Vegas underworld that often isn't even seen in the pit rows of the casino halls. I enjoyed Robert De Niro, (Sam "Ace" Rothstein) a professional gambler selected by the mob to run the biggest casino in town. You really start to believe Ace as a real business man looking to run a straight and clean establishment. Things seem to be going his way until his childhood friend, the wacky and crazy Nicky Santoro(Joe Pesci) turns up with his own very different agenda, of how he is going to run things for himself and thus the mob bosses in Vegas Gangster movies remain to be cool and I can watch them over and over again and I look for the next one to be a little more modern day to see how things have changed over the last 10 years. Casino is a well directed, acted and edited masterpiece, which does a great job telling the story of 2 friends that in the end don't quit see things eye to eye.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro as always superb along with Joe Pesci and James Woods et al. I'm saying the film belonged to Sharon Stone. She was more than convincing as the meretricious demimonde. Her character began as a shooting star and deteriorated to a burnt out derelict. She should have won the Oscar for this awesome portrayal. Direction was meticulous with each shot and scene saying something pertinent to the plot. I did not appreciate the F word used so many times. it tends to cheapen the film. What did we do for sixty years before the F word was used?? I'm fortunate in viewing the film on TV where the filth was dubbed over. I remember seeing a film called "Glen Gary, Glen Ross" I had to leave the theatre due to the senseless filth in the language. I mean really stupid, unnecessary profanity. Later I saw the film on TV sans the filth. It was a very good film. I have nothing but praise for Casino and all connected with it. Kudos to Martin Scorcese.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as perfect as Goodfellas, but still very very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro is Ace Rothstien is trying to keep a tight, methodical operation as a mob-connected casino operator in Las Vegas of the '70's with his new love interest, Ginger (Sharon Stone, who is surprisingly not totally insufferable as she usually is, I guess she saved it up for the commentary). Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) arrives under the Mob bosses desire to see that Ace's operations are running smoothly, but the more flamboyant, high risk taking Santoro, has plans of his own. Before long the "civilized" lifestyle is offset by the more violent, devious excesses as it all begins spiraling downward. The performance of the movie are all great, the film keeps your interests throughout it's duration, and while this isn't as good as Scorsese/Pileggi's last collaboration, "Goodfellas", there's still more than enough on display here to highly recommend this one as well. Although, this is based on a true story, names changed naturally, but I feel that this is probably a watered down version of what really happened.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Martin Scorsese, Sharon Stone, Nicholas Pileggi, and Trailers for "the Big Lebowski", "Assault on Precinct 13", &amp; "Northern Exposure" Seasons 1-3.

		<shortDescription>Casino was the greatest movie of all time for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Deniro deliveries his greatest performance of all time in this movie. I became a fan of Sharon stone after this movie. Joe pesci displays his ability to act. Casino is a realistic look at what las vegas was like back in seventies and eighties. Everything from the card sharks, the money laundering, the pimping and murder. Casino takes you into the dark underworld of vegas while delivering a storyline that is based on real events. Martin scorese is the best thing since fresh air. This movies is definitely a classic and was worth the money I spent to go see it and it is worth the DVD purchase. although Casino is three hours long you wont regret the time you spent watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great gangster movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish, realistic, violent, perfectly written and directed, this movie has the power to attract and capture attention for almost 3 hours. The plot is just as good as in any other gangster movie, but excellent script and superb acting make the movie a masterpiece. Robert DeNiro and Joe Peschi do an excellent job portraying complicated characters, and creating a unique atmosphere of presence while watching the movie. The only considerable flaw is Sharon Stone, who's performance cannot keep up with the rest of the cast, but since she's just an average actress, this is a mistake of those who gave her a leading part in the movie. So to sum, up this is a great movie by one of the greatest directors of all times. 9/10.</fullReview>

It is directed well, and acted well. I read the book, and the film follows it closely, a few events changed because of time considerations and where shorting. The film had to be long for it to reasonbly follow the book. This is a interesting story, and the movie follows it accurately, and the viewer goes along the journey as he was there.

		<shortDescription>Scorsese needs to get back to this kind of film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino was the last great film made by Martin Scorsese, who is certainly one of America's finest filmmakers. Despite the three hour running time, Scorsese tells us a powerful story filled with memorable characters. Although he seems to have moved on to big-budget extravaganzas like The Avator, and Gangs of New York, it's films like Casino and Goodfellas that properly showcase his incredible talent.The plot centers around Robert DeNiro's character named Ace Rothstein who has been sent by the mafia back east to manage the Tangiers Casino in Vegas. Ace knows everything there is to know about gaming, and he makes the place rather profitable. A good chunk of change is sent back to the mafia bosses each month. Things seem to be going fine until two things happen. First, Ace falls in love with a shady woman (Sharon Stone) who hangs around the casino and extorts money from unsuspecting high rollers. She has a sleazy pimp-like character (James Woods) brooding over her who complicates things further. In addition to all that, the mafia bosses send some muscle (Joe Pesci) into town to presumably watch Ace's back. But this ends up backfiring as Pesci tears the town apart and draws every cop in the city's attention to the Tangiers. Things continually spiral downward for Ace and the gang until the typically violent climax wipes most people out. There are plenty of other details that you will have to experience for yourself.The film introduces characters we care about, and the actors portraying them are exceptional. Stone, Pesci, and DeNiro are all terrific, and James Woods once again reminds us what a scene-stealer he can be. The film is very violent, but also funny at times. It uses many of the same production techniques that made Goodfellas such a wonderful experience. You also get a nice insider's view of how Vegas operated back before it became such a commercial city. The Vegas that Scorsese shows us is for adults, not families.At three hours, the film is indeed too long. There is a little too much time spent on detailing what a bitch Sharon Stone's character is. After she started fooling around with Pesci, we got the point. Still, we are treated to too many arguments between her and DeNiro. I cannot help but think that if Casino had the two hour and twenty minute running time of Goodfellas, it wouldn't have lost a thing. You won't daydream all that much, but you will find yourself wondering when the next scene with Pesci is coming.Casino was made on roughly a $50 million dollar budget. That's chicken feed compared to some of Scorsese's recent ventures. Though it didn't make that money back in theaters, it has since become profitable through the means of home-ownership. Most of the people I know seem to have the DVD in their collections, anyway.It's time to put DiCapprio on the shelf, and start making some more like Casino, Mr. Scorsese! The Hound thinks Casino is worth 9 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the opening sequence, with De Niro dressed in a cerise jacket and shirt, getting into car that blows up, and then circling across the title credits, it was clear this movie was going to be a stinker. I don't care if Martin Scorsese directed it. Even monkeys fall out of trees. Why would a cartel of rich men hand over control of a casino to a handicapper, i.e. someone who is good at betting. You need someone who is good at organisation and leadership, a CEO. Any rich man would know that. If he didn't know that, he wouldn't be rich. So the premise, introduced in the first minute, makes no sense. Joe Pesci's yapping voice - as a narrator?! Some silly staged stabbing in a bar over a pen. The other man's hostility didn't even make sense. Just a lazy set up to show how vicious the Joe Pesci character was. And Robert De Niro falls for the annoying girl that's stealing chips from men and throwing everyone's chips around, when with the status of a casino boss, he could choose any of 1000 non-annoying, non-criminal women? Time to stop watching.</fullReview>

It has zero emotional content. The characters are intentionally one dimensional, idiotic and therefor impossible to identify with. Most of the movie feature narration, which at first feels welcome and classic, but soon grows tiring because instead of the movie just "happening", the narration disrupts the acting all throughout the 3 hours.Now I know many might consider this one a classic, but I will bet you right here and now, that non of the actors playing in "Casino" would willingly sit through this 3 hour torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely underrated and very compelling film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't consider Casino Scorsese's very best film(Goodfellas is my personal favourite), but it is a fantastic film and definitely one to see. It is shocking, disturbing and unflinching in places, particularly the part where a head gets squeezed in a vice, but that added to the atmosphere rather than distracted from it.Casino is brilliantly made too. I loved the setting, the cinematography and editing are outstanding and never take away from the atmosphere, and Martin Scorsese's direction is superb. The realism the film has is always absorbing, the subplots that form the story are intriguing and the characters are adeptly drawn.The story for me has seldom a dull moment, not with the subplots as intriguing as they are, how well made it is, how good the characters and acting are. The characters also are deliberately less endearing than are seen with Goodfellas, making it perhaps a more even portrayal of unorganised crime, but the decision to do that paid off. The acting is equally impressive. Robert DeNiro the great actor he is is incredibly charismatic, Joe Pesci gives his best performance in one of his more meatier roles and Sharon Stone(who has never been this good or even sexy before) is a revelation in a very demanding role.Overall, hugely compelling and underrated. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard Scorsese rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unsavory, trite,dull Mrs. Stone was the very wrong choice for her role; De Niro keeps telling about how she charmed everybody and was a sex goddess?rubbish, she looks like a hag! Pesci makes a good role, and Woods too. The main objection against all these mafia dramas (Coppola, Leone ?) is their premise?they tend to be character?driven, which is wrong. They pretend that the mobs portrayed are interesting as people?i.e., as drama characters. They're not. That is why Pesci and Woods are good, while De Niro flops once again?the first two have well?written roles. The directors behave as if the hoodlums they are filming are Kane or the Ambersons, and not some scumbags.It has zero human content. For a thriller, a genuine one, it is lousy and pretentious and almost flaccid. Who invented Scorsese, anyway? CASINO is meant to be satirical and sometimes funny; but Scorsese is one of the least witty persons in the whole Hollywood. The characters are such that you can not relate to; and not a single stream of sympathy is allowed. It is addressed and meant for the most dubious audience. It's MTV style is banal and vulgar. I mean Scorsese would have been supposed to narrate intelligently about brutes; but the story itself is rubbish.CASINO is a MTV?style brutal extravaganza, mindless and remarkably empty, devoid of any emotion and idea, and of overwhelming, overbearing bad taste; Scorsese boasts in cinematographic tricks that at least at the age he was when he made CASINO should have seemed less appealing to him. Pesci's performance is the only good thing in it (Woods, as I said, is very good too, yet his scenes are too few). Like other Scorsese flicks, CASINO takes pride in a sort of mean, cold, empty, academic formalism ,very conventional and dull. That's why Scorsese (even less than Coppola or Palma) says nothing to many cinema buffs.</fullReview>

I know there's suppose to be a social message in here somewhere, but its somehow lost in all the screaming and horrible beatings we have to witness along the way. The plot line of the unhealthy relationship between Sharon Stone's character and DeNiro's grows tiresome very quickly and I found myself wanting this film to be over with much much sooner. The one good thing I can say about it is that it makes me want to never visit Las Vegas again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often Extremely Underrated Due to Comparison and Excitement For Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put simply, Casino is often completely underrated and discarded because people hold it right beside Goodfellas and compare it with Goodfellas. Most people love Goodfellas, and when they then move on to see Casino, get a bit disappointed that it didn't give them the same vibe or feeling as Goodfellas.I should know, because that's how I felt the first time I saw Casino. I was fresh into a discovering Scorsese films and watched Goodfellas first, a day later, Casino. And after listening to all the hype about Goodfellas and being in that type of mood, I thought Casino fell short.A few years later I watched Casino and loved it, absolutely loved it. It's a slower moving, riveting, slightly disturbing dive into the world of excess. Complete excess. As the characters dive deeper and deeper into their stories, we realize that the film is indeed NOT like Goodfellas in the sense that the characters are not clawing their way to the top with the audience sort of cheering them on and enjoying the cowboy show. No, in Casino the characters ARE at the top, and we have the uncomfortable experience of seeing how they deal with it. There are no REAL obstacles against these people, except for their own vices. What we are left with is a very disturbing and deep tale.I encourage anyone watching this movie for the first time to CLEAR the expectations and hype setup by Goodfellas and Scorsese's reputation overall, and really give this film the time to deliver what it delivers in an amazing way.I also encourage anyone watching this film again who is so decidedly against it (or definitely thinks that it is inferior to Goodfellas) to rethink their position and watch it again with a different mindset.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ace Rothstein (Robert Deniro) is a lean, mean Jewish American gambling machine put in charge of the Tangiers casino in the Las Vegas desert. Ace knows how to run the Tangiers in the way it should be run and will use hammers and vices on cheaters who want to defraud his casino. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's hot headed body guard of sorts who will in his own words not let anyone f-word with the Golden Jew. Ginger is Ace's wife who is a drug addicted gambler as well and Ace considers her to be the Queen of the Tangiers because she can bring gamblers in. She has her world in control except for her former pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods). Even though Ginger is a wife and mother she won't let go of the hold Lester has over her! All performers are excellent in their respective roles, but director Martin Scorcese's little Italian mother Catherine steals the show from these actors! She is so funny as the mother of one of the Mafia guys who lectures her son for dropping f-bombs and rolls her eyes when she can't stop his tirade! Catherine brings much needed comic relief to the movie and I think it's great Martin Scorcese brought his mother into the movie and turned her into a star! "Casino" is recommended for the performances and Scorcese's mother!</fullReview>

But as the film progresses the bags get progressively smaller. It becomes difficult to convince them that money counters who skim off the top are just going to steal some for themselves too. Suspicion abounds and bad times are ahead. Dinero has troubles with his wife. Joe Pesci stabs someone who insults the casino boss in one scene and sets out to dispose of the body. although The script &amp; directing are not perfect.. their combination make great mix and very enjoyable movie!

		<shortDescription>good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is by almost all standards a great film. Its got a great ensemble cast,Sharon Stone gives one of the best performances iv seen by her and *obviously De Niro and Pesci are great. The film follows a rise and fall structure just like Goodfellas, which is probably why people are comparing them, and it follows the story of Ace Rothstein(De Niro) running a casino in Las Vegas which is under control by the mob. Aces operations in Nevada are put into jeopardy by the behaviour of his wife (stone) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and many elements contribute to a kind of decline for Ace.The film isn't one of Scorseses best - but that means almost nothing in the general scheme of things- as its still great and infinitely watchable. The previous reviewer said the soundtrack was kind of like a mix tape but id disagree. The soundtrack coincides perfectly with the great moments in the film and reinforces them as well. I can see his point though,there are so many great tracks in there that it kind of seems like Scorsesee just picked the great ones but then again they tend to fit whats going on on screen, such as I ain't superstitious playing over a scan of the casino, and Gimme Shelter by the stones playing to the montage of murders ( like Goodfellas) and for music fans its almost worth watching just for the music.One of the great things about films is its look, its really appealing to watch because of it and is pretty fascinating as well if your into that kind of thing. ( I dunno if I bought a dodgy version or something but i found there were bright lights around the characters which were hard not to notice- everyone else see that?)The storyline and themes are also interesting (unless your really fed up with gangster films. The direction is superb as usual and its a pretty flashy film as well,definitely more goodfellas than Raging Bull. There's lots of swish-pans and stuff and its fun to watch.The thing this film probably lacks more than anything is emotional engagement and if you are after that this isn't the perfect film for you because Scorsese doesn't really nail that emotion engagement (whether he was trying to or not i don't know) but if you just want a couple of hours entertainment then this films is strongly recommended. Iv seen the movie three times and it was great every time. If your new to Scorsese films then I would recommend buying other films before this i.e Raging Bull,Goodfellas,Taxi Driver because they are probably a bit better but what can i say ,I ain't seen a bad film by the guy (Cape fear was ace).Basically this is a great films, just don't expect Goodfellas 2 , it isn't quite that good. Most of the elements of the film are good - music,acting,cinematography and it adds up to an enjoyable film. Buy i.</fullReview>

Now Pesci is the 'animale' and DeNiro the placid, reasonable man. Pesci is scary here, another classic movie psycho.Sharon Stone is excellent in this film too. If you like Scorcese's style (pauses, tracking shots, voiceovers, Rolling Stones music) then this is well worth checking out.Having said that, it only ranks after Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Goodfellas.

However, because it shares similar style with the earlier Goodfellas, Casino tends to be dismissed as Goodfellas II, even though it is easily the more perfected one of these two. It also appears that people, who are not familiar with Las Vegas, don't seem to quite get it.Goodfellas was great, but it was still fundamentally a regular mafia story, and there are tons of those around. In contrast, Casino delivers an interesting and unique twist, because it is set in Las Vegas which is special in this context. Add the superb acting performances and ingenious direction, and we are talking about an uncovered diamond.Casino is one of those movies that will either increase in value over the years, or become lost and then rediscovered by a new generation of movie buffs who will then be puzzled why this gem was missed by the contemporaries...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Running a casino is like robbing a bank with no cops around. For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's like a morality car wash." - Sam 'Ace' Rothstein</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, many people have slanted view that 'Casino' is basically 'GoodFellas' with a different name. I can definitely see why people would feel that away, after all it's a mobster movie based on a true story, Joe Pesci plays a crazed mental midget, Robert DeNiro plays the sly and cool leading male and f-bombs are dropped almost every second. I don't criticize people that feel 'Casino' is a bit of a rip-off, but I believe it's not. My experience of viewing Martin Scorsese's brutal and bloody classic 'Casino' is that it's similar in a lot of ways to 'GoodFellas', but it's a different film. 'Casino' isn't so much about the ups and downs of organized crime, as it is about how Vegas really got started, and it just so happens it was started by a greedy, ruthless and scary syndicate -- the Italian mafia.'Casino' follows the true tale of Jewish tough-guy, Sam 'Ace' Rothestein (Robert DeNiro). In the heart of the 1970s, Ace is approached about running the Tangiers Hotel &amp; Casino casino floor, which is run by the mob. Ace is told by another Jewish mafia associate, Andy Stone (Alan King) that he doesn't won't even require a gaming commission license to run Tangiers, since the gaming commission is ten-years behind registrations. Everything seems to be set financially for Ace, as long as he allows the mob soldiers to skim a percentage of the casino's money for the bosses of the different crime families. Ace is being protected by his best friend and mob capo, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew of misfits. Nicky is cruel, lascivious, greedy and has a very short temper that when tested causes him to act outrageously violent and demoniac. Things are going great between Ace and Nicky, then Ace meets the seemingly beautiful and kind, but actually selfish and rapacious Ginger (Sharon Stone). Ace falls for Ginger and the two eventually get married, but have severe marital problems involving Ginger's old flame, the sleazy and conniving Lester Diamond (James Woods) and Ginger's drug and alcohol abuse. When everything seems so perfect and mirthful for Ace, his world falls apart very rapidly before his eyes. His wife is crazy, he's loosing money, he's having problems in general with the Tangiers casino and his once solid but now rocky relationship with the malignant goon, Nicky. The film also stars Don Rickles, Frank Vincent, Dick Smothers, John Bloom, L.Q. Jones and Kevin Pollack as the owner of the Tangiers Hotel &amp; Casino.What 'Casino' really boils down to is being a tale of avarice and it's consequences. The film starts out very optimistic and satisfying for all the characters, but quickly and abruptly turns sour for everyone. It perfectly demonstrates how money and wealth consumes you and changes you; especially in the case of having Ace and Nicky be bosom buddies in the beginning but end up loathing each other so much that they considering whacking one another. 'Casino' may drag a tiny bit in it's two hour and fifty-nine minute runtime, but when it's all over it turns out to be an excellent film. Martin Scorsese does another incredible job behind the camera, while the actors are even more solid in this one then in 1990's similar mob movie 'GoodFellas'. Robert DeNiro should have earned an Oscar nomination for his perfect portrayal of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein the Jew with Italian-mob connections who always plays his cards right. Joe Pesci is great as to be expected as the barbaric and cutthroat gangster, Nicky, but no where near as excellent as he was as the heartless waste of human life he played so impeccably in 'GoodFellas'. But the show really belongs to Sharon Stone in an impressive and remarkable performance as the crazy but ultimately pathetic junkie trophy wife of Ace. I never really thought she was a good actress until 'Casino', and in the film she really proves herself. James Woods is ideally cast as the film's undeniably unlikable parasite and Don Rickles is very upstanding in his role. The film features Frank Vincent (who you may know as the creepy mob villain, Phil Leotardo in HBO's hit drama 'The Sopranos') as Nicky Santoro's right man. The film has a lively music score and Scorsese and Nicholas Pillegi deliver a fine screenplay.If you haven't already, take three hours to sit down with a big ass bowl of popcorn and watch Scorsese's 'Casino', but only after you've seen 'GoodFellas'. You may not enjoy or appreciate it's brutal violence, crude language and overall staunch ferocity, but hey, odds are you may enjoy it if you give it a chance.

I completely agree with this, and for many reasons. And, if this truly is a sequel, I believe that Casino is the greatest sequel in the history of film-making. And I believe that Casino is better than Goodfellas, but not by much. This film is very in depth about the lives of gangsters and how casinos are managed. Parts of Casino feel like a documentary. Robert De Niro delivers one of his best performances as Ace. Sharon Stone is unbelievably believable as Ginger, who drastically changes as the film continues. Joe Pesci steels the movie yet again, playing Nicky, who acts very similar to the character that he played in Goodfellas. The lighting is beautiful and very shiny. Scorsese pulled it off once again. I heard that he claimed that after this film he would never return to violence. He did. Casino is one heck of a thrill ride. You must see this picture.</fullReview>

One, how the intense gestures are approached and two, the ways that these people swear in this movie. That's how I see it!!! The truth though, I also thought it was very touchy and very addictive. I consider it to be my new favorite movie!!! Naturally, I also consider it to be 'Crime Drama' at its finest since it is a Martin Scorsese film. It's 100% high-impact, 100% eye-popping, 100% fun to watch and on top of that, 100% pure adrenaline rush!!! I sincerely recommend that everybody go buy the 10th anniversary edition on DVD in stock now at Wal-Mart or any other video store!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic and brutal painting of the Mafia in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film a lot, it made me want to see all the rest of Scorsese's work. I had already seen Taxi Driver and Raging Bull when I saw Casino. Casino is only slightly inferior to Raging Bull, Taxi Driver being altogether the best, but Casino takes Scorsese back to his roots : the Mafia, although instead of having his native city New York as a setting, this time he chooses Las Vegas, with the casinos and (obviously) the cash. The story is roughly based on true authentic anecdotes from the 70s. It's about a master of gambling, Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert de Niro), hired by the Mafia to control a casino, the Tangiers. He meets and marries a respected prostitute, Ginger (Sharon Stone), and one of his old friends, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), comes into town. The actors are excellent, Robert de Niro is just perfect as usual, Joe Pesci plays his usual small, but completely out of control, violent gangster and Sharon Stone is as beautiful as ever, getting less and less when she starts to drink and take drugs...things start well for the couple, but "no one stays at the top forever"...A great film, with superb travelings and shoulder-held camera-work by the director. The film is violent. I saw it when I was 14 but that's just me, so if you've never seen an R-rated movie or an 18 (UK), don't start with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Casino" (1995) is director Martin Scorsese's analytical, if overly graphic, critique of mob rule and its loss of control over Las Vegas' gambling empire. It stars Robert DeNiro as Sam Rothstein, a hand-picked inside wise guy and front runner. Sam's put in charge of one of the biggest gaming palaces on the strip, The Tangiers. Initially he's assigned to clean up the penny corruption of local shady con artists. After all, the mob can't be the one's getting scammed. However, when Sam meets Ginger (Sharon Stone) the sexy and devil-may-care high rolling courtesan of the blackjack tables, he throws caution and the advice from his mob bosses to the wind in favor of a good time. This already volatile situation is further stimulated by the arrival of Nicky Santora (Joe Pesci), a thug in a fancy suit with a decided disregard for the niceties of gracious living. Nicky presents himself as Sam's indispensable appendage. But it isn't long before his uncontrollable behavior threatens to topple Sam from his roost. With the mob bosses getting very nervous over Nicky's rising body count and Sam's flamboyance in the work place, it isn't long before everything falls apart.Scorsese populates his cinematic landscape with a veritable who's who of contemporary stellar and old time talent, including Don Rickles, Kevin Pollack, James Woods, Dick Smothers and Alan King. After some smart talking and fast shooting at the crap tables, Scorsese takes us on the real tour of Vegas ? in its corrupt byways, brothels and hidden cemeteries out in the middle of an unassuming corn field.The Anniversary Edition of "Casino" has been remastered for DVD. The anamorphic picture element is free of the dirt and debris that the prior bare bones release of this formidable film had. Colors are rich, vibrant. Contrast levels are bang on. There is a bit of color bleeding during some of the underexposed scenes, but perhaps this in keeping with the film's original texture. Blacks are deep and solid. Fine details are fully realized throughout. Only a hint of edge enhancement intrudes (and then, only briefly) on an otherwise impressive transfer. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a real punch and kick to the bass and rear speakers, particularly with its emphasis on vintage background music. The brutalization of Nicky with a baseball bat is even more viscerally disturbing in this new sonic mix. You can actually hear subtle nuances in breathing as they bludgeon him to death. Extras include a bevy of making of featurettes, including interviews with many of the principle cast, some nice behind the scenes junkets, deleted scenes, and an extensive backstage look at the real life incidents that inspired the film. Bottom line is, this is the version of "Casino" fans have been waiting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stunning epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It usually takes a decade or more for people to wise up to to a Scorsese film, and notice how brilliant it really is...just witness all the sneering comments being made about Gangs and Aviator. When Casino came out, its only high profile defender was Ebert. Most of the other critics, and not just the usual suspects( such as a certain hack whose initials are M.M).thought it was just an knock off of Goodfellas. This is , to put it bluntly, absurd. This film is one of the three or four greatest organized crime epics.The texture, the rhythm, the pace, the color, and the horror of Las Vegas are captured with bold brush strokes.The costumes, the music, the editing, the cinematography..all are brilliant. I will comment on the acting... Robert De Niro portrays someone hes never portrayed before in a Scorsese film..a cool headed, calculating near genius.His Achilles heel is his pride in his intelligence. He cannot imagine that he can make a mistake, and it leads to his fall. Joe Pesci offers a better performance than in Goodfelllas, because his character has more screen time and is far more complex. Yes..he is a violent, destructive man. He also imagines himself to be extremely loyal, a good family man, etc. Note how reluctant he is to torture the guy using the vise..its just that he knows that if he doesn't, HIS head will be in the vise.Note the weird grace notes , like combing the hair of the woman he shoots. Finally, Sharon Stone.This is a woman who who is pitifully weak and confused, for all her outward bravado. James Woods (a stunning portrayal) plays her like a Stradivarius.). The last shot of Ms. Stone in the movie(I will not give it away)is terrifying-and pitiful. every performance in this movie,from the biggest star turn to the smallest cameo,is dazzling..the use of Stardust at the end is brilliant. This is a fabulous film, which will-eventually be seen as a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casino Has to Rate a 10 if you like the genre -- no other way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A more realistic gangster film, more subdued than other greats, but this is also what makes it a great film. And excellent use of voice-over narration by the different characters. When you add in the fact that, in addition to being great film-making / storytelling, that this film also serves as an engaging reference to the historical and contemporary phenomenon that is Las Vegas, the ultimate metaphorical caricature of the United States, how can this film not be a 10? And the performances? How about the killer soundtrack?? As unintelligent as it may sound, the only knock I can imagine on this film from the aficionados would have to be the lack of violence when compared to say, Pulp Fiction, but I definitely think that there is ample blood and guts, but the gratuitous violence is actually (and this is rare) overshadowed by the depth of the art going on here, and this is the mark of greatness within this genre. Also, the editorial-stype commentary in the last 3 minutes was a bit heavy-handed, but nothing that would detract from a deserved 10/10 rating. Thoughts??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the greed that takes over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Martin Scorsese does it again, he shoots Casino with so much flare and style that explodes off the screen. You can tell how much confidants Scrosese has with shooting this, each shot and scene are shot so well it's incredible.Casino is a beautiful compassionate story about a smart Bookey Sam Rothstein who takes over a casino. It all starts off easy and successful, Sam is as good as it gets when it comes to gambling, but when his brother comes in it becomes more of a challenge, and then when his future wife Ginger enters glowing in slow motion all hell breaks loose. But it's all about Ginger. It's not what happens at the Casino that hurts us it's what happens in the house.Sam makes the biggest mistake of his life, he marries a woman who loves money more than life it's self, a woman who looks and thinks about money and gets ecstacy through her whole body.Ginger is like all evil woman at first, shes sweater than candy and tricks you into thinking shes a good person. Sam allows Ginger into his life, he gives her the key to everything and trusts her. But he slowly learns it was a bad mistake. Ginger slowly becomes an alcoholic and can't get rid of her ex pimp boyfriend, year by year Ginger becomes worse and worse, becoming more addicted to money and drugs she turns into hell.Sams career as well starts to go down the drain, he gets into trouble with his casino, becomes involved in bookeys and the power slowly fades away. and like all great Scorsese films self destruction fades in.The sad thing about Casino isn't Sam's career it's his relationship with Ginger. He keeps forgiving her and believing she'll change but she just gets worse and worse. It becomes obvious by the end that Ginger used this man, in a later scene she tells Nick that she needs the money they left in the bank before she leaves, it's a perfect metaphor of her characters obsession with money and not love.Slowly all the good things go down hill, Ginger dies, Sams brother dies, and the power ends.Scorsese creates Casino, one of his most passionate and well done films.10 Star</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie almost has it all. Acting is at its finest, the direction is excellent, the story is interesting and it has a good plot, however, this movie is not for everyone to see. The amount of violence is very high (a bit too much) and there's a lot of swearing in this.As always, Robert De Niro is at his best, making sure he knows every little single detail of what's going on in his casino. He doesn't play the typical Italian here. If he sees someone cheating at a table, he lets them go with a warning instead of killing them.Joe Pesci, on the other hand is very similar to the character he played in 'Goodfellas'. His job is to make sure that nobody messes with Ace. He ends up going too far. After sleeping with Ace's wife, not taking orders from the bosses back home and doing things his own way, it's obvious he has to suffer the consequences.Sharon Stone is at her best here as the gold digger and drunk wife.Overall, 'Casino' is a well acted movie, but as I said it's not for everyone to see. It contains a lot of "F" words.Rating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is an excellent and very accurate portrayal of events that shape a part of the recent history of Las Vegas. For those of us who have been in Las Vegas for the last 30 years or more, we well remember Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal (portrayed in the film as Sam "Ace" Rothstein), the diminutive but brutally violent Anthony "The Ant" Spilotro (Nicky Santoro), casino front man Alan Glick (Philip Green), and the early days of the Stardust Hotel (The Tangiers). We also recall Spilotro's crew, "The Hole in the Wall Gang" who, as depicted in the film, were notorious for jewelry store heists wherein their method of entry was, yes, drilling holes in the walls. Rosenthal ran more than one casino at the height of his authority, including the Fremont, Hacienda, and Marina Hotels.Of course, the time lines in the film have been doctored a bit for the sake of story-telling. For instance, the man (named Bill McCarthy) who's head Spilotro (Santoro) put in a vise and tightened to the point of popping an eye out of it's socket actually occurred back in Chicago, prior to Spilotro being sent to Vegas to protect Rosenthal and the Stardust's skim. Incidentally, Spilotro was first sent to Miami to function in the same capacity of protecting Rosenthal. In the film, Santoro's reputation was primarily built through the torture and murder of the fella in the vise. In reality, Spilotro's reputation was well in place, at least among the wise guys, by the time he arrived in Las Vegas. As for Rosenthal, we remember his awful television show after his first tangle with the GCB although, to this day, Lefty emphatically denies ever juggling on the show as Deniro did in the movie! Though, another truth in the film, once the increasingly power-hungry and reckless Spilotro became involved with Rosenthal's wife, Geri (Ginger in the movie), things were already going downhill. In 1986, the bodies of Anthony and Michael Spilotro were found buried in an Indiana cornfield. They had been bludgeoned to near-death prior to being buried. The amount of dirt in their lungs indicated they had been buried alive. Geri Rosenthal was, indeed, found dead in a California motel from a "hot load", a drug overdose. Alan Glick still resides in California (if memory serves) in a well fortified residence, likely still wary of retribution for his role, ignorance aside, in the downfall of the enterprise.Nicholas Pileggi got a lot of it right, as did Martin Scorsese. Casino is a great film. It was an extremely interesting time in Las Vegas in the 70's and 80's, one that I am not likely to ever forget.

		<fullReview>Casino (1995) **** (out of 4) Martin Scorsese's epic look at Mafia crime in Las Vegas has Robert DeNiro playing 'Ace' Rothstein, a man placed in the sin city to run things but his love for a former prostitute (Sharon Stone) and the Mafia henchman (Joe Pesci) brought out to keep things running smoothly might have the entire operation fall apart.Technically speaking this here is without question one of the greatest looking movies that you're ever going to see. How Scorsese told the story of the Mafia's involvement in Las Vegas makes for one of the most visually striking movies that you're ever going to see. I say that because the editing, the music selections and the cinematography really comes to life like very few films and it makes it possible for the director to tell this rather violent story unlike anything else he's ever done.I will say that I don't think this is his greatest movie as I think there are several others that are better but that just speaks to how wonderful Scorsese was that he could make so many terrific movies. As I said, the visual style here is rather amazing and there's a lot of narration used, which had to be done because so much is covered here that without the narration you'd be looking at a six or seven hour movie. The narration is something that at one time bothered me but today it's just an added greatness because of how it basically reads you a story and keeps you up to date on everything that was going on.The performances are another major plus as the director gets some of his strongest performers here. The laid back DeNiro that we get to see here is something the actor really nails. I loved the way DeNiro's rage is all the more powerful when it happens because he just slowly builds this anger towards the wife. Pesci is as powerful as ever. Some of complained that this is basically the same role he played in GOODFELLAS but who cares? Stone also delivers the strongest performance of her career as the deadbeat junkie who by the end of the film you will hate with a passion. We also get great support from Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollack and Alan King.Clocking in just a couple minutes short of three hours, the film manages to pack quite a punch. As story-telling goes the director does a marvelous job at taking a look at Vegas from countless view points. He perfectly covers the main characters but we also get to see it from crooked politicians, the "guys back home" and of course even the FBI. CASINO has all sorts of great scenes and it's just amazing watching how Scorsese puts everything together and turns it into something magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wise Guys?, except not as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Casino' feels somewhat like 'Wise guys' all over again, but grander and longer, and with extensive drama and bloodshed. Still, this one is also very much worth the while. I most prefer the parts where the actors (De Niro, Stone and Pesci in particular) interact in the more elaborate, dialogue-driven scenes. There's quite a few 'quick updates' (with voice-over) here and there to keep the story going, but I felt that, even though they may be necessary to understand the whole plot, there is just too much of that getting in the way of the story - or at least in the way of the dramatic build-up. I suppose it's not an easy story to tell. The idea of giving Pesci's character a voice-over as well, worked out pretty good, though, and quite a few shots were simply cinematic magic.A fine film once again by Martin Scorses, all in all. A big 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese has done it again. As he did with his "Goodfellas" movie six years earlier. As he reunites with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. As both are really great playing off one another. Like in the movie mentioned and also "Raging Bull!"Robert and Joe play corrupt casino sharks. Bent on ruling the Vegas strip. But a lot comes into play. Robert falls in love with violate call girl played by Sharon Stone in a Oscar nominated performance. And Joe's character goes into drugs and violence. That really has caused a strain between the two men. Plus get's Joe's character banned from the casinos over it.Beware of 300 sayings of the F word here. If you can't stand language. Still though, it is typical mob movie. How the mob get taken down and the FBI coming down on them over it. Scorsese you cant do wrong at all. As he really directs his actors into some of their great performances!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it doesn't get any better than Casino. The cast, acting, directing, cinematography, music, and story are top notch and it makes for a memorable watch. In my opinion this is Scorsese's best film and could watch it over and over again. It is a great mobster film that follows Ace Rothstein (Deniro) and has many trials and tribulations that comes with trying to run Tangiers Casino for the mob. Don't miss this movie and it is one you should see before you die. Put it on your list of must see movies.If you are interested in more details...Again, it is my favorite film of all time so I am a bit biased. That said, Scorsese entrenches you in Las Vegas and Ace Rothstein's reign of the Tangiers casino. Nicholas Pileggi doesn't put out anything but quality material and him and Scorsese together are like peanut butter and jelly. You can't say enough about Scorsese directing and vision in this film. I can't think of a movie that was better put together and has such a great and natural flow to it.On to the acting and casting, which is nothing short of superb. Robert Deniro is Ace Rothstein and does a fantastic job. It isn't his best work, but you couldn't have found a better actor to play the part. Joe Pesci is outstanding as Nicky Santoro and plays one of the most memorable characters in my recent memory. Sharon Stone is great as Ginger and it is arguably her best work to date. You take all that into account with the supporting cast and you have something special.The movie is lengthy, but everything about it doesn't make it seem so long. I am telling you it will go much faster than the two and half hours that it runs and be impressive the entire way. The directing and cinematography are something to marvel and I don't think it gets any better than this film. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a outstanding gangster film. This ranks as my favorite film of all time and you won't be disappointed.Email me at filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as good as it gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I've never reviewed this classic, but that's probably because it is a classic and therefore hard to do it justice in writing. Scorsese gives us an intimate look at 1970s' Las Vegas, when the mob ruled, and courtesy of Pillegi's novel. The plot centers on two childhood pals (DeNiro and Pesci), both "connected" and shipped out to Vegas. DeNiro's charismatic character Ace Rothstein runs a casino and hotel, while Pesci's strong-arm thug Nicky Santoro delights in causing old-fashioned mayhem. The difference in their approaches to Sin City will eventually cause them to be at odds with one another. Sharon Stone plays a grifter and prostitute whom DeNiro's character marries, to his eternal dismay, as she cannot shake her old ways. An almost unrecognizable James Woods plays her loser boyfriend. Everyone is at the height of their careers here. The dialogue is sharp, the editing first-rate, the vistas of a now-vanished version of Vegas truly astounding. There are moments when the dialogue is clearly being improvised, which gives the film a more natural feel -- even though I normally associate improvised dialogue with inexpensive indies, not a major Hollywood production. Along with Scorsese's "Goodfellas" and Mann's "Heat," a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's most compelling drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totally compelling to watch. Robert De Niro at 43 years of age packs his best performance since Goodfellas! I've always admired De Niro as an actor. His narrating, acting, and undeniable talent as an actor is there for all to see. It may not quite be the movie Goodfellas was. But, I'd put it 2nd best in the whole MOB Movie franchise. A strong, ambitious story about a multi-million dollar Casino deep in the lively city of Las Vegas set back in the year 1983. Mr Sam "Ace" Rothstein (De Niro)is given the opportunity of a lifetime to take on the job of running the huge Tangiers Casino, the biggest casino in Las Vegas. He marries the beautiful sexy wildcard "Ginger" McKenna played by the gorgeous Sharon Stone who looks elegantly dazzling. Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) is Ace's bodyguard or "Muscle" if you like. His job is to make sure nobody messes around with the golden jewel. Later on Sam's relationship with Ginger totally disintegrates leaving Sam and their daughter Amy in an out of control situation with the circumstances resulting in the crazed Sharon Stone going on a rampage of madness until she finally gets arrested by an FBI agent and taken to jail. Nicky Santoro also has every FBI agent in the city watching him with great suspicion thinking he (which he was) behind multiple murder plots. The problem was that they always had to let Nicky go because there were never, ever any witnesses or evidence that he murdered these people. Very late on into the Movie near the end, Nicky and his brother (His closest friend) named Dominic are mercilessly &amp; tenaciously beaten down in acres of cornfield around the desert of Las Vegas and buried alive in holes &amp; filled with sand. The scene is excruciating to watch as the beating is realistic and extremely graphic to watch. Nicky's friend Frankie was responsible as he had basically just had enough of Nicky's evil behaviour and finally puts an end to his dominance. Frankie and his murder plot chums use wooden baseball bats and metal crowbars and whack Nick &amp; his brother with them very hard. Seconds after Mr Rothstein faces a NDE as a bomb is planted under his car. Ace survives with minor burns thanks to a device under his seat that saved his life. He is seen on a stretcher being wheeled into an ambulance with the emergency docs saying "You sure are lucky, mister." Everyone should take precaution that this movie isn't for the faint of heart and contains incredibly graphic and realistic torture scenes that should not be watched by people who can't watch bloody scenes. Also there is around 600+ swear words including 430 uses of the infamous F-word including 3 racial slurs which should also be avoided if you dislike profanity. The Acting is absolutely outstanding and spot on though with a great cast, story, and director. Movie Tag: "No one stays at the top forever"</fullReview>

Or maybe this is the problem, maybe there is too much going on, so the average viewer is simply too stupid to understand it all.

		<fullReview>The simply titled "Casino", one of many Scorsese/ De Niro collaborations, tells the fact-based story of Las Vegas, 1970. Many themes are present, most notably the power of money and greed. The usual suspects are here, and both De Niro and Joe Pesci fit their roles very well; De Niro the suave, level-headed thinker, and Pesci the volatile buttonman.Five minutes in, and an appropriate title popped into my head: Goodfellas Part II. All the signature aspects of that bar-setting film are present in Casino: smart-talking, wiseguy narrators, constant music in the background, constant action and furious dialogue, swearing (you won't BELIEVE some of Pesci's rants), and dripping mafia style. One thing that isn't the same though is setting: Las Vegas.The stakes here are higher, so lots about the movie has been scaled up as well. The plot is rich, with many angles. Goodfellas had a more contained story with less to explain, or it was just explained better. The first 20 minutes of Casino tell you all kinds of Vegas info very quickly. I hope you know your gambling. I don't want to say it's a fault, because it's very necessary, but it seems almost rushed. But it's not like it would affect the runtime, the film is almost 3 full hours. I'm a fan of that though, this is a bog movie with lots to tell. And because of great pacing and exciting moments, it's a 3 hour treat.The content has been elevated too. Violent and vulgar, this is not a film for kids. But it's all important. Pesci's character Nicky does most of the swearing, probably 300 or so f words from him alone, because he's always in a foul mood, which makes him unpredictable. Then there's the violence. Starting with a scene involving a pen, this is super-duper violent, showing just what people do to get what they want, or because they're crazy Nicky.If you told someone this was a Scorsese/Tarantino collaboration, they'd probably believe you. Scenes with the vice, hammer and bat are right out of the Tarantino killbook, or out of Dead Rising. They keep you on edge and are brutal.Casino takes everything about Goodfellas, minus Ray Liotta, and puts it in Vegas. Except for a confusing start that can't really be dealt with, the only reason Casino didn't enjoy the success of Goodfellas is its bland name and being released 5 years later. See Goodfellas, then see this. 8.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A near flawless film. Many probably don't agree, but I do place this one, 1 notch above Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, Goodfellas is a great film in it's own right, but for me Casino takes the cake. For a 3 hour film it passes quickly and is wholly entertaining. One of my favorite aspects is the performances. I am not a huge Sharon Stone fan, but Martin manages to get a full out dramatic performance out of her, definitely her best role in her entire film career to date. I can watch this film once a year and never get bored and I always watch from beginning to end. I believe this is his most underrated mob movies, which is unfortunate, because it is definitely my favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prospects of enjoying "Casino" : 80 out of 100 ....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an exhilarating immersion in the titular business, the first act is probably the greatest from any Scorsese's film. Marty plunges us into Sam "Ace" Rothstein's universe through a hypnotic flamboyance, working like a reminiscence of another Gangster classic, "Scarface"; and Robert De Niro is as charismatic and respectable as ever. I wanted to be this "Ace", this manager whose infallible competence in gambling, betting and defining odds made it sound like an exact science. The opening is about a competence, and boy, how refreshing it was to see in a Marty's film, a man who loves his profession, and who's not a gangster. This part is the reason why I like and respect "Casino" as a cinematic achievement. And Marty's direction deserved an Oscar nod, if only for this moment where Ace tries to find out how some customers cheat.This part absorbs me so much I always wish it would never end. But you can't expect from a Scorsese film to avoid the cherished theme of guilt, and no guilt without a mistake. So, we wait for it to come, remembering the very first lines wondering how this could have gone wrong? "Ace" was the Tangiers' undisputed boss, protected by the mob 'back home', who controlled the casino through the notoriously corrupted (at least in mafia films) teamsters' union. Plus, "Ace" had a feared bodyguard, the psychopathic Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci in a performance that would have been more impacting if it hadn't been preceded by Tommy De Vito. In fact, the whole movie has a deja-vu feeling due to its plot's similarity with "Goodfellas" but this wasn't a problem for me.The problem was the hypocrisy of the whole "how things could have gone wrong". You expect the movie to introduce it smoothly while in fact, as soon as it starts going wrong, the whole narrative, is structured by a series of mistakes. Nicky was at least honest and explicit about his intentions in Las Vegas. He wanted to squeeze the town until the last drop. He wanted the big thing, and no one to step him over, he didn't care about warnings, about his bosses' instructions, he was in a gangster's oasis in the middle of nowhere, and Ace trying to reason him was as laughable as his attempt to conquer Ginger's heart. Nicky's 'pen in the neck' was a premonition of him being the pain in the ass. But still, he was the guy whose friendship prevented Sam to act against him, like Charlie and Johnny Boy in "Mean Streets". One weakness, I could have handled; but another was one too much, and I'm talking of Ginger, Sharon Stone in her Oscar nominated role.In fact, even Ginger's entrance bothered me, because Marty and Bobby portrayed Sam as a meticulous man who means business and tolerates absolutely no imperfection. So, I didn't buy that he would let a woman throw the chips in the air like this, even for a 'love at first sight' moment, I thought the movie immediately lost its gripping realism, and it's one of the few weaknesses I noticed, after the dummy in the car's explosion and before Anna Scott's strangely blood-less murder. I couldn't believe the guy who told the croupier to perfectly align the chips, or the cook to keep the same quantity of blueberries in the muffins would let this happen. Well, let's concede that it was love, and Bobby played perfectly the part of a man who wants a desirable blonde so much (indeed, she was beautiful) that he didn't care about being loved. And we understand this would be his downfall. But it just started the very day of their marriage, when she was calling her ex-pimp, James Woods as a believable scumbag named Lester. Couldn't "Ace" get the point? That's "Casino"'s problem: problems come too early, we know it will be an infernal spiral until a bloody climax would purge out the bad blood, it's just a matter of time before it'll explode, before Sam beats the hell out of Ginger, before Nicky gets his comeuppance etc. Basically, "Casino" is about people wondering how they screwed up, while they had it coming from the start. It's about a situation with people being their own liabilities and the icing on the cake was the disturbing sex moment between Nicky and Ginger. I wouldn't care if "Casino" was at least a half-hour shorter, but it spans too much time on the 'problems' sequence, it gets redundant and annoying, too much shouting, arguing and of course narrating. Hell, at one point even Nicky's sidekick, Frank Vincent as the namesake Marino, started doing voice-over. The movie reached an extraordinary level of noisiness where even the soundtrack got in my nerves, the part with Ginger and Lester and the "Can't Live if Living is Without You" song was annoyance at its peak before Marty finally redeemed the film.At the end, "Casino" finally reconciles with the idea that we're watching a Gangster film, and that all this mess must come to an end now, and all the protagonists of this tragicomedy must meet their maker, in the most gruesome way if possible. And I can't go on without mentioning that particularly gruesome and disturbing scene, where Nicky witnesses the death of his brother Dominick before receiving the same batting treatment from Marino and the gang. "Billy Batts' revenge" broke both Nicky's bones and my heart, and his crying followed by a bloody face half-breathing before covered by sand, will haunt me forever."Casino" starts and ends with intensity, but in-between ? well, it's like starting a Texas Holdem game, with a pair in your hands, expecting to win with two pairs, or a three of a kind, but at the end, you just win because all the players folded. Shorter would have been better with less style and more substance.And that's that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last of an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch 'Casino' today is to be reminded of a time when Martin Scorcese made good films starring Robert de Niro instead of bad ones featuring Leonardo di Caprio. Casiso is a rollicking, rock and roll ride through the world of Las Vegas, brilliantly set against the sounds and colours of two decades. The effortless way Scorcese pulls this off (he uses a 1930s-style font for captions, and at times the strip appears as if drawn in pastels) is perhaps his last great cinematic achievement. But it's not quite a great film, too long for its length, too similar to his earlier 'Goodfellas', and, for all its horrific violence, just a little too smooth. The audience of 'Raging Bull' was allowed to feel what it was like to be Jake La Motta, at least as Scorcese imagined it. The audience of 'Casino' is merely told, the double-headed voice-over steering us through a story we are shown, but never allowed wholly inside of. Still, the abruptly unsentimental ending reminds us of the ruthless that all great directors must possess; and sadly, it's not a edge Scorcese seems to possess any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, I was so looking forward to this one. It had all of the stars: De Niro, Pesci, Sharon Stone. Heck, it even had Don Rickles and Dick Smothers in dramatic roles (!) Not to mention Alan King (remember him?).So, it was with anticipation that I got this one, and started to watch. It started out with a healthy dose of narration, reminding me of Goodfellas. But this time it was DeNiro doing most of the talking.But then he didn't stop.This is a three-hour movie, and about an hour of it, if not more (I didn't count the minutes) is Abe Rothstein (DeNiro), or sometimes Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), narrating the background. I mean, Ray Liotta did a good job in Goodfellas, but this is overboard, guys. Enough gabbing, and let's see the characters do what they do best, and let the story fold out through the scenes.So, the story is about two gangsters, Abe Rothstein and Nicky Santoro, who are small-time bookies some place "back home" - in some non-descript town anywhere between Dallas and Cleveland, where gambling is definitely a no-no. The "bosses" there send Rothstein out to Vegas to manage a casino that they bankroll. Except for the source of the funds, Rothstein is now involved in a legitimate operation. And that's where the first conflict arrives: he's not used to being a law-abiding fellow. But he gets it real quick, and in no time at all, has a babe for a wife (who had warned him that she's not the marrying type), Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).Then his buddy Nicky comes out to Vegas, and wants to help. But Nicky is the bouncer. The violent guy, and he wants to do it his way. So, he gums things up with his beatings, and threats, and stabbings. And these things are still illegal in Nevada, folks.So, the rest of the movie is how these conflicts pan out: Abe Rothstein trying to be legit (and it's not only his own demons, but there are some shenanigans going on in official Nevada as well), trying to be married to a former call girl of a wife (who just can't keep her finger out of the white stuff, and still has the hots for her former pimp), and Abe trying to get along with Nicky, who just can't keep his hands - and switchblades - to himself.Sounds like a cool gangster movie, and the potential is there, folks. In fact, I think not only the potential is there, but the scenes are there, too. The acting is fine (although DeNiro has done better jobs elsewhere), but the killer here is the editing. There were just too many scenes that could have been cut out, and the movie pared down to 2 hours or so. It just went on and on and on.So, if you want to see these guys on the screen, by all means watch this movie. But beware of the high price you pay in time invested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice movie, and I think it is quite amazing that they made it from a non-fiction novel. De Niros acting is as always very good, and he interprets Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal very well as Sam Rothstein. The movie might be quite violent, but I feel this gives the movie a very realistic approach to the novel - and sadly the reality. It seems to have very little to do with http://www.bettingexpert.com/dk/casino - but even though Casino is a movie that affect you, it 's a feeling - the same way as you got a special feeling when entering a Casino. The movie is shot at Riviera Casino, Vegas - and gives a perfect setting for "Tangiers". Great movie and the soundtrack is wonderful, house of the rising sun always gives me the chills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gargantuan epic(some critics and Scorsese fans considered it his "failed epic")about mob-run Las Vegas focusing on casino "boss" De Niro, his flashy junkie wife Sharon Stone, and volatile "muscle", Joe Pesci, how they had it all and squandered it due to their own faults and frailties. De Niro, without a legal license to run a casino, was able to run operations of a specific casino successfully with help from city commissioners, and, most importantly, major Midwest mobsters who skimmed from the "counting room" in order to allow him his opportunity to earn lots of money and live a life of luxury. Pesci was the mob's go-to-guy when they needed people whacked or kept in line, anyone who threatened to take from the mobsters what they considered theirs. Pesci is feared, but unstable and ill-tempered, and soon his presence in Las Vegas wasn't wanted, his criminal activities catching the attention of the police and FBI out to put him behind bars. Sharon Stone is alluring and attractive to De Niro, but she's involved with a lowlife pimp(played by James Woods)and unable to let him go. Stone has the looks and personality that benefits De Niro, helping him bring in the right kind of people to profit from in his casino. But her drug habits and alcoholism(not to mention, her inability to relinquish her love for Woods who is manipulating her to give him money behind De Niro's back)slowly over time ruin the marriage and this deterioration places her in the arms of Pesci! Scorsese's film is, as you'd expect, very detailed and the screenplay quite elaborate in the inner-working of the criminal enterprise ran by the mob who used wiseguys as their eyes and ears in Las Vegas. We see how De Niro and Pesci's personalities bring about their downfall, and Stone's addictions lead to a tragic conclusion. With all the money, clothes, and jewelry, Stone couldn't find happiness, agonizing in a joyless marriage to a man she never loved to start with. De Niro, as much as he was skilled at making money for his mobsters, couldn't help himself when it came to Stone and running such an efficient casino that he couldn't appease the city commissioner to allow his dumb-as-dirt brother-in-law(Joe Bob Briggs, inspired casting)a small position. Pesci's explosive, corrosive temperament, and unwillingness to play by the rules when it come to behaving in casinos, meant that he was doomed to eventually be discarded by his superiors. As was the case in GOODFELLAS, CASINO has startling scenes of brutal violence as the FBI get the pinch on a stupid mobster goon who gave up the names and subject matter of his people with the old-time gangsters setting in motion the executions of anyone who might rat them out. Watching the glamorous Stone unravel by film's end is disheartening and rather pitiable, going from elegant and stunning to washed-out and browbeaten, the drugs and booze turning her into a hobbling, malevolent, blabbering misfit. We see Pesci stab a man with a pen for cursing De Niro, shoot a woman while eating her supper, and bash poor Don Rickles across the face and skull with a telephone..it's not surprising what his character's outcome is. De Niro, though, because he's such a money-making machine, might escape a grim fate, although Scorsese opens the film with him in a car that blows up. Scorsese leans heavily on voice over narration from both De Niro and Pesci who explain the ways things were run in Las Vegas before the corporations took over. Clocking in at 3 hours, CASINO is certainly long-winded, and I'm not sure these are the kind of characters one wants to spend this amount of time with, but I found the story Scorsese brings to light compelling enough to withstand the entire journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know you are facing a work of art when you watch it again and again and is always fresh and new and attractive. Casino does that, and more.Superb acting of every actor involved, but with an special mention to Joe Pesci who basically played the exact same kind of guy of "Goodfellas". Robert the Niro, totally believable, and even Sharon Stone, someone I don't particularly like on screen does an excellent job transforming herself along the movie.One thing I absolutely love in movies is when they talk to you. This happened both in "Casino" and "Goodfellas". I felt as if I was sitting with the characters and they were talking to me. And unlike "Goodfellas", where the main character is the one doing the talking, this time a few of the characters talk, and even give you reasons to why they do what they are doing.The plot is about a mafia-controlled casino and about the life and times of Sam Rothstein, professional gamble turned into casino manager and his trigger-happy friend, or about a perfect operation spiraling out of control.You don't want to miss this movie. In fact, I recommend you to own it instead of rent it because you will want to watch it again and again.Keyphrase: "Why you have to get married is beyond me".Is a long movie but it doesn't feel long. That is what happens when you watch a movie that is a complete piece of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short, what happens when you get Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci together in a gangster film told by Martin Scorsese, and stretch it to three hours in length? Pretty much the greatest crime movie of all time. It has the look and feel of "Goodfellas", but focuses less on the mafia and more on one man's drive to get to the top and avoid the Feds (who at one point actually land in his yard when their spying helicopter runs out of gas).The casting of Sharon Stone is a bit questionable. Not to say she did a bad job, but when you see who else all auditioned, it is odd that she pulled ahead. Stone is now more or less a relic of the 1990s. I would like to have seen Traci Lords or Melanie Griffith take the role of Ginger.Scorsese pretty much never fails, and his track record with DeNiro is strong... this ranks as one of their best films together, no doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is an absolute masterpiece. It is easily one of the very best movies ever, but ya it is no Goodfellas, so i guess it stinks. If Casino was titled Goodfellas 2, then I could understand the critiques, but it is a totally different movie, err. None of them make any sense. Every reason I have read that supposedly makes this movie bad is something that doesn't even factor in to whether a movie is good or not. Too much violence - first off, Casino is not excessively violent. The things that happen are but it's obviously not so severe that it's too repulsive to bare or anything close (same goes for Goodfellas). That's nonsense, just like all the other excuses. I am still waiting for one reason to why Casino is not a 4-star, all-time classic movie. I can understand how some can watch it and perceive that it's boring, but you have to listen...there's so much going on. So much depth to the characters. And Scorsese is a genius with editing and directing a film. Casino is an unstoppable movie. It's easily cemented into my top 10. It is one of the most underrated movies with a 3 out of 4 star rating; that is an insult to this masterful film. What are you guys seeing? Nothing is wrong with it. Every scene is powerful. Way to go Scorcese. You give us another cinema classic, and get no love. This movie should be top 20 in the Top250 list, a perfect 10 outta 10.Brilliant depth in the acting and writing, great pace, great soundtrack, great storytelling, a superb attention to detail, natural dialogue, and top-notch directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really annoys me that this great film can never get it's own identity in the popular mind. Too many simplistic comparisons to "Goodfellas", probably made by boneheads who think imitating Joe Pesci's, "How am I funny?" line is amusing, when the only person who should ever say that again is Mr. Pesci himself. "Casino" is a very different film in it's gut than it's country cousin from the East coast. And it's also based on another awesome book by Nicholas Pileggi.Martin Scorsese lights another bunch of movie dynamite with this shotgun blast to the face of a flick. My minor issue is with who's playing Sam "Ace" Rothstein (based on Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal). Don't get me wrong, I think Robert De Niro is fabulous in the part. But if I were casting this, I would have selected Gary Sinise for the role. Anyway, De Niro is at the top of his game again, this odds making genius a drastic departure from his Jimmy in "Goodfellas", who was a homicidal thief and nowhere near as brilliant as this figure who mastered the art of staying out of trouble, until his wife and best friend ruin it all.Nicky, the thug Pesci plays here (based on Tony "the Ant" Spilotro), is different from Tommy, which earned him an Oscar (and Mr. P gave a short and sweet, "It's my privilege, thank you!" speech, letting us see not all prize winning performers have to spend an eternity on stage, thanking the whole world!). Tommy was ashamed his brother testified against certain people you don't rat on if you want to live in Brooklyn much longer. That inspired the spark plug of "Goodfellas" to be the craziest, most vicious killer of the whole bunch. His role in "Casino" is slightly more subtle and for much different reasons. Tommy never would sleep with his friend's wife, like the Vegas bound troublemaker from Chicago that he plays here does.A very insidious kind of betrayal takes place with Ace's future wife, Ginger, Sharon Stone's relentless hustler. This woman lets us see the hollow shell her character really is. After taking all she can from anybody she can, this creature runs off to her scumbag pimp Lester, played by the great James Woods, giving him her money and love, not realizing or being lucid enough to care he's the ultimate parasite. Sam can brush off Lester easily. His protector from the windy city who comes to the desert and screws up what should have been their paradise is another matter.Pesci shows this wise guy Nicky is his own worst enemy and everything he touches turns to hell. Tommy would have kept a modicum of common sense and loyalty to his buddy, not wanting all that money, power and success to blow away like so much dust in the Nevada wind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1990, Martin Scorsese unleashed Nicholas Pileggi's hard boiled docu book to the cinema. After viewing it for the first time, I knew than and I am still confident today in 2009, Goodfellas is one of the finest motion pictures that will ever be made, let alone the best gangster movie of them all.Having read the Pileggi book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised how well the writer and director translated the source material. Casino is probably the best Vegas movie you'll see. I'd call Fear and Loathing a close second. Leaving Las Vegas, to me, was well acted, but boring and overly "arty."So yeah Casino is a slick piece of craft. Slick cinematography, slick design, slick acting. But the heart and soul we'd find in Goodfellas is clearly missing from this take. The mechanisms of greed, the procedures of skimming are fascinatingly and warmly documented here, but the people are just not very interesting. There is a good 45 minutes of human drama about humans we don't give a shi*t about.But the good in Casino is so good, we forget about the thin characterizations. We forget its too long, we forget, at least a little, Sharon Stone is the only miscast part. Sure its got a few spots, but this one is still pretty bright to watch, even nearly 15 years on. You have to hand it to Scorsese. Even his crappy movies are damned good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese's phenomenal 'Casino' follows the same type of storytelling as his 'Goodfellas'. The director has the reputation of having his unique style and paying attention to every detail of film-making. 'Casino' sort of follows a documentary style voiced over by De Niro's Sam and Pesci's Nicky. Based on true events, the film mainly focuses on bookie Rothstein, his marriage with the gorgeous crackwhore/con-artist Ginger and his friendship with unstable nutjob Nicky.The movie follows a smooth pace with excellent cinematography, effective visuals, slick editing and a fantastic soundtrack where the songs contribute to the storytelling. The film is longer than the usual two hour length general viewers are used to but I was hooked to the screen from start to finish. There was something so captivating about the glamorous, seductive and deadly world that Scorsese creates on screen.Scorsese's regulars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are in top form. Sharon Stone perhaps delivers her career best in one of the most complex roles in a Scorese film. The supporting cast is solid.'Casino' is no doubt one of Martin Scorsese's best and my favourite Scorsese film. I don't remember how many times I have watched it but recently I revisited it after about 10 years and it still seems to have the same effect on me as it did during first viewing.</fullReview>

Robert De Niro, once again proves that he is a masterful actor, right up their with Marlon Brando. Anyway the film Casino, is a dark thriller where De Niro plays a casino owner. It shows the rise and fall of his character, the up's and downs of his relationship with Sharon Stone and the downfall with his best friend played unforgettably by Joe Pesci. Acting- sheer class, moving and majestic.Directing- Can't be bettered by anyone doing a mobster film Story- charismatic and undeniably thrilling.There's nothing else to say apart from, that this is another classic by Scorsese and one that should stand the tide of other gangster films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After movies - Casino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Martin Scorsese's film, casting with his longtime partner Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, like another "Goodfellas". This time the story is about Casino, but mobster is still an indispensable part of it.The film began with a car bomb and then flashed back to how Sam carved out his way in the casino business, how he desperately kept the balance between business and his mobster background. At the same time, this film emphasized his unsuccessful relationship with his wife, Ginger. Which is quite unusual in a Scorsese film because most of his films female characters are just ornaments. But this time, Ginger (played by Sharon Stone) is indisputably the leading actress in Casino.Violence is another important ingredient of this film, torture, beating, bombing and killing, all to bring forth the cruelty of the living world. If you're a typical Scorsese's fan, you will love it.The accurate and realistic depiction of Casino business is also remarkable. The colorful world filled with gambling, cheating and hustling. But all gamblers are losers, the only winner is the casino itself. Business is business, making profit is the ultimate goal. When Sam had made great fortune by running the casino, he wanted to be a normal businessman and didn't want to be involved into mobsters anymore. But it was difficult to quit because he had already made the countless ties with them. When it concerns with benefits, it's not a thing one man can decide anymore.Talking abut the actors, I have to admit that Sharon Stone is wonderful in this film, her only Oscar-nominated role by far. But there is something I must complain about, that is the role of Ginger, which is so stupidly written, she was just a mindless Blondie who only wanted to marry a rich man to enjoy a luxury life. We don't blame her for that, nevertheless how could she be so in love with James Wood's role is beyond redemption and totally unconvincing! Maybe the answer is either me or Martin Scorsese does not understand women at all. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci's acting are some kind of continuing of their roles in "Goodfellas", good but far from excellent.This film is not Scorsese's best work and Sharon Stone shines in her bitter and badly-written role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern cinema classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is another modern classic from Martin Scorsese. Drawing parallels with his earlier "Goodfellas", "Casino" again teams Scorsese up with writer Nicholas Pileggi. The result is a truly engaging tale of mobsters setting up a new gambling empire in Las Vegas and the subsequent ripple effects that involve the local authorities and the police.With an incredible cast, superbly realistic visuals and dynamic direction, "Casino" is an unforgettable experience. Violent, gritty and uncompromising, it is a hard-hitting story but extremely entertaining nonetheless. De Nero and Pesci are simply amazing in their respective roles and the energy between these two actors is unique.A joy from beginning to end, "Casino" is an example of a perfect movie. There's nothing you'd want to change about this film. It's full of memorable scenes that are rich with outstanding performances and dialogue and it simply demands a repeat viewing.10 out of 10. Marvellous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a violent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino has to definitely be in my top ten favorite movies. But why does everyone say it's so violent. I'll ask someone "What did you think of Casino?" and they'll say it was violent. They never say whether it was good or bad, they'll just say it was violent. Other then the scene involving the baseball bats, the movie is not all that bad. I thought movie's like Scarface and Goodfellas were a lot worse then this. It is really unjust to watch this movie, which had great acting, a good story and an awesome soundtrack and say it was just violent. If you thought this movie was violent, then you should not watch any of Scorsese's movies. This movie should be in the top 100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although it shouldn't take 2 hours and 51 minutes to tell a good story, Scorsese manages to draw us in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1995, Martin Scorsese had well and truly etched his name into the film making book and Casino is really just a cherry on the icing which was already on the cake; this means it's not a bad thing but just feels unnecessary. Whilst this film took me two sittings to get through (I had to cut it off with about 40 minutes remaining the first time I sat down to watch it), I can still see why it's gained a somewhat cult status amongst the masses.What's good about 'Casino' is its energy and vibrancy. The film is very colourful and attractive and it sucks the viewer into its world with several brilliant voice-overs that are informative and dark yet often funny. This is twinned with some brilliant use of colour giving us stone wall proof that cars don't just have to be metallic dark green or blue; jackets don't have to be grey Armani's or pinstripe suits ? (they can be pale red!?) and that walls and buildings can be splashed with every colour of the rainbow and still look moderately average. Everybody has a favourite colour and so, when the viewer is drawn into the world giving the feeling you're actually there, sitting in the bars opposite the characters, walking and talking with the croupiers and gambling with the rest of them; it feels like there is something there for you ? everyone, in fact and the colours act as a focal point as you map onto various items, objects, props and costume that bear your familiar favourite shade, making things easy on the gaze. This is how Casino's early attempt at drawing you in works.Although the film stays in the exact same gear for at least thirty minutes and the voice-overs (which you think will depart once the scene is set) remain, you can ignore it in a certain sense. There is that nagging sensation, however, that the whole opening is just a watered down back-story ? explaining what happened in the first film, making 'Casino' actually feel like a sequel rather than a new, fresh film in itself.What's also odd is the fact that a lot of scenes just feel unnecessary. Pesci's character's dialogue scenes and twitchiness can only feel genuine and spookily evil for so many times and the results from his mounting relationship with a female character can be seen coming from quite a mile away. Although they feel out of place, the scenes are still entertaining enough ? especially for the viewer who wants to see Pesci pile on his evil, bad-guy, 'wise-guy' caricature that he's been made famous for over the years. It's these things that bulk up the running time, frustratingly.What really grabbed the film by the scruff was the whole plot point that catapulted it into its final third. Without giving anything away, I'll mention one word: 'corruption' that involves (in some crazy way) absolutely everyone. And, as the final third reaches its, and the films, climax; there seem to be several twists and flips of the coin that involve characters floating here and then to there and then back again and then to where they were two stages ago?..and so on. This was very annoying and was a disappointing, messy way to finish the film. It concludes, then re-opens and then concludes again before partly opening it back up before finally allowing the equilibrium to catch up with itself.Although brave, bold and energetic; 'Casino' ultimately felt like an excuse to pool together a couple of big name Hollywood actors, actresses and a director just to make another gangster film that everybody will probably love. If you want a film like this one but better, try Wayne Kramer's 2003 film 'The Cooler'. At least that's not as ridiculously long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The scene where Nick and Frankie die still shocks me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like casino, even though I am not a great fan of any of its principal players (De Niro, Pesci or Stone). The film is good in places, drawn out in others and sometimes just takes my breath away.However, my lasting memory is the killing of Nick and Frankie by the mob, to the tune of The Animals' House of the rising sun still stuns and shocks me. Even though you see it coming, the end result is graphic, simple and well acted, even to the point where the hoods get exhausted from the beatings they administer.I sit there, watching this scene and I wonder what, apart from the baseball bats, would be going through their minds, especially Nick knowing that his brother is going to be killed and he will soon join him. I hope I never find out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One word: Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A look at how Las Vegas went from and Eden for organized crime syndicates to a family orientated attraction as it is now. All seen through the eyes of casino manager Ace Rothstein and his closest associates.Scorsese's previous mob world film "Goodfellas" was about small time gangsters, but this film is about the big fish. The top of the criminal underworld food chain. That even makes this film even more fascinating to see how Mob operations are run, where they get their dough, and just how ruthless and self-serving people can be. Martin Scorsese and Co, with this film, deliver an epic crime tale of deceit, corruption, betrayal, told with a great attention to detail of the story and characters involved.The only downside is that it might feel like a little bit of a re-run from "Goodfellas" since the key players are not only the same actors, but playing similar characters. However, overall this is a great film its own right and one of the best crime dramas ever made. 9/10Rated R: strong violence, brutality, and strong profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a good mob movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joes Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is the only one of the three that doesn't come through for me. I do find it funny though that so many of these guys end up in the same gangster movies, do they even have to read the script anymore. Even with that said I do enjoy these films a lot and I hope they keep making them. I would like to see a new mob movie come out. The Sapronos is a good guide but even still I don't know how Deniro would deal with somebody like Tony Saprano. I would like to see a Casino 2, maybe Deniro's character wants to get back into the business, and I am not talking about the sports betting side of the coin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a director makes a fantastic movie, sometimes there will be a follow up movie that has a similar idea and story. This isn't a sequel, but it is pretty much the same movie with a different location and list of characters. This can be done by the same director or a different one. In this case, Martin Scorsese made Goodfellas in 1990, creating one of the greatest movies of all time. In 1995, he came back with another movie of the same caliber as Goodfellas.Casino is the story of the rise and fall of a casino in Las Vegas called the Tangiers during the 1970's and 80's. Casino operator Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) try to make this casino the best there is while making a huge amount of money for themselves, their wives, and for the "bosses" back home. They use some interesting methods of persuasion for cheaters in the casino so they never come back, and of course there are payoffs to police, security, politicians, and anyone else who needs to be "taken care of". With so much corruption in this town, they fit right in.Sam's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is the woman of his dreams, or at least that's what he thinks. Together, the two of them go on a roller coaster ride through everything. Just when things are looking great, the whole operation falls apart. The Tangiers is running smoothly, no one is ratted out, and they are becoming kings of the Las Vegas strip. Little by little things crumble down into oblivion. Snitches, FBI agents, and all sorts of trouble rain down on this paradise in the desert. Scorsese does a nice job of illustrating the rise and fall of this casino. It is very reminiscent of Goodfellas, the story being the rise and fall of the crime family. Casino the same idea with a different story. The good thing is that there isn't a problem with that because the movie itself makes up for it. Scorsese brings back De Niro and Pesci from previous movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas to make this movie worth watching. The addition of Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Ginger, gives the movie more of a reason to watch.The only problem with this movie is that is really long, running just short of three hours. Some parts seem to drag on, but with the changing storyline, it's always something new. Scorsese does what he does best and that is tell a great story. His use of narration throughout the whole movie by De Niro and Pesci is very well done. The transition from the 70's to the 80's is noticeable in the equipment used in the casino, the clothing, the music, and the lifestyles they pursue. Whether it's watching the casino floor or taking some guys out back to "talk" with, there is a lot to watch and be entertained by. The hard work put into running a casino and all of the in's and out's are exposed. It's a hard life out there, but when a problem arises, all they have to to is dig a hole in the desert and let the pistol do the talking. Casino is a great story that is definitely worth a viewing at least once. As the saying goes, "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...". Thankfully this movie got out for us to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorcese's Post 1990s work is grossly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorcese - the film's director - is known for directing some excellent movies. MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER and RAGING BULL have been great successes and Scorcese's start into the organized crime genre commenced with a loud bang with the box office success GOODFELLAS (1990). However, I believe it is Scorcese's post-Goodfella's work that he should be commended for - excellent movies such as CAPE FEAR (1991), CASINO (1995) and GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) have gone wholly unnoticed. While receiving 10 Academy Award nominations, GANGS OF NEW YORK didn't receive one and CAPE FEAR and CASINO were blatantly disregarded by the Academy - a gross oversight and disappointment to all Scorcese fans. IMDb users have also chosen not to put CASINO on its top 250 list - another blow to this wonderful film.CASINO revolves around an ex-criminal Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro). Rothstein is the successful - albeit corrupt - owner of an illegally run casino in Las Vegas. Rothstein is running the casino successfully and without many hitches.Enter two big obstacles in the form of call girl Ginger (Sharon Stone)and psychotic friend (sort of like Tommy DeVito in GOODFELLAS) Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein marry's the irresistible Ginger and Nicky starts up a brutal mafia racket in Las Vegas, leading to the slow destruction of Rothstein and his empire.CASINO was brilliant. Supported by excellent acting and masterful direction, this film is one which must not be missed. Scorcese's Vegas is violent, sexy and, in parts, appealing and this three hour epic portrays this very well. CASINO is a not-to-be-missed gangster film that you cannot fully grasp without seeing it twice. However, I ask this of all IMDb users who love this film: GET IT UP TO THE TOP 250!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shut up, Bobby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I'm not alone in my fascination of Las Vegas casino "culture." I've only been there once, but I was completely awestruck by the delicious, glowing obscenity of it all (mind you I'm a jaded New Yorker, not some babe in the woods). "Casino" only adds to the fantasy. The irony is that while Vegas is seen as a separate universe where vice is as commonplace as streetlights, it's probably the only HONEST city in the world. Every other city is as full of vice and corruption, but Vegas is the only place that admits that these things are at the core of our lovely civilization. Scorsese has many tools at his disposal; here he uses his scalpel and Bedazzler above all else. The one thing that really bugged me (other than the usual Italian-American stereotypes, but what are you gonna do) is the OVER-use of voice-over. Voice-over is pretty annoying to begin with, but here it's just way too much. It almost sucks the life out of the movie (especially when coupled with Scorsese's snappy montage style). Visually it's quite breathtaking, and the performances are top-notch, especially from Sharon Stone, who emits a raw energy not common among today's leading ladies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow at times, but definitely worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening narration of this epic tale pretty much sums it up. Ace Rothstein (based on real life casino owner Frank "Lefty" Rosenthal) was a very gifted individual and the way the inner workings of a casino is described is fascinating to watch. However, the more the story unfolds we are banged over the head with numerous names, situations and too much narration that really isn't necessary to follow the story.There are other problems, especially regarding the Nicky Santoro character, played by Joe Pesci. There are conflicting information about him all through the movie. Was he a major figure in organized crime or was he simply a two-bit hood. It is never quite made clear but he must have had some connection since he gets in any casino before he is banned. The friendship between him and Ace is never really fully explored either. A background sequence could have saved the viewer a lot of confusion. As they are portrayed in this movie they don't even seem to be of the same species. The way Rothstein tries to cover up where he comes from is essential to the plot but that he behaves a lot more like a socialite than a gambler is too polished to be believable.The Sharon Stone character Ginger is the most fully developed person in the movie. Her character is pretty much revealed in the first two minutes she's on screen and the way she transforms during the movie is also believable. Even though her pimp, Lester (played by James Woods) doesn't have a lot of screen time, we can guess what purpose he had in her life. Therefore, it must have been hard to cast the Ginger role as her's requires a great deal of acting skill.Like so many actors Scorsese has worked with before, De Niro, Pesci and Frank Vincent does pretty much what we expect. They are all terrific but the real surprise is Alan King, who is a comedian. Even though his character is also a little sketchy, he brings the right kind of authority to his role. He is also the one character who gives the most information as to how things operate in Vegas.The bosses of Las Vegas are mostly decorative. They are never fully explored and are therefore mostly played as fat men in suits. The only boss who seems to have any say in what goes on is the character, Remo Gaggi, and even he seems to be clueless most of the time.There are a lot more to mention but the bottom line is that even though it is very clear that Scorsese has put a lot of effort into the accuracy of the action, it is a bit confusing and I think he should have left out a great deal of the narration that doesn't really explain a lot anyway. So an 'A' for the effort but only a 'B+' for the artistry which is what I think he is trying to aspire to.</fullReview>

The script is incredible, the screenplay is dazzling, the editing is perfect, and the ensemble cast is outstanding. Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone, put in great performances as the leads. And the supporting cast which includes James Woods, Kevin Pollak, Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, and LQ Jones among others, is also excellent. The soundtrack is expansive and actually takes on a life of it own. The great music is used in the right situations. Scorcese uses the perfect mix of fact and fiction to create this glitz and gangster masterpiece set in Sin City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rise and fall of Las Vegas gambling - Scorsesse style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real life story of how the Mafia - through dubious front men - won and lost casino gambling in Las Vegas.Hard to see how director Martin Scorsesse could really go wrong with a script and subject like this. Totally down his street. This is almost Goodfellers Part II and to make this more obvious they even have some of the same cast - including Robert De Niro as Sam Rothstien the mob front man taking heat from the overworld AND the underworld.If this film had have been made before Goodfellers (probably the best organised crime picture ever made) then it would have been better received. This is not as good and requires too much setting up (almost documentary style) and we don't really care quite as much. It also has a nasty underbelly.The message is that gambling is for idiots and in this world nobody trusts anybody else. This is not a point that you have to go searching for, because it is pushed down your throat through voice-over and then underlined through action. People here are cold and in it for themselves; although this may be true-to-life.I love the little scenes that are truthful. The smiling receptionist setting up the robbery of the guest. People being lured in to debt for the fun of handing out punishment. Casino cheats being dealt with on the spot. It presents a view of 1970's Las Vegas almost as if it were a middle eastern country where thieves have their hands removed. The real thrust of this film is the feeling of being at the cross-roads. Where legitimate business and organised crime meet. De Niro has to play both sides and this is not without danger; as the opening and closing scenes demonstrate. Joe Pesci represents the old school rob 'em/shoot 'em world of the mob. A thuggish money earner while de Niro is a rob'em through a fountain pen type. Uniquely, in my own viewing experience, they share voice-overs giving different spins on the same events.Despite being a thug I prefer Pesci because he is walking the only path that he knows. He is a good thief because he is brave and immoral. "It is all about the dollars." He says. De Niro (Rothstien) had choices and made bad ones.Despite being garlanded Sharon Stone does nothing with her "love interest" role apart from looking good and doing some shrieking. Like everyone else she is selfish and me-first, a Las Vegas hustler who lives as a parasite. While interesting, in that it gives the story some variety, the fact that she hooks up with the De Niro (who has his doubts - even in voice over) shows that no one is quite as smart as they like to think.Scorsesse is good at the making people human with little subplots or humour, but he loses the film in some of the violence. It goes on too long and merely drags us through the gutter with the characters. It also cuts against the grain and timing of what goes before. Casino isn't a great film because it doesn't hang together well and we don't care about the main three characters. They made a pact with the devil and they have to abide by the consequences.What remains utterly baffling is the final reel in which the old Las Vegas is blown up to be replaced by the corporation, family safe, version which is sneered at in final commentary: Almost tearful about the dying of America's last wild frontier. In Scorrese's world nothing is worse than being boring, safe and Mafia free...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casino is a great example of how great a director Martin Scorsese is. He shows us the violent underworld of Las Vegas, and does so very effectively. Casino has become one of my favorite performances because of how stunningly realistic the film is. The acting brings the characters to life, and the film moves at a quick pace, which is good for a three hour film. Unfortunately, Casino will always be underrated because of Goodfellas, which came first. However, I believe Casino is the more fascinating and thoughtful of the two.RATING: 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Goodfellas! (Seriously)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1995's Casino saw Martin Scorcese continue his masterful exploration of the American underworld, calling on the talents of Messrs De Niro and Pesci to portray the corrupt background of Las Vegas in the seventies.De Niro and Scorcese, when working together, always come up with the goods (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy), although their previous collaboration, Cape Fear, was a slight dissapointment in comparison.Casino tells the story of the rise of Sam "Ace" Rothstein (De Niro) to the top of the gaming community in Las Vegas, albeit with the help of the Mob and resident psychopath/long-time friend Nicky Santoro (Pesci), as well as concentrating on his rocky relationship with Vegas hustler Ginger (Sharon Stone). Between the heists, the stunning cinematography, seamless editing and sumptuously glamorous visuals, Casino is seriously compulsive filmmaking. De Niro and company are all on peak form, creating believable and fascinating three-dimensional characters. Scorsese's direction is smooth, confident and incisive, using a terrific array of shots and technical tricks to take us through the real deceptive nature of Vegas. The film is often hilarious due to the animated trauma of the characters (see Santoro's furious reaction to Tony Doggs spilling the beans about his boss) as they try to deal with the trials and tribulations of being first-rate gangsters.The critics were shockingly unkind to Casino, saying that it was a poor man's Goodfellas. I wonder what everyone's reaction to Casino would have been if it had come out first and not Goodfellas. The truth is is that Casino, while lacking the strong narrative of Goodfellas, is in many ways a stronger film in terms of acting, direction and in terms of being simply more entertaining. Goodfellas is very professionally made, but at its peak, Casino really does impress more, especially in its more dramatic moments. De Niro and Pesci are given more room to explore their characters, and Sharon Stone is just brilliant, proving that there is more to her than the trashy exploitation of Basic Instinct and the awful Sliver. Also this film has probably the best soundtrack of any film made in the 90's. Just check out the stylish use of the Stones' classic Can't You Hear Me Knocking as Pesci introduces his gang of "desperadoes".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Goodfellas" is just "Casino 1"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up until now, most of the criticism I've heard from people is that "Casino" is "Goodfellas 2" or that Scorsese's done the "gangsters with voice-overs and the classic rock soundtrack" thing before.To that I say, "So what?" It worked brilliantly before. But, I'll even go so far as to say that it works better now.Ways in which "Casino" is better than "Goodfellas":1) The setting is better. 2) The story is deeper and more complex. 3) The characters are much better developed. 4) DeNiro is brilliant in a bigger role. 5) Pesci is great in a much better role. (His character isn't so 1-dimensional.) 6) Sharon Stone is great in her best performance. 7) James Woods is excellent in a supporting role.In addition, the movie contains one scene which I consider to be one of the greatest ever. It was the scene late in the movie in which Pesci's and DeNiro's characters meet to air out their differences. Two great actors meet with the desert as a backdrop in the movie's key scene."Let's get one thing straight. I'm what matters out here, not you and your f**king casino, or your f**king TV show." ...The story is very well-told, even if it's a little longer than it needs to be. But, the scenes where Sharon Stone and James Woods are fighting with De Niro (the obvious places for substantial edits) are such compelling acting/drama that I wouldn't want the movie to be any shorter."Goodfellas" falls just shy of "Casino" in so many ways. Had "Goodfellas" been made later, not only would it be considered "Casino 2" but it would not even be held in as high regard as "Casino" is now.Scorsese improved upon what was a great movie-making formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Films of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1996 was a strong Oscar year ? Nixon, Dead Man Walking, Braveheart, The Usual Suspects, Sense and Sensibility, Se7en ? but Casino was bizarrely, and shamefully, snubbed that year, with Sharon Stone receiving the movie's only nomination.Told almost exclusively through narration, the film follows the fortunes of Jimmy Conway, an essentially decent man who runs a casino for the mob, and how his loyalty to psycho made-man Nicky Santoro and love of upscale hustler Ginger McKenna leads him down a path of doomed tragedy.Everything about this movie displays a host of talent playing at their peak. All the leads are magnificent; the writing sharp and funny; the direction confident and spellbinding in its aesthetic sensibility; the editing tight and witty; and the soundtrack, providing CONSTANT background atmosphere, is perfect. The whole thing looks beautiful, with a dazzling array of incredible interiors and costumes that perfectly capture the era, the story, and the characters inhabiting it.Epic in scale, as all Scorsese tends to be, the movie plays out like a Greek tragedy, with every character on a trajectory that only leads down into spectacular, violent, drug addled oblivion. Fascinating, riveting, inventive, gaudy, and funny ? a success on every level and one of the greatest films of the 90s.NOTE: The head-in-vice scene is painful. I can watch all manner of exploitation/cannibal/grindhouse fare over dinner, but I still can't watch the head-in-vice scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May I Be So Bold As To Say: This Movie Is BETTER Than "Goodfellas"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been criticized by many for being a reworking of sorts of Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi's previous true-crime classic film, "Goodfellas", and in many ways, that idea holds water: it uses many of the same actors, the same kind of sudden, spontaneous, unflinchingly brutal violence, the same SteadiCam direction, and of course the glitzy period soundtrack - not to mention the extreme use of the "f" word (422 times - and this time, not all of them are from Joe Pesci!). Yes, it has all that. But, in my opinion, "Casino" is actually BETTER than "Goodfellas" in many ways. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything (pretty much) just clicked.Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro in one of his best performances) is a very skilled hustler and gambler who takes over (at the behest of the Mafia) the Tangiers Casino in 1970's Las Vegas. Soon, he's on the top of the world, with him and his cohorts making millions of dollars in an intricate money-making scam - not to mention a beautiful, sexy wife, Ginger (Sharon Stone). But things start to fall apart when Rothstein's childhood friend-cum-mob enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and his crew, representing "the big bosses" back east, arrive to make sure everything goes smoothly. Soon, Rothstein's empire falls apart, from an increasingly leaky scheme, sloppy playing by Santoro and crew, his wife's infidelities and drug use, and pressure from the Feds, state government, and the local county commissioner (L.Q. Jones). Finally, Rothstein watches as pretty much everyone around begins to tumble, and he finds he must watch his own back as well.This movie is simply marvelous to behold. Scorsese's direction and Robert Richardson's direction are beautiful, taking Scorsese's wonderfully fluid directing style from the mean streets of New York to the glitzy neon jungle of Las Vegas. Scorsese and Pileggi do a wonderful of showing the glitz, glamor, corruption, and spectacle of old-time Las Vegas, through the utterly beautiful images, and the fantastic dialog. This movie's screenplay isn't laugh-out-loud funny like "Goodfellas", but it's just as memorable and well-put together. The violence, as in "Goodfellas", is bloody and unflinchingly graphic (particularly Pesci's interrogation of a rival mobster and the death of Pesci and his brother), while not at all glamorized.The acting is solid all around, though that's to be expected. De Niro gives a truly outstanding performance as Ace, who comes across as a normal guy who happens to have had a multi-billion dollar cash cow fall in his lap. Sharon Stone, who I don't much care for, does an excellent job portraying Ginger's wild and crazy nature early on, and doing a fabulous job of showing her downward spiral. Pesci is solid as always, and his performance here (despite the abundance of "f-cks") is actually more subdued than in "Goodfellas", though just as good. The rest of the supporting cast - Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollack, L.Q. Jones, Dick Smothers, and Frank Vincent, among many others, all turn in wonderful performances, even in the smallish roles. The only flaw is James Woods, who, as Stone's loser ex-boyfriend, is perfectly cast and does what he can, but is more or less wasted. The period soundtrack is simply gorgeous, and truly helps to enhance the atmosphere. Unlike in "Goodfellas", where the music was mostly solid but did have a few out-of-place songs, all of the music clicks.99 out of 100 movie buffs will tell you that "Goodfellas" is a classic, while "Casino" is merely a pale attempt to live up to that film by Scorsese. I can't speak for more than the minority - but I actually think that "Casino" is a more solid version of the package that "Goodfellas" delivered. Both films are classics that I'd recommend to anyone; it's just a matter of personal preference.My score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen. Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it. From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the surveillance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in. Robert De Niro is "Ace" Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.) And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind? The cast is really top notch. De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill. But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it. Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie. And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS. In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD. But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.Gary F.

		<fullReview>Is Casino a poor movie? Of course it is not. After all, the constituent elements are there and one can almost foretell a delectable piece on the dark underbelly of Vegas told through a true master's aesthetics. If the same breakneck verve that abounded in 'Goodfellas' was applied to the already radiant Las Vegas, is it not logical to think that something truly stunning should ensue?The opening title sequence is enough to make your mouth water as the significance and seriousness of the tale is immediately conveyed through the gracefully falling body of De Niro and a backdrop of Bach's fine choral piece. However, somewhere along the line the screws went undone and someone must have forgotten to carry the 2. Casino left me feeling like the proverbial s***. Though the violence cannot be deemed gratuitous, something about the film is so dark and depressing, the final product is little short of off-putting. The obvious fault is the length, but there is a myriad of other problems that force Casino to trudge along while Goodfellas flew by.All in all, definately not a waste of time, but have something cheerful lined up later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked, But Equally Impressive Scorsese Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and color as Disney World. Robert De Niro stars as a casino owner who is on the ground-level of the city's change. He is a high-class crook who's able to turn profits with the help of the mafia and crooked gaming practices (a norm for all casinos). Joe Pesci is on hand as the mob assassin with the short fuse who is De Niro's right-hand man. However, no one stays on top forever and De Niro's demise is partly due to his ex-prostitute wife (Sharon Stone, in her Oscar-nominated role). Bad decision-making, shady dealings, and questionable alliances will also be key factors in his ultimate downfall. Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi-layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes. "Casino" is a crime epic, in close contrast with "The Godfather" series of films. Scorsese accomplishes what he did with "Raging Bull" and "GoodFellas". Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with Scorsese's direction and the unrelenting screenplay. Sharon Stone does the best work of her career. She does not necessarily shine brighter than De Niro and Pesci, but she holds her own and never lets either of them steal her thunder and lightning. Another great thing about "Casino" is the supporting cast. Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs (!?) all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits, but is just as potent as his other five-star films. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas rehash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough rehash already! Although not a remake in the traditional sense, "Casino" is a virtual re-presentation of Martin Scorcese's '91 smash "Goodfellas". Now that was a great gangster film. Graphically violent, self absorbed, bitingly funny, brooding and epically proportioned, it was a knockout. Not so "Casino".This is a real exercise in excess, and one that completely backfires on Scorcese and his team. The film is terribly overlong at three hours, and many will struggle to pay attention the entire time, especially given the narrative which has leads De Niro, Pesci and others talking us through the whole show, another big miscalculation.The movie is far too violent, being often hard to stomach rather than effectively portraying the characters and their personalities and motivations. It's just one long, drawn out gangster show set in Las Vegas that is spotted with bursts of gruesome violence. In short, Scorcese and co-writer Pileggi have used exactly the same formula that they employed in adapting the latter's first book "Wise Guys" ("Goodfellas") to the screen, which made that film a sensation, and this one a mindless bore.Performances are strong, especially Sharon Stone as the hopeless drug fiend Ginger whose love of money proves her undoing. She is well deserving of the Oscar nomination that has come her way. De Niro and Joe Pesci, though impressive, are really only reprising their original "Goodfellas" turns. De Niro's Jimmy 'the Gent' Conway is very similar to his Sam Rothstein, the Jewish gambling icon who ran "The Tangiers" for the mob. And Pesci's Nicky Santoro, the ultra-violent, crazy mob guy assigned to look after Rothstein, is a dead ringer for Tommy De Vito, his violent, paranoid persona from "Goodfellas". Other support players make the most of their limited roles.Definitely under edited, tale could have been told in less than two hours, but Scorcese had to over indulge didn't he. Robert Richardson's camera work is impressive, though even he seems to be trying too hard. Perhaps that's just the whole feel of the movie. An over-rated, over the top, over inflated waste. Art and sets are incredibly lavish, while the costumes are wild but spot on. PS I bet Pileggi's book is great reading.Sunday, March 24, 1996 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inner-workings of a corrupt Las Vegas casino are exposed in Martin Scorsese's story of crime and punishment. The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: "Ace" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field.Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voice-over, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece. ~ Jeremy Beday, Rovi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty entertaining and all you know, well made, good acting, all that. But after seeing it, I'm still thinking.. It's not really that great. One thing is that it's too long. It's fun to see the empire growing, and there is a lot happening, but it is still just too damn long.I am no big fan of mafia-movies, really, but I had this mafia craze a little while back and I saw The Sopranos, and all the biggest mob-movies, but still I was a little meh about this one. The reason for the high rating is that it's Scorsese, and that it's mafia. Those two combined often equals overrating. It's not bad, that's not what I'm saying, but it's not a perfect movie. I want to be more entertained, and more sucked in by a movie like this, Casino didn't quite do it. I can't say exactly what it was, maybe it was just my expectations being too high.Maybe I'll see it again some time, and then like it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not "Goodfellas", but there are stretches when "Casino" is pretty great. That back-and-forth narration between De Niro and Pesci is a brilliant narrative trick and plays like a guided tour through this lavish empire the mob has carved out in Las Vegas (this, in spite of the town's gaudy trappings). Seductive, to say the least.It's in the second half that the narration vanishes and the movie starts to overstay its welcome. This criminal enterprising dream can't last forever, and when things start to come crashing down, they do so viciously (don't ever tell Scorsese he's timid on his violence). It's mostly when the '70s give way to the '80s and Sharon Stone's drama takes center stage that things become sour. "Boogie Nights" sprang to mind around this time, although that was a much more satisfying story.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers have described this movie as "Goodfellas Part Two". While it's difficult to disagree with that assessment, I do feel that this picture has some merit of its own. Like Goodfellas, it is loosely based on a true story which adds some value. The presentation is very similar to Goodfellas but also provides different settings and plot twists. My major criticism is that of the length. It's just too long and contains a lot of unnecessary dialogue and extended scenery. However, Sharon Stone turns in one of the most brilliant performances of her career. All in all, a really good movie. Nothing totally original. But as stated before, a bit too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen GoodFellas, chances are, you don't really need to see Casino. But it's a masterpiece, nonetheless, so why not? It stands as one of Scorsese's longest movies, only beaten by "The Wolf of Wall Street". But just like "Wolf", this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat, for a whopping 3 hours, never losing it's intensity for a second. Scorsese might be the only director in history to sustain such rapid fire, intense power on screen for that long. It's classic DeNiro and Pesci, enough said. The real unique gem of a performance in this movie belongs to Sharon Stone. She's plays a character about as despicable as the mobsters themselves, and fascinatingly enough, you'll tend to root against her. It's Scorsese's oldest tactic, which is to make you interested in awful people, and perhaps seeing the traits of them that are overlooked. Casino isn't Scorsese's best film, but it is a truly memorable, and watchable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but Great to Scorsese is Mediocre to The Everyday Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trust. The fascinating theme and moral reassurance for Martin Scorsese's attempt to hit critics and audiences as hard as he hit them with his classic, Goodfellas. Unfortunately, his arm isn't strong enough to smack the audience on that level. However, he does leave a great impression thanks to his style, control, of course the two components that make his films the best of the best: his film editor and Robert DeNiro.In Spanish, "money" is translated to "diniro". Hiring Robert DeNiro to star as the leading role in a film centered around gambling. The irony is fascinating. Thrown into a role that is more simplistic than past roles Scorsese has put DeNiro front and center for, DeNiro delivers the goods and is the MVP in Casino, when his two co-stars are given much more to raise a circus with. Speaking of, Joe Pesci. While one may question the actor's range with his role choices, no one can deny him the praise he deserves at knocking these types of characters through the wall and then some.Talk about more irony. Sharon Stone was the only cast member (or crew member for that fact) to receive an Oscar nomination for her work in Casino. She gets to cry, she gets to yell, she gets to do drugs, but hardly is she ever to scratch below the surface and bring something real out in her character. Ginger is resorted to Stone's awkwardness on the screen, struggling through scenes other actresses could've killed by throwing a hissy fit. She doesn't work in the role. Not that the role isn't rooted in clich, unoriginality, and lacks the development needed to make this trite stereotype a quality character.Much of the film is montage with narration guiding the viewer through the quick action. Scorsese films have tightly strung editing, but nothing ever like this has been produced before. The film barely gives us full length scenes until the last third, but those are drown in Stone's distracting acting efforts. It's a complete mystery to me how Casino was shot and edited; there are so many scenes to get caught up in that last 20 seconds at most some of them. Major props to the editing and Scorsese. I'm aware giving Scorsese praise in that fashion is redundant and expected with each film he directs, but here it's earned considering this is one of his weaker efforts.The film's running time is a monstrous one, and coming from a person who checks their watch incessantly in a film that's over two hours, I didn't feel the length once. It kept me interested and invested in the happenings of the story. The viewer almost rides it like a raft down a river. But, just because it's watchable doesn't always mean it's worth watching. In this case, it is worth the flaws. Flaws, in which the film erupts with as does the opening scene's car bombing. The story is fun, minutely intriguing, and entertains us with the back dealings of Vegas and then seem. But somehow the story and the characters sometimes feel like they are struggling to stay above water. Casino is very reminiscent of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, homaging the plot arc, specific scenes, themes, subject matters, and the iconic endings.When I was growing up, my mother demanded respect at all times. Even when we were giving her respect beyond any of our peer's efforts for their parents, she still never felt it was enough. She was never going to be satisfied For DeNiro's character, Trust is his version of my mother's trust. He falls in love with Stone's character, knowing her tarnished reputation and her art of conning, but still he chooses to marry her and forces her to be loyal to him. Deep down he knows that he shouldn't trust her, but he lives reality as if she was worthy of his trust. Just as the average joe wants to believe Vegas is an honest place and in gambling you risk it all, but as the saying goes The House Always Wins. Perhaps DeNiro strives for personal strivings for trust result from his view of the unlawful acts of the city. Even though he tries to maintain legitimacy in his end of business dealings, maybe real trust cannot be found in Las Vegas.RATING: 7.5/10GRADE: B+</fullReview>

The usual suspects are here and this pulsating, rhythmic, rocking Movie is nothing if not indulging. In fact, this great looking Movie goes so overboard in the third act with its Marital dysfunction, that it almost collapses like one of those Casino demolitions.With its non-stop narration and relentless Music Soundtrack things move fast and frantic and sometimes looks so disorienting and bizarre that one might feel that the mind-altered mind of Hunter Thompson is behind the Camera. In the aforementioned conclusion things become more verbally kinetic than visual and it seems like the High is about to wear off. It does.So not without some shortcomings, this can be quite a ride if you are ready for it. So place your bets and hold your breath, and enter this powerful plastic World of garish colors and even more garish Characters.

		<shortDescription>Sin is a Proud American Institution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Las Vegas is a mythical place, a yellow brick road destination that came into being on the backs and bucks of men on the fringes of society who weren't constricted by petty, hypocritical morality. Naturally, it's a town of broken losers, desperate dreamers, and cold remorseless opportunists. So the most definitive, most emblematic American city is a paradox, promising pleasure but thriving on pain. This is the grim landscape that Casino occupies and Martin Scorsese is our gracious tour guide, pointing out all the garish, notorious landmarks with near reverential diligence.DeNiro is convincing as the Jewish numbers expert Casino manager, Sam "Ace" Rothstein, beholden to the mob and loyal to his would-be tough guy boyhood buddy, Nicky Santoro, played flawlessly by Joe Pesci, who shows up in town and complicates Ace's life. Ace has complicated things for himself, too, by hooking up with ex top dollar whore, Ginger McKenna, played by a raw and riveting Sharon Stone. Ginger's alcohol and drug soaked mind leads her into the arms of the wrong guy, the worst possible guy, setting the stage for an inevitable tragic showdown. No one escapes unpunished, but then again no one entered the game innocent.It's a chilling image of a fiery hot world, burning white on the fumes of people's hope and fear, but it's a vision that's somehow sympathetic to the sad, twisted souls who choose to inhabit this godforsaken outpost. There's never an easy score, never an unearned jackpot. Every nickle and dime in Casino is hard fought, paid for with blood, sweat, and tears. It's often gruesome to witness the brutal depravity that passes for human behavior in Scorsese's films but it's never depressing. There's a sinister satisfaction to be found in all his dangerous, dark shenanigans, just like when you finally accept that you do in fact enjoy seeing other people get hurt. Or get killed.It's not as groundbreaking or as awe inspiring as Raging Bull, or as epic as Goodfellas, or as ambitious as either. It's a somewhat more nuanced, mature version of that patented Scorsese style, this time not so much rejoicing in the opportunity to depict unconscionable violence, but certainly not ashamed of it's lurid excesses. If you choose to see all this as an expression of the curious - maybe demented - American psyche, then Scorsese has done his job. I think he's done it damn well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas II This Ain't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I found it to be better than Goodfellas. Imagine my surprise upon reading reviews for this film that many critics proclaimed this to basically just be Scorsese going over old ground and being too much like Goodfellas. Why they presumed this I can see, but when looked at closer it is actually not that much alike.The cast contains a number of similar faces in each movie such as De Niro, Pesci, Vincent Etc. But on the whole I found Casino to be more gripping than Goodfellas and just as well made. A scene near the end of this movie has the consequences of the characters actions throughout the movie shown to music by the animals in the form of the house of the rising sun. In Goodfellas the same similar consequences are shown to music from Derek And The Dominos' Layla (another captivating scene).Going over old ground or not you can't deny that Casino is another winner for Scorsese, and if you think Joe Pesci was nuts in Goodfellas. you ain't seen nothing yet. From the soundtrack to the camera-work to the editing this film is almost perfect. Another reason I prefer this to Goodfellas is De Niro. He has a lot more to do in this than what he did in Goodfellas and the film benefits from him being lead again. James Woods also shines in almost a cameo role the way he struts in and out of the film several times then showing up for comedy effect later in the film. Sharon Stone got best Actress at Oscar for her performance (though good, I'm not her biggest fan) and she probably deserved it.The opening credits should also get a mention for being quite possible the best I've ever seen and any film that opens with the 'death' of Robert De Niro would have anyone hooked. In Conclusion this is a total masterpiece in my eyes and was way the best film of 95 and the fact it was beaten to best picture by Braveheart sickens me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen too many Scorsese films. I've seen The Departed, The Aviator, and 'most' of GoodFellas. I just watched Casino last night and I think I can say it is one of the best, most involving and well-directed films I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. The acting is great, De Niro and Pesci giving wonderful performances of 'Ace' and Nicky, respectively. I haven't seen Sharon Stone in any film before, but she also gave a great performance as Ace's wife Ginger.In a way, Casino is a companion piece to GoodFellas. However, it needs to be judged as a film in it's own right. GoodFellas is a great movie, one that almost anyone can enjoy. But Casino, to me, is more in depth and gives a much more detailed look into the 'big' mobs, the ones that ran Vegas.The photography is great, especially the camera movement. The voice-over narration may be more than you heard in GoodFellas, but in a way it's necessary to get into the minds of Nicky and Ace. It's like a documentary and these guys are just giving us the facts. Not using a traditional film score also helps to make it feel more 'natural', the pop music selected to give exactly the right mood to its respective seen. Particularly the 'House of the Rising Sun' played towards the end over a sort of 'epilogue'. It not only fit's the scene, but the film as a whole.I think it's hard to actually say or write what this film is about, like any great film. All you can do is watch it and find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese's epic true story about how the mafia build Vegas, is as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen! The story is just so good and you will be hard pressed to ever find a better pair of performances than the ones by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. I love this film, I loved it the first time I saw it, and I loved it the hundredth time I saw it. Casino follows a pair of gangsters who earned their reputations in Las Vegas in two very different ways. De Niro is Ace Rothstein, the man with the plan. He always made money, but since he was Jewish, he was never fully trusted. Pesci is of course, Nicky Santoro, the tough guy who says the f word seven thousand times, while doing things his own way. Everything about this movie is pure genius. It's on my top ten list and I suspect will always have its place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fueled by mob bosses, two long-time friends make it big in Las Vegas. Scorsese not only rehashes the themes he explored in "Goodfellas," but is also much too long-winded about it. After the film starts with heavily narrated expository scenes, one would expect the main story to kick in, but it continues in the same vein. This must be the most heavily narrated film in history, defying the notion that film is mainly a visual medium. Adding to the busy soundtrack is a non-stop hit parade of 1970s songs. Of course there are numerous scenes showcasing Scorsese's obsession with repulsive violence. De Niro and Pesci essentially reprise their "Goodfellas" roles. Stone is alluring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scorsese follows up GoodFellas with a sort of variation on the theme, creating a similar structure but with different characterization and mood. Both GoodFellas and Casino tell a true story of mob activity in two parts, the rise to power and the inevitable downfall, featuring interwoven voice-over narration, pop music, and, well, Joe Pesci as short fuse to a bomb gone out of anybody's control. They contain different enough elements however that comparing them too closely can misconstrue the point of both; nevertheless, the similarities are there.Casino immediately appeals with its Saul Bass opening titles, and then quickly keeps up the momentum with sharp cinematography glorying in the light and spectacle of the Las Vegas Strip. The Strip is a popular place for filmmakers to play with the light and imagery, and Scorsese is all over it with some amazingly striking and glorious compositions. On a purely visual level, this movie is more than worth the time to check out, and on that note may be better watched silently.Because, the thing is, it's also very noisy. With almost never-ending voice over, constant music, and Sharon Stones superb but still harrowing performance of an overwrought junky falling into sheer hysterics, the very few and all too short moments of silence in this movie stand out for their sheer contrast, and end up being the high notes. It's a shame, too, because technically this is DeNiro's finest performance along the "detached, cool, but cares" mode, and he plays a genuinely likable character who wants to play it as straight as possible and knows how to make everyone happy--provided they actually listen to him, which of course they don't, and provided that nothing goes wrong, which of course they do.There's so much to like individually about the film that it is hard to criticize it as a whole. Each individual scene works on its own level, most of them involving DeNiro and Stone as they work through their relationship (one of the most heartwarming moments when he proposes to her, and one of the most heartbreaking moments when he discovers their daughter tied up), the storytelling is sharp, and the visuals straight up eyecandy, but Scorsese still overdoes it in all marks, creating an overwhelming and mostly overstimulating project out of the whole. Form following function? Technically the Strip is one of the world's most famous realms of fully immersive virtual reality, along with New York Times Square, the Mall of the Emiratis in Dubai, and too many places in Tokyo to name. However, that not being a thematic point of Scorsese's movie at all, it doesn't really help the fact that he could have used a little reserve letting the individual pieces work on their own without distracting them from one another by layering them over each other.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film but not a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese's Casino follows Sam 'Ace' Rothstein played by De Niro as the man who runs a casino controlled by the mafia in Vegas.The story revolves in his everyday life in the casino , his problems with his wife Ginger played by Sharon Stone and his conflict with childhood friend Nicky Santoro played by Joe Pesci. The basic flaws of the movie that keeps it in the category of "good" but not a masterpiece are two 1. After some point it concentrates and spends so much time in Ace's personal life that after a while it gets a little boring (and Sharon Stone is annoying)2. Joe Pesci repeats himself in the role we saw him in goodfellas.Overall it's a movie that is definitely good and it's worth the 3 hours you'll have to spend to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I've seen it probably a million times. Well, the other day I caught a blooper. After checking the IMDb blooper page for this flick, I realized it wasn't on there. So I wanted to see if anyone else caught this. There's a scene early in the movie where Ginger and Ace are in their apartment. There's a brief shot through the window in the background before is goes to a close up on Ginger. If you watch that window, you can see the Stratosphere in the background. The movie is supposed to take place in 1973. However, the Stratosphere was built less than a decade ago. Way to go filming guys! So yeah, anyone else catch that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I once saw a small piece of Casino, one of the later scenes in the movie between Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone. Based on the scene, without knowing what was going on, I formed a notion that the movie was another loudmouthed violence film. I mentally, subliminally, resisted seeing it for the six or seven years since, even after taking in Goodfellas. It was seeing The Departed--twice--that convinced me to look into the picture.Everything that can be said about its direction, camera-work, style, dialogue and overall quality has probably been said. But one thing that most reviewers have overlooked, and a nuance of the movie that I believe provides much pleasure in the watching, is how it addresses change. In this light we may interpret Scorcese's shots of coins running through the casino, like blood through veins, as sly visual clues.On into the movie, Pesci and Stone share a line about how DeNiro's character has "changed." But one of the points Casino attempts to make is that no one really does change, no matter how hard they may or may not try, and no matter how hard someone tries to make them. After all of his friend's warnings and urgings, Pesci remains the hardheaded opportunist gangster; despite his old friend's growing disgust, DeNiro continues to try to make money within Vegas's politicized atmosphere; and Stone goes steadily along a destructive path to as much money and material goods as she can lay her hands on.One of the genius things about the film, if so instinctive and everyday for us viewers as to be almost subliminal, is that the story is situational. Situations change, relationships between characters may change, but the characters themselves rarely do. The ways they react to these changes around them may or may not be expected, but they are the ways real people would react. Pesci and DeNiro were always a thug and a penny-pincher, respectively, but they grew up as friends; their surroundings never created a conflict between them before they went to Vegas. Similarly, Stone always coveted the material, but her new relationship with DeNiro begins to strain her sense of independence.This is a movie that functions in layers of action and psychology: violence as a means to an end, the effects of power and greed, the straining of relationships, how we adapt to new situations, etc. All played out by a cast of very capable actors by the hand of a very able director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your site states: "The scenes outside the fictional Tangiers casino were shot in front of the then-closed Maxim casino. The Maxim was renovated and reopened as the Westin Casurina (1996)".At this time, the Maxim was still in operation and gaming continued to be so until 1999. The hotel remained opened until 2001.The Tangiers was 'created' at the Landmark Hotel-Casino, which had been closed since 1990. Martians destroyed the hotel (The Galaxy Hotel in Mars Attacks!) in 1995.The Landmark Hotel-Casino was imploded 11-7-95 and was, at the time, the second tallest building in the world to be imploded (by only a few feet). It remains an overflow parking lot for the Convention Center.As far as the movie - those were the days. Frank Rosenthal ("Ace") was a sports bettor hero as he was responsible for the sports book concept in Las Vegas casinos - Stardust being the first. One of the most brilliant handicappers of our time. When the news hit that he had been served dessert in that parking lot, we all knew he was leaving town. The end of an era for Las Vegas.One poster stated the tale was based on the Sands - it was actually the Stardust and many, many of the names were changed. Frank Rosenthal - er, "Ace" gives the film a 7 out of 10 for accuracy. Fudge one or two points to keep a few details under the covers and a discrepancy or two about Geri (the chips in the air scene really happened but he had already met her) and I would say he meant a 9. Anthony ("Nicky") was making way too much noise in those days, with his old-school beatings and his on-the-side 'Hole in the Wall' gang. It was no wonder he met the bottom of a corn field at a time when they were trying to be a little more low-profile at the 'Dust. The late '70s-early '80 days were under a lot of Gaming Commision scrutiny with Harry Reid at the helm - who also had a bomb attached to his car once - and cops like Joe Blasko, who was a leak to Anthony Spilotro.The narration? A nice ride down memory lane for those of us that were there - as was the movie. Great stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has to see this movie to truly see Scorsese at his very best. I cannot believe this was not rated higher. **Pay attention to the fabulous lighting in this film**- Especially how Sam (Ace) is lit whenever he is in the Casino. *He is shown with a very bright light directly over him, making him appear god-like. Notice how Sam is lit much differently when he is in his home with Ginger, showing he does not have full control and does not have his god-like status there as he does in the Casino. **Trivia**: ** DID YOU KNOW... that the "Tangiers" Casino hotel (as they call the casino in the film) Was based on the Sands? **DID YOU KNOW*... *...That Casino is based on a true story and a lot of the names weren't changed. **Major film Inconsistency*: in the first scene, Sam is shown flying from his car in the car-bomb explosion but later when they show how it actually happened, he gets out of the car just as it's blowing up and is never blown out of it at at all.</fullReview>

The portrayal of the main characters by Stone, Pesci and di Nero are the best I have ever seen.This film deserves to be listed among the top ten ever made.Goodfellas is another film in this genre and the above comments about Casino fit here as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EXCELLENT movie but it's a bit too long and it can't match good fellas. The story for the most part is very engrossing and it had 3 great main leads and they were all a lot of fun to watch. But this does tend to drag at times and it's a bit long in the tooth, however it's still an excellent movie, with great characters and lots of harsh violence. The direction is AWESOME and very stylish with some very cool camera work, Martin Scorsese is one of the best of all time as far as i am concerned. There is TONS of bloody violence. We get vicious bloody stabbings in the neck with a pen , bloody hammer hit to the hand Lot's harsh bloody beatings, bloody gunshot wounds, 4 graphic bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains splattering, slit throat more bloody beatings and some EXTREMELY bloody beatings with a baseball bat. The acting is almost Oscar worthy. Robert Deniro gives an EXTREMELY good performance here he had a lot of powerful scenes with Sharon Stone and he was quite marvelous. Sharon Stone is just as good she gives a dynamic performance and is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS to boot, although she actually freaked me out when she went all crazy. Joe Pesci basically plays the same character he did in Goodfellas and did another Marvelous job!. James Woods is always great here is no different but he was kinda wasted. Overall a MUST see just don't expect another Goodfellas! ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese's Vegas connection.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is like the "Good Fellas" came to Las Vegas and not all the crowd followed them. Coppola, Scorsese and Darabont-you expect brilliant dialog, narration and direction. Casino, is another masterpiece with Las Vegas connection by Scorsese. The narration has no depth as in "Good Fellas". Sharon Stone looks stunning and probably the beginning of her typecasting in movies. She plays the drug addict to the hilt. The movie is very close to the Vegas that existed in the Sixties and Seventies. Ace Rothstein's attorney portrayed by Oscar Goodman is now the current Mayor of Las Vegas. The movie is incredibly gripping with great acting that has tradionally expected from a Scorese film, but the Casting will never be like the "Good Fellas".The movie takes off where the masterpiece "Bugsy" left-off when it comes to the Las Vegas history. The scene where the brothers are done away with is gorily authentic you see only in Scorsese movies. Scorsese will be nominee for "Aviator"-it is time he gets an Oscar but it does't mean a thing if he does't since he is unofficially the best Director in North America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dir. Martin Scorsese Starring: Robert DeNiro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Don Rickles, Alan King, Kevin Pollak, L.Q. Jones, Dick Smothers, Frank Vincent, and John Bloom. This is a very good underrated Scorsese film. The graphic violence and graphic language is often criticized by many but really adds to the nature of the 1970s mafia in Las Vegas. This film is based on Frank Rosenthal, Sam Rothstein in this movie played to perfection by DeNiro. Wonderful acting all around, especially Stone as Sam's wife, Ginger. This role actually won Sharon the Golden Globe for Best Actress. This movie is often overshadowed by GoodFellas, which it is definitely not equal to, but still is a wonderful, involving movie. The movie does tend to repeat itself every so often and could've been trimmed a bit, but it is still a breath-taking movie.</fullReview>

I agree with all previous comments that 45 minutes to an hour could have been left on the cutting room floor, occassionally it felt like I was watching the same scene two or three different times.

But this did not disappoint. Robert De Niro gave, in my opinion, his best performance yet and Sharon Stone was great, although psychotic near the end. Now on to Joe Pesci. While he was great in Goodfellas, he was sometimes annoying in Casino. I'm not offended by profanity, but just about every other word out of his mouth is the F word.

		<fullReview>Gratuitous comparison first: Casino is definitely in the same league as Goodfellas, and this is definitely one worth watching. It looks and sounds brilliant.De Niro is superb in one of his last pre-'funny' roles, Pesci manages to add depth to his trademark psychotic role. The story is absorbing, and there are some compelling stretches - unfortunately these do not last. The major flaw for me is that the film is overlong for the story it tells. Sharon Stone's performance is good, but I couldn't help but feel the confrontation scenes between Ace and Ginger were too similar. I think a little cutting could have turned this very good 3 hour film into a superb 2 1/4 hour film.The violence is very heavy-handed, possibly overdone, but doesn't detract from the characters. Good acting and some sublime visuals make this one worth your time. This is a solid Scorsese flick, which means it is very good indeed.James</fullReview>

This was because the two films share many similarities and are bound to be compared, and in my opinion Goodfellas will always be superior. However Casino is a good film on its own and the more times I've seen it, the more I've appreciated it. People should not dismiss it as a Goodfellas rip-off. For fans of the gangster genre, this film will not disappoint. One thing must be said however. The violence in this film is very very shocking and disturbing, so if you are planning to watch this with a lady, make sure she has a strong stomach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was better when it was called GoodFellas. Now since Scorsese is such a great director, I figured it would be a good gangster drama, but it was really just a flashier, longer, gorier, dryer version of GoodFellas. Now GoodFellas is my #3 movie, and I guess that I would have liked this film had it had more originality. James Woods and Sharon Stone did a great job in this film, Stone was a very convincing junky, as was Woods. As for De Niro and Pecsi, they've done this sort of thing before. I guess that if my expectations weren't so high for this movie I would have enjoyed it more, because a good deal of the time I enjoy no-brainer action movies, but I was hoping for a good movie, which turned out to be a regurgitated and much less plausible version of Scorsese's classic film.  But it's not all that bad of a film, I mean the flashy images of Las Vegas and the casinos were well shot, and some of the dialogue was good, but I didn't keep me interested for 3 hours. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but no where near Scorsese's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is captivating, interesting and repetitive. Despite being a very well made film, it is quite similar to Scorsese's GoodFellas, which is so much better than this, I can not begin to compare the two. Robert De Niro is casted again as the lead in yet another Scorsese picture, but just like every other time, he out-shines the rest of the cast. Sharon Stone, however, was also quite good in by far her best role yet. Joe Pesci as "The Scorsese supporting actor" is basically repeating his role from GoodFellas, and as in GoodFellas, (SPOILER) Pesci gets "whacked" at the end. As do several other of the main characters, but Scorsese does the sequence so well that it's hard not to enjoy this part of the film. This is probably my best picture candidate for 1995, but definitely not for a Martin Scorsese Picture. Still, very enjoyable, a tad long, but in the end you'll be satisfied.****/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard several times that this movie is underrated, and it is, to some extent. This movie became a clich the very moment it came out since it was directed, written and starred by the exact same people as Goodfellas.Overall, Casino is a good movie, but maybe if it would've come out before 1995 (and 1990, for that matter), would have been more sucessful, and less criticized. Also, I definitively think this is not Scorscese's best film...Goodfellas, Raging Bull are of more quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese At His Best - And Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since GOODFELLAS, Scorsese's gone beyond Great Director status; his talent, vision and confidence, combined with his unofficial coronation among serious moviehounds as King of the Medium, have elevated him to Virtuoso. Every one of his 90s projects feature staggering camera movement, audacious violence, tour-de-force visual setpieces. The opening of this film - DeNiro spinning up and out of an exploding Caddy in glittering slo-mo, segueing into credits superimposed over state-of-the-art montage work...your opinion of the film's morality aside, it's the kind of jaw-dropping stunner that has become a Scorsese trademark. Like the Copa sequence in GOODFELLAS, it's the unbridled brio of a director who has not just Arrived, but occupies a plateau where his only remaining competition is with himself. If only he had the ability to pull back now and then and maintain some perspective...but his style of complete immersion into the story he is telling, more and more often these days, leaves him adrift without a moral compass here. And, Lord, could CASINO use one. It's not simply the violence on display, but the soul-dead callousness of every last living, creeping or crawling thing in the film that numbs me even as I'm awed by the compositional fireworks of the filmmaking. Everyone in this film is either vicious and corrupt, or weak and corrupt, and several characters are both at once. The 'love' story between DeNiro and a shrill, hollow Sharon Stone is like a sick parody of romantic love. The gangster/buddy angle is nil, as we see from frame one that De Niro and Pesci's 'friendship' is mutually suspicious and parasitic. The Vegas 'backstory' angle, which dominates the first hour, is visually riveting as you'd expect - Scorsese employs every type of shot in the lexicon of moviemaking here, taking the viewer on the ultimate insider's tour of how a casino operates - all in the service of the most cynical of themes: the fix is in, there are only predators and prey, and the prey deserve their agony - otherwise they'd be in on the feeding frenzy. This is part of the increasingly ugly side of Scorsese: his conscious sacrifice of any moral center, the better to solidify his appeal to the sociopath audience, probably embodied in the gangster types he grew up with in Little Italy. Or am I alone in noticing that the amoral-adolescent audience (of ALL ages) who fetishize unfeeling 'hardness' respond and identify so strongly with his latter-day work, almost as visual aids to help achieve a zen-like serenity in ruthlessness? I've heard audiences laugh in approving hilarity at some of the most appalling brutality in his films, dating back to RAGING BULL but really emerging with GOODFELLAS, which parallels his increasing disregard for protagonists who represent any kind of moral conflict. The Joe Pesci of RAGING BULL was a torn and vulnerable individual; the Pesci of CASINO is a conscienceless thug, period. You feel nothing when he dies, not even revulsion at the blood and viscera of the scene. He's one more fly whose time has come to have his wings pulled off. There are no more Charlies (of MEAN STREETS) in Scorsese's urban films, or even Travis Bickles, to truly disturb an audience by awakening their own dormant conflicting emotions. There are only Max Cadys, Nicky Santoros, Jimmy Conways. Heroes, even nominal ones, are quickly trivialized into hypocrites, cowards, rats and larval psychopaths. One wonders if Scorsese, for all his brilliance, could have ascended so high in the current pop-culture firmament without throwing out any belief in something better than remorseless efficiency and murder-as-commerce like so much sentimental ballast. He could have been, still can be, the Michaelangelo of cinema. Of course, Goya was a great artist too, but how long before he abandons being Goya for Joe Coleman?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could seriously have been a classic. There are so, so many things right about the movie. The performances of the three main characters--DeNiro, Stone, and Pesci, are standard excellence. The script makes the movie quite enjoyable to watch. The sleazy vision of Las Vegas(visually as well as mentally) is well made. Scorceses direction is practically flawless, and the first hour of background on the Casino is some of the best footage of the 90's. This movie would have made my top 50 of all time except for one little problem....It is a pure carbon-copy of Goodfellas. The two main characters (Pesci, DeNiro) are the same, the general plotline (Naive rookie to the playing field sees the glamour at first in the business but soon realizes that the violence and politics might end in his own demise) is the same, the director and his style of direction is the same, the movie is shaped in the same way, etc.If you're looking for a better movie, see Goodfellas. If you're looking for a more entertaining movie, see either of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An entertaining and meaningful film, it's one of Scorsese's best works and a must-see for fans of mob tales. In effect the film is two movies in one. The first hour or so is almost a documentary on the logistics of the mob skimming money from gambling and the trail of that money back East and the machinations of how a casino works; the hierarchy of surveillance, the money trail, the greasing of local palms and finally the suckers and high rollers who feed the monster. Robert Deniro, the film's lead, was excellent in the role of Ace, as was Joe Pesci who played a psycho-hyper-active mobster similar to his role Goodfellas. Sharon Stone also gave a fresh performance, completing a trifecta of excellence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Casino (1995)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is another modern classic from Martin Scorsese. Drawing parallels with his earlier "Goodfellas" , "Casino" again teams Scorsese up with writer Nicholas Pileggi having De Niro &amp; Joe Pesci in lead traditional favourite of Scorsese. The result is a truly engaging tale of mobsters setting up a new gambling empire in Las Vegas and the subsequent ripple effects that involve the local authorities and the police.A joy from beginning to end, "Casino" is an example of a perfect movie. There's nothing you'd want to change about this film. It's full of memorable scenes that are rich with outstanding performances and dialogue and it simply demands a repeat viewing.Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert De Niro plays Sam Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and Casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorsese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorsese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Scorsese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of "Satisfaction" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.Being a complete movie buff, I generally don't watch films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorsese is definitely one of them. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to any movie buff - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, "A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies" which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert De Niro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joe Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.My Rating ? 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed foils crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casino is tough to analyze with Story Charts. The casino racket plot (along with all the other subplots) all start at their highs and tumble down to failures. The only Controlling Idea I can think of is that crime will always fail because of greed. The Story Chart for Casino is not very interesting, basically everything crumbles because of the characters are up to no good.My main beef with the movie is two fold.One is specific about this movie: why make a movie about crime that fails when no one in the movie does any good at all and there is no moral center to the film? Since everyone is up to no good, the only rational way to keep our attention is to up the ante on how bad the characters become and how cool they when they are being bad.So a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters "cool" and full of "attitude" and glorifying them. Seriously why do we need a movie like this? It seems to just perpetuate all the negative stereotypes about movies glorifying violence and bad characters.My second beef is in general about Martin Scorsese. I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show-and-tells rather than true storytelling by characters, conflict and consequence. This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how "cool" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence. I think voice overs are the nemesis of absorbing movie making and Casino spends about half its time with its characters voicing over stuff that happens on screen: its like a holiday slide-show from "cool" gangsters.I think Casino tries to objectively document a period of Vegas excess driven by a few characters and their criminal ways. It's voice overs certainly make it documentary-like. But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.I don't get it, why make a movie that suggests crime doesn't pay but suggest it's cool to be a criminal? How does this make the world a better place? If it doesn't, why make movies at all?My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca</fullReview>

Can't agree with most of the reviews for this one.Love DeNiro and Scorcese and Goodfellas and Raging Bull are two of my favorites, but I found Casino hard to sit through, despite the great performances. I think Scorcese went to the DeNiro/Pesci/gangster film well once too often. I found the aging and diminutive Joe Pesci a little hard to believe as a Mafia enforcer and his "love" scene with Sharon Stone is unintentionally comical.Brutally violent, overly long, and with few laughs to break the monotony, I actually found myself looking at my watch halfway through. Non-stop narration is distracting and an odd choice for Scorcese.</fullReview>

Sharon Stone is excellent and Joe Pesci is, well, Joe Pesci. Like "Goodfellas" it is based on a true story. This time, the Chicago mob in Las Vegas. It has a number of effective scenes: Sharon's Stone's breakdown, the scene involving the two card cheats, and the brutal though richly deserved death of Joe Pesci and his brother. But the film left me cold. It could have been called "Goodfellas Go to Las Vegas". Scorsese, screen writer Nick Pileggi, and Pesci basically recreated what they did in the earlier film. Not a bad film by any means, but more like a warmed over meal that was great the first time but only good the second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 1995, The film follows the life and exploits of a professional gambler from his life on the East Coast until he is adopted by the organized crime syndicate. The syndicate uses him to open up a casino in Las Vegas. It shows the times and places of Las Vegas in the 50's. Also the film plot follows a small time hit-man (friend and protector of the professional gambler) goes to Las Vegas to set up his own 'territory' in order to take over the crime in the wise open gambling town. The film ends in a ironic twist of fate for the lead characters.*Special Stars- Robert DiNiro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, Don 'Hockey puck' Rickles, Alan 'Mr. Stand-up' King, John 'Joe Bob' Bloom. Dir: Martin Scorsese.*Theme- Crime doesn't pay even among gangsters and their pals.*Based on- Modern organized crime gangster lore.*Trivia/location/goofs- This film is loosely base on a true Las Vegas person, Frank Rosenthal. The Nevada Gaming Commission member, a US Senator, is partly based on Nevada Senator Harry Reid, who was chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission. The scene in which the Nevada Gaming Commission denies Sam Rothstein is a gaming license by is based on a December 1978 hearing when US Senator Harry Reid was the commission's chairman. This project was filmed entirely in Las Vegas (Stardust and Landmark Hotels and Casinos) and with historic period costumes, music, and props. This film is horribly editing for public TV viewing sensibilities and it should be seen in its entirety on recorded media. Several scenes are lost in the TV airing censorship and will be appreciated by film fans.*Emotion- This is an unforgettable film. It is filled with great performers that acting well in their ensemble of well-written scenes. This film has several classic movie lines and indelible images that leave the movie theater with it's satisfied audience. This is a modern classic film of its topic, genre and time period that should be experienced by any film lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long, indecipherable journey inside Las Vegas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In looking at Martin Scorsese's look at life in Las Vegas under control of the mob in the 1970s and 1980s, I became intensely curious as to what in particular Scorsese was trying to tell me. Was there any sort of outward message being presented in this sordid tale of greed, deception, backstabbing and violent behavior? And in the end, was this simply a spin off of Goodfellas? Many would disagree, claiming that Casino is an entirely different kind of Scorsese film, concerned more with the city of Vegas and its surroundings than anything else. Indeed, the first two hours fly by as Scorsese whisks us through the casino and its behind-the scenes facts. Long famous for the energy and spontaneity of his films, Scorsese's fluid camera snakes in and out of rooms, eavesdropping on the conversations of some of the highest and most powerful men in Las Vegas, some of which don't even live in Nevada. As in Goodfellas, there is innumerable amounts of information given. In fact, there are so many voice-over narrations going on one right after another, some may get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. All this, combined with fiercely intense performances from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci make this a great two hour run. Unfortunately, this is a three-hour film.The last hour of the film, for me, bears many marks of Scorsese's labor of love for these settings and subject, yet it feels to drag on and on and on. Never have I seen one hour go by so slowly that was directed by such a great filmmaker. Indeed, the main reason for such slow pacing is the fact that practically the same thing happens in every single scene. For the first two hours, Scorsese sets up nearly ever character for some sort of payoff or consequence. Now, the payoffs must come. They do, one right after the other and it is not only boring to watch but also painful. As with any Scorsese film, the bleakness and desperation of the situation is not shied away from. It is difficult to watch the relationship between De Niro and Stone crumble, in effect mirroring the mob's relationship with Las Vegas fall apart. Nevertheless, by the end, I was left feeling somewhat unsatisfied and cold with all these characters. Not a single one can truly be empathized with, and in the end all get what they deserve.I know it is unfair to Scorsese to compare this film with Goodfellas, but there are so many parallels that it is hard not to. Where Goodfellas succeeded in having one main point of view narrate everything, here there are too many to consistently keep track of as well as too many scenes of people being beaten senseless and screaming at each other in drug-induced rages. I do not ask Scorsese to be gentler or sugarcoat his stories; I only ask that he create a solidly discernible plot flow throughout the film as he did in Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence. Regrettably, despite its many positive elements, Casino is not one of the great Scorsese's best.</fullReview>

One could argue that voice over and soundtrack to bridge the gaps between set-pieces, but those set-pieces are masterful. Joe Pesci's performance - a hyperactive retread of his Goodfellas (1990) schtick - is a weak spot, but De Niro and Stone (the real revelation here) are very good indeed.

Joe Pesci once again plays the psychotic hard man with a certain flair for sadistic violence, a role he seems to act with brilliant ease; and of course Scorcese once again directs with his usual brand of genius.If you liked this film, you simply have to see Goodfellas.7/10</fullReview>

The characters, the acting, the story.........all done with flawlessness. Goodfellas is extremely good and Casino, although not as popular for some reason, is just as good if not better. This movie is vastly underrated. I think it deserves at least an 8.7 hands down. I first saw Goodfellas with a friend in 2001 and immediately fell in love with it. I asked him if he knew of any other movies of similar nature. He recommended Casino, and after watching it once, i couldn't stop watching it. All in all I probably watched Casino more than 100 times. It's really that well done. If you like Scorsese's style and you're in the mood for another one of his masterpieces, buy this one. Don't rent it. Buy it. You won't regret it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"GOODFELLAS" Part Deux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CASINO (1995) *** Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, Don Rickles, James Woods, Kevin Pollak, Frank Vincent, Alan King; as themselves: Jerry Vale, Steve Allen &amp; Jayne Meadows, Frankie Avalon. "GoodFellas II" could've been the working title of this brassy and encompassing crime drama by screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi and director Martin Scorsese examining the underbelly of Las Vegas in mob-controlled era of the 1970s with De Niro as Ace Rosenthal the man running the show in glitzy corrupt casino Tangiers who eventually falls from grace to love interest Stone (nominated for Best Actress) and boyhood chum/psycho thug Pesci. Despite great opulent set decorations and production designs (check out those rainbow colored clothing) the film ultimately collapses around itself much like its characters: wanting too much of a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was beautifully made - wonderful direction from Scorcese, amazing acting from DeNiro, Stone, Pesci et al. But...This is one of the most disgusting and revolting movies I've ever seen. I had to take a bath after seeing it. Right through this movie, I kept asking my self, "Do I REALLY want to know about these lowlifes??".I promised myself that I would never watch it again - I'm only posting now after having recently read the book of the actual events. Far, far worse than "Goodfellas" (No, I'm not talking about moviemaking here).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this one, not sure if I would like it or not. The cast, crew and reviews were all top notch; having not seen Goodfellas I basically came into this as a bit of a newbie....Here's what I think:Love the acting, esp. DeNiro and Pesci, though they've both done this same thing before, and better. The narrative, the camera work, first 45 mins of this are great, and if that could have been sustained for the entire film, this could have won the Oscar. Instead it desolves into a Vegas based Godfather knock off.Now, I don't mind some film violence; and expected it big time with these guys. But WHY the baseball bats in the cornfield? Why the Pesci Vice bit? Did we have to see the old gal get shot 3 times in the head up close like that? I think one of those scenes was enough; but having all three...overkill. There's some terrific supporting jobs here: Don Rickles, Alan King, Sharon Stone turns in one too. James Woods was fine. But when you get to the end, all you can remember is 'Batter up!' And that isn't right. Just too jarring at times.I would give this one *** outta ****, it was very good but ought to have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every boring Scorsese clich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>JFT, this movie has every boring Martin Scorsese clich. It's all about how terrible Italian gangsters are, but somehow they retain a chivalric nobility that makes them fundamentally noble.Joe Pesce delivers his one-note role, the only thing he has ever played. A cheap gangster who for some reason commands respect that you would not expect from a five-foot two-inch loser. He was much better as the clichd role in "My Cousin Vinny." In another (better, shorter) Scorsese movie, "Goodfellas," he would have been pretty good if he had been 30 years younger. But it was like watching my mother play Scarlett O'Hara.Every single scene is an argument. That gets tedious after a while. Alan King and Don Rickles are miscast in dramatic roles. This was made when Robert DiNiro was already always playing a clichd version of himself. Sharon Stone tries hard, but her role is not well written. Is she good? Is she evil? Why does she pretty much disappear from the middle third of the movie and spend the last third screaming? There are some Scorsese movies that are actually OK, but this is not one of them.</fullReview>

This film has nothing to say,nothing to show and nothing to exist for,except perhaps for those whose sad lives lead them into believing that bad is good and violence is the new religion.

		<shortDescription>Moments of greatness but overall a flawed gangster epic that is still great to watch though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casino" is by no means a bad movie but it rather is a flawed one, which is mainly due to the story and its characters. The first two-thirds of the movie is certainly great but after that the movie takes some negative turns and it loses some of its credibility and I lost some of my interested.No question in my mind that Martin Scorsese is a great director but he however does push it at times with this movie. People compare this movie to "Goodfellas" for a good reason. Just like "The King of Comedy" and "Bringing Out the Dead" were similar in many ways to "Taxi Driver", "Casino" is on many ways similar to "Goodfellas". It's a tough gangster epic with lots of graphic violence, lot's of cursing and backstabbing characters. The main storyline is especially parallel to "Goodfellas". Yes, you can truly describe this movie as "Goodfellas" set in a Las Vegas casino in the '80's. Unfortunately the casino world is not as interesting to follow as the gangster world as portrayed in "Goodfellas", at least that's my opinion of it. The movie is too often about 'nothing' really. Style over substance you may say.But also when you judge the movie on its own good you have to come to the conclusion that there are flaws in it. Sharon Stone is great in this movie but her character is distracting from the movie at times, especially towards the ending when almost the entire movie evolves around her character. It gets tiresome at times after a while and the movie loses some of its credibility because of that. There also are way too many characters introduced in the movie, which makes it hard to follow at times. I also never really got in to the character, not even the main characters. I couldn't really care for any of them and it was hard to understand and follow them at time. The movie is also too violent and graphic, even for my taste. It's a bit too much and some scene's are unbearable. Scorsese really pushed it there and should had hold back a little.There's nothing wrong with the style of the movie. It's fast paced and wonderfully looking, also mainly thanks to the director of photography Robert Richardson but also of course to Martin Scorsese's stylish and unique way of directing and storytelling. Yes, there are some memorable sequences present in this movie, which certainly helps to make this movie a better one than most of the others in the same genre.Also of course the presence of some well known good actors make this movie a good one to watch. Robert De Niro is never disappointing in the main lead and Joe Pesci yet again plays a typically hot tempered Joe Pesci role in which he always is just great to watch. The movie unfortunately under-uses James Woods. They could had done some more and better things with that wonderful actor.Great to watch for the fans of the gangster genre. Overall a good, yet flawed gangster-epic that is certainly worth watching but not worthy of the high rating.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GoodFellas in Vegas...it was better in New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a GoodFellas rehash. Casino is not a bad film. But it pales in comparison to what has come before it. It would be much easier to applaud Casino if we could take it on its own merits. But the parallels to GoodFellas are so numerous and so obvious, Casino always leaves us wanting more. We've seen this all before and we've seen it done better.Casino starts quite literally with a bang with a rather shocking car bombing before the opening titles have even rolled. It's a fascinating and highly intriguing opening but Casino never is able to sustain that energy. The film slogs along for three hours with the pace so slow that at times the movie seems to come to a dead stop. Scorsese has, even in his most brilliant successes, been criticized for the pacing (or lack thereof) in his films. Casino is a prime example of a Scorsese film that would have benefited greatly if the action could have been pushed along just a little bit faster. There's a terrific story here, top-notch acting performances and the typically brilliant Scorsese visual touches. What's missing is the energy a film like GoodFellas had. For all that Casino has going for it, in the end it's simply not entertaining enough.After the shock of the opening sequence, Casino goes back in time ten years to tell the story of Ace Rothstein, as played by Robert De Niro. We see he is running, on behalf of Midwestern mob bosses, the Tangiers casino in Las Vegas. Through use of voice-over narration (a la Goodfellas) Rothstein, and later Joe Pesci's Nicky Santoro, explain how the money moves through the casino and into the hands of the mafia kingpins. As the story begins everybody's getting paid, everything's running smoothly, everybody's happy. When mafia tough guy Santoro, played wonderfully by Pesci who could do this type of thing in his sleep, takes up residence in Vegas things start to unravel. Santoro's a hothead, out to make a quick buck for himself. Where Rothstein had been free to operate his casino in peace, when Santoro starts stirring things up he brings unwanted attention from the authorities. Rothstein's wife, Ginger, is not helping matters by being constantly drunk, stoned or drunk and stoned. Sharon Stone plays Ginger and the character is such a train wreck it's hard to really evaluate Stone's performance. She's certainly convincing as a glamorous call girl early on, perhaps less convincing when she's forced to be hysterically screaming all the time.Anyhow, Ace ends up having problems with the wife, problems with the authorities and problems with his onetime good friend Nicky. It's fascinating to see all the conflict swirl around him and De Niro is reliably brilliant in his performance as he deals with all the madness around him. Pesci is terrific and Stone is OK. Actors playing smaller roles also do noteworthy work. James Woods does well in a bit part as a man who is part of Ginger's past. Frank Vincent (GoodFellas parallel number 8,362 or thereabouts) settles into his mobster's role quite easily. And Don Rickles and Dick Smothers of all people have serious parts to play and each does a fine job. So, the acting certainly isn't the problem. The main characters, and some of the secondary ones, are wonderfully developed. Casino is beautifully photographed as you would expect from Scorsese. And the story is a good one, intriguing from beginning to end. It's in that long journey from beginning to end where Casino stumbles somewhat. It just takes too long to get where we're going and the film can't sustain the energy it opened with. A fascinating story, but in the end one that with a better pace could have been told in a much more entertaining way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this movie with the preconceived notion that i was going to be treated to goodfellas 2, and to an extent that's what casino was for me. BUT, unlike goodfellas, this movie is overlong, the editing is poor (possibly to the many cuts scorsesee was forced to make to avoid an NC-17) and it just felt bloated. a whole hour could have easily been trimmed out of the second half in my opinion. other than the many flaws, i still found this movie to be fairly good entertainment. sharon stone finally was allowed to act and not just be window dressing. deNiro, although sorely miscast, did his usual solid job but Pesci's character sometimes veered dangerously close to being a parody of his Goodfella's character. i can tell what the filmmakers intentions were, but i think they just lost their way somewhat.(the first hour which shows the inner working of casino's in the last 70's is the most fascinating part of the movie and is worth renting this just for those scenes)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a discriminating movie buff and want to see Martin Scorsese at his most inspired, most enthralling, most engrossing, and most enrapturing, forget CASINO. Watch GOODFELLAS instead.CASINO pales in comparison in every respect. And while its characters and their interpersonal relationships are poorly developed, CASINO drags on and on for 3 hours and 2 minutes.Aesthetically, stylistically, in terms of many of the cast and crew, etc., CASINO looks too much like GOODFELLAS, leaving people to think that they've experienced dj? vu. The most glaring example of this is Joe Pesci, who basically reprises--and even parodies--his role from GOODFELLAS.Furthermore, the narration in CASINO is excessive while the depictions of violence are often gratuitous and stylistically weak.So rest assured that GOODFELLAS is the masterpiece. CASINO is the travesty and discriminating viewers should stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese does deliver a vivid, pulsating look at what goes on behind the scenes in the temples of gambling out west, but fails at the human drama. Robert De Niro stars as Sam Rothstein, a Midwestern bookie with mob connections who is sent to Vegas in the '70s to run the Tangiers Casino. Sam is a hard worker and keeps his bosses in Kansas City happy with regular deliveries of cash-filled suitcases. Things start to go awry when his childhood buddy Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) comes to town. Nicky is a psychotic gangster/lowlife whose strong-arm enforcement techniques eventually do him in. Sam has also fallen for blonde bombshell Ginger (Sharon Stone), a gold-digging hustler. For some unknown reason, Ginger can't seem to give up her former pimp, the slimeball Lester Diamond (James Woods). Maybe she's just attracted to his name. The jewelry collecting Ginger would certainly find "Mrs. Diamond" more her style than "Mrs. Rothstein." We unfortunately remain passive observers of the downward spiral that consumes these characters. As the third hour dragged on, I just got more and more impatient for the whole thing to be over. I want to be leaving Las Vegas. De Niro does De Niro as usual, but the character's emotional revelations are small potatoes. Pesci does a veritable reprise of his GOODFELLAS part. Funny at first, with his "F"ing vocabulary, Nicky soon starts to grate on the nerves. Quick, bring out the baseball bats. Sharon Stone does a respectable job as Ginger, but a Golden Globe win over Susan Sarandon (not to mention the ignored Kathy Bates) is a bit tough to swallow. The non-stop soundtrack of 70's hits is distracting at times, but the costumes and set designs are just right. Frankie Avalon, Jayne Meadows, Steve Allen and Jerry Vale play themselves. Guess Wayne Newton was out of town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well - Martin Scorsese likes to make very violent movies (Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Cape Fear, etc.) but does he need to do it for any purpose. Why can't he just cut out some of the violent scenes in Casino and reduce the movie to a 2 hour show. After all - I got the picture of a very violent environment after the tenth bullet in the head. I do not need to see every killing (a lot) in the story - I do not need to see people getting tortured, burried alive and hit with baseball bats all the time. Even when characters of secondary importance to the story got wacked we saw it all.And the language is very abusive. I don't think Joe Pesci's character spoke a sentence in the whole movie without saying the f-word. Does it have to be that way.Not for me. I can tolerate violence and abusive language, but only if it is used to describe the environment or is important to the story. Martin Scorsese uses these two things in Casino only to amuse the audience.Guess what - I'm not amused.I rank this movie as 6 of 10. The reason for the high score is the - after all - exciting story and a very good performance by Robert de Niro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Expository Narration and "F" Bombs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been a very interesting drama about Las Vegas gangsters, but Martin Scorsese ruins it with the film-making technique he used in "Goodfellas": expository narration. It was annoying in "Goodfellas," but is very heavily used here. Instead of letting the action guide the plot, he has characters give background narration for every single point of action in the damned film. You're TOLD rather than SHOWN what happened. If I wanted to be told something, I'd read a book. Movies a re more interesting when character dialogue and action move the plot. Narration slows the movie down to a grinding halt.Oh, and there's "Casino's" claim to fame: the most uses of the "F" word in an English-language non-documentary film. Every other word is "F" this and "F" that. I know gangsters are tough, macho men who love to speak dirty, but this is way too much. Again, this is where action may have helped to convey the characterization of tough gangsters, rather than the "F" word every second. This film needed better dialogue. "The Godfather" has excellent dialogue, and though there are dirty words, it's balanced out by intelligent writing. "Casino" doesn't have going for it in terms of good writing, unless it's to show that the Vegas mob was run by a bunch of unintelligent morons who can't form a complete sentence without the "F" word.The acting is extreme and over-the-top. Sharon Stone is less than spectacular as a drug-addled, high-strung moll. She's either laughing or screaming, and nothing more. She chews the scenery like a starving pit bull. De Niro does little but blend into the background. Joe Pesci seems like his SNL caricature, screaming and squeezing heads into vices.Granted, I'm interested in the history of the Las Vegas mob, and this movie is based on a nonfiction book; but the writing was bad, and the narration device distracted from my enjoyment of the action. I didn't like "Goodfellas," but it was leaps and bounds superior to this dreck. I do not recommend this, except maybe for a rental. Watch the DVD extras that feature an A&amp;E documentary on the real Las Vegas mafia.</fullReview>

It is the classic rise and fall of a thug seen in Goodfellas, Scarface and The Godfather. Which could be said as the 3 greatest films ever made. The Promblem is it has WAY too much Narration and the film is too long and not exciting, it drags on and on. In the end it feels like a waste of time. If you want to watch a crime film with a Casino rent Oceans Eleven.

		<fullReview>I love Bob DeNiro and Joe Pesci. And I think in the right hands Sharon Stone can do a great job. But in this film, the best thing was seeing DeNiro in a brilliant new suit each time he appeared on screen. Here are my issues with the movie: *The background soundtrack, all popular songs, almost always drowned out the dialog. I find that after watching a lot of movies, if the director doesn't feel 1) that we're going to get the message and/or 2) that there are some concerns over whether the scene is working or not, the quick fix seems to be, "Pump up the jam!" This is a terrible mistake. It makes it difficult to understand what's being said and the audience starts to lose what might be important information. This was a consistent problem throughout the film. *As the movie went on, Joe Pesci slowly rose to the position of God. There's a scene where he yanks a phone off the wall and smashes it into Don Rickles, who works at DeNiro's casino as some kind of ancient security guard/yes-man. The point is... he works at the hotel and no one, not a single person, came to his defense. Joe, as Nicky, was allowed to slap, kick, sucker-punch anyone he goddamn wanted to without the least bit of concern as to whether there would be any repercussions. *DeNiro signs a paper (at least the film makes it look that way) giving the contents of a money-filled safety box to Sharon Stone (who plays his wife, former prostitute, Ginger). Okay, that's his business. But, late in the movie, after she's gone on her inexplicable drug/alcohol binges, has tied up her daughter (Really? So she could have a night on the town?), and had an affair with Nicky (like she would!!!), she literally breaks into DeNiro's desk, as a police escort stands nearby, gets the key to the safety deposit box (because... somehow Bob got it back from her, even though he signed over the contents to her so that she would "never have to worry" if they broke up?), then goes to the bank to get her money (it's hers, Bob signed it over to her!) and then Bob is screaming into the phone, "She can't do that. She can't legally do that" ... and yet... he signed it over to her? So, in fact, she CAN do that. *Marty would like us to believe that Joe returned home every morning, no matter what, to make breakfast for his darling little boy. You've got to be joking. While his wife did what? This man was an inconsiderate pig who thought women were mouths to put on his nether regions. Was this scene put in to show his "sensitive" side? He was a pig! So what that he made breakfast for his kid?! Did he ever think of what kind of role model he was to that child?... Yeah, I didn't think so. *When Bob and Joe would argue, despite the fact that a lot of the dialog was funny, smart, smack-in-the-face kind of dialog, people don't talk like that. In other words, there was ALMOST no reaction time in between lines. You'd HAVE to know what the other person was saying to respond that quickly! I didn't buy it, although I enjoyed the exchanges. *As others have pointed out, when Bob is screaming and yelling at people, he's kinda fun. But when he does this pathetically lame speech about what "love" is (no wonder Sharon Stone felt queasy about getting involved with him), all I could think is: This freak is a loser and he'd be better off buying "love" for the rest of his life. Sharon as Ginger tells him quite frankly that she doesn't "feel that way" about him. But Bobby won't take no as an answer... and, boy, does he pay for that. * The overuse of the F word and every variant associated with. Why, Marty? It got so irritating and tiresome that it lost whatever impact they thought it was going to have. *The voice-overs!!! Please, no! I was willing to buy one (Bob's), but then Joe chimes in, too, and then later, Frank Vincent, one of the many henchmen, chimes in, too! As others have said, this is lazy storytelling, there are things these people could NOT have known, and forced me to think, "Okay, whose story is this? Am I rooting for anyone? Or is anyone who happens to be sitting in the studio when Marty wants a voice-over forced to get up and start jawing?" I found it be intrusive, abusive and a coward's way out of telling a story. *The level of violence was gag-inducing, covered with the loud soundtrack I mentioned before. If you like seeing people shot in the head, if you like seeing both men and women violently killed, if you like seeing Cosa Nostra type murders up close, including seeing Joe Pesci's character beaten to a pulp and buried alive, then you will be sure to have a good old time. IF there was a story, it was about pathetic, stupid, sad, self-involved people whose only interest was money and squashing anyone else, and children, if there were any, bore the brunt of collateral damage. Sharon Stone snorting coke in front of her child! With her pimp berating the child! On the verge of harming the child! Yeah, yeah, I know; "harsh reality" torn from the pages of real life. So, if this is the sad mess of people's lives that you want to wade through... and three hours of it... have a grand old time. IF Marty had actually done a bit more character development and not have essentially 1-2 note performances by every person in the film, then it could have been great. Right now, the best thing about it were Bob's suits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visit To Your Parent's House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, I am not a worshiper at the altar of Scorsese; He has made one good film GoodFellas. This is another: am I watching the same movie that everyone else is watching? To be fair, the first half hour is excellent. It is really a great look into the workings of a corrupt casino; how the money is skimmed what goes where, how they stop cheaters etc. I am chomping on my popcorn, hey this is pretty interesting. Then guess what happens? It turns into my parent's house Ace marries a hooker and then the casino story disappears with them yelling at each other, her driving her car into Sherbert's car, yelling like a banshee rattling the fillings in my head. BORING. Look, if I want to watch that crap I will rent some chick relationship piece of crap. Yes, interspersed we still get little pieces of the casino story but it shrinks into the background soon it becomes AS THE CASINO TURNS where you need a scorecard on who is screwing who like we care? The casting is awful; Marty, Don Rickles as the casino manager? Sharon Stone was a disaster in this film; yes, she is beautiful but she never could act. Look at the wreckage of crappy films behind her; Sliver, Quick and the Dead, terrible actress. We have long scenes of her shrieking at the top of her lungs; yes, I do not envy Dwight Yoakum now. This is not GoodFellas where the domestic problems were in the BACK of the script; here, Ace and Ginger's domestic problems take over the whole movie and you keep saying what was the name of this movie? Oh yeah, Casino I thought it was Slot Machine Heartbreak. Marty always feels he needs to gross us out to wake us up from what a crappy, overrated filmmaker he is; in Cape Fear, we got the treat of a woman having a chunk of her face bitten off and spit on the floor; bring the kiddies, thanks Marty. Well, here, Marty has a man's head put in a vice until his eyes pop out. How Lovely! Scorsese always says he does this because life is violent. No, it is to wake us up. GoodFellas is a great piece of work; this is not GoodFellas. It is about 45 minutes of good entertainment that suddenly goes off into a boring soap opera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead;Yes I know every Scorsese film is a masterpiece right? Wrong. Check out crappy Cape Fear then watch J. Lee Thompson's original with Mitchum and Peck please not even in the same ballpark yes loved the pedophilia sub text with Juliette lewis really classy touch. It was implied in the original here it is almost consummated. Scorsese never was one for subtlety. DeNiro overacts so badly and finishes the picture off. Here the film starts out very well except for a few casting choices that wreck the picture later. First Don Rickles as the casino manager you are kidding me? Sharon Stone is beautiful but watch her films please she never could act; she single handedly wipes out Sam Raimi's The Quick and The Dead. Even then it might have worked, the real death knell is when Martin for some reason decides that Rothstein's domestic problems with his hooker girlfriend are relevant to the plot. WHO CARES? Notice in GoodFellas that Liotta's personal problems are in the back of the script not the front. I was really enjoying the film how casinos are run; how profits are skimmed off the whole mafia structure then something happened it turned into AS THE CASINO TURNS. Ginger is doing Nicky and Sam both and then they throw Lester in for good measure. Was this film called CASINO? Did I wander into ORDINARY PEOPLE? The casino story vanishes for a big chunk of the film it degenerates into some sordid love triangle highlighted by the unintentional hilarious scene of Ginger ramming Billy Sherbert's car. We are treated to Stone shouting at the top of her lungs making us all glad we were not the unlucky ones to be blinded by her beauty in the early 90s. What an awful actress with no range at all. It is not an accident she was in CATWOMAN. Yes the first half of the film is quite well done. My advice is to watch until say about an hour and a half in get up and turn the movie off. As a sidebar you can notice that Stone who was famous for not having any qualms about doffing her duds is shown in bed with a bra on for some reason with Pesci. Yes she agreed to do the film but it is one of her only roles without nudity after seeing her performance they should have demanded it be re shot with full nudity. If you loved GoodFellas as I did, watch half of a great movie the bail out. Scorsese always feels he needs to up the violence every picture we were treated to a man biting a chunk out of a woman's face in his CAPE FEAR. Here we get a man's head put into a vice until his eyes pop out; also two men beat to death with bats and thrown still alive into their grave. Martin says life is violent that is why he puts it in there; maybe Marty it is to cover up what an overrated crappy filmmaker you are. Please it is there to bring ghouls into the cinema you know the Friday THE 13th crowd. Overrated Badly like most of Scorsese's bloodfests</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(70%) "Goodfellas in Las Vegas" holds up as one of the better crime movies of the 1990's. It's a movie of two halves with the first covering the operation as a whole with quite a lot of detail regarding the inner workings of their sleaze pit, and the second deals more with the downfall of each character. Sharon Stone plays one of the most hateful god-diggers ever, and Joe Pesci is more or less the same character he played in Goodfellas. The movie ends with other side of all that money, jewels, and luxury in a bitter tasting manner with a really quite brutal death scene highlighting the reality of greed and power and where it can lead. This is undoubtedly a good film, but Goodfellas is better, funnier, and overall stronger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was ruined by the technique of narration. The same technique that spoiled Goodfellas completely wrecked Casino. DeNiro and Peschi's characters narrated it for us as if it was a slide show. How great this film would have been if it was done in a straightforward manner. Instead, we even have narration as gangsters are shooting each other. Sharon Stone stole he show and she deserved to get the Oscar for Best Actress. Too bad she didn't. I don't know what more an actress could do. The film was full of great moments - Peschi for all intents and purposes reprized his role as Tommy from Goodfellas and was as menacing as ever, though it mystifies me as how anyone could be intimidated by this dwarf. It's almost as bad as when Danny DeVito played the tough guy in "Hoffa".But look out - when Peschi goes after a guy with a ballpoint pen, all bets are off - I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore...harrowing. DeNiro was bland, as he was in Goodfellas - he didn't seem to try to act. Once again, this film was absolutely ruined by the intrusive narration. It muddled the continuity and restricted the storyline.</fullReview>

Different colors but with his rugged complextion he carried them off beautifully. And he was dressed impeccably. Sharon Stone was also dressed to the nines. And their spacious and sprawling home was to die for. Joe Pesci looked like he had a face lift. I wonder? But I love seeing movies about American gangsters and especially about "the mob" and this one lived up to it's theme. So far none can reach The Godfather level but it's always nice to see some try.

		<fullReview>Martin Scorsese is one of our finest directors and Casino may not be one of his best films such as Taxi Driver or the very similar Goodfellas, or his worst such as the horrible mess called Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, and instead comes about at the level of The Aviator and maybe Age of Innocence. Scorsese has a fascination with the mafia and there is a lot you could say about the mafia, unfortunately most of it wouldn't work for a Hollywood film so he keeps telling practically the same story over and over again which is unfortunate. So once again we see this cool mob man played by Robert De Niro in a superb performance who is well standing in the community, and than we have his boy-hood friend the psychotic played by Joe Pesci who once again deserves and Oscar, and well we go from there. The film is masterfully written, acted and directed with very nice visual effects but is to familiar and long to be very engaging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again. What an incredible movie! This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in. Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch a lot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold. Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker. Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career. Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it. This film is truly a gem you don't find often.</fullReview>

It's much deeper than, and the metaphores are obvious. Martin Scorsese always uses religious elements, usually Catholic, in his movies to accentuate the story, but here he decided to go for the big one and tell the classical tale of God.Yeah, you heard me. God. It's so obvious that it surprises me that no other reviewer has mentioned this. It's simple, DeNiro's character is God, trying to create order in this thing he has created, while Pesci's character is Lucifer, always rebellious, always trying to break free and create something of his own. Pesci's character is even named Nick, which is an old name for Satan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films by Martin Scorsese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not the biggest fan of Martin Scorsese at all, in fact, I don't like him and I think he is a tad overrated, and this film is a proof of why I think that way about him. It's a bad film that no supposedly 'great' director would do. It's a film moved by nothing. Seriously, there is no point to make that film. It looks like a worsened version of Goodfellas, that frankly also wasn't that great. There is the crazy Joe Pesci yelling and killing people and the quiet and conscious but also despicable Robert DeNiro. In fact, it can be considered a reprise of their roles. But unlike Goodfellas, that has an intelligent narration an is so over the top that you even laugh at some scenes, Casino has no redeem value or whats or ever. Is a mess. It's so predictable and so repetitive. Why should I spent three hours of my time to see things that were not only made before a lot of times, but made way better before, after all? It is not worthy watching at all. Not mentioning the fact that the film is ugly as hell, it has no art value and it looks like those low budget films made in the 70s. Total fiasco. The music was great, oh yeah, some great stuff on it. But it was all over the place. I merely believe how bad the music was on this film. But if the music was that bad it was because of the editing. One of the worst that I've ever seen in a 'big' film. Seriously, who are the editors of this film? What a lazy work. What they are thinking? I mean, what they are thinking? And the art direction was so tasteless, it looks like *rap. Sorry for the swearing, but it is literally what I meant to say. I know that the intention of the sparkling colors in the ambient was to make the bandits looks even more extravagant and repugnant than they already were, but it couldn't have been done in a better way? Well, I totally think so. I'm not even bothered by the horrible and senseless script, since that there is things much worse than that in the film. Anyway, it succeeds in passing the intended message, that is to show how dirty and how works the casino's world, but the rest, is a mess. The only good thing about it was Sharon Stone, that was by far the best actress in the film. 4.5/10</fullReview>

It really adds nothing new or original to the genre and featured the most disgustingly overacted performance I've seen my entire life in the form of Sharon Stone. Also, any time a film relies 90% on narration just annoys me. If I wanted that much narration, I'd get a book. You should be able to convey your story through images and character dialogue, not a constant narration with little clips of what they're talking about scattered throughout. I give it some credit for completely kicking it up six notches in the final third of the film, though. It became so much more engaging and entertaining, and Pesci and De Niro both fine tuned their performances. James Woods was also very fun to watch, but was criminally underused.</fullReview>

It is beyond me how people can endlessly praise this movie and pejoratively reject films like 'Gangs of New York' or this year's 'The Departed.'

The end though is much like that in Goodfellas, where all the top-men who know something end up getting wacked by the Mafia. An done of the best thing about this film, as all sorcessee fans probably know, is that there's nothing false or 'Americanised' about it, it is written from a first person's perspective.

		<fullReview>From Nicholas Pileggi's factual book about a mobster's immorality and downfall in Las Vegas, NV from 1973 to 1983. Despite sweeping cinematography and palpable evil at nearly every plot-turn, "Casino" seems a "Goodfellas" retread. Robert De Niro is predictably good in the lead, but Joe Pesci, as De Niro's surly back-up, does nothing new and Sharon Stone, as De Niro's wife, is just the 'token woman', trying to build a character without much genuine material to work with (she's satisfactory). Director Martin Scorsese seems more interested in his characters' actions than their motivations, causing some confusion in the story and leaving many questions unanswered by the end. The film is fast-paced and entertaining, but it doesn't leave a heady imprint behind, and some of the violence verges on self-parody. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, a shocking misfire from great director Martin Scorsese. This movie could have been great, but it was really miscast. Robert De Niro is a great actor, but he was wrong for this movie. For one, he doesn't even bear a slight resemblance to the real Ace Rothstein. He is just sleepwalking through the entire movie, and his cigarettes seem to be more animated than he is. Sharon Stone is good in her role, but she is just so unlikable that you don't feel any sympathy for her. Same for Joe Pesci. He has none of the humor that he brought to his role in "Goodfellas", where he played another mob psycho.That is why I hate this movie, because all three lead actors are so unlikable that you don't care what happens to any of them. Only the supporting cast, led by Don Rickles and Alan King breathe any life into this movie. James Woods is great in his limited role as well. Funny how you sympathize more with his scumbag role than you do with the other three. Woods could have been the lead in this movie. It just goes on FOREVER, and there are long stretches where you feel like nothing happens. A great cure for insomnia.This was the last Scorsese/De Niro film, but hopefully not the last. Scorsese seems to have gotten his balls back with "The Departed", and it would be great if someone would write a good script for these two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that 'Casino' is usually perceived merely as a critique of the Mafia. Much more than a clich condemnation of the criminal underworld, the film delivers a mordant 'j'accuse' against the degradation of the self-destructive socioeconomic system (including cops, government bureaucrats, politicians) that generated and institutionalized the Mafia's role in contemporary Americana.Upon relocating to Las Vegas, childhood friends Sam Rothstein and Nicky Santoro (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) submit their gangster experience to the disposal of the local mob network, which controls the gambling industry. Rothstein rapidly excels as a Mafia-sanctioned casino manager luxuriating in a Roman lifestyle, while Santoro successfully commands the rougher, more violent aspects of the underworld business. Soon, however, their virulent lifestyles and incessant greed leads them to a downward spiral of confrontation and deceit, accentuated by their common lust for femme fatale Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).This fascinating Franco-American co-production ought to be commended for its caustic inquiry into the rotten economic foundations of the American dream. Moreover, it achieves this without seriously compromising its solid cinematic components (storytelling, cinematography and overall cohesion), while also giving prominence to Stone's extremely well-acted, visible female character, amid all the Mafiosi male chauvinism. On the downside, the screenplay is often vaporous, and some of the inevitable violence is truly stomach churning. Yet these deficiencies should not discourage hardened fans from taking a look. Worth experiencing, 6.5 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worth watching, but not scorsese's strongest effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie for the second or third time. The movie is decent, but certainly not as good as Goodfelllas, taxi Driver or Raging Bull.The movie starts out very strong - I like the first half a lot better than the second half of the movie. The last half kinda tails off, the plot becomes a little ridiculous and it is hardly about a casino at all.The movie as usual with Scorsese movies is shot very well, and the acting is great even if DeNiro and Pesci are playing roles they've played before - especially Pesci who is virtually playing the same character he played in Goodfellas. Its always a treat to watch DeNiro act in these types of movies - even if he is rehashing old ground.The movie kind of felt like Scorsese was trying to top Goodfellas but I think he ended up a little short. i give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goodfellas Part 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there had been no 'Goodfellas', i would have liked 'Casino' much much more. But, there was, and this movie is an obvious rehash of the exact same formula that made 'Goodfellas' a big hit (same writer, same direction, same actors, same formulaic super hits from the 70's soundtrack from hell).I will not deny that it is a well made movie - but I already saw it once when it was called 'Goodfellas'. Having to watch 'Casino' only makes me want to hit stop and put it the real thing - 'Goodfellas'.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scorsese tries to do a Goodfellas 2 but forgets to give substance to his style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rise (and fall) of casino boss Ace Rothstein in 1970's Las Vegas. The film charts Ace's struggle in love with money hungry Ginger McKenna and his struggles to control his business with the violent influence of partner and friend Nicky Santoro.This is very much a rerun of Goodfellas - the running time, the heavy style of Scorsese, the cast, the soundtrack, the violence. However here the story is so thin that it is really stretched to breaking point. The first half is mainly just action, heavily stylised scenes with De Niro's voice over giving it a vague direction. The plot kicks in in the second half with Rothstein's empire crumbling in parallel with his relationship with Ginger. The action is pretty good, but the lack of narrative is a big problem.In Goodfellas, Scorsese's tricks seemed to be the icing on a very, very good cake. Here they seem to be a end onto themselves. Similarly Pesci's performance is very much a turned up version of his Tommy. Scorsese's tricks, tracking shots and soundtrack all seem to be wasted here - as if he was looking for an excuse to do his visual stuff without needing a strong story.Overall this is an unfortunate version of Goodfellas. Visually it is great but without a strong story it feels very empty and shallow - After Raging Bull and Goodfellas I didn't think Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci could do a bad movie. Unfortunately here it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked Goodfellas but this really wasn't that great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really like this movie I generally don't really care for mafia movies as much as other dramas but this really seemed dumb. It made little sense to me at the end. You don't really know what happened to the main character's (Robert DeNero) wife and kid. I am not that huge of fan of Sharon Stone but besides that I really can't fathom why she was nominated for an Oscar for this. Joe Pesci pretty much plays the exact same short tempered jerk that he plays in Goodfellas. Only this time he is his own boss. It was so long too. I liked how The Simpsons parodied the scene in this movie where Robert DeNero has a guy's hand hit with a hammer. That scene isn't that great either. I also didn't care for the amount of cussing in this movie. It had 422 uses of the Fword. Which is a record. Almost every single line in this movie used the Fword. I know Goodfellas used the Fword but not nearly as much as this movie did. Overall this movie was boring and I didn't really like any of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the worst, not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ehh. Everybody compares this movie to Goodfellas (which was one of the most horrendous movies I've seen that wasn't outright 'bad') but in truth it was much better. It was much worse than what Scorcese is capable of at the top of his game, however, which makes it watchable. Dancing around the theme of redemption, like so many Scorcese films, it tells of Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a crook trying to redeem himself and go straight, and who ends up running a fancy casino. Awesome, right? Wrong. He falls in love with a hooker (Ginger), marries her, and then his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci, playing a trigger-happy psycho for once!) comes and wants his share of what Vegas has to offer. Except Nicky's not even trying to go straight. Ginger ends up an abusive, cheating junkie bitch on wheels, and Nicky, by virtue of his relations with Ace, ends up messing Ace's life up in a big way. A main theme in this movie is trust - Ace begins with saying there can be no love without trust, and by the end it turns out Ace shouldn't have trusted anybody. Robert De Niro gave a pretty good performance - nothing compared, of course, to Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, or The King of Comedy - but he is from head to toe a fundamentally good guy with his head on right, who in fact tends to live too much in his head until he crashes for Ginger. He recovers quickly enough, though, and although he isn't perfect, we want him to win. One of the interesting points of the performance is that even though Ace is so logical and tough, when he gets hurt it's unbearable. Joe Pesci was OK, nothing compared to his performance in Raging Bull of course, and while I'm tempted to say Sharon Stone was awful she wasn't that bad. In my opinion Scorcese was a lot better before all the expensive sets and frou-frou camera-work. It just gets in the way of his message. I guess ultimately it's about how your life adds up at the end of the day, and how you can escape your past. It's got a very Catholic tone to it with respect to absolution - it seems to convey the thought that if you're just sorry enough for your sins, everything will work out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although made before 'Heat', the film was not released until after 'Heat'. This shows the superiority of 'Heat' over 'Casino' where audiences were disappointed by this follow up to 'Heat'. In 'Casino', De Niro reunites with Joe Pesci who continues to play unsavoury characters and gets his comeuppance at the end. De Niro manages to escape death when his specially built car informs him that his car is going to explode, and escapes within an inch of his life. Sharon Stone plays leading lady, but because the film is a disappointing follow up to 'Heat', she goes unnoticed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well,i finally got around to watching Martin Scorsese's "Casino"tyhis one has some big names,but to be honest the only standout performance was by Sharon Stone"she runs the gamut of emotions in this one.i won't give any of it away,however.The rest of the actors are okay in their respective roles.Joe Pesci makes sure everyone knows he can skillfully add the f-word into nearly every sentence at least once.that is a dubious distinction and not really an impressive one.after awhile,it just gets annoying.credit that to Nicholas Pileggi,who wrote the script and co-wrote the screenplay(with Scorsese),based on his novel.anyway, considering how much this movie has been praised over the years,i expected something approaching spectacular.it is not spectacular,in any sense of the word.it is a good movie that is entertaining and well paced,given its nearly 3 hour running time.but a disappointment if you are expecting a movie that will knock your socks off and remain with you for days. i just watched it,and it's already fading from memory.keep your expectations low for this one,and you won't be too disappointed.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting anywhere near this Casino will make you lose 180 min. of your life you'll never get back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scorcese is overrated. If you want to know why just watch this dog with an unbiased mind and remember that many fans call it "masterpiece". As for myself, I only watched it out of curiosity, because from time to time they put it on local TV and I was always catching only bits of it. So I checked it out without too many expectations and WDYK, I wasn't disappointed. What I wondered later was why this flick had to be made at all, as it constitutes a clear Been There, Seen That example: the inside workings of a Casino--mainly from the POV of its security--those of a mob hierarchy and, as a bonus, an inside look at a screwed up "romantic" couple. Also this is one you can see without any feeling if not that of remorse for having spent 3 hrs. of your life you'll never get back and that you could have used in a more sensible way--swallowing flies for ex.The main flaw of Casino is that it hasn't any solid plot. Events build upon themselves like rows of brick giving shape to a wall, without any central guiding idea. The thing goes just by the formula: bad guys do bad things, kill people, get their comeuppance. Now, the usual set up in many action flicks is that bad guys do bad things and we feel bad--so we feel good when, later, justice is done. But here everyone is so shallow, contemptible and lame we don't care when they kill someone or are killed themselves. They are all indistinguishable pieces of the same pile of sh*t. But even in that case, you'd say, there may be occasion for a nice building up of tensions, for a thrilling atmosphere, with the use of clever plot twists and an appropriate cinematography. No such luck as, I said, there's no plot, so the only way to keep characters in the movie is by keeping them doing bad or stupid things. The clearest ex. of this is Ginger. Already early on she's in danger of being left aside, her flimsy connection to the "plot"having become ever thinner; at some point she's just De Niro's love interest, so she becomes virtually superfluous. And what do you know, at such a conjuncture the best way they found to put her back aboard is by bringing back her former pimp. And there you got it: the true reason for the soap that becomes that marriage, which consumes excruciatingly long segments of the flick, is not the fact that she was an unrepentant whore, but the more banal one that the writers had lost her and had to bring her back some way--not to mention the $$ Stone was costing. They could've turned her into a faithful wife, devote mom, just the same and we wouldn't have noticed, so shallow had been her characterization; but of course that wouldn't have helped selling tickets. The same thing may be said of the others, with the possible exception of Rickles' Sherbert. No depth, no nuance, no complexity there. Pesci plays the same violent, foul--mouthed SOB he has been doing forever--even his JFK's Ferrie is indistinguishable from Casino's Santoro--and De Niro plays the same self-restrained, still--waters--run--deep goon he did in OUATIA and in others flicks.No plot, no characterizations. What's left? Oh, mood and atmosphere. The sumptuous setting should serve to establish at least the second with some help from the acting and the score; but no help there either. The problem here is, we have seen the same thing sooo many times before--ever vigilant Casino goons, managers; smart-ass players who get theirs in the biggest burner; random wise guys getting their clock cleaned. Mob bosses getting their cut, ordering hits, imparting justice...yawn...So, 2/10, only for settings, cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great thing about this movie are the strong cast and the strong characters they portray. The incredible acting talents of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci definitely bring their characters to life. In reality, THEY, and other incredible talents made the movie memorable. And they are the ones who prevented this movie from being nominated for the worst picture award.Because when you look at the whole movie without those incredible talents, it is very lame and impotent. It has a great beginning, an interesting ending, but much of the middle is worthless. Out of 3 hours of movie, maybe 1 is watchable.It can be compared to a practical joke that involves a piece of paper that says, "How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over." And on the other side it says "How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over." In terms of entertainment and development, it would as effective to make a 20 minute movie, and repeat that exact same 20 minute movie over and over again until near the end of the movie. Cause it has no interesting plot twists. No real character development after the initial introduction around the beginning. And much of it falls under the "yeah, and?" category.Altogether, this movie gambled and lost.</fullReview>

I switched the DVD after 50 minutes and returned it to blockbuster for an exchange. Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro are my favourite Crime Movie actors of all time. But casino didn't do it for me with all the talking and swearing. There was point where three people were talking at the same time i.e narrator, mob boss and an old lady, i couldn't make out what they were saying , and bad enough I don't have a remote control for my DVD player, so I couldn't use the subtitle feature.

		<fullReview>The Scorcese/De Niro/Pesci teaming should work on all levels, such as in RAGING BULL and GOODFELLAS. However, this film fails in too many places, which deteriorates the well-intentioned scenes. Romantic side-stories, such as the one in De Niro's HEAT, rely on uncompromising female counterparts to mangle the story, the hero's strength, and the overall enjoyment of the movie. Now, here we have Sharon Stone. Her character is so imbalanced, from the time she is introduced, to the end, that there really is no justification for it. Here are some major flaws with her performance/character: * She's on top of the world at the beginning.* She snags a millionaire playboy, Sam.* She still has feelings for Lester (ragged James Woods).* Golddigger.* Child endangerment issues.* Screws Nicky (Pesci) several times.* Druggie.Now, what kind of a woman, for no real reason at all, would ditch the rather handsome Sam, to screw Lester and Nicky. Her character is so unreasonable, that we want to see her killed, like Nicky and his brother. All scenes, without Stone, are quite enthralling. When she enters the ring, keep your finger on the FF button on your remote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it has been said plenty of times before, we've all seen this film before. It was called "Goodfellas" and it was better. Actually, saw this film before "Goodfellas" and I still hated it. Three hours long!SPOILER ALERT The beginning, by all means, keeps you interested with all the work of the process of cisinos. Looks like like a very rewarding business. The voice overs of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are also well written eventhough we've been through this with Ray Liotta. The direction starts out considerable. I thought the work was particularly good when De Niro is insulted with the subject of a penn and Pesci steps up by repeatedly stabbing the man out of line in the throat with his own penn.Later, we get to meet Sharon Stone's character. A prostitute who works for James Woods. When De Niro lays his eyes on her making trouble for a mistake made at a crabbs table, he instantly sees something in her. He convinces her to marry him and give up her job for the pimp. He gives her a gift of millions of dollars worth in jewels. What De Niro is not aware of, but becomes suspicious of, is that she is still secretely with the pimp with meetings and phone calls. When they are caught at a restaurant, she msut plead for his life.Peci makes trouble in Vegas. In one scene, he plays blackjack and throws vulgar remarks at the dealer while he throws the cards he recieves out. In one scene they find a thief on the inside and spend days torturing him with with woodshop supplies untill they get names. Eventually, Pesci works his way up to being band from Vegas completely. The FBI eventually gets on to all of them.Sharon continues to be the perfect little wife, snorting coc and drinking away. They have a daughter together who gets the luxuries of witnessing all of this right before her. Eventually, she breaks out to find Woods, bringing their daughter with her. While they're there, they make cash and get a good share of coc. Eventually, De Niro tracks them to get their daughter back. Saron, high and more out of it then ever sleams back when she breaks away from Woods. While running an eran, she did the thoughtful thing of simply tighing their daughter up on her bed and leaving. Sharon continually threatens to leave and the yerns for the jewels so that she can get money and dump De Niro.Rivalry starts up with De Niro and Pesci. Pesci starts getting jobs on his own, still dodging the Feds who have gone as far as hring lip readers. Eventualy, Sharon finds her way into Pesci's arms and they have a short go for something. Eventually, however, Sharon just schemes to get off cash and Pesci kicks the whore out.This film is based on a true story, yet seeses to be realistic. There's a scene when a man at a blackjack table is caught counting cards. He is brought out into a back room and they breack his hand with a hammar. One very cardinal rule in any organization with publicity. Always appeal. To take a mafia tactic like that on an ordinary civilian, would be desastorous for business. People would be disgusted. Thaty doesn't seem to bother the story, however. Even though it should.Pesci's sharacter couldn't be more exactly like his character Tommy from "Goodfellas". Still cold blooded. Still aggressive and unreasonable. The most noble character in the film is De Niro. I can't even get into how annoying Sharon Stone got, whether it was sincere or a good performance, it just got old, stupid, and aggravating. Ya want De Niro to just simply draw his gun and blow her to bits, but he won't because after all thiss "I love her." This after she bardged into his house to get the key to the bank where she can collect her wealth.Yes, the film is violent and gorey. They should have spent much more time on that then all the other crap that is boring and annoying, not gripping. I'm glad to see that it didn't go on to any real success. An osar nomination for Sharon and four stars from Roger Ebert who is simply in love with Scorsese. That's all except for, I believe, a script nomination which I certainly don't appove of, other good review that may have come up, and, of course, the movie goers. It's a shame so many of them likd this film. Plenty of other good or great mafia films out there. "Goodfellas", "Bugsy", all three of "The Godfathers", and probably much more. This is certainly a waste of time and it seems like a considerable deal of effort went into it. Too bad.</fullReview>

Let the acting and the story carry the film but alas thats the problem. Its just boring, it doesnt work.

		<fullReview>I decided to give Scorsese one last chance (I'm now trying to erase the entire film from my mind, and Mr. Scorsese's name, as well). I understand he's supposed to be a great director and that the acting is supposed to be great (I just don't see it - and I tried *very* hard to see good things in this film. I paid to rent it, I wanted to like it. How can someone ruin a movie about my favorite themes - Vegas and the mob? I mean, I'll watch practically anything about this topic.This movie's pacing is arbitrary and amateurish. Scorsese knows he has to provide some gruesome violence at some point - we were checking the time of this flick at 1 hour, wondering when it would *ever* be over. I figured then that the violence would be immediate, gratuitous and upcoming - merely because it had to be there, to keep anyone watching. So there it was. A TV-style shoot-out, followed by torture scene (don't worry, I'm not spoiling much) that's filmed with overly artsy and arbitrary camera angles. I've never seen a film that relied so heavily on narration. What was Scorsese thinking? That he'd get remembered for having the most over-narrated film in world history? There are TWO overly wordy narrators, but you can't make up for the lack of cinematic action and believability on the screen - unless you are watching this during a cocktail party or something. Or you really like movies that don't require a strong plot, and blast you occasionally with set decor or violence.The sets are great - that's what kept me going through the movie, but set design and production design do not a great film make. He should have DeNiro be naked to provide interest, though. DeNiro does his obligatory pug-dog face, with the wrinkled forehead way too much, and that bobbing and swaying thing where he crosses his arms and looks intense way too much.The side characters are overwrought and stupidly dressed (that huge bolo turquoise guy is an example). Once again, Scorsese is like a cartoonist that hates cartoons. He can't even put meaningful props around the set, they appear to be symbolic (but apparently are not) and he shows us all kinds of things that never come into play (that's just bad directing - very B movie, actually). I guess I can see how a movie like this one (cartoony) can be popular, though - I just can't handle the shifts in tone and pacing throughout the flick. There are too many scenes where the frame is tilted, comic book style, that have NO comic book content - and where in addition the acting and dialog are overshadowed by set decor or costume - and the dialog/events do not move the movie forward. Why do that? And why then force so much narration (in a boring tone, mostly from DeNiro) onto the audience? I love B movies, and was prepared to view this entry as Scorsese's attempt to make one, to forgive him all the other directorial excesses he's been guilty of. If he had done that - at all, I would have liked it. Or if we'd seen naked Sharon Stone (that's how bad this was - I was praying for Sharon to lose her panties in that one scene, or at least give DeNiro a blow job, but no - nothing).The Italian mobsters and their food look fake and last minutey - as though someone composed those scenes on a Sunday morning, with a hangover, using the most obvious and basic film student style composition techniques and set pieces. Even the decor failed at many points - and it didn't have to.Oh, and by the way, Martin, if you're reading (which I doubt - if I had made this film, I'd never read anything critical about it, I'd never want to remember I'd made it) - merely sticking old slot machines in little trios on the floor here and there to denote "basement" doesn't work. Neither does using geometric window patterns or Renaissance colors to provide visual distraction to make plot elements loom large when in fact, it's just standard stuff. Watch a Tarantino movie, will ya?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CASINO is by no means a bad film but I`m left with with the distinct impression that I`d seen it all before , and it`s not the first time director Martin Scorsese has done this , remember THE KING OF COMEDY is an inferior remake of TAXI DRIVER . Robert De Niro plays a very similar role as he did in GOODFELLAS , Joe Pesci plays more or less the same role that earned him an oscar with GOODFELLAS while Scorsese uses the same directorial techniques as he used in GOODFELLAS , but GOODFELLAS is by far the superior film .Taken on it`s own CASINO is good . On first seeing it I could remember all the great scenes like the choice between getting the money or the hammer , the cowboy with his feet on the chair , the " Enjoy your meal officers " the scenes of extreme violence and the extremely witty caption of " A few years back " . However seeing it again a couple of years later I realised this film is about an hour too long and became very irritated by myriad of scenes composed of flashy camera work and voice overs ***** SPOILER ****** Most irritating of all if Joe Pesci`s character gets killed at the end how is able to do voice overs in the flashbacks ? </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The reward for those who overrated *GoodFellas*.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This might not be Scorsese's worst movie (that would be *Kundun*), but it may be his most negligible movie, given that it's very much a remake of the director's own *GoodFellas*, which was a pretty empty affair to begin with. That makes *Casino* extremely empty -- call it a black hole.Once again, we get the nonstop soundtrack comprised of Bobby Vinton-esque oldies and 70's album rock. Oh, there's snatches of grand opera, too, especially when little Joe Pesci is killing someone. The point of all this music, presumably, is to punctuate with either emphasis or irony what we're seeing on the screen . . . an easy indicator that the director doesn't have much to show us. And in case that wasn't enough, Scorsese tries to fill the gaps with nonstop -- and I mean, NONSTOP -- voice-over narration. This may be one of the few movies a blind person could watch without missing anything. As cinema is a visual medium, I'm obviously not being complimentary to Mr. Scorsese, here.Scorsese keeps trying to outdo his earlier film with MORE narration, more walk-on characters, more gruesome violence (one guy gets his head squeezed in a vice), more domestic squabbling, more more more. But it's all meaningless, quite apart from being as boring as hell. What we have here is the story of small player from the Kansas City mob (Robert DeNiro) who wants to be a big player. His bosses send him to Vegas, where he feels he has a real opportunity to not only be a player, but to be "legit" in the bargain by becoming a real casino boss.In the meantime, he's got to deal with an old associate, the violent Joe Pesci, and a whory wife (Sharon Stone) who's addicted to drugs and, most laughably, a mullet-haired James Woods. I can buy the whole wife thing, maybe . . . men WILL do stupid things when it comes to blondes. But I absolutely cannot take Joe Pesci seriously as a fearsome, bloodthirsty mobster who blows into Vegas looking for his own action. De Niro and Pesci should've portrayed each other's roles. But what do I know.</fullReview>

Basically the film gives us an insight into the dark world behind the glitz and glimmer of Las Vegas, the gambling capital of America, maybe even the world. Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) runs one of the biggest and most successful casinos in Vegas, the Tangiers, with Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) helping him out, they are the mobsters that know everything there is to know about the running of a casino. They know how that the customer are never the winners, the money goes through a system of checks, they can spot the cheaters, and they know how the staff should be doing their jobs in the way they want. For about an hour and a quarter the film consists of the two friends, since childhood, narrating their knowledge of the gambling business, and then Ace meets Ginger McKenna (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Sharon Stone), a sure fire charmer to lure rich gamblers into the joint. Ace is the smooth operator, while the often troubling Nicky is the violent one who will beat someone if they cross the casino. As I mentioned, there is a dark side to the world of Las Vegas, and that is seen by Ace and Nicky, as Ace is lured into loving a hustler who he wrongly trusts with his most treasured assets, and Nicky gets involved with too much violence, drugs and alcohol. In the end, the whole casino and all of its building blocks come tumbling down, all the key staff members and mob heads are killed, including Nicky who is beaten heavily and buried alive, Ginger gets shot, and Ace only just survives his car blowing up. Also starring James Woods as Lester Diamond, Toy Story's Don Rickles as Billy Sherbert, Rush Hour 2's Alan King as Andy Stone, Kevin Pollak as Phillip Green, L.Q. Jones as Pat Webb, Dick Smothers as Senator and Frank Vincent as Frank Marino. DeNiro and Pesci both create vibrant gangster like characters, and Stone certainly deserved her Academy Award nomination for being a real hard-edge vamp, filled with the same sort of stuff GoodFellas gave us, the lust for power, the domination of money, some sleaze and some really graphic scenes, it is certainly a must see crime drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great "why bother" films of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the talent is there. But aside from Stone, we've seen it all before (and usually better). I guess if it were about an hour shorter and the dialog didn't suffer from banality and the pacing weren't so slack, it might be just about OK, but nothing great. Ridiculously gory (think The Wild Bunch, but without the style). Obviously some loved this film, though I've never met anyone in person who did. The few I know who have seen it basically thought it was a waste of time, a disgusting waste at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A foul mouthed low life degenerate movie written by some foul mouthed talentless slime ball with a bunch of foul mouthed degenerates trying to pass themselves off as actors who if I never meet I will have missed nothing. Hollywood has become a cesspool of foul mouthed jerks with little or no talent. When I watched part of this movie on cable I finally turned the sound all the way down and watched the ending then I canceled the station. I have been a stage actor for 47 years and a musician who plays 15 different musical instruments and have done so for 44 years during my act I tell jokes and never once during my many years on the stage have I ever used profane or foul language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally Profane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you say the "f-word??" They can here - 353 times, according to Entertainment Weekly. This movie, as few others, will assault your senses and make you numb by the time it's over.Constant bickering, yelling, and Sharon Stone's out-of-control character the last hour will have you uttering a few expletives yourself after this Martin Scorcese sleaze-fest mercifully ends.As bad a character as Stone plays, the all-time champion profaner is - no surprise - the one played by Joe Pecsi, who must use the f-word every other sentence. Robert De Niro comes across as a choir boy compared to these other two jokers.The sad thing is, this could have been a decent movie, if Scorcese wasn't just so preoccupied with being so verbally degenerate (see "Goodfellas," "Raging Bull," etc). If the film had been cut down 45 minutes from 3 hours (too much of it dwells on the marital problems involving Stone) and cut back on the profanity, you might have had an interesting crime story with some very colorful cinematography and good narration. However, Scorcese can't seem to make a crime film without all the excess."Brutal" might be a good word to describe this movie. It's too much for anyone above trailer trash morals to endure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really have to be an unbridled fan of mobster movies to like this. I will admit I only watched the first 40 minutes because it was so bad. I decided to give it a shot because of all the glowing reviews here at IMDb. Big mistake. The people that wrote those reviews are probably the same sort of people who dress up in Jedi costumes and wait for days in front of theaters for the next opening. I admit I am not a fan of the genre, having watched 20 minutes of one of the Godfathers and less than that of The Sopranos. The characters are cardboard, overly romanticized, embarrassingly conforming to what someone thinks the stereotype is, and the dialogue is pitiful. Scorcese ought to try making a real movie instead of recycling this gangster swill. Mean Streets is the only thing of his I've sat through because it was gritty and real. Everything since - hogwash. You would be better off watching the old gangster movies with Bogart or Cagney or Edward G. Robinson. They were far more believable and at least you and they knew they were acting. Better plots and dialogue too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWFUL!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely hated this film. It was a complete waste of time, money, and celluloid. The only reason I endured the interminable hours spent on screen by the unpleasant, boring, borish, and nasty characters and the very bad story was I was keeping my friend out of his house so his wife could set up a surprise birthday party. (Actually, there was one redeming quality to it-- the look at the inner workings of a casino was interesting, but the Discovery Channel version was better, without the incessant profanity.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two thumbs down!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is pointless. It supposedly shows aspects of the heydays of Las Vegas and the way Casinos worked. In fact though, it is a series of violent events, decadent situations and disgusting scenes after which the spectator comes to realise that there was no reason to watch the film in the first place. Films like this should be watched only to test one's neural bearing.</fullReview>
