		<shortDescription>Lots of Fun, and Tuneful Too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waaaaaaaaaaaay back in the early 1990's, when Jeffrey Katzenberg was still a top exec at Disney, he had one of his less successful ideas -- to bring back the break-into-song musical. So, as the story goes, he selected three scripts that were about to go into production and gave them to Disney Music Maestro Alan Menken and asked him which of the scripts could be turned into a musical.And that's how NEWSIES was born.It's a great story, too, being a fictionalized account of the newsboy strike in New York at the turn of the century. It follows the exploits of a ragtag band of teenage boys, including Cowboy (Christian Bale), who dreams of becoming a ranch hand in Santa Fe, and David &amp; Les (David Moscow &amp; Luke Edwards), brothers who take up selling newspapers when their father is injured on the job.Conflict arises when Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duval) gets greedy and raises the price of his newspapers to the newsboys, but not to the public. The outraged "newsies" decide to go on strike, which eventually galvanizes all the working children in the city to stand up for themselves.It's a fun film, with Duval playing his villain to the hilt, but Ann-Margret is wasted in her role as a showgirl (both of her musical numbers are badly edited down to just snippets of song). Bale is the real wonder here, though, singing and dancing with surprising aplomb. The songs overall are quite good, but a couple of them are hard to distinguish from each other. My favorites are the opening number, "Carrying the Banner," and the rousing "The World Will Know." It seems odd, though, that Duval doesn't get a musical number of his own, considering in Disney's animated musicals the villains usually get the best songs ("Poor Unfortunate Souls" or "Be Prepared" anyone?).It's a shame that the film didn't do better financially, since as a result of its dismal box office Disney declined to ever make another like it. First time director Kenny Ortega, who also choreographed (he was known for his choreography of DIRTY DANCING), directed one more feature after this, the underrated Bette Midler flick HOCUS POCUS; since that film also failed to find an audience, he hasn't directed a movie since. And that's a shame; he has a very distinctive kinetic style that served both films well.Seek out a copy of NEWSIES, and go for the widescreen version. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie that never gets old!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I was just 3 years old.. My mom tells me that my little brother and I used to dance and jump off couches and try to spin around on the ceiling fan, and sing, when we watched this movie... Recently, it was being mentioned to me for suggestions for our school chorus.. I began to look things up about the movie, and all of a sudden, had an urge to go out and buy it the next day. I've had the movie for a week, and have already watched it 6 times. Around 12 or 13 years later, the movie still has me wanting to dance and sing along... This is a movie that never gets old, no matter what your age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thousand Fans. One Great Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Newsies" is one of the few Disney films that can be classified as 'great'. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that, although it's a Disney movie and based on actual events, it actually stays very close to what actually happened. (Who would've thought?) The movie has a very good script, great acting, and music that make even the biggest musical-hater tapping his/her feet. Add into this mix show-stopping choreography, humor, and some of the best actors and actresses you can find anywhere, and you will see why this movie has generated more fans than any other movie in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie for people of all ages. It has historical information presented in a fun, and exciting way that keeps viewers entertained throughout. It is a brilliant musical filled with catchy tunes by Academy Award Winner Alan Menken, that wrote songs for The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, that keep you humming and singing even after the movie is over. Great dialogue between characters and fantastic dance sequences. The Newsies is filled with a incredibly talented cast, including Christian Bale, Robert Duvall, Gabriel Damon, Max Casella, Aaron Lohr, Ann-Margaret, David Moscow, and much more. Overall, a very entertaining movie, highly recommended for everyone!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm 19 years old in college. I sing the music from this movie on my way to class. And people stop me and say "that's from 'Newsies!' I love that movie!" How many times do you get that kind of response? This movie was exciting, well-choreographed, and funny. It has the best ingredients a musical could have. The best part...you can find this stuff in the history books (well, maybe not dancing newsboys and Robert Duvall playing Joseph Pulitzer...but nobody's perfect...except Christian Bale). See it, love it, brings the kids. They'll want to carry the banner after the movie's long over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>apart from being a wonderful musical (which i've grown up watching so i can tell a good from a bad) it also has a wonderful story-line. the plot is so well thought of, it isn't every day when they make a musical about a strike that happened in 1899. i fell in love with this movie the first time i watched it. it's classical, and when you see it, you can't help but liking it. the dancing, acting, and singing is great. i don't know many teenagers who can dance and sing like that! evenn thought this movie was made 10 years ago and i don't remember it, it's starting to come back. my mom's friend called one day saying that her daughter loves this movie called newsies, and i said that i love it! i thought nobody knew about it, but i was wrong. how could you forget a great movie like this? if you haven't seen it, i gaurentee you 100% that you will probably end up liking it as much as i do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1992, Hollywood has all but lost the fine art of movie-musicals, then along came this film &amp; PRESTO, Disney breathed NEW LIFE into the forgotten art. NEWSIES entertains on ALL levels. The songs are singable and catchy, the dancing is lively, the charactors are lovable, and the story is PURELY INSPIRATIONAL!!! This movie works so well on the screen, and could VERY EASILY work as a Broadway Stage Production, that's the feeling it carries. This movie is So MUCH FUN, and I don't feel ashamed for announcing that. This is a movie that you could STAND UP and CHEER about! Christian Bale delivers a powerful performance in acting, singing, AND dancing, and the rest of the boys are equally as talanted. Headlines don't sell papes, NEWSIES sell papes, and they SOLD ME on this film. NEWSIES DELIVERS!!!!</fullReview>

Jack is a Newsie(a young boy who sells newspapers) that helps lead a stike against the newspaper owners of NYC in the late 1800's. With the help of his friends, Jack overcomes and wins his rights as a working boy of NYC. Along the way he wins the heart of the girl he loves,confronts his past, and sings and dances his way into the hearts of everyone how watches this film. The music and dance routines are fun and energetic,making everyone want to join in the fun. Includes apreances by:Bill Pulman and Ann-Margret. Music by: Alan Menkin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film! We had used a dance number from it for a musical I was in and we watched the film at out cast party. I had heard my friends talk about this film before but had never watched it. I love the story and everything about this film! The songs are so catchy, my personal favourites are Carrying The Banner, King of New York, and Seize the Day. My favourite characters are Mush, Jack, Les, Crutchy and David. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes musicals and good songs. Alan Menkin wrote most of the music and he was the one who wrote the music for The Little Mermaid so you know it has to be good! After watching this movie for the first time, I asked for it as a Christmas present. I also bought the soundtrack so that I could listen to the songs wherever I went. I love this musical and it will always be in my top 10 movies list. I don't see how anyone could not like this movie. I've never met anyone who hasn't liked it yet. Kind of like the same thing with the Princess Bride. I don't a single person who doesn't like this movie! I give it 10 stars!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anyone can make a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone can make a difference, if they believe in the cause ? even the "Newsies." You've probably never heard of them, but in the cities, "Newsies are what sell the news." With their "expansion of the truth" these guys can sell anything. They may seem energetic and jolly, but their lives are a little different. Residents of the slums of New York, they strive just to fill their plates each day. While living in shelters, these orphans live their lives by their own rules. With no one but their newspaper distributor caring for them, they have formed their own family. But on their terms it's not all that bad. Living life with no rules ? every kid's dream. But their futures are what may worry some. This musical has everything from villains to the group hero. This typical Walt Disney Production is everything you image it would be: The same old story, an average "slum" like group and their attempt to change old ways of life. The "Newsies" are the rebels against the "Big-Guys" of the New York News Industry. Every rebel group has its leader, like the great, Susan B. Anthony, with her fight for women's rights. For the "Newsies" the handsome flirt, Jack Kelly was their Susan B. Anthony. This story isn't just on the fight for rights, it's like life...with love, laughter, and everyday problems. Also just like in life people lie, Jack Kelly lied of his future in the West. The reason for this was Realpolitik (there is no right or wrong when it comes to doing for your group/ country.) He wanted to be a strong leader for the others, but when it came down to possibly having a future Kelly, rethought his determination. In the end he got back on track and had more determination than ever before.Ladies, if you would like to see young, handsome men dancing in "tight" newspaper guy costumes, then this is just the musical for you. But, for a 1992 production this musical has some "off the wall music", and the guys sure know how to "drop it like its hot", if you know what I mean. City slums, orphans forming their own family, a fight for change, young love and new friendships, you'll see what it would be like if you went into the real world a "little bit" early. You're never alone in the city of New York ? Not even Jack Kelly! As a leader of the pack, he was never really alone. He always had his followers with him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies is my most favorite movie in the whole world! And that's really saying a lot, because I'm seventeen and my other much loved movies include The Sixth Sense and Batman Begins. Oh yeah...Christian Bale is in both Batman AND Newsies. And for an eighteen year old (he was that old in Newsies), his performance is amazing.Newsies is based on the true story of the 1899 newsboys strike in New York City. Robert Duvall plays Joseph Pullitzer, the real life newspaper tycoon who runs much of the city (newspaper rival Hurst and Teddy Roosevelt himself also appear in the movie). When Pullitzer makes a ten percent cut on the sales of newspapers for the newsboys (mostly teenage boys who smoke and pull off believable New York accents), the boys get mad and go on strike. They are led by Jack "Cowboy" Kelly, a boy on his own who "improves the truth" about himself. He is followed by his partner, the good boy David Jacobs, and his cute little brother Les, and the rest of the grungy street rat boys in their crusade against Pullitzer.This movie has something for everyone. Really. For the older generation, Duvall's performance is really funny (he is the most entertaining character), and then there's Ann-Margaret (who I don't know, but my parents do, although I thought she was the most annoying part in the movie. Whatever). And for the boys, of all ages, there is the rude, crude behavior of the newsboys, who use a lot of 1890s slang and slurs, and who smoke and fight anybody they don't like. There are at least three fight scenes. And then for all the girls out there, like me, there are the dancing sequences, and the typical love story thrown in. What is better than watching a lot of teenage guys (especially when they're good looking...Christian Bale...) dance and sing in tight clothing? Hmmm? And there is the lone girl among the boys, Sarah Jacobs, David and Les' sister, who is the love interest for Jack.This movie is also interesting because it is based on a true story, even if loosely. In fact, two of the boys in the movie, Racetrack and Kid Blink (he's the one with the eye patch) were real leaders in the newsboys strike. That's impressive. And it is certainly refreshing to see a down-to-earth, real movie, unlike movies that are either fantasy, or simply don't look realistic at all. This was the way New York was, and this movie makes history a lot more entertaining.And of course, there's the music. Okay, most people I know don't enjoy musicals, and most don't even know this movie exists. This is a Disney movie, which is why I can't understand why no one knows about it. (And surprisingly, the word "dumbass" is even used-by Jack). But I love the music in this movie. "Carrying the Banner" and "Kind of New York" are fun and two songs you just have to sing along to (my little brother sings "King of New York" all the time), and "The World Will Know" is a song that upholds justice and personal rights. And "Santa Fe" is heartbreaking. This song is sung by Jack (yes, it really is Christian Bale singing) as he expresses how he has no family and nowhere to go in life. This song gets me every time, because you feel exactly what Jack is feeling. And of course, each song is accompanied by amazing dance sequences, which is mind-blowing, taking into consideration that these are all normal teenage guys who normally wouldn't dance. The newsies leap and slide and roll and make everything look so easy, you have to smile.And now, I must touch on why Christian Bale's performance boggles my mind. I first saw Newsies when I was very young, and last year, I was given the movie on DVD. When watching the special features, I learned that Bale is British, and I was floored. His performance as Jack is real and believable, and I still can't figure out how a British teen could pull off a New York accent without flaw, and sing in the accent on top of that.It really is a shame that most people don't know about this movie, because it is truly a great story. It has great music, great acting, a true story, and dancing that will make you want to jump off the couch and start dancing too (at least I want to). I have yet to hear any bad word about this movie. It is a movie that I for one can watch over and over and never get sick of it. A must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'"Newsies" keeps itself from an educational documentary by holding the Pulitzer and Hearst conflict, Theodore Roosevelt and effectiveness of strikes in the periphery. Indeed, it forces historical accuracy out of the periphery and into the trashcan to provide a feel good ending for the film.Newsboys did indeed strike in 1899 as a result of Pulitzer's decision to raise the price the newsies paid in order to cover the cost of foreign correspondence. However, the newsie's union did not achieve its goal. Joseph Pulitzer did not return the price of the papers to its former level. The newsies only won the right to redeem unsold papers for money.But that's not much of a victory, is it? Not compared to the voices of thousands of children raised in protest, calling for rights while gathered in the square beneath the offices of newspaper tycoon Joseph Pulitzer.Machiavelli would have been full of pride (and taking notes) as Robert Duvall's Pulitzer extorted a few extra cents from his 'distribution apparatus'.James Rogers, author of the 'Dictionary of Clichés', would have instantly revised his book to include characters Racetrack (a character who just might have been lifted from a Damon Runyon novel: a snappy dresser who bets and smokes cigars), Frances Sullivan/Jack Kelly (charismatic leader), Crutchy (crippled kid looked after by his friends), David Jacobs (the brains behind the leader) and Brian Denton (idealistic journalist looking for a great angle), among others.At any rate, it's a David and Goliath story. Had the Philistines, the Israelites' opposition at the biblical battle where a shepherd slew a giant, made a cameo appearance, they most likely would not have been able to keep up with the newsboys' dance moves. The choreography blends together well, but still holds the right tone for the characters, working kids living as they please.All in all, it's a fairly enjoyable movie, if you forget history and refrain from analyzing characters and plot. Its idealistic ending is a crowd pleaser, and the song 'King of New York', will stick in your head</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very important movie from my childhood. It has it's obvious flaws, too long, a few unnecessary musical numbers, not very true to historical events, but for me the positives outweigh it.Some of the joy felt while watching comes from the fact that the entire cast seemed to be so joyous and fun while filming. They throw themselves into the songs, dances and silly New Yawk accents with relish and delight. Christian Bale was revealed to be a powerhouse performer even back then. The songs are fantastic even today, transportive and beautiful and the choreography allows the skilled dancers to shine.It always manages to be a fun one to come back to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This musical is perfect for little kids, or anyone for that matter, who want to watch something clean yet entertaining. Not only is it a great story, but it has awesome songs and choreography to go with it. And don't forget Christian Bale, Ann Margaret, and Robert Duvall. (Plus of course all of the Newsies) The story of Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) and his struggle to become something better than a poor, hard-working newspaper boy (newsie) takes place in New York City in 1899. Jack realizes all that he can be when he becomes leader, with a little help from his friend Davey (David Moscow), of the Newsies' strike against a new price increase on the "New York World"'s paper. Filled with humor, dances, and overall talent, "Newsies" will make you wish you were back in 1899.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fine movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen this movie in the theatres when it was released, at the age of eight, I have a real affection for it. I had the hugest crush on Spot Conlon. It's hard to find faults in a movie like that. How you feel about this movie will probably depend on how receptive you are to it. Chances are, you'll have one of two reactions while watching "Newsies". One: "I can't believe I'm watching a musical about newsboys." Two: "I freakin' *love* this movie."Yep, I'm with the latter group. My interest in Newsies was revived when I picked up the soundtrack lately. The music is well written, and infectiously engaging. If you don't like musicals, you're not going to like this film. If you do like musical, I defy you to not like it.Some parts, yes, are a bit hokey. It's a Disney flick, and by definition, is kid friendly. (A lyrics sampling: "And we'll kick their rear!" "They gave their word, but it ain't worth beans.") But the characters are great (and I'm not just talkin' 'bout Spot). The dynamic between Jack and Davey is great. And even though the cussin' is bland, it's still a story of young kids living in an adult world, facing adult problems with teen angst. That's good stuff. Plus, Robert Duvall's in it. Come on."Newsies" kind of got pushed aside after release. As an afterthought, it's interesting to wonder, with the new interest in musicals thanks to "Chicago", if the reception would be different if it were released today. No matter. As evidenced by the comments here, people enjoy it. Darn tootin'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making a Musical Makes News</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I'm reading the comments for Newsies, expecting to find some suitably pithy remarks since this movie was universally panned upon release. But apparently I've stumbled on Tiger Beat magazine's subscription base. Or, to be more forgiving, a group of musical fans that will do anything to see the genre return.I'm glad so many people liked it, and I agree, Newsies wasn't terrible. It had singing and dancing, with Mencken at the lyrics, so we musical fans have to give it at least a five. And it's great to see men dancing - not that this rivaled West Side Story, but it offered the high energy dancing as only young men can do. And it was based on a real inspirational event (coming from Disney, it had to be that or a heartwarming children's classic). Christian Bale has incredible appeal, Max Casella is good, and David Moscow shows potential. Ann-Margaret, unfortunately, must have been forced to be in the film, because she played her part like she was under heavy doses of anti-depressant medication. Now that I think about it, she was very authentic for the times.Music was great, especially the range offered. The other day my husband flipped to the Hallmark channel and I could tell he was watching a Disney movie just by the way the horns were played (turned out it was the "Ugly Daschound" - quite the classic). None of that here - the music was excellent.No, Newsies wasn't terrible. But it certainly wasn't great. The production values were embarrassing. The sets looked only slightly better than Pollyanna's village. I can't believe Robert Duval allowed that cheesy piece of of "beard" to be pasted on his face every day - the closeups were OK, but the distance shots were clearly my faux rabbit coat. And only Disney would managed to find so many clean, well-dressed "poverty"-stricken kids in such tidy slums, toss in a crippled boy, add a romance and a hero nicknamed "Cowboy" and say the film is done. Not a single urchin. You couldn't call them ragamuffins - none of them wore rags. Please. No crooked teeth. Not even dirty hair. I think they even used hankies. And such clean streets! Times Square is dirtier now, after the renovation. Concept and basic story were excellent, and I suppose I can't fault Disney for throwing in the romance and the poignant storyline. The writing (especially lyrics!) and music was beautiful and long missed from other movies. But the production itself could have been miles better. I hope they try another musical with a little more effort (but all their movies have the same look - Princess Diaries II). Disney's movie execs should be forced to watch Martin Scorsese movies for 48 hours before filming anything.</fullReview>

Newsies became a very odd obsession, I watched it daily, bought the soundtrack, and did research on the movie. While it's effect on me has worn off, I would still agree that Newsies was an Amazing movie, for people of any age, a masterpiece, that could get corny but was still one of my favorites. In Conclusion Newsies had to be one of the best movies I ever saw, and I definitely recommend it to future movie viewers.

		<fullReview>One of the best movies of my child. The music is fantastic, written by Alan Menken. The movie follows the true story of the newsboys, or Newsies, of New York City as they fight for their rights and for the pay they need to survive. Christian Bale plays Jack Kelly, leader of the group and reluctant hero at first. Bale really shines and is a talent in acting and in singing as he preforms the beautiful ballet "Santa Fe". David Moscow and Robert Duval are excellent supporting character's to Bale's Jack. Moscow plays the quiet-to-brave character Dave, Jack's right hand man and Duval as Joesph Pulitzer. If you haven't seen this and love musicals, it's a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the movie Newsies! This is a great movie for the entire family, based on a historical event from the late 1800's. If you love musicals, the dance and singing numbers will definitely pull you in to this movie. My favourite songs are Carrying the Banner, Seize the Day &amp; Santa Fe. But if you don't like musicals, this is an interesting history film too! It illustrates (in a Disneyfied way) something of what it was like to live in New York city over 100 years ago... you get some feel of how hard it was for the poor working class to survive. The topics of child labor &amp; the treatment of orphans are touched on. My niece actually studied this musical in school! It's a good discussion starter. If you don't like history or musicals, you still might like this movie because it is also a story of a poor underdog fighting against the rich oppressor. I find SOME parts of the film slightly boring (the bits with Mr. Pulitzer drag a little), but on the whole, the movie is great. Try this movie!</fullReview>

My favorite song is "Santa Fe" where Jack is discussing the idea of a family, and then of his dream to move to Santa Fe. We all know he wants to move to Santa Fe? However does he ever make it there? No he does not. At the end, he is given a ride to the train station to take a train to Santa Fe and he doesn't go - but he comes back! I love musicals and this movie was a really good example of a good musical. My favorite character is Crutchy. I always thought he was cool, but kind of sweet and innocent at the same time. Long live the Newsies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newsies: And the World will know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For being made over a decade ago, Newsies is still a fantastic movie. I've only applauded at two movies in my life, and this was one of them.Christian Bale brings the heart-rendering tale of wannabe "Cowboy" Jack Kelly to life. Kelly wants to go to Santa Fe, where "everything's bigger" and to be free of the city where he is forced to work as a Newsie to survive.Newsies are what Newsboys were once called. They called out the headlines and sold papers for a "penny a pape". If the headlines weren't good, these boys would make up there own. (For example, one headline was about a baby born with two heads, yet it is called out the child has three.) David Moscow brings his character of David to life. Davey is a traditional big brother, trying to keep little Les out of trouble and to watch out for his family. He is unwittingly dragged into the Newsies life, and strike after Les decides Cowboy is his idol.Throughout the movie, foot-tapping songs are matched with amazing dances. I still am amazed every time I see the DVD, because none of the boys had ever really sung or danced before. The songs are stuck in your head for days, and you love them anyway.Kenny Ortega did a fantastic job with Newsies. I've seen the movie dozens of times, and still applaud when the striking children of NYC walk onto the set. I am very impressed with this movie, and urge everyone to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it better than Annie? OH YEAH!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that made Annie is that it had a role that every little girl wanted to play. Jack Kelly is the role that every growing boy should want to play. However Disney has not given up the rights. Shame. What did poorly at the box office (perhaps because of the timing. Musicals in 1990s did not seem to be terribly popular) would probably do well on Broadway. Anywho, on with the review.Newsies is a movie of rebellion. It stars Christian Bale and David Moscow. One of them got to be Batman, and the other got to be in Honey. Not a fair exchange, but hey. Bale's more talented. They turn in good performances, and the story and dialog are endearing. You will feel the power of "The World Will Know" and "Seize the Day (reprise)" I have seen this movie maybe 15 times (I do that with good films) and it rarely gets boring. Minus Ann-Margaret's stuff. I dislike "My Lovey Dovey Baby" (does she actually say the words "My coochy coo") so much. Other than that, the movie is pure gold and the story of rebellion at it's finest.It's a story of boys and that's the main thing I think kept it from being a hit as Girls were supposedly the only people interested in musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tons of people have heard of certain musicals that can be called classics: "The Sound of Music," "The Wizard of Oz," "Oliver!" Yet when one of my friends decided that we would watch Newsies, my reaction was "Never heard of it. What's it about?" The Response: "You have to see." I looked at the box, and saw several big names that I recognized, such as Christian Bale and Robert Duvall. I was immediately thinking, "Seems like a nice movie; why haven't I heard of it?" I still can't answer that question.It simply awed me. I am a long time musical fan, and I had never seen something quite like this. I enjoyed the songs from the beginning, had to admire the plot, felt an immediate bond with the characters. And the dances! I was frightened by the dances. I'd thought that several simple high-school stage dances were tough, but this was insane! I just amazed by how well they were pulled off. All the way to the end, I was watching in eager anticipation of what would happen next. No one disappointed me, the performances were excellent. I was rather intrigued by the fact that this boy longing for Santa Fe was Batman, although I could definitely see the similarities between Robert Duvall's Mr. Pulitzer and Duvall's role as Stalin.The movie stayed with me. I loved it. I was amongst several (including the people I watched it with) who suggested we watch it in History, when learning of the yellow press and the labor unions. (There, parents, it's educational too.) So, *****/*****. If you haven't seen it, see it. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie as a small child. I am now 20 and a college student and I think I love it more now then I did then. I have been asking for the movie for holidays for the past 3 years, and this year I FINALLY got it. I have watched it nonstop since. Something about Newsies just hooks you. Whether it's the catchy songs (all of which I know the words to and listen to on a daily basis), the fun dancing, or simply all of the great characters, I find it impossible that anyone could dislike this movie. Newsies takes you back to time where things were much different and it makes you feel a part of it. It's inspiring and a great movie for anyone. I wish that Disney movies today had the same great quality that they did when they made Newsies. NEWSIES IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE THAT I RECOMMEND FOR EVERYONE!!!!</fullReview>

I love all musicals and this one is no different, the story line was pretty good. You have to love watching movies that will take you back in time to simpler and interesting times. This movie was the first I had seen Christen Bale in and totally fell in love with him he is just so darn cute!! David Moscow was also really good. Who doesn't want to watch a movie filled with such good looking guys for over an hour at a time. My friends like this movie too, in fact we are have i musical party this weekend and Newsies is on the list at the very top!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this movies is great for the whole family to enjoy! I am able to watch it over and over and still love it just as much as I did the first time I saw it. It helps young children to understand some of the history of our country as it was first starting out. The Newsies is a great musical and always keeps you wanting to watch more. The characters really know how to play their parts, they really get into it which makes it really exciting to watch. Christian Bale and David Moscow have a great connection on the screen with their friendship which is also very enjoyable. I would recommend this movie for anyone to watch. It has a great story to tell of young children and this movie does a great job of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newsboys went on strike in 1910. This is their story...only put to music.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it can be pretty corny at times in the dialogue, the music completely makes up for it. Christian Bale does a great job in one of his early appearances as the veteran "newsie" and strike leader Jack Kelly. David Moscow is also superb as David Jacobs, a newcomer to the world of newsies and fellow instigator. Bill Pullman as Bryan Denton, the reporter who helps the newsies in their strike also adds to the show (and he's not a bad singer either). Also deserving recognition is Robert Duvall, who portrayed Joseph Pulitzer, the real owner of the paper the newsies are on strike against and the villain of the movie. Alan Menken probably should get the most praise for this movie simply because he wrote the songs. They are FANTASTIC! When you watch, look for Santa Fe, Open The Gates, and... aw heck, look for all of them! There are also a few good fight scenes. It's funny at parts, and serious at a few others, but overall, it's just plain fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Newsies as part of an assignment in Social Studies - We studied the industrial revolution - and I was taken. A baby-faced Christian Bale leads a rag-tag gang of ragamuffins into battle against the rich and powerful Joseph Pullitzer, who has decided to raise the price of the newspaper for the newboys.A charming classic with catchy tunes now on Broadway including "Carrying the Banner" and "Santa Fe." It will surely win your heart. Ann Margret and Robert Duvall both co-star in this movie and steal the scene in their parts, from Margret's seductive but all the while, playful "My Lovey-Dovey Baby" to Duvall's mean and dark dialogue. Audiences are sure to boo.That is not to say that the movie is not good. I saw the show on Broadway but personally, like the movie more. They are two different things. Get a copy. It's worth it! And if you get the chance, see it on Broadway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's An Old-Fashioned Musical And Ultimately Went To Broadway!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie came out the critics threw bricks; many the reviews here, especially those written by young people love it. Newsies is, after all, a Disney movie, a musical, a boy version of Annie, with athletic dancing on the cobblestones instead of the little girls dancing on beds in the orphanage--so its a kids film, and a very appealing one. Christian Bale is perhaps an acquired taste, but his intensity carries the heroic aspect of the New York newsboys standing up to the capitalist bosses, in this case Robert Duvall in red beard glaring unsympathetically as the dancing tots outside his tower building. The earnest performances from Max Caselli and David Moscow are compelling, the one young female Ele Keats predictable but appealing, and when the boys break out dancing in the streets, you may want to join them! You know where the film is going from the first ten minutes, but the joy is sometimes in the retelling--this is much better than often cited, but it isn't The 400 Blows--it's a musical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a modern day musical it ranks among the best. In fact for musicals period Newsies is one of the better ones. I just resaw it for the first times in a long while and fell in love with it all over again. I love the interact and respect that all the newsies have for each other. And at the end it's very clear how they all feel about Jack and how Jack feels for them, especially David and his family. Even if you don't care all that much for musicals it's still one to watch for it will still entertain you and make you cheer right along in the end. Newsies is a classic in my opinion. I grew up on it and it was something I shared a common interest in with friends and family. It may not go down in history as one to remember but in my book it already has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Fit For God, Starring One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is, unequivocally, the greatest piece of art ever to be revealed unto mankind. Film lovers, as well as human beings, should regard the Newsies as a gift to humanity. The Newsies, with the holy help of Jack Kelly (Praise be Unto him), takes its rightful place next to other triumphant works of man including the Mona Lisa (slightly better), the Great Pyramid (much better sounding), the Great Wall of China (a lot shorter, and more visible from space) and Noah's Ark (saved a lot more lives).Overall, though, Jack Kelly the Beneficent Magnificent Holiness of New York, carries this already remarkably amazing film on his gold plated shoulders. He runs, jumps, speaks, and fights with the grace of God (coincidence?) and the strength of 2.55 million grown bull elephants from Madagascar. By the end Jack Kelly the Beneficent Magnificent Holiness of New York has revealed himself to be a God, played in this movie by Batman. There are three and infinite reasons to watch this movie:1. Because it is a work of God revealed to his people on Earth 2. Because if you've ever wanted to see where the best of mankind his hiding, its in this movie 3. Because if you don't you will be grits-boarded to death</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time when my friend brought it over to my house after getting off work. I wanted to watch it because I saw that it featured Ann-Margaret. At first I was disappointed that she had such a minor role, but then I realized just how good an actor Christian Bale is. I'd never seen him in a movie, and I really liked him. I also liked the young man who played Spot Conlon, and the boy who played Crutchy.Another thing that I like about this movie is that it exposes the way child labor is abused by selfish businessmen, who steal from their teenage employees to pad their pockets. The movie makes you stop and think about child labor, and one may realize that the abuse the newsies suffered is still being suffered by hardworking teenagers who are paid minimum wage for twice the amount of work they are capable of accomplishing.This is an excellent movie with fairly good music, a little comedy, a good plot, and some touching scenes. Plus you get to see Ann-Margaret.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under praised movie musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not discover "Newsies" until my senior year in high school but it remains to this day one of my favorite movie musicals. The movie appeals to audiences both young and old and also gave us our first glimpses at such actors as Christian Bale (American Pysco, Batman Begins)and Bill Pullman (Independence Day). Being a fan of old school musicals such as "Guys and Dolls" and "The Music Man" I was skeptical that a film made in 1992 about news boys would be any good but my friends insisted (and rightly so)and the film still ranks as one of my favorites. The songs will stick in your head long after you have finished the film and you will be wishing you had seen it on the big screen. I recommend this film to children of all ages and anyone who loves good old fun movie musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who says that this is a "bad" film is completely missing the point.Firstly, historical accuracy is not the issue. Just because it is says at the start of the film that the story is based on actual events, it in no way means that the film will be complete truth. For those who have seen Fargo, you may recall that that was also supposedly based on actual events as well. I believe it is on AFI's Top 100 movies of all time and a favourite here on IMDb.Now onto the movie. The songs were good and really addictive. In fact, I just went out and bought the soundtrack for this film. The whole point of a musical is to add and develop a dimension of the film that can only be told by music. The Newsies definitely does this well. Each song gives you a bit of insight into the character singing it.I found the movie thoroughly predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen at all moments in the film. Partly because it is a Disney film and partly because the music gave so much depth to the characters that it wasn't hard to see what the characters were going to do. This is part of the movie's charm. The fact that you CAN predict what the characters are going to do is a testament to how well the music does its job.I think that this film is a lot better than many of the so-called musicals out there because not only was the music was integrated into the film and though the storyline was a bit cheesy at times, it was thoroughly believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Kelly (Christian Bale), David Jacobs (David Moscow), and a group of rag-tag newsboys in turn of the century New York City must try to stop their "tightwad" newspaper owner, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall) from taking away their rights, and at the same time Kelly must deal with the ghosts of his criminal past by avoiding the devious Warden Snyder (Kevin Tighe). The editing isn't great, the painted backdrops can be incredibly obvious, but these are really the only negatives.As a live-action musical that long preceded 'Moulin Rouge,' 'Newsies' succeeds in what it was meant to do- entertain all who watch it, and introduce the world of live-action musicals to children and adolescents who otherwise might think that only animated characters can burst randomly into song.Bale and Moscow, joined by fellow newsboys Max Casella, Aaron Lohr, Trey Parker, Arvie Lowe Jr., Gabriel Damon, Marty Belafsky, and Michael Goorjian, among others, are endearing and, for all of the young women out there, swoon-worthy. Supporting characters Medda, the vaudeville singer who is friendly with the boys (Ann-Margret), Denton (Bill Pullman), the reporter who helps the newsies with their campaign, and the not-so-good Weasel (Michael Lerner), and his two miscreant nephews (Shon Greenblatt and David Sheinkopf) add color and flavor to the film. The dancing makes the non-dancers of the world envious, and the songs will keep you singing for days. The storyline is inspiring, and when all's said and done, it's the kind of movie that just makes you smile.It is no wonder that this movie has such a wide fan base!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of Newsies until a couple of weeks ago when I was in California visiting a friend. She said, "Have you ever seen this? It's got Christian Bale in it." I looked at the Newsies DVD and said, "I've never even heard of it, and why are they dancing on the cover?" My friend laughed and said, "it's a musical, I bet you'll like it." And that day was the beginning of a life-long romance! I'm 20 and fell in love with this movie. It's got charm and class and is just great. It can just make you smile all the way through. A lot of supposedly "kid-friendly" movies today are just plain stupid. The humor is all gross "bathroom" humor and is very hard for someone older to enjoy. Newsies is the complete opposite. After watching it I immediately bought the movie and soundtrack. I listened the great songs on the flight home and then I showed the movie to my mom and she loved it too. I've since asked some of my friends if they've seen it and it turns out two of my close guy friends LOVE it. Growing up it was a favorite and one, when asked said, "dude, it's like my favorite movie NOW." lol . Sometimes it's corny but it's meant to be a kid's movie so don't let that stop you from just enjoying this great film.</fullReview>

It's also a huge favourite for all the Christian lovers out there - it's amazing how quickly people put him and the movie together - he may be a little ashamed of it but everyone else loves it! Yay for Newsies the greatest movie ever!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch... as Veronica Kelly might say, the cat's meow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what if she's dead, or a fictional character... Veronica Kelly (no relation to everyone's favorite newsie, Jack) had the right idea: the cat's meow. Yes, Newsies is just that. It's a lovable story that even I as a junior in high school adore. I mean, really, who can resist Christian Bale and a bunch of other boys running around dancing and singing about selling papes and going on strike? I've got to give major props to Disney for making an ultra-groovy flick that people over the age of 7 can appreciate. Anyone in the business of Broadway (and who has half a brain) needs to put this on stage; after two shows already, you'd think Disney would know a big seller when they saw one! To sum up, if you haven't seen Newsies, something is wrong with you! Go see the greatest movie Disney ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The songs are great and the acting is strong in this fun movie that's only occasionally clumsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that Newsies got bad reviews, didn't make much money and was considered a huge disappointment is incredibly upsetting, considering that it is fun, the songs are catchy, and it is a well-written and interesting story.It stars Christian Bale and David Moscow as the two main teenagers, with Robert Duvall, Ann-Margret, and Bill Pullman in some of the main adult roles. The teenagers are "newsies", who sell newspapers on the street to earn a living; the story is kicked into action when greedy Pulitzer (Duvall) decides to up the price of the newspapers a tenth of a cent. The newsies decide to go on strike, lead by Bale (the charismatic leader) and Moscow (the brains). Pullman plays a reporter who befriends the newsies.Turning this story into a musical was an excellent decision, and despite what critics said, the songs are good, catchy, and fun. The choreography starts out looking amateurish but soon becomes impressive. There's something just plain cool abut seeing a bunch of teenage guys jump, twirl, and dance around in unison. And in one of the songs, "King of New York", Pullman sings. It's always fun to see established actors unexpectedly sing.Faults? The Ann-Margret character is in only two scenes and lends nothing to the story or the music - the one song she sings is the only weak song in the movie. The whole thing would've been better and shorter without her, and indeed it seems as though the screenwriters patched in a part for her after the script was written. Duvall plays Joseph Pulitzer very oddly sometimes, and is not really an interesting or well-written character - just a standard greedy villian, only more quiet and deliberate.Yes, the heart of the movie and the best scenes are the ones with the Newsies themselves (and Pullman), which is good considering the vast majority of the movie is held on their shoulders (both Duvall and Margret have very minor roles, really, odd since they're the only names on the cover). Bale is naturally charismatic in his role, and is a good singer, as is Moscow, who convincingly plays a very likeable person.The movie cost a good deal to make but was very badly advertised and was only released in about half as many theaters as normal. Consequently, no one went to see it, especially considering the bad reviews it received. A real shame, because Newsies is a fantastic amount of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Disney Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie first came out, I did not pay much attention to it, except for the clips of two of the song numbers that the Disney Channel would show, namely "Seize the Day" and "King of New York". I did not get a chance to see it in the theater. However, when I worked at the Disney Store the following year, I would look at the video box cover (admiring Christian's picture *wink*) and something just kept telling me to see this film. My sister purchased the video and we watched it together. I was immediately hooked. Most of the guys are cute, the songs are upbeat, and the movie has a charm that is unique to Disney movies.Someone commented that the movie would have been better as a drama. As Newsies fans already know, originally, it was supposed to be a drama. Christian Bale was awesome as the energetic leader Jack Kelly. David Moscow was great as the more educated brains-of-the-outfit sidekick David Jacobs. Luke Edwards played a cute Les Jacobs. And Gabriel Damon was perfect as the no-nonsense Brooklyn leader, Spot Conlon.One critical point- the romantic angle between Jack Kelly (Bale) and Sarah Jacobs (Ele Keats) was wasted. Although there is an attraction, there is no real chemistry between the two.A solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out and have not quit watching it since. The story is one of boys who sell newspapers on the streets of New York that are disadvantaged and are being further mistreated by the people in power. The songs are great, the dancing is carried out in the way it should be, and the acting is wonderful! Christian Bale and David Moscow are two seemingly unknowns who pull off great performances in all areas(singing, acting, dancing). Then there are greater known actors such as Bill Pullman and Ann-Margaret who are great in everything they do. The whole movie reminds me of all the musicals that I have watched my whole life. I will keep watching it and keep "carrying the banner" with as many people as I know!</fullReview>

Christian Bale is fantastic, even if his singing needs a bit of work. The story is a bit predictable, and the songs kinda lame, but the charming cast really makes up for it.

		<shortDescription>Newsies is a hit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catchy songs, great dancing, and lovable characters; sounds like the 1992 classic Newsies. Not only is Newsies entertaining, it is also true. It is based on factual events that happened in and around the New York City area. The characters aren't bad to look at either. The main character, Jack Kelly, is played by the handsome Christian Bale.Most critics dislike Christian Bale and his role in Newsies. But, I disagree. I thought that dancing and singing were a great way to display the hardships that the Newsies went through in 1899. I also think the love story between Jack and Sarah was a great way to relate the movie to young teens. The only downside of Newsies is that not all of it is entirely factual. For example, in the movie the newsies' strike is successful, and the actual strike against Pulitzer was not successful. So, to conclude, Newsies had its ups and downs, but I thought overall, it was an all around good movie. I would give Newsies four out of five stars. I awarded Newsies with four stars for the great songs, excellent choreography, and fun story line, but not all five because not all of the movie is factual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed,w/ Poor Singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An early Christian Bale movie during his late teenage years, Newsies features support from Robert Duvall and Bill Pullman. It seems worn out, the singing is average to poor especially by Bale and the storyline doesn't flow and is disjointed. Most outdoors scenes seem like backlot sets, but costuming is fairly well done. Dialog is mostly run of the mill. Newsies may harken back to a time when Newspapers were the information highways and all important, but this Disney effort doesn't have the talent direction or musical numbers to stand tall with a movie like say Annie. It tries and deserves some points for what it can muster - maybe worth a look if you like musicals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Pure Disney, Though Ironically Walt Didn't Like Unions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as a long time Disney fan since early childhood in the sixties, i pride myself on instinctively being able to identify anything that seems pure Disney. in the 1990's in particular, there was a fair amount of material that was not suited to the Disney product. usually it was adaptations of Disney studio's animation rivals like UPA or Jay Ward that didn't seem perfectly suited. especially UPA animation adaptations since UPA pretty much hated Disney and was comprised of mostly animators who went on strike against Disney in the early days.strikes. that brings us to the subject of labor unions. Walt Disney hated them. he pretty much associated labor unions with anti American communism. he did everything to resist and oppose them. even though the subject matter of a Disney film about labor unions seems unlikely for a Disney product, 'Newsies' pretty much seems tailor made to the Disney look and philosophy. it's about triumph in the face of adversity, it strongly supports family values as well as being about youth and childhood. it also presents impeccable historic period recreation and even features use of classic matte photography that looks like the work of Disney "in house" artist Peter Ellenshaw. except for the labor union rally cry, everything about this film seems so Disneyfied. oh and yeah, music plays a prominent role in this. also very Disney.besides it's physical attributes, 'Newsies' plays as classic Disney because of it's spirit of humanitarianism. you can't really support a philosophy of family and goodwill without supporting humanitarian beliefs. even though labor unions in this country are intensely flawed, they are still the only base for worker rights. the only other alternative is to let employers do whatever they feel like with their employees, and history has shown us that that doesn't always work. i mean at one time young children were employed by factory workers in this country for heaven's sake. you can't really promote humanitarianism and condone a situation like that. if it wasn't for labor unions, factory and coal mine workers would have no one to look out for their self interest. looking out for the self interest of the working class alone justifies their existence. you can't have children working in factories.i'm surprised that good ol' Walt didn't make that connection. at least someone in the Disney organization had the brains to do it for him. you can't be about humanitarianism and not stand up for people's rights. which is really all 'Newsies' is really about, the right to humane treatment.an interesting footnote to this film is that when Siskel and Ebert used to review together they fought over this film. unsurprisingly Ebert trashed the film for what he perceived as a slap in the face to Joseph Pulitzer. pretty dumbed down bias because Ebert himself won a Pulitzer prize for journalism. obviously Ebert doesn't always detach himself from personal motive.'Newsies' is a great film musical, one of the very best really, and oddly, despite it's subject matter, makes for good Disney. it also helps Disney complete it's assertion of goodwill and social responsibility.look if you really know who Walt Disney was, his right wing political views are no mystery. like a true American, Disney was at least honest about his views right or wrong. i guess that's why Disney rabidly helped send communist to the electric chair and had them blacklisted. you might never reconcile Disney's right wing agenda with a more humanitarian philosophy, but considering Disney's "Small World" view of good will, it's at least worth one good try and this fine family film is the best you'll get toward it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Kenny Ortega, It's First Strike and You're Out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1899 New York City, paper boys sing, dance, and form a union to strike for better wages and working conditions. Leading the "Newsies" is cute young Christian Bale (as Jack "Cowboy" Kelly), an orphan who dreams of moving to Santa Fe. He derives inspiration from curly-haired pal David Moscow (as David "Davey" Jacobs), who is trying to earn some extra money for his unemployed father. The two dancing boys have obvious, er? shall we call it "chemistry" and move along? To make them a little less gay, filmmakers throw in sexy senior Ann-Margret (as Medda Larkson); depicted as having a thing for young lads, she shouts "I put on my best and I stick out my chest!" Go figure? You've got to wonder what Walt Disney would have thought about this? And, we haven't even gotten to pre-teen beer-drinker Luke Edwards (as Les Jacobs). But neither has Ann-Margret. Give her a week. Joining the film's list of flawed come-ons is red-bearded Robert Duvall (as Joseph Pulitzer). Mr. Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst made newspaper street peddlers a staple of American cities. They were often homeless, disabled, and/or lower class lads, trying to make a living before television and coin-operated newspaper racks brought change. Not surprisingly, newsboys were used by publishers as cheap child labor.According to both the DVD sleeve and film, this is "the true story of a courageous group of newsboys who become unlikely heroes when they team up to fight an unscrupulous newspaper tycoon. Determined to make their dreams come true, they find the courage to challenge the powerful?" The claim that the film was "Critically acclaimed from coast to coast," and stars Robert Duvall and Ann-Margret is debatable. Bill Pullman (as Bryan Denton) is the best "adult" in the cast. The film received mostly unfavorable reviews when released. And, relatively few critics called it "must-see, feel-good entertainment." Yet, even with its flaws and studio misrepresentation, "Newsies" remains entertaining. It's certainly original; you just don't see many musicals being produced about turn-of-the-century newsboys. The real stars are Bale, Moscow, and the energetic gang of "Newsies". They are obviously not all professional singers and dancers, which is probably why they succeed. Each one makes to most of his characterization, from Gabriel Damon (as Spot) on saying, "Never fear, Brooklyn is here!" to Marty Belafsky (as Crutchy) advising the jail-bound to "make friends with the rats." The most valuable player is definitely choreographer and director Kenny Ortega, who does everything he can to make these "Newsies" sell. And, he really hits the first one home.******* Newsies (4/8/92) Kenny Ortega ~ Christian Bale, David Moscow, Gabriel Damon, Luke Edwards</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Family Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moderately-paced and simple, Disney's Newsies is best classified as a 'dramedy,' outside of its obvious musical category. The music is decent, Ortega's choreography, as always, fits into a niche of its own, and the singing is fairly easy on the ears and the audience, thankfully, not subjected to pubescent opera singers for a 2-hour duration. Starring Christian Bale as the rebellious, easy-going, and lovable Jack Kelly, leader of a strike against Joseph Pulitzer, (played by highly acclaimed actor Robert Duvall) Newsies is the fictionalized story of 1899 newsboys who fought against Pulitzer, one of the biggest newspaper giants in New York City at the time, to lower newspaper prices back to normal after a spontaneous race of one tenth of a cent per paper. The supporting cast consists of David Moscow, Bill Pullman, Ann-Margret, and Max Casella. (of Doogie Howser, MD fame) This movie, though painfully black-and-white in character, is light-hearted, fun, and introduces feet-tapping songs for which a person might go back for alone.</fullReview>

Certainly this film does not encompass the same audience. It becomes readily apparent when reading reviews from publications geared toward younger audiences that the Newsies has garnered a large-fan base in the younger audience. Although during its release this film was one of the lowest grossing Disney live-action films released, it has since developed a large following. Because this film was well received by its intended audience, it can certainly be considered effective in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great musical and film for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1899 and world is controlled not by the TV or internet but by those who own newspapers. Our first glimpse is not of the rich and powerful but of the abandoned and poor newsboys, the children who distribute the papers on the street.We quickly meet Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) a legend among the newsies and David Jacobs (David Moscow) a new comer to the newsies world. Kelly quickly teaches David and his little brother Les (Luke Edwards) the ropes of being a newsie in New York. The excitement is quickly extinguished when the owner of the World, Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall) decides to increase his profits by charging the newsies more for their papers. Soon Kelly is leading a strike against incredible odds facing a political puppet controlled by the very people the newsies seek to defeat.This movie is a fantastic musical with perfectly written and placed songs. Such tunes as King of New York, Carrying the Banner, and the World Will Know are instantly likable and fun to listen to. I find myself from time to time humming these tunes.The choreography is not perfect but it is still good. It is fun to watch the songs and see how not only the songs but the dancing fits with the story.The story is one that we do not see to often with clean language, a clean story, and normal flawed people becoming heroes for what matters most.I recommend this film to anyone (who likes musicals) and their family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying I love historical fiction. It's so much better than reading history straight out of a schoolbook. Newsies, based on the 1899 New York newsboy strike, has brought a forgotten true incident to life and made it stand out in our minds, as all great pieces of historical fiction should do. It is an entertaining film with catchy songs and some great dancing sequences. The acting performances, notably Christian Bale and Bill Pullman (who I had no idea could sing) are wonderful. It's refreshing to see such enthusiasm for a film that was considered Disney's biggest disaster. This is the second time I've seen it now and I can honestly say that it doesn't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It will probably always be remembered as a box-office disaster, but Newsies wasn't a disaster because it's a bad movie, it was simply ill timed. If it had been made 35 years earlier, it would have probably been a huge hit, but it came out in 1992 and was an initial disaster. Oops.Newsies is built on a formula of musicals from the 50s and 60s, and when compared to musicals of that time, it's solid and well-made. The problem is that the filmmakers consciously decided to use old techniques for making the film, instead of reinventing the wheel. I honestly believe that with a few minor adjustments in how the film is shot and cut, Newsies would be a success today. Just look at the success of the High School Musical franchise and Enchanted if you don't believe me.This film, however, has made legions of fans in the last fifteen years. I originally saw it in school, and later decided to watch it for one reason; namely, Christian Bale, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who discovered this delightful film because of him. Before he donned the cape and cowl, the future Batman was dancing his way through Newsies, and doing a fantastic job for someone who didn't sing or dance prior to making this film. Interestingly, almost none of the leads sang or danced before making this film. Watching the movie, you really wouldn't know, the training those boys got was obviously just that good.The legions of fans who now carry the banner for Newsies are proof that it was never a bad film, it just came out in the wrong decade. In conclusion, my advice to studio execs, if you're going to produce a box-office bomb, make sure you cast a future super-hero, it'll help you with the rentals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies!. This film is a story about family and how important it is to be a part of one, no matter how old you are. But it's also about fighting for what you believe in and going after what you want. Even one voice can make a difference. I've always loved this movie, even when I was younger. I just recently bought the soundtrack and have been driving my family crazy with my renditions of "Santa Fe" and "Carrying the Banner." The music is outstanding and you can't help but sing right along with it. And of course yet another great performance by Christian Bale. He was incredible as Jack "Cowboy" Kelly. He had a strong voice that carried throughout every song and an incredible accent that fit his part perfectly. I think my favorite part, besides that last scene, would have to be when they're on the rooftop together in the morning. It's just a really sweet scene and you can really see how vulnerable he is and how much he just wants to matter to someone. And that kiss at the end was amazing. Ele Keats is one lucky girl! Everything about this movie was great and not only that, but it's a movie for people of all ages. It never gets old. Besides, what's not to love about a bunch of young, good-looking guys singing and dancing in the streets of New York!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies is a wonderful movie musical put out in the early 90s by Disney.Although the film initially bombed at the box office.It has,over the past 15 years or so,gained a cult following through video sales and multiple broadcasts on the Disney channel.I first heard about this movie a few months ago,so my curious self went out and bought it,and I fell in love with it.The story is about the newsboys(a.k.a the Newsies)in 19th-20th turn of the century New York.When Joseph Pulitzer hiked up the prices of the Newsies papers.Jack "Cowboy" Kelly(played by Christian Bale at only 18) organized a union made up of fellow Newsies and with the help of Kelly's friend David(played by David Moscow),who was the brains behind Kelly's voice,the Newsies go on strike.The story is very wonderfully written and is well acted out by the remarkable cast.Christian Bale plays Jack Kelly an orphan who through David Moscow's character,ironically named David too,he finds out what family really is and falls in love with David's older sister,Sarah(Ele Keats).Bale perfectly hides his English accent with a perfect New Yorker accent,it is superb and he is definitely the thing that keeps this film fresh throughout.Robert Duvall is very good as Pulitzer,and Ann Margret who is a Vaudeville singer who's a friend to the Newsies is remarkable.But what truly makes this film shine is the wonderful music written by Alan Menken(who also wrote the sings for Aladdin,Beauty and the Beast,and the Little Mermaid).The songs and the choreography is just stunning.With such great upbeat songs as 'Seize the Day','Carrying the Banner',and the big showstopper 'King of New York' are down right stunning(but my personal favorite song is Bale's ballad titled 'Santa Fe').Although the singing isn't particularly amazing it fits the story and characters well,and you must also remember that the majority of the cast is boys from about the age of 7-18.All in all it's another great Disney Musical and is definitely a must see for all!!!!! A perfect 10/10!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thousand voices . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think one of the most powerful lines in this movie is, "When you got a hundred voices singing, who can hear a lousy whistle blow?". These boys, not much older than I am now, took the future into their own hands, and make the world stand up and take notice. On a lighter level, this movie is fun for the whole family, with music you can sing and dance along to, and jokes that everyone can laugh at. They managed to keep the riot scenes low-key enough to not frighten young viewers while still getting the point across (especially in the scene at Irving Hall)There's also some incredible dance numbers and the singing talent exhibited by the actors blows you away. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason I watched this movie was because I was having a big obsession over Christian Bale. In the beginning, the name sounded weird, so I avoided it. But then I saw a picture of the characters dancing. "It's a MUSICAL!?! That means Christian sings and DANCES!!!!" It was the best present ever. So yes, the main reason I watched it was because Christian Bale was only 18 in it and he sang and dance. But when I finally watched it, I found I couldn't just love it because of Christian. The whole movie was brilliant. The songs range from jumpy and catchy (eg. Carrying the Banner, King of New York) to soulful and full of power and meaning (eg. Santa Fe, Once and For All). I don't care if this was considered a flop and was nominated for four Razzies (which is just full of *beep* and pure evil), it's a cult phenomena, and should be re-released in the theaters. Then people will see how much money it'll make. If you love musicals with meaning and pelvic-thrusting Newsboys, you'll love this movie. I highly recommend it. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely my favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title says it all, right? Newsies is and has been my favorite movie for several years now. The music is great, the choreography is very good, and everyone does their own singing! That's the best thing about it, I think- What you hear on there is everyone's real singing voices. If you like musicals, you'll probably like Newsies. If you like things that are based on actual events, you'll probably like Newsies. It's about a real-life newspaper strike that happened in 1899 in New York, a story that (from what I know) got very little recognition. Of course, they were able to be creative with it because it's a movie-musical, but don't shoot it down because of that. Watch it before you say it's bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fifteen minutes into this movie I knew I LOVED it, and so did all the others who were watching it with me. This movie has everything that anyone could hope for: a true story basis, excellent acting, a wonderful plot, and awesome dances put together with great music! Oh, and some funny humor too! It is based on what really happened in NYC during the newsboys strike of 1899, and about how the boys had their many ups and downs, and how they were like a family and always looked out for each other. There was even a touch of heart in the movie to make it perfect. I'm not sure what it is, but just something about this film amazes me, and thousands...hey, maybe millions of other fans out there.This true story is about the power and courage of KIDS, and even has it's own, very large, very dedicated CULT of fans who just love to talk to each other about this. Their favorite film! =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! It just gets better and better every time you watch it, especially when you know the songs. The characters, music, and storyline are all amazing. The dances are great too! It has lots of comedy, romance, action, drama, everything in one movie! The sets are good too, most of the time they used very large outdoor sets, so there's only a couple times that you can tell there's a fake background. Plus it's directed by the awesome Kenny Ortega! It has a lot of characters so trying to keep everyone's name's and character's straight can be confusing, but they all fit in just right. There are a few spoofs you can notice if you watch carefully but most are very minor. All around it's a great movie and I would recommend watching it to anyone, even if you don't like musicals or old-fashioned movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my brother first told me about this movie, I was very skeptical. Neither me nor my brother have ever been fans of musicals, so I wondered what had possessed him to watch one and, heaven forbid, like it. But I also believe in giving something a try before deciding whether or not it's worthwhile. After seeing it for the first time, I was hooked! The songs are so well-written, and I always find myself humming a few bars. The choreography is what I love the most about this movie, though. I know that newsies didn't really dance and sing as if they lived in a musical, but if they did, this is how they would have done it. Both the style and wording of the songs and the punch-and-kick-and-jump look that the choreography has really helps to bring out the newsies' character.Chock full of memorable characters and great quotes, Newsies has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Even if you don't like musicals, I recommend Newsies as a great family film, an entertaining experience, and an all-around good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit, I rented this movie anticipating that it would be unforgivably dorky; something that I could make fun of throughout the entire movie. We did a Newsies medley in my high school choir that was straight-out cheesy, and I made the mistake of assuming the musical would be equally as horrible.As it turns out, I loved Newsies! So did the rest of my family - young children, teenagers and adults alike. There were a few dorky elements, but it was still a really cute movie.It's based on the true story of a newsboy strike over a price hike that took place in 1899 New York. I'd highly recommend this film to any American history teacher looking for an interesting way to present yellow journalism, unions or exploitation of child labor.The dancing was truly amazing. Choreographed and directed by Kenny Ortega, who also did Dirty Dancing, I was very impressed with how such a big group of boys ranging from about 7-19 were able to move so well together. There were a few acrobats in the group who were flipping their way around the set effortlessly.The music was pretty catchy too, but not nearly as impressive as the dancing. There were a few moments with powerful ensemble singing.Awesome dancing, Vegas-worthy circus tricks, kids with adorable fake-but-well-pulled-off New York accents, and upbeat music. What more could you possibly want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Newsies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you love all singing, all dancing, fun loving and happy ever ending story lines then this movie is perfect for you. If not, then i wouldn't recommend reading on. The Newsies is a Disney movie based on the real life events of the 1899 news strike, although not all the facts and figures are strictly true. The Boys of the news strike in this film are based on real characters, although the main character Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) is fictional but may of been based on the real Kid Blink. Created in 1992 this film is fairly old, and when it first hit box office was one of Disney's lowest grossed films yet. But, having said all this, it really is a great light-hearted family film, which is enjoyable and yet sends out a powerful message of 'always stand up for what you believe in' to the younger viewers. The songs are uplifting and high-spirited and as for the dance routines well they are as energised and enjoyable as possible. The ending you could say is predictable, but makes a great finale to a great film, the characters make the film all worthwhile, and as the relationships between them grow we begin to relate to them and really get involved with the action. Overall its a Musical adventure, with some heart warming moments, and some great New York accents! Enjoy the film! And remember 'The Newsies never quit!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie ever. I was over my friends house and she said that i had to see this movie that i would love it. She was right. It is about the newsies strike of 1899. The newsies challenge the most powerful men in New York. It is a story of dreams coming true and is great for almost any age. There is some rude language so if you are not allowed to listen to that i wouldn't see it until you are. They are not really bad but newsies are street rats so they are not going to speak in proper language. The plot is based on real events so that makes it even better. It is teaching you about history without you realizing it. If you have not seen this movie you should and then become a newsiefreak with me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really cool. Newsies is about a group of newsboys who go on strike when the prices for the papers go up. With Christian Bale (singing and dancing) and Robert Duvall, what could go wrong with this Disney movie? The story is based on actual events, so the storyline was great. the acting was superb, and i'm not normally pleased with kid actors. and it definitely helped that the dancing was really good. you almost can't believe that the kids are actually doing the dancing. with twists all through the movie, and lots of comedy, this is a great movie for kids and adults (except if you hate music, but that would be very sad).</fullReview>

Cowboy and David are the main caracthers and they really capture you and the draw you into the movie. They have guts and stand up to the big guys and fortunately the win against those pigs. Him and all the newsies go on strike to fight the big guys and so get beat up and go through hell and still make it through. But it kind of goes downward when the leader cowboy get caught by the cops causes hes a criminal and get taken to the refugee and he has to work for the newspapers owner to get money and get out and everyone thinks hes a scab and a trader. He does redeem himself when his friend gets beat up and he helps him. Then they finally win against the pigs and get there rights back and jobs.

His daughter is my best friend so when she comes over she brings it and we watch it. My friend also has the soundtrack which I LOVE listening to.This movie is really upbeat and we love singing along. We love singing along with "Carrying the Banner" and "King of New York". We even get tempted to dance along.My favorite character is probably Denton. He's one of the few good adult people in this movie. This is a great movie and it will never get old to my friends and I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie two years ago in a choir class. I instantly fell in love with it, and bought the soundtrack. It's got a great plot, and great music. It really tells about what really happened in the strike of 1899. I remember once in my eighth grade history class, my teacher asked who the two owners of the newspapers were, and a ton of us knew the answers because we had seen the movie. This movie is one that anyone can enjoy. My eleven year old brother was just introduced to it, and he and his friends act like their Newsies all the time now. They love the fight scenes, and the music. This is a movie that parents can put in, and watch it as a family. There's nothing in it that little eyes shouldn't see, and parents wont feel like they are watching some boring little kids movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals, or to anyone just looking for a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie some time in '94 and i thought it was simply wonderful. it was a welcome break from overloads of testosterone filled films of the late eighties and early nineties. After being brought up on feel good family musicals like Annie, The Sound of Music and The King and I, Newsboys was a welcome development. Made me ask whatever happened to the musicals? However, the movie was not celebrated and was not very popular; not too many people i know have watched it.besides i don't think any one was much into musicals then. The choreography was excellent, the songs were catchy and passionate - can only remember one though: "...and the world will know..." Christian Bale showed he had what it takes to be a serious actor(think Johnny Depp in Cry Baby!)Two-thumbs up! Going to look for it on DVD!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christian Bale is the leader of the NYC "Newsies", the countless boys and young men trying to earn a few pennies selling newspapers. "Read all about it!". Already exploited by greedy newspaper barons, the Newsies are hit with yet another "squeeze", bringing the already steaming pot to boil over. STRIKE! The story is based on actual events in 1898 NYC. Played for drama, some of the actual story was obviously embellished. Musical numbers and outstanding choreography make this film a winner. Unfortunately this was a box office dud and to date has not received proper recognition for the portrayal of a piece of Americana. Worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All around family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Newsies was a clever musical movie with catchy tunes and fun dance sense. Songs like "My Lovey-Dovey Baby," and "King of New York" are great for the whole family. The movie's plot was a clever one but they forgot one key thing: To tell the truth! In this movie, the Newsie's strike apparently goes over very well, but in reality it didn't. In real life the Newsies didn't win the strike but they still worked as hard as they portrayed it in the movie. Scenes like when Pulitzer talked and when Jack Kelly explains his past made the movie dry. Yet aside from that the movie's sheer suspense was great! The songs were snappy and went well with the theme of the 1902 time period. Songs like "Seize the Day" and "The World Will Know" were uplifting and helped add to the movie's sincerity. The dances scenes were fun and had movement that made you want to get up and dance yourself. This movie always left you wanting more, like when Jack Kelly is told to sell papers or his friends will be put in jail. It really makes you want to scream out "no". If this movie was a book it would be a real page turner .This movie was suspenseful, interesting and an all around family movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best family films ever, and it works as well for 18-year-olds as for 3-year-olds. The plot is strong (a David/Goliath story of street kids versus Joseph Pulitzer); the values are strong (families are important, friends stick together, the truth will conquer all); and the songs and dancing are a thrill. "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" became famous on the strength of just ONE manly, athletic dance scene, but "Newsies" is FULL of them -- these boys bound across the set like a combination of Tommy Tune and the Olympic men's gymnastics team. It's great fun to watch.</fullReview>

If you liked this movie, I recommend checking out the history of the 1899 strike and the effect it had on child labor and related issues. It is truly inspiring what a bunch of underdog kids were able to do. And the movie is just plain fun, as is the soundtrack, which I highly recommend if you can still find it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can imagine why this movie didn't hit it big- it's a musical. There aren't many fans of this dying genre out there, and (with the exception of "Newsies") the last of the great musicals died with "Grease". I love musicals, I still do. I think that the dancing in this movie was great, I believe that the 'fight dancing' that they used in the "Seize the Day Reprise" might even be MTV worthy (not an insult in this way). The singing was great, I specially loved "Santa Fe", and the lyrics were catchy and humorous, case in point "King of New York". The boys were !muy guapo! (very good-looking). I was very fond of Mush, Racetrack, Kid Blink, Crutchy, Cowboy, and the rest of the gangs with their funny nicknames. I hope that people start watching this movie and give it the credit is deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Of course it's probably a chick flick, but it has great music. This is a great musical with a somewhat, if not sketchy, factual history. Also, for the ladies, there are some really cute guys! Guys, music, dance numbers, what else could you ask for!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion Newsies was an awesome movie. The cast members played their parts well. If you like musicals, I know the sound of it may turn you away, with break out into a song and dance you will seriously enjoy this movie. I just recently got into it and I have been hooked ever since. It has some great actors and actresses that deserve a lot of credit and applause for this movie. It makes you feel like you should get involved in the strike as well. I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars! :-) ~Stephanie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie has so may good qualities. Alan Menkin is an amazing composer and Kenny Ortega's choreography make this move visually and audibly stimulating. anyone who is in the performing business cannot pass this flick up. beautifully acted and you wouldnt recognize the backlot of Disney's MGM Studios if you didnt know. its also fun to see the history of New York. it has slight similarites to Scorsese's Gangs of New York in art design, acents, etc. i teach summer camps and i have used many of the songs many years for numbers for the kids. some of them have also made this one of their favorite movies. have fun watching this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a matter of fact...these events *were* based on a true story. And the way they showed it isn't as bad as you think it is. Just because you think it's bad doesn't make it bad. I think it was an excellent movie and it portrayed the fact that life wasn't easy back in 1899...just as it's not easy today. And it also teaches a moral...if you actually paid any attention whatsoever, you would've noticed that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Waaaaaaaaaay back in the early 1990's, when Jeffrey Katzenberg was still the Prime Minister of all things Disney, he had one of his less successful ideas - to bring back the break-into-song musical. So, as the story goes, he selected three scripts that were about to go into production and gave them to Disney Music Maestro Alan Menken (who was still floating on his accolades for all the animated films he had scored) and asked him which of the scripts could be turned into a musical.And that's how NEWSIES was born.It's a great story, too, being a fictionalized account of the newsboy strike in New York at the turn of the century. It follows the exploits of a ragtag band of teenage boys, including Cowboy (Christian Bale), who dreams of becoming a ranch hand in Santa Fe, and David &amp; Les (David Moscow &amp; Luke Edwards), brothers who take up selling newspapers when their father is injured on the job.Conflict arises when Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duval) gets greedy &amp; raises the price of his newspapers to the newsboys, but not to the public. The outraged `newsies' decide to go on strike, which eventually galvanizes all the working children in the city to stand up for themselves.It's a fun film, with Duval playing his villain to the hilt, but Ann-Margret is wasted in her role as a showgirl (both of her musical numbers are badly edited down to just snippets of song). Bale is the real wonder here, though, singing and dancing with surprising aplomb. The songs overall are quite good, but a couple of them are hard to distinguish from each other. My favorites are the opening number, `Carrying the Banner,' and the rousing `The World Will Know.' It seems odd, though, that Duval doesn't get a musical number of his own, considering in Disney's animated musicals the villains usually get the best songs (`Poor Unfortunate Souls' or `Be Prepared' anyone?)It's a shame that the film didn't do better financially, since as a result of its dismal box office Disney declined to ever make another like it. First-time director Kenny Ortega, who also choreographed (he was known for his choreography of DIRTY DANCING), directed one more feature after this, the underrated Bette Midler flick HOCUS POCUS; since that film also failed to find an audience, he hasn't directed a movie since. And that's a shame; he has a very distinctive kinetic style that served both films well.Seek out a copy of NEWSIES, and go for the widescreen version. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

It's a useful way to introduce the sensitive topics of child labor, unions, and the abuse of power to children ages 8 and up.It's not a documentary which is a good thing, cause if it was it would be much harder to get kids to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest musicals ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that I just can't work out why it bombed at the box office-it has to be in the top ten musicals of all time. The only part of the film I dislike is Jack's dance (when you see it you'll understand) The songs will have you singing along and you'll really route for the characters. It is based on the NY Newsies strike of 1899 and stays pretty close to what happened-quite shocking for a Disney film. This is one film I highly recommend and I recommend that everyone watches it-I defy anyone not to have that feel-good feeling by the end of the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My opinion (and several others) on this Miraculous Musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Newsies is not only a miraculous musical (as I have stated above), but a passionate love story and one man's strife to find his real place in life. It tells of the 1899 strike (a real event may I add), and how the newsboys of Manhatten, New York (or The Newsies as they are known better as) took charge and stood up to the "tightwad" Joe Pulitzer.The Newsies does not only include spectacular choreography, but priceless songs with countless voices. This is a movie for all ages and of all times. My friends give these ratings of the movie:Simone: 10 Melissa: 8 Mareesa: 9.5 Shannon: 10 Laine: 10 (ME): 10 Zoe: 9(average of: 9.5)If you can't believe these ratings, then see the movie for yourself!You wont be upset if you do!This movie is a musical, a comedy, a love story, an action tale and a drama, rolled into one 2 hour and 1 minute movie! Around every corner is a new character, a new adventure, a new surprise (both good and bad), but what this story is mostly about is: Fighting for your rights (and taking chances).So grab a bowl of popcorn, pop the movie in, sit on the couch and enjoy the world of The Newsies!Simone: Da best moivie Ise ever did see! (sorry thats my impression of a Brooklyn accent...Bitts n me r trying to get em all down).Melissa: I thought I wouldn't like it because it was a musical, but I was wrong and I enjoyed the movie a lot (and all the cute guys helped)!Mareesa: With all those accents, cool dance moves, cute guys and awesome plot, how could you not help but love it!?Zoe: My sister showed it to me and I thought it'd be lame, but it wasn't! It was actually really cool! (I'd see it again...shhh!)Shannon: Me and Laine were and are life time Newsies' fans, we just pulled in my little sister (Bitts) and she did the rest!"Newises is a timeless classic, don't be the only one that doesn't see it!"~Bitts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I don't see how Newsies ever flopped at the box office! Newsies is by far my favorite movie! I'm an avid musical lover...and no, Newsies isn't quite up to the standard of most musicals, but it's a fun movie that is really not to be compared to any of the other big musicals! Newsies is a moving story of kids on the street who have to do all they can just to make it day by day!! It's a feel good movie that people of any age can watch! Currently, I'm in highschool, and I have grown up watching it with my sister who is now in college, and with my parents! It's a movie that everyone loves! A movie with great music and fun dancing by boys on the street! You don't often get to see a musical movie full of boys...normally it's a bunch of girls! Newsies is an excellent movie that everyone should own or atleast rent! I know I watched it once, and now I watch it probably atleast once a week...it never gets old! Just give it a chance! It's an excellent movie you'll watch once and love forever!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie to lift the spirits and put a smile on your face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I have to admit, I really like this movie. I wouldn't say it's the "greatest movie ever made," nor would I venture to say it's the "greatest Disney movie ever made," but it certainly holds such a special place in so many people's hearts. Even if you HATE the movie, you have to respect the work these kids put into their dancing, singing and acting. First they had to learn the music, then record it, then learn the dances, block them, and practice. Above all that, they had to learn their lines and blocking just like any other movie. The choreography has so many different elements, so do the fight scenes, especially the riot.The plot is very simple: good conquers evil, the little guy beats the big, mean, tycoon and the main characters live happily ever after, it's a very Disney type of film. If you desire a movie with a little more depth and complexity, then don't see this film. If you want a depressing plot where nothing goes the way it should and things just keep getting worse and worse for the characters and only evil people come out on top, don't waste your time. If you want a realistic movie about poor boys living on the streets of New York City circa 1900, starving, without food, and ultimately curling up in little balls just to die, go on to the next film in the database. This movie is not realistic(how many people do you know that randomly break out into choreographed song and dance when the mood is right?) but it is incredibly entertaining with great songs, terrific choreography, and a cast of wonderful kids with plenty of charisma, great ability as dancers, and wonderful voices.I love this movie. As a dancer and a singer, I think it's wonderful to see so many boys dedicating so much time and effort to an art that is not as "macho" as some people take it to be. It takes guts to do that and I give all of the guys in this movie a huge thumbs-up for taking this challenge and making it into a wonderful film.By the way, some of you don't seem to realize that the movie was not entitled "Jack Kelley and the Newsies" and the whole film should not be critiqued on the basis that Christian Bale is a good-looking person. I have to admit, I think he's wonderful in this movie, his acting, dancing, and singing tie the whole thing together and I think he's absolutely adorable in this film, but the movie could still suck even with a cute headliner. Make your criticisms with a bit more depth than "Oh My God, Christian Bale is so HOT!" because it gives no insight into the movie and is incredibly childish.Please don't dissuade people from writing their comments even though they are negative. Not everyone liked this movie and that's ok. Everyone is entitled to their opinions and everyone is entitled to write their opinions here (freedom of speech, remember that one?). That is why this feature was created: to let people who haven't seen the movie listen to other people's thoughts and decide whether it's worth the three bucks to go rent it. Personally, I would skip the renting and BUY the movie, but that's just me.Overall, if you're looking for a fun, entertaining movie that will make you laugh, sing, and dance along with these boys as they conquer New York, look into it, but make your own decisions after you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange distribution of IMDb votes -- 50% of them are "10", but it only gets a 5-point-something! Good movie. "Newsies" were what they called the kids, 7 to 17, who put up their own money each day to buy newspapers at 1/2 cent to sell them at 1 cent. On a good day, if they didn't have to "eat" too many papers, they might make 50 cents for their families. Mandatory school was not yet in place.Rich and powerful Joe Pulitzer decided he needed to make a little more money, so began to charge 1/10 cent more per paper. The newsies organized and went on strike. Eventually they won, a victory for the little guy.The DVD is very nice, and has several very worthwhile extra features, two generally on the "making of", and another on the real newsie strike in 1899. The acting, choreography, music, singing, and dancing are all well done and entertaining. I don't think it is a "10", but probably an "8". A "must-see" for anyone who appreciates films based on good historical events. The singing and dancing by the kids has sort of an "Annie" feel to it.</fullReview>

Kenny Ortega faired much better choreographing "Dirty Dancing" and "Salsa", but his direction here was heavy-handed. And he got to follow this up with "Hocus Pocus". Ouch.People of the world, rent "Hello, Dolly", "West Side Story", "Funny Girl", "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" or "Singing in the Rain", even Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" will do, and see what a true musical is supposed to be, mesmerizing and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies is deffinetly the best musical or even movie i have ever seen. It is soooooo awsome! The thing is there are a lot of girls that like it because of all the cute guys in it (i must admit they are pretty cute) but that is not the only thing that is good about it. There is a great message about the newsies and what they went through everyday. Also the singing, dancing, and acting was spectacular!!! My friends think I am crazy because I like Newsies but if they gave it a chance they would probably like it to. So, I recommend that everyone go and rent Newsies A.S.A.P!!! (I LOVE NEWSIES!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World Needs More Movies Like This!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 14 when this movie came out and no one would take me to see it in the theaters saying it was childish. I got to watch it for the first time on TV and was hooked. I looked for it every where, and when I finally found it for sale I bought two copies in case one wore out. That's the kind of movie this is. I own over 500 VHS tapes and DVD's but this is the only one that I have two of and I plan to buy the DVD as well. As a young teenager it gave me new ideas and showed me that I could change the world, as an adult of 24 it still stirs dreams of changing the world. Both the music and dancing are catchy and get you so wrapped up in what's going on you feel like you're right there with the boys struggling for what they believe in. I've been a big fan of musicals growing up, nothing ever compared to Annie and Sound of Music for me until Newsies came along, now I would trade my whole video collection just to keep those three movies. I want my kids to grow up with good entertainment such as this. Hopefully with the musical Moulin Rouge coming out more movies such as Newsies will get made. I think the world is ready for the feel good experience singing and dancing bring to a movie. Nothing can bring you closer to experiencing a movie than singing along with the stars to a great song, and nothing can bring the world closer together than the shared language of music and dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I'm reading these reviews complaining about how the movie doesn't show the squalor the boys lived in, that it's riddled with inaccuracies, that it's shameful how fun it's portrayed... Well, NO DUH, SHERLOCK! Look at the company. Disney. DIS-NEY. Has Disney ever shown a film aimed at teenage girls that was full of facts? Maybe once. It's a fun, happy musical made PURELY so girls could squeal whenever Christian Bale or any of the other guys came onscreen. If you can't stand the mis-information, get the sound track. Because the music is astounding. Or watch the dance sequences. The dancing is astounding. But stop complaining and read a book about how horrible kids had it at the turn of the century. Then go watch the movie and giggle because you KNOW those tunes get stuck in your head, no matter how hard you try. Ahem. I really am fond of this movie. Shame I can't find the soundtrack. But it's extremely enjoyable and if your teenybopper daughter is stuck for something to watch, hand this video. She'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still enjoy it now that I'm an adult!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this as a young teen when it came out in the theaters I was so excited as I always loved to watch old musicals and now here was a modern one with kids my age! I wasn't disappointed, I felt it was just as entertaining as some of the classics frankly, but the songs had a modern sound to them which wasn't a bad thing either. As one who took dance for years I found it thrilling to see such well choreographed leaps and formations. And the story was gripping and inspiring. I watched it again a little while back, and though I am an official adult now I truly still enjoy it. The songs and dancing still thrill me. And while I do find a few scenes a little hokey and cliched now it doesn't detract from the overall sense of exhilaration I feel when the boys cry "Carrying the banner!" or "Headlines don't sell papes, Newsies sell papes!" This movie is a celebration of determination and the all American "can do" spirit. Every generation needs a few movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It May Be A Disney Movie but ITS SO ADDICTING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outside, Newsies may appear to be just another musical that they tried to make into a movie. but this isn't the case! Newsies is the best movie that i've ever watched. Sure, the plot isn't exactly scientific, it follows the usual pattern that Disney movies have. But the music--singing and dancing-- are SO addicting! i watch all of the songs over and over again. the soundtrack practically lives in my cd player, i rent the movie almost every weekend, and its so much fun! the actors that portrayed the newsies are extremely talented (especially max casella and aaron lohr :P) and they make you want to watch the movie over and over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of musicals and Christian Bale, so naturally Newsies is my kind of movie. The songs are great, the choreography is amazing, the singing and dancing ability of the young cast is unbelievable. There are some slow sections, namely almost any part involving the adults (why is Ann-Margaret even in this movie?!). It would have done better if they'd stuck to what makes Newsies great: the kids. All the Newsies and Bill Pullman did a great job, and I especially loved Max Casella as Racetrack.Newsies is one of my all-time favourites. I will never get tired of singing the songs or trying to do the dance steps, and I'll never stop wishing that I was that talented!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The low end of the musical scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed that this was on TV recently and decided to watch it only after reading the effusive praise heaped upon it here. Big mistake.Oh, it's not an absolute abomination like Exorcist II, but compared with other movies in the musical genre it's pretty lame.Where to start? Forgettable music and sloppy choreography? Not being either a teenager or a girl, the "cuteness" of the boys did nothing for me.As for the "authenticity" of the film, this sounds like yet another failing of the public school system. (New York transportation was almost exclusively by horse; those dancers should have watched where they were stepping much more carefully.) The sets were okay, except for some really bad matte paintings, and the kids all had incredibly good dental work (hardly credible).So let's compare it to similar films. The abysmal Annie had, at least, better songs. You want dancing boys? Go for West Side Story. Singing kids? Oliver! and Bugsy Malone put this to shame, in the quality of both the music and the film in general.Storywise, if you took out the music and made it a straight drama, it just might have worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I have asked almost everyone I meet if they know of the movie "Newsies". I have been amazed that so many people reply telling me it's one of their favorite shows and they love it. Then they ask me if I know where to find it. I tell them to check local video stores and things, but it has become so popular that it's become hard to find. Especially the soundtrack, since that's not even in print anymore. My opinion on the matter, is that they should start printing more copies of the movie and soundtrack, but first re-release it in theatres. It was made to be seen on the big screen. Dinsey would make more of a profit on it now than they did in 1992. I may only be 14 yeas old, but I have my opinion and I think the majority of people would agree with me on it. Plus, I do know movies pretty well since I grew up with them. If you want to talk to me on the matter, feel free to e-mail me. ~*Lindsay*~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard so much about this movie that I finally broke down and rented it, really not expecting much. Boy was I pleasantly surprised. It really is an uplifting movie that catches you in its spirit and holds you to the end. The story and characters are strong enough that even non musical fans will find enough to enjoy, and those who do enjoy musicals--well, this is easily one of the best in many many years.Christian Bale is great in the lead role, as is David Moscow and Gabriel Damon in supporting parts. Its amazing to think, since this movie was made that many years ago, that these actors (other than Bale, of course) have not become more famous. They all do a wonderful job here. Robert Duvall, Ann Margaret and Bill Pullman also manage quite well in the adult leads.You never can really tell what makes one movie a hit and one a flop. But by any standard, this movie should have been a much bigger hit than it was on its initial release, and we can only hope that it is finally finding its deserved audience in video.Now you'll have to excuse me--I'm going to go watch it again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. Okay, okay. So the ending is predictable. So the villians are two-dimensional. So the dance scenes aren't always perfect. So what! Really, it's hard to explain why this is one of my absolute favorite movies ever. Maybe it's because the songs are so "singable" that I have them all memorized. Maybe it's because the lines are so memorable, and at times funny, that I have many of them memorized too. Maybe it's because you can't help but root for the David going up against a Goliath. Maybe it's because I love the accents. Maybe it's even because many of the actors are good-looking teenage guys. (*grin*) All I know is that I've loved this movie since before I can remember (7 or 8 years old maybe) and I still love it now. Right now I'm anxiously waiting to go to my friend's house so I can watch it again. Here's some proof of this movie's greatness as a feel-good family movie: my friend's family has 9 people in it, and every one of them loves Newsies. From the 40 yr old mother, to the 20 yr old daughter, to the 16 yr old son, to the 5 yr old son; all of them can sing along with any of the songs. Believe me, if you like movies that are simply fun and enjoyable, you'll like this. Every time I watch it, I end up with a large, stupid grin on my face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You watch the movie the first time. Great. You watch it a few more times. And you pick up some things you didn't notice before. Watch it a few more times. And you pick up more. By then you're obsessive and you go to websites on the film. And you find a list of bloopers. And it's a *long* list. So you print it out and you watch the movie again. And it gets even better once you can pick out all the spontaneous goof-ups on film that, when you watched it the first time, you never picked up. And by then, you've become a real fan, part of the huge Newsies cult. ::chuckle:: This is a movie that either you love or you hate, and only very few people are in the middle area. Not only is the music and dancing incredible, the story is inspiring and the setting is breathtaking. You wouldn't think the slums of New York City would be so incredibly beautiful, but in a way, it has a charm to it all its own, adding a real flair to the piece. Even with the editing mistakes and the bloopers, it's an excellent film, and I believe that the mistakes add to the charm of it and make you watch it again to pick up everything. But even if you don't pick up the bloopers, you will probably want to see it again. Perhaps to learn the dances, or the words to all the songs. However, the video and soundtrack are hard to find (I recommend amazon.com). Not only will children enjoy it because of the music and the dancing, teenage girls will enjoy it because of the "hot guys," and just about anyone else would like it because of the story and the tough New York attitude of the characters.I'm not just saying this because Newsies is my favourite film. I'm a critic, generally, and I'll point out anything I don't like about the movie. So, now is my time to be a critic. One: If you don't enjoy musicals (even though this is FABULOUS music from the one and only Alan Menken), don't watch it. I believe it's started a musical revival in the film industry. Two: Medda Larkson (Ann-Margret) should be seen more often. So much more could have been done with her character and her relationship with Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) was never established. There should have been another scene with her. Three: Sarah Jacobs (Ele Keats). That's all I have to say. If you've seen the film, you'll probably agree. She was pretty, but she didn't seem the type Jack would fall in love with. She had no real character, and seemed like a damsel in distress until the Delancey brothers attacked her and she threw a punch to Morris's face. But for the rest of that fight, she cowered in the background and let the two thugs beat up her older brother, then watched Jack come to the rescue. I'm not one for damsels in distress.But, despite this, it is a movie worth watching. Really. Especially for the bloopers.. you'll feel like you're in on a big inside joke that no one else knows about. Check out this film, it's a winner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I am absolutely amazed at the talent of the many singers and dancers. All of the songs have so much passion and expression. Also, Newsies is a family movie that anyone can appreciate. There is no teenage girl who can resist the charms of Jack and Spot. Parents can enjoy the plot without having to worry about mature content. Kids can enjoy the fun of the songs, and the plot in general. It is such a great, uplifting, heart-warming movie that everyone (especially history buffs like me) should see this movie. It teaches a tale about courage, and gives hope to the hopeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a surprisingly great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film after being pestered by my friend who absolutely loves it. I didn't understand why. It looked downright silly to me, but I borrowed the tape and popped it in one night when I was bored out of my skull and found--to my complete surprise and shock--that it's REALLY a great movie! I found myself instantly wanting to watch it again and again, and wanting to acquire a copy of the soundtrack (which has been discontinued) so badly that I resorted to paying over $60 for a used copy. This is a REALLY good movie! It has a certain charm to it, especially (ironically enough) in its many flaws. Find a Newsies site and look up the bloopers list. It's quite long but you'll find you'll enjoy the film even more with these little quirks (like someone tripping over their own feet in a dance number, or two boys giggling and sharing a glass for a toast because they were only handed one). The singing and dancing is great in that you know the actors are not professionals at that sort of thing, which goes well with their charactors, a sort of rag-tag bunch of young teens. The characters are all pretty adorable in their own ways. I really didn't think this movie would be any good, so I'm SO happy it turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. If you want a really cute, campy, uplifting, fun movie, go rent Newsies, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I know I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I admit I'm completely obsessed with musicals of every kind, but that does not mean I can't be critical! But Newsies ... Oh I loved it! The story line was inspiring and exciting, the music was superb and energetic, and the dancing? What can I say? It was unbelievable! Every musical number in this movie achieves something! The story and the characters create excitement and arouse the spirit within you! I was absolutely overwhelmed with the acting of all the Newsies! Jack, David, Spot, Blink, Racetrack, they blew me away! (And not a few were extremely cute!) This is a movie for everyone! A true musical of the late 20th century! Now what would movies be like if someone could put out more musicals like this one? I gave it a TEN! There is no other number below that that could do this movie justice! (If I could I would have given it a higher vote!) I LOVED IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it! I have been a closet Newsies fan for years. I saw it in the theater 3x but went to a theater where no one knew me because I was embarrassed. I once was almost outed by the clerk at the video store who informed me in front of my independent film loving friends that I owed a fee because I was late returning Newsies.I even own the sound track. Now I am coming clean. I adore this film. I love everything about it; the music, the dancing, the characters, the story and I can't explain why because it really is not a very good film! But isn't that really what makes a cult classic? So pull down the shades if you must but don't be afraid to enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies that Disney has ever made. Not only is there a heart-warming storyline and a collection of endearing characters, there are some really adorable actors that completely converted even my most cynical friends.This is the story of the newsboys of New York City at the turn of the century, and their couragous struggle against the most powerful man in the city. Fighting for the right not to be ignored, to be treated fairly, they pull a David and Golliath worthy of the most exacting in movie critics. There are some evil villains that keep you alert, and several heroes that supply endless thrills. Of course, above all else, are the wonderful songs in the movie. Hear them once and you'll be singing for weeks on end. I cannot say enough about this truly wonderful (though underrated) movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies didn't find its audience in the theaters, but it's not for lack of quality. For years movie musicals were terrible. "A Chorus Line," "Annie" and all the rest had no idea how to use space, how to bring the passion of the music alive on film. But Newsies changed all that. The choreography and dancing are brilliant, and Menken's music is some of his most fun. And where else do you get to hear Christian Bale sing, and see Bill Pullman dance? A wonderfully energetic, exuberant film that should have been a smash hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as some would claim, but certainly not as bad as others would claim...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People have covered this movie in excruciatingly fine detail, so I won't go into the technical aspects of the film. They have already been explored quite adequately. Where this movie fails is where all live action Disney movies fails. Disney has a tendency to infuse all the heavies in their movies with a heavy, leaden cartoonish aspect. I guess that makes them less threatening to the audience their movies are aimed at. Newsies is no different. You could even make a strong claim that the movie was fomulaic. Guilty as charged. But this doesn't really detract much from the movie very much. Anyone who expects reality or accuracy from any, and I do mean, ANY movie musical is setting the bar way too high for a movie of this type. All movie musicals have a certain element of fantasy to them. No-one breaks into song in the real world for dramatic effect. Do they? So to judge a musical on the basis of historical accuracy or realistic ambiance is doing a fool's errand, and are just simply nit-picking. Most of these same people would also cheerfully give a 10 to any one of several 60's musicals with two people professing their love for each other in song against a painted backdrop. So, please. Give it up.Newsies was just simply released at the wrong time. Movie musicals were box office poison then.Newsies gets much more right than it gets wrong. The choreography was stunning in it's execution, given the complexity of the routines that were performed during the movie. Christian Bale turns in a most agreeable performance considering his age at the time this movie came out. The songs by Alan Menken were as engaging and catchy as they could be, given the historical material on which they were based. And that's probably what killed the movie upon it's release, ultimately. A dated premise. Disney took a big chance and rolled the dice, and lost. But perhaps what was bad timing then, might be good timing now.This movie is much better that most have led you to believe. And if you are willing to suspend disbelief and watch the movie on it's own terms, you are in for a treat. The movie has a lot of energy and is so earnest in its' message, it almost hurts. But is it good? Yeah. I think it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so Newsies is seriously the best movie ever. Honestly, Kenny Ortega was much more creative when he was younger and had a ponytail. Honestly! Newsies is far better than ANY HSM. The actors are all phenomenal. Each one a triple threat with his own specialties! It is amazing to think that numbers like King of New York were put together very last minute! I watched Newsies when I was younger and loved it! It was pretty historically accurate, but the singing and dancing made it interesting for an 8 year old to watch. When I got a bit older, I started to take more of a fancy for the actors. Not gonna lie, I had a bit of a crush on Max Casella until I realized that he was 23 years older than me! It got me into cool shows like Roundhouse and Doogie Howser. You realize these boys are amazing outside of just Newsies. Now, I love Newsies. It is an amazingly well put together movie that is pretty historically accurate. It is used in many theatre classes I have taken and in many history classes as well. I have written numerous papers on the Strike of 1899 and the war and child labour laws because the movie got me so into history!!! Every time I always learn more, and so many opportunities have opened for me because of Newsies. It is also a great family film, with enough highs and lows to keep you on the edge of your seat and still never get tired of this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When our family first heard of this movie we were a wee bit skeptic as it had been given such poor reviews by the critics but we gave it a go anyway and were pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the more family friendly and fun musicals that came out in the 90's! The young people in this flick did a great job and even (what looked like) slightly unpolished choreography and singing lent great charm to the picture and made it even more entertaining.Christian Bale was a delight as the "unwilling" leader of the Newsies and I still look on this film as one of his great performances.Our family watches this movie at least once a year and shares a place of honor alongside "Fiddler on the Roof", "Oklahoma" and "The Sound of Music"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Newsies did not bring back the musical film into wide favor, it certainly was a noble effort. In a way, it's director Kenny Ortega did accomplish it in another way. He's the creative genius behind Disney Productions incredible money making franchise, the High School Musical films which as I write another one is in the planning stage.You can certainly see no small resemblance in this production to either of the two High School Musical films. Leads Christian Bale and David Moscow do a great job as the two newspaper kids who lead a strike against all the 'Papes' as Joseph Pulitzer of the World tries to gouge the Newsies to increase his profits. Christian Bale is an absolute wonder to me. A kid born in Wales speaking like a native New Yorker back then and he'd still pass for one today. No surprise he's had the career he's had.Ann-Margret in case we all forgot is a great musical performer who plays an entertainer and friend of the Newsies. She gets a nice number just to remind us.Robert Duvall has a once in a lifetime part as the press lord Joseph Pulitzer. Back at the turn of the last century with no internet, no radio, no television those papers ruled. When I was a lad in New York there were still seven daily papers in the city. Back in Pulitzer's day there were about 20 all competing with each other and nothing else. Pulitzer is not a man who got where he was by exercising scruples and he's not about to give in to a gang of ragamuffin kids.The songs by Alan Menken fit well into the story though none of them became any kind of hit. And the atmosphere of 1900 New York City is captured well in the sets and costumes.1900 was a time my grandparents were children and I think they might have appreciated Newsies as good entertainment with a nice moral to it.What's the moral? The Newsies united will never be defeated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so my friend showed me the Newsies and I didn't like it at first until I saw it on TV and I made my parents get it for me for Christmas. I absolutely love that movie. All the songs and dances are amazing. Kenny Ortega is a great director and I think he was perfect for directing this movie because he has a history in dance and theater.I also think the actors are great. my 2 favorite actors have to be Aaron Lohr who plays Mush Meyers and Max Casella who plays Racetrack Higgins. I like Mush Meyers because he is sweet and he has a nice body but I think he is sensitive about what Jack and David are doing but then he gets into it and he is a strong person in the strike. I like Racetrack Higgins because he is so funny. Max Casella is the best guy to play Racetrack Higgins. Every movie I watch with Max Casella in it I laugh really hard, even if it isn't funny because I think of his part in Newsies. So enough about that I just want to say that I absolutely love Newsies and i think it is always going to be my favorite movie. Yes some people say I'm obsessed with the Newsies but who cares, I know I am. I know every line, word, song, and dance move. It is sad but I don't care. I'm proud of my obsession over the Newsies and I don'y care what people say. I'm really glad Kenny Ortega decided to make this movie a musical because I think it is one of the best movies I have ever seem and I think it's the greatest musical i have ever seem. Believe me I have seen just about all the musicals and I think it is one of the best yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie-musical directed by Kenny Ortega is a treasure. With wonderful songs that get stuck in your head (the kind you don't mind having stuck there), and numerous classic, funny, quotes, this is one that you can watch again &amp; again and never get tired of.One thing I would have to say that really stands out about this musical to me, is the incredible dancing. Not necessarily by the main cast (although if you take a moment to notice Aaron Lohr, who plays Mush, is INCREDIBLE), but the extra newsie dancers. They are incredibly skilled dancers &amp; performers. Often movie-musicals, get very downplayed in the aspect of dancing, meaning that the dancing, if any, is very slight and with possibly one big, choreographed dance. I commend Ortega, this musical is jam-packed with big, difficult dance moves &amp; routines. "Seize The Day", "The World Will Know" and especially "King of New York" have dances that leave you speechless.The best characters in this musical, are not the leads, though Christian Bale &amp; David Moscow were amazing, their characters don't have the catchy one-liners, and quirky, jump-out-at-ya personalities. The best characters are Spot Conlon, the leader of the Brooklyn newsies, and not to mention the most feared newsie in all of New York, played by Gabriel Damon, is roughly, dangerously charming &amp; witty. Racetrack Higgins is hysterical, and with by far the best accent of all. Crutchy is one character that makes you laugh, and you have a warm place in your heart &amp; a soft spot for him. Mush, Kid Blink, Medda &amp; Snipeshooter are a few of my other favorites.The 'villians' are perfection. Duval is awesome as usual playing Mr. Pulitzer. He plays up Pulitzer's quirky sense of meanness very well. I also loved Mr. Snyder, the warden. He was the character everyone LOVED to hate.The only bad part of this movie I see is the character of Sarah Jacobs. Towards the beginning, she is not the best actress, and she is unnecessary to the story. Although, the romance element is a nice touch, it seems to not fit well with the story. I do enjoy that she was the only girl out of all those guys though!Overall, I'd say this musical is one of my favorites, and always will be. I recommend it to anyone! It's great for families, adults, teens &amp; kids!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheese-tastic musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know many people look at this movie and think to themselves "Well, that's just another cheesy Disney musical for you." I also know many fans will stand up and immediately protest that statement. Me? Well, I think it is true. "Newsies" is without a doubt a cheesy Disney musical. However, who's to say that is necessarily a bad thing? Let's face it; we all need a bit of cheesiness every now and then.Is this a deep, thought-provoking movie? No.Is this a side-splitting comedy which will have you catching your breathe? No.Is this movie worth your while? I'd say yes.You see, "Newsies" is a wonderful display of how even children/teens can change the world. We see how the word "family" doesn't just mean blood-relatives, but all the people who care about you and protect you. The movie's cast, lead by Christian Bale, is a strong group of performers, many of whom sing, dance, and act. The music is your traditional Disney score, yet also different. I can assure at least King of New York will have you tapping your toe and bobbing your head.That isn't to say the film is without its faults. While the opening credits claim it is based on actual events, the term "loosely" comes to mind. Yes, there was a newsboy strike in 1899, but Disney did embellish a bit. While many of the supporting characters (i.e. Kid Blink, Racetrack Higgins, etc) were part of the real strike, the protagonist, Jack Kelly, was a made-up character. Also, the strike did not have the same outcome as the film. The newsboys did not get the price of the papers lowered as in the movie. What they did get was the ability to sell back unsold papers for a full refund.In addition, Disney tries to force a love story into the plot with the character of Sarah Jacobs (Jack's love interest). I am grateful that the film continues to center itself around the strike and doesn't use an historical event as a place to insert a love story (as is done in Titanic and Pearl Harbor), but the side plot still proves to be a bit awkward and sudden, not to mention Sarah is an uninteresting, one-dimensional character who serves no other purpose other than the hero's love interest.Despite these few flaws, "Newsies" is a wonderful, albeit cheesy, musical which is sure to amuse the entire family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musical's were never really my thing. I had seen Jesus Christ Superstar (1973) but that was about it. I was flipping through the channels and came upon this forgotten Disney film. Newsies: the word referring to the thousands of newsboys that littered the street of 1899 New York. But soon these boys weren't passing the news but protesting their pay cuts and harsh environment.The film is based on the actual events that took place just around the turn of the century. As the price is raised that newsies had to pay from their profits skyrocketed, a young man joins up with them. His name is David (David Moscow) and he has joined with a young orphan named Jack (Christian Bale). Soon the two are best friends but are soon earning next to nothing and David needs to support his parents. Meetings are called and the boroughs agree that something must be done.With a little help from a mysterious man named Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman) they are able to print a city wide bulletin calling on a strike. Standing against them is the king newspaper owner Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall) who has been unaware of their hardships and tries to resolve the matter quickly, but fails. As the film progresses, more fascinating and likable characters are presented and keeps it going. It's a musical with each character (minus Duvall) singing a song. The dance sequences are choreographed perfectly on the streets of New York. The character of Jack is brought out more as he goes and a sad and miserable past is revealed as the film progresses. I haven't watched many musicals as I said early but this entertained me like Disney usually does. It brings a sense of harsh life and really the explanation why worker unions were formed. Christian Bale is superb in acting and son and dance in this film. I don't much about this era but it has driven me to learn more about it. This is Disney in its glory days and it's ashame it didn't do better financially, it just wasn't a time of musicals. Newsies. Starring: Christian Bale, Bill Pullman, David Moscow, Robert Duvall, Max Casella, Marty Belafsky, and Luke Edwards.4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Newsies for the first time last winter (at the age of 22), and was hooked instantly! My friends had always told me, since I'm a theater and musical junkie, that I seemed like the kind of person who would have grown up watching this movie every day of my life! So they were always surprised when I told them I'd never seen Newsies.I saw it, and it was like I'd been watching it my whole life! I can't believe I'd never seen it! This is the epitome of movie musicals! And my 14-year-old self would have obviously been in love with Christian Bale as Jack Kelly and with Gabriel Damon as Spot Conlon had I seen this movie as a child! This movie musical has the music, the dance moves, and the boys to win anyone's heart...needless to say it won my heart easily. :) The choreography, for the most part, is really well done. I sometimes wish they had a wider camera angle on some of the group dancing shots so I could see more of it, but the boys are marvelous. Yes, the dancing is cheesy...(anyone will tell you that!)...but it's a musical. Of course it's cheesy! But it fits the music and gives each song it's own distinct energy. The songs inspire you to join their cause, feel their plight, or share their joys.This is truly a family movie, and yet it's not afraid to show the roughness of New York in 1899 for the orphans that work in the streets. It was a hard life, and though any musical (Newies included) will put a happy spin on troublesome times, this movie shows the bad with the good. It doesn't simply sugarcoat an historical event and put music to it. You laugh, you cry, you gasp, you sigh, you shake your fists in anger, you jump for joy - right along with the feelings of each character.As I said, a definite MUST SEE for any theater and musical junkie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I'm a fan of Newsies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what it is about this movie, but from the moment I first saw it in 1996 with my 4th grade class I've been in love with it. It is one of my favorites. While I may be biased a little since we also performed it that year as a class, I've always loved the songs and choreography. I played Racetrack, so he is naturally my favorite character. I also remember how made all the boys in my class were that I, a girl, got one of the lead parts. My favorite song would have to be "King of New York." I remember I was so nervous because it was like, my song to sing, and I was afraid of messing it up. I was also worried about the opening lines. I was the first actor the audience saw so I didn't want to go and mess up first. I can still remember almost all my lines from the play. I think that was some of my favorite times in elementary school, all those years ago, well, maybe only 9 years ago. I only wish I hadn't missed the pictures, but that's for me to understand. But it always showed me that you could step up and take action. I am always and forever a fan of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;giggles&gt;I've been reading the comments about this movie, and it's so funny how most of our titles are very similar "This movie is great!" "I love it!" "Great fun!" As funny as this is, we're not joking. This movie really IS great.When I first heard about this movie about 3 weeks ago from my friend, I was reluctant to see it. I mean, I love singing and dancing...but I wasn't sure about them together. There are some fabulous musicals like West Side Story which I adored, but I still wasn't what you would call a musical-lover. That all changed when I saw Newsies. Let me spell it out for you. This movie has everything the teenage girl is looking for (and even something for guys, too!): cute boys with accents, great choreography, excellent singing, a great cast of children and adults, and a wonderful message. In fact, I nearly started tearing up when I heard Christian Bale's beautiful voice crooning "Santa Fe". There are a few slow parts, I must admit, like the scenes with Pulitzer and his men, but those are few and far between. Most of the movie is filled to the brim with rousing, stand-up-and-cheer (um, I mean dance) action! :D Watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't believe a friend of mine that Newsies had developed a cult following of epic proportions. I didn't believe, that is, until I saw the mountain of recommendations from users here. Well let me say you are all deluding yourselves. I finally broke down and let him make me watch this. It is garbage. Not one believable emotion or likable character. The musical numbers fall flat after an almost-promising opening with Carrying the Banner. The wise-acre kids' act gets tiresome and the actors are all "lookit me i'm cute" in a bland, character-less sort of way. Christian Bale is servicable at best. Robert Duvall, Ann-Margaret, and Bill Pullman are all wasted. Pullman and Margaret act as if they know this movie is garbage and are hoping that their scenes will be recut and added to another period peice. Sorry Bill and Ann, they only make colossal bombs like this once or twice a decade so that footage will just have to be included into this overblown, completely stupid, musical. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I....love this movie! Quite a varied and extensive selection of eye candy (even for someone way too old for these hottie boys), terribly catchy and well orchestrated music, and a plot with a cause worth fighting for! The dancing is SO irresistible and...enticing? What can I say...group synchronized dancing boys and slow-mo walking guys are both my weaknesses.Okay, so I'm drooling...also, I love the authenticity of the costuming in the movies...they all have really cute dirty outfits and greasy hair...you see movies with girls in survival situations, yet with perfect hair. Not quite accurate. I find the grease and grime somewhat refreshing. Did I mention Christian Bale is so sexy? Forget him now, he was at his best as a teen. Yeah, I love this movie. The "weighted average" of imdb is completely unfair...most everyone gave this a 10, me included...it deserves at least an 8.5. If you need more persuasion than can be found in similar rave reviews, here's my advice: SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. Especially if you are female. You will enjoy it. I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sadly, it isn't a joke...because it is hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is atrocious. I know I am going against the grain of most of the reviewers here, but it seems that most of those who have taken the time to review this movie are either young women just entering puberty or people who have limited access to film in general, or never watch a movie rated above PG for religious reasons, or are cat-herders...There is nothing wrong with that, and it's great that people have found a movie they can get behind and enjoy. More power to them. Anyone else who actually goes out in public or has seen a real movie will laugh at this atrocity.People react to this movie the way they do another abomination, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, that is, since it looks like a good movie, and has talented stars in it, it MUST be good.Newsies has good cinematography, and the sets look realistic. So someone who has never seen a movie before would certainly be impressed, But that is all that is good about the movie.The accents are horrid, and drop in and out frequently. "Crutchy" is particularly irritating, but all the actors' accents are inconsistent.The musical productions are elaborate, and the orchestration is over-the-top; so again, someone with limited access to musicals (or music in general) might think it is good, but it isn't. The lyrics are contrived, and the performances lack drive and heart. Watch a movie like "Singing in the Rain" and note the difference.The fact that Jack Kelly yearns to move to Santa Fe, NM is also hilarious! Why Santa Fe? Why not Jackson Hole? Or St. Louis? Probably because Santa Fe is easier to rhyme.The story chosen is a curiosity, too. Who cares about the newsboy strike of 1899? It isn't even a blip in the history of American Labor, and it was over in a week.In one review, a fan wrote that this movie is so great it isn't surprising that it has generated more fans than any other movie in history. Really. Ever hear of "Star Wars"? Where are all the Newsies action figures? When is the next Newsies convention? Where is the sequel? Disney isn't stupid when it comes to merchandising, so where is the merchandise? They are lucky they got a cult following after showing it on their own network.All of that said, if you are a fan of bad movies, you should own this. I've seen it about ten times and will certainly watch it again, it is so funny. It is up there with "Battlefield:Earth" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space" in the pantheon of the bad.</fullReview>

Gabriel Damon as Spot Conlon is just brilliant, he has got to be my favorite newsie.

		<fullReview>I was only 3 years old when this movie came out, and didn't see it for the first time until about 5 years ago. I immediately fell in love with it. I'm 16 years old, and since I was so young when it came out, and it wasn't as successful as it should have been, very few of my friends had seen it. Every one of my friends that I have made watch Newsies have loved it too. I watch this movie all the time. I know all of the songs by heart, some of the dances, and basically every word of this movie. The music is some you can sing over and over again and never get sick of. All of the cast was very talented, especially considering many of them were under 20 when they made it. It is rather disappointing to see that most of them weren't very successful after this movie. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is in the new Batman Begins. I saw this movie just because he was in it, and his performance is far from disappointing. Kenny Ortega did a terrific job with directing and choreography in this film, and I wish it had been more successful. Everyone should see this movie, I guarantee you will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Newsies Conspiracy Theory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it initially failed at the box office, time has proved Newsies a classic. There have been many theories as to why the movie failed: people just don't like musicals, the movie was cheesy and/or awful, etc. But no one had yet come up with a conspiracy theory to explain the movie's box office failure....until now: http://tobymelt.blogspot.com/2005/05/newsies.html. Plus, through this link you can also sign the petition to bring Newsies to Broadway. If high school productions have been staged for years, then Broadway can surely manage it. Also let it be noted that Newsies was the first instance of Christian Bale's penchant for morphing himself to fit a role. All in all, Newsies is a fine place to have come from, and the extras on the DVD release are worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Newsies" captures the magic of musicals gone by: the choreography was absolutely superb, the plot entertaining, the lyrics and music memorable and catchy, and the casting excellent. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.I think a majority of people really like this movie. However, as you can see, it has a 5.6/10 "weighted" average. When you look up IMDb's definition of what it does to come up with that number, I find that the policy of "the exact methods we use will not be disclosed" as a disservice. To their credit, they do show the average mean and median, which are 8.0 and 9 respectively. I believe that these numbers more accurately show the movie's appeal.</fullReview>

Its a movie based on real life, and its shown in a very fun way! Jack Kelly leads the Newsies of New York on strike against the most important and powerful newspapers of New York. The warning I give is that it is very addicting. Most people who watch it once, watch it many times following it! I would recommend planning on purchasing the soundtrack with it as well after as you will probably catch yourself singing the songs after anyway.

		<fullReview>After several years of being familiar with this film, I finally broke down and rented it. I suppose I was pleasantly surprised. The movie had a better plot than I was expecting, and I was quite impressed with several of the song and dance numbers. However, even though I am a fan of musicals in general, I found this one to be a bit laughable at times. I think it was probably due both to the obvious orchestral lead-ins to the songs, as well as the over-the-top New YAWK accents. I also found that a few of the musical numbers were strangely placed in the fabric of the story.Besides those minor complaints, I found the movie satisfying and fun. The acting was surprisingly great from such a young cast, and I wish many of the actors had continued their acting careers after this movie. I felt that Christian Bale really shined in this film. I can honestly say I am still humming the songs.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Guilty Pleasures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I first saw this movie when I was ten years old. At that time, I thought it was the best thing in the world. I liked the songs, the dancing, and the story. I'm now twenty- something and I recently rented the DVD for old-time sake. I can't even begin to rate it numerically, because part of what makes the movie so good is that, in many ways, it is so very bad. For those that don't know how the Disney movie came to be, it was originally supposed to be a period drama. Disney had gotten Christian Bale for the lead and then inexplicably decided to to turn the movie into a musical. This was the dream project of the well-intentioned, but woefully inadequate, director Kenny Ortega. Bale apparently tried to pull out of the project when he heard it was to be a musical, but was convinced to stay, though he was told that he wasn't going to have to sing or dance. Obviously, Ortega worked on Bale a bit, because he certainly does sing and dance in the musical. The best thing the movie has going for it are the catchy, singable songs written by expert Disney songwriter Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Hercules).The historical premise of the film is interesting, but working against that interest are quite a few hard-to-get-by flaws. Firstly, though well researched, the script is weak and the direction unbelievably amateurish. Ortega is more frequently a choreographer than a director and he seems to have provided the actors in the film (many of whom are children) with little advice,no advice, or very bad advice. Robert Duvall's Pulitzer is particularly hard to fathom. Despite a few good moments, he is over the top for most of the film. In Duvall's defense, the sloppily scripted lines are particularly hard on his character. Most of the young performers playing the newsies fall victim to Oretga's unrealistic direction. There are several fight/dance scenes where scrawny young boys take down huge grown men, using the weakest blows imaginable. Bill Pullman is surprisingly appropriate as news reporter Denton and his singing voice works quite well in the context of the film. Ann Margaret is also good as Medda the Vaudeville performer. David Moscow, who hasn't had another role this big yet, holds his own and is a decent singer. Little Max Casella, who you'll remember most as Vinnie from Doogie Howser, MD., is thoroughly enjoyable, particularly in the musical numbers. Ele Keats who plays Moscow's sister and Bale's love interest is particularly horrid. Everything she does is unforgivably bland.Poor Christian Bale must have a bagful of mixed feelings about this one. He has admitted that the first time he viewed Newsies, he watched it with his hands over his eyes. It's not hard to understand why. His voice works well enough in the group numbers, as does his dancing, despite the messy choreography, but during his solo numbers (Santa Fe and the Santa Fe Reprise) he has a hard time holding it together and he looks like he'd rather be having dental surgery. One can also argue that Bale, who has been the best thing in so many films both before and after Newsies, gives his worst performance here. The Welsh actor is typically quite good at cultivating accents, but this one doesn't work and his acting is over the top. You get the sense that Ortega told him that everything in a musical has to be bigger than in a regular film. But even with these failings, Bale is still as easy to watch as ever. And to be fair, despite his so-so performance, the remarkable cult-success of this film is mostly do to fascination with Bale. The cult success of Newsies is nothing short of mind-boggling. The internet became a haven to Newsies fans and apparently even today, you can find many active online Newsies communities. The fans are diehard and the stories about their extreme devotion are comical. (one fan had his name legally changed to Jack Kelly, the name of Bale's character). Though it is a little hard to understand that level of devotion, it is impossible to deny that this Newsie-mania helped to make Bale one of the most popular actors on the internet.So should you see Newsies? Of course! It's funny as hell. As a tragically failed attempt to revive a misunderstood genre, Newsies is particularly interesting now that live-action musicals are trendy again. It's also amusing, and slightly painful, to see an actor like Bale so out of his element. And of course there are those catchy Menken songs. Also if you are at all interested in internet cult film phenomena, Newsies is definitely a must- see. Newsies is not a great film. It might not even be a good film, but it is a much- loved film and can be best appreciated when you sit down to watch it with the most minute of expectations.The DVD has some pretty decent extra features including behind the scenes featurettes, Newsie Slang, Sing-a-long subtitles, and a featurette on the story that the movie is based on. This is also a great film for families and children as there isn't any even slightly objectionable content in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw this movie for the first time, I had never heard of it before. I was flipping channels, and as a big fan of musicals, I decided to give it a try. I fell in love with it during the very first part, the amazing song Carrying the Banner. I was literally squirming in my seat, trying to keep myself from jumping up and singing, dancing, and flipping all over the house. As the movie progressed, I felt like I knew the characters. The young boys gave spectacular performances, especially Christian Bale. And every musical sequence completely blew me away. I couldn't believe how talented these boys were! From the deeply emotional songs "Santa Fe" and "The World Will Know" to the joyous, fun songs like "Seize the Day" and "The King of New York," the music genius of Alan Menken just astounds me. After the movie, I researched reviews from the critics only to find that they all absolutely hated it! I couldn't believe it. I usually agree with movie critics, but this was absolutely ridiculous. Don't always trust the critics, you may be missing out on the movie of a lifetime. This is one of the rare positive reviews given to Newsies, and I'm no famous movie critic, but don't let that fool you. See this movie and decide for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of the people who saw this movie in theaters when it first came out; I was 8 and loved it. One of my most vivid memories from when I was younger was being about 10 or 11 and singing "King of New York" in the car with my best friend. We used to watch this movie all the time, and I now own it on DVD. I used to get so excited when it would come on TV. It's one of those movies that you see and maybe forget about until you see it at the movie rental place or on TV.I recently saw it again and fell in love with it. I think I've watched it 10 times within the last week, at least. It's funny how my favorite song is now "Santa Fe" whereas it used to be "Seize the Day." Now I know who Ann-Margaret is, and I really understand the meanings behind the songs. The girl who commented on it being a movie teenage girls would love is right. Christian Bale is amazing. I knew he was a talented actor from "Reign of Fire." When I read the jacket and realized it was him in "Newsies" also, I was shell shocked. Hearing his singing abilities, mainly from "Santa Fe", and seeing his dancing abilities showed that he's is definitely a triple threat.There are a few slow parts, but if you enjoy music and dancing and a good plot, then "Newsies" is a definite must. It's a lot of fun and for an older audience than the Disney cartoons. It reminds me of the movies that Disney has been putting out lately, only you actually hear cuss words in this one. The fact that I like it as much as I did 10 years ago, when I was 8, shows that this movie works on different levels and can appeal to a wide variety. I would say check it out for yourself, though. A warning, though: Be prepared to like it more than you thought you would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but don't over-exaggerate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading quite a few of the other reviews shown on this website from people like myself, I would like to say a few things. I enjoyed this movie when I was a young kid and I have to say that I still enjoy it. The only difference is that now I have a more analytical view on this movie. I see that this movie has a very good plot for kids, which is the audience that it is aimed towards. The bad guy, I'm sure, is not the same as real life. I'm sure that he was not as heartless as he was made out in the movie. The story was also almost a perfect example of what Charles Altman calls a folk musical. For example, the main male character was a boy without a family or home, a wanderer. While the main female character, which is the main male character's love interest, is a women who has a home and family that she is not going to leave any time soon. I feel that Alan Menken, the same songwriter that wrote songs for the little mermaid and beauty and the beast, had worked his magic once again with the newsies. The songs that he wrote for the newsies were of better quality than his songs in the more popular movies. One thing that I felt could have been better was the main character's voices. After all though, what can you expect from a bunch of actors, they aren't singers. On the other hand, they did really surprise me with their dancing abilities. Although it is what they would have been doing back then, it kept the viewer's attention and interest, which after all is the goal of the movie. To conclude this long comment, I would like to say that this is a very good movie, one that I would and do recommend to my friends and family. Although this is not the best or most accurate movie that I have seen, this is only a Disney movie. So from Disney standards, I would have to say that this is a very good Disney movie that I would personally like to see more often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have already written one review, after reading all of the previous comments I feel I must write another. The people who write that this musical is garbage and has no right to be called a musical should be shot. I am an avid musical watcher and yes I have seen all the ones that were listed to see and I love them all. I'm not saying that Newsies should be on the same level as say West Side Story or My Fair Lady or Singing in the Rain ect but they are all different. I don't understand why you have to compare them. This is not supposed to be the run-of-the-mill let's bring you to tears musical. It's Disney for goodness sake! This musical is wonderful. The cast is great and the songs and dances are unique. The dances are not West Side Story but so what? Because they are modern they can't be called good?? Can't you people who degraded it just except a musical for what it is and not compare it to others. I don't understand how someone could call it trash. The actors must have worked so hard to get everything perfect and it is a shame that it wasn't more popular and it was poorly advertised but that is Disneys fault. Just watch this movie with a light heart and you can't help but love it. I have all the songs memorized and I could watch Mush and Kid Blink dance all day. I admit I have never seen a musical I didn't like but this one is one of my new favorites because it is so unique and the characters are so lovable.Girls can drool over Mush (Yes he is incredibly hot and man can he dance!) and the guys can enjoy the dancing and have fun with it. My brother hates musicals but he even liked this one just because it was about guys and not all the girly stuff. It's a fun lighthearted movie and I don't see why people have to put it down. It's hard enough to get people to watch musicals now a days when they havn't been around for a long time. I wish this one could have brought them back because it is wonderful and even if you don't like musicals you can at least appreciate a different kind of style and culture. I'm glad about 95% percent of people had good things to say about this movie cause it deserves it after all it's been through. For you 5% please just leave the bad comments to yourself and don't dissuade people from watching it. You never know... the more people we can get to watch it and love it may go watch other musicals and be as hooked as we are on those lovable singing and dancing movies. Then maybe one day the big movie corporations may finally start doing them again if they realize people want them back. People that don't like musicals may like this one. So please don't ruin a great fun and lovable musical with your nasty and degrading comments. Thank you Samantha</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay well what can someone possibly say about the best movie every. Except just that. I cant even remember how old i was when i first saw Newsies. All i know is i have been the biggest fan since i can remember. When i was younger and the movie first came out my friends and I were obsessed with this movie. We learned ALL the lyrics to every song and watched it whenever we could get a chance. Newsies has a great plot and you never get tired of listing to the music. Not to mention Jack Kelly played by Christian Bale is so Hot and what girl wouldnt fall for that accent? I could watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. If you have not seen this movie before i recommend that you rent it fast because you are missing out.</fullReview>

His voice brings a tear to my eyes. (Awwww)Newsies is a based on actual events and tells a story of truth and justice - with a few song and dance numbers thrown in. Very enjoyable,on a scale of one to ten, i give it an eleven.Thanks!-Kate</fullReview>

'Newsies' makes you feel good and want to have a cause of your own to fight for. You can watch it over and over again without getting sick of it. Plus, Christian Bale is pretty cute.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can still remember when I first saw this film at the theater, I was only eight and it totally blew me away. From the opening number to the big finally it held this little kids attention.At that moment Christian Bale became my favorite actor and new hero.His New Yorker accent was so convincing I could have sworn he was born and raised in Brooklyn;gosh,was I surprised when I saw him on the Disney Channal talking his native English toung.This movie holds special significants to me because of the music.The song "Santa Fe" was the first time I ever understood song lyrics.Along with the words and Christians heart felt singing about the home he dreamed of it brought tears to my eyes.The cast was the other half of the film that made it so wonderful!From the acting vets,like Ann Margrat and Robert Duvall tothe newcomers like Aaron Lohr and Luck Edwards it makes this movie a must see. How people could not like this film is beyond me,but then again I am still just a kid.Keep "Carring the Banner" and see this Disney Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this show from the first time i watched it. This show gives people a hope nd strength that we (kids) can stand up for what we believe is right and we won't back down. I love Christian Bale in this film because he did so well with his acting. You could tell that all the kids in the film wanted to be there and they put in a lot of work to make this film. Watching hot guys dance and sing and ride horses just makes me happy i guess cause this movie had all that plus more. I cried and laughed and even got so into it that i was really angry at some of the actors and would yell at them to shut up or not to do a certain something etc... I recommend this film to everyone. I think that anyone can enjoy it because it has stuff for all types of people. It has good morals and is a fun film that does so much for people.</fullReview>

I cannot believe the actors, however untalented they are, would stoop as low as this movie.Furthermore fans of this movie tend to be addled in the mind,follow severe cult like practices,and generally annoy people to tears with their misguided idolization...

		<fullReview>Are you in the mood for a Friday night classic movie? If you are, then "The Newsies" may be the movie for you. If you're an idiot! Personally, I think that the movie was rated appropriately low. The movie's plot is about nine and ten year old boys why deliver papers, but when Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall) raises the price of the "Papes," the boys go on strike. They get boys involved from other places around New York City. They all come together in the movie and win. In real life, though, the boys really lost the strike. "The Newsies" has a lot of singing and dancing. So, if you are not the musical type, do not watch this movie. The songs are not tunes you hear every day, but they are some you will want to hear again. The dancing is okay for a bunch of teenage boys dancing in vests. I think that the dancing could have been more with the songs and not so choreographed. There were two good dance scenes, that both involved Ann- Margret, the dancer. Ann- Margret did an excellent job at captivating the viewer with her great dancing and her electric personality. The actors are some you may not have heard of, but they did a fair job for the experience they have had. The actors "acted" too much. They tried to do too good of a job so it appeared boring, pointless, and fake. When the writers and directors say that it's a true story, you can believe part of what they say. Some of the events are true, like the "newsies" went on strike, formed their own paper and more, but like I said they did not win the strike in real life. It was just part of the story to make it like you want movies to be, "the fairy tale ending." And they gave you that. I would give this movie a 2 ? out of 5 stars. Most of the acting and dancing scenes aren't worth watching again. Though the actors as themselves might get your attention, (ladies, you probably know where I am going with that). If you haven't seen it and you like movies about partially real things and history, you might want to watch this film. Overall, however, I would not watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Warning (?): I mention things from the film here, they might be important to film, but i don't think so. Here's the short version of what's bellow: If you want to watch a musical, I recommend anything over this, you name it.i saw this movie a while ago when i was 11-ish and i remember hating it. It was on tv the other night and, since MST3K has given me a passion for the worst movies, i sat down to view it with my dad. The opening shot is of all the "newsies" seemingly living in a dorm or youth hostel or something. After that i knew i was in for some awesome riffing. I think Duvall was doing someone a favor for wearing that gigantic bush of steal wool on his face. And why were the kids on strike destroying the other "scab newsies" papers. Pulitzer already had their money, so they were, in effect, hurting themselves. The payps (i guess that would be how you would spell it) were worth more intact. Maybe it was supposed to scare them into "striking." The "striking", the so-called plot of the movie, didn't work in real life when it happened. First off, it helps that the strikers actually work for the company they're striking against. What they did was a poor excuse for a boycott. The last of my many bones to pick is "How does the kid from 'Big' support his family so well on the change he makes from selling papers?" They live a great looking apartment for a no-to-low income family circa 1900. Oh, and why did the really small kid have a British accent? Come to think of it, that whole family had accent issues. It seemed like kids came from different countries than the parents. There were a few catchy lines in the songs and some nice dance moves, but they couldn't save it. Cult followings are meant for really good unknown movies (such as Carnival of Souls) or really bad unknown movies (Manos: Hands of Fate or Plan 9). Everyone here that says this movie is great, please broaden you view of musicals. There are many many great musicals out there that have everything over this heap. By the way, me and my dad had a blast riffing this movie a new one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your time! Who is the mental genius that came up with this one? Based on New York's paper boy strike just prior to the turn of the century, the filmmakers pretty up the squalor these boys lived in and make it seem fun and cheery. Although, it is a Disney effort so what else can be expected? As lame as this film was (and why Robert Duvall chose to stick his name on it eludes me) the music has its moments. Alan Menken, better known for his work in "The Little Mermaid, "Aladdin, and the Oscar winning "Beauty and the Beast", does some good work here. But I can't recommend this, even for young children. The only part worth checking out can be found on the CD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm really sorry. All I can say is, I feel bad for poor Christian Bale. He's a wonderful actor...so how he ended up in this saccharine goo filled bucket of a movie is beyond me. I mean, if I had never seen a musical film before, then seeing this movie would put me off the genre permanently. I feel bad for bashing it when so many people seem to love it, (for some strange reason) but honestly! Actually, I do remember having a good time watching it...but that was only because it was so awful, it was amusing.While watching it, I think I felt very awkward for everyone in it, especially Christian Bale. (What was he THINKING?! He and Anne Margaret are probably the film's only redeeming features, I'm sorry.) I mean, just -watch- the thing! Don't get me wrong - I enjoy a good, uplifting musical just as much as anyone else. But I said a -good- musical. Not a shamefully contrived musical based on exploitation of child labour at the turn of the century that never should have been made in the first place. Normally I tend to disagree with the critics too, but in this case I think they have a point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Newsies was an interesting movie about the newspaper strike back in 1899. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen though. Newsies was very predictable such as when the main character Jack Kelly (Christian Bale) said his parents were coming back for him once they settled in Santa Fe. It was completely obvious that it wasn't going to have a fairytale ending. It was also predictable that Kelly was going to fall in love with David Jacobs (David Moscow) sister. The dance numbers were well developed by choreographers Peggy Holmes and Kenny Ortega. These dances went well with the songs and lyrics in this movie. The acting was mediocre at best. It shows that the casting director did not do a good job in choosing good actors, only good dancers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Newsies. Is a film you do not want to see. A reason why i felt that way about the movie was because the horrible accents that the boys used were very phony. This movie should not have a rating of one star. It was not very interesting. For this movie to be another Disney movie, i was surprised. They had no attention grabbers for the young kids. The movies plot was not thought out very well; if you did not concentrate on the movie the whole time you would get lost just looking at the film. The scene where jack was let off of his prison time by working for the head newspaper man was not very realistic. More of the scenes where they went on strike were not the best acting. For example when jack and the other Newsies tried to fight the cops. I think that this movie had a lot of bad actors and actresses. The movie seems like it had a budget on the way that the scenes looked cheap. The movie was very corny and badly written. I think that no one should go and waste a dime on this movie; it is not worth it. i suggest that if you see this movie on a movie stand, run past it as fast as you can. Disney was not thinking clearly about this movie production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely, positively HATE almost every musical in existence (save for Bob Fosse's), because people do not SING their way through life. The whole concept of breaking into song during life's biggest crises is one that has never registered in my brain as legit, and this is also why I don't like opera. "Newsies" is a film which demonstrates the absurdity of most musicals, what with picketers breaking into song and dance routines in between getting beat up by the corporate thugs. Come on! What's next: "Hoffa, the Musical?" I can see it now: Nicholson as Hoffa, singing "I don't know how to KILL him" (same tune as "I don't know how to love him from JCS, another pathetic musical).If you don't hate musicals like I do, you'll enjoy this film and the story it tells, but it would have done much better as a dramatic piece.</fullReview>
