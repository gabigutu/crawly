		<shortDescription>A transcendent, nostalgic, pervasively hilarious experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for the right time to review this film. I did not feel until today that I was truly ready to say all I had to say about director Rob Reiner's unforgettable staple of 1980s pop culture. When I first saw The Princess Bride, I was only 7 years old, and hardly cognizant of film as anything but a pastime. While I remember the movie as being enjoyable, I did not have anywhere near as strong a liking or appreciation for it as I do now. I certainly did not remember the film as a theater-going experience, and recently, I got the chance to view it, on the big screen, with at least fifty others in attendance at a midnight screening.Personally, I am one of those people who, by nature, absorbs memorable quotes, and by that token, the entirety of The Princess Bride is fair game. As I sat there watching, I could always hear somebody, if not more than one person, at least whispering along with the movie under his or her breath. Meanwhile, I noticed that there was a wide disparity of age groups. There were pre-teens, teens, people in their twenties, thirties, and some that looked well past forty. If the showing had not been at midnight, I do not doubt that there would have been pre-pre-teens as well.With a screenplay written by William Goldman (based on his book), The Princess Bride is a classic, familiar story of a princess, her true love, and the forces that come between them. As is evidenced by those in attendance, this is a story for all ages. The manner in which this fairytale part of the story is executed by Goldman and Reiner is memorable enough to make this a great film. As any fan of the movie will tell you, however, it is the film's whimsical, irreverent, pervasive tongue-in-cheek antics that make it an unqualified masterpiece.If you hang around people who love this film, do not be surprised if they react to unbelievable situations with the exclamation, "Inconceivable!" Likewise, if you tell them to just wait a minute, don't be thrown aback when they suddenly sport a Spanish accent in saying, "I hate waiting." And if you suddenly, from out of nowhere, hear, "Hello.my name is Inigo Montoya.you killed my father.prepare to die," don't worry. It's not your fault, and you're not going to die.While The Princess Bride has the sort of satirical edge more geared towards adults, the film is equally effective as a pure fairytale, and for this reason, there is a little something for everyone. In addition, the film enacts a self-referential tribute to the power and beauty of fairytale stories, even in the current age in which many consider them archaic and obsolete.A sick grandson (Fred Savage), who is spending his time mindlessly playing video games (of the nostalgic Atari 8-bit type), gets a visit from his grandfather (portrayed through a wonderful performance from Peter Falk). To the grandson's dismay, his elder has brought a book to read to him. When he expresses disapproval at his grandfather's old-fashioned ways, the grandfather's response is, "When I was your age, television was called books." Even this quote stands out as resonant and memorable.The grandson starts out expressing skepticism and boredom, but of course, as the reading of the story progresses, this gradually gives way to captivation and praise. Buttercup (Robin Wright, in her breakthrough role) is a fair-haired, stunningly gorgeous maiden who has been engaged to the smug, cowardly Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), the prince who rules over the land of Florin. She of course does not love him, and she has been without joy since her true love, a farm boy named Wesley (Cary Elwes), was reportedly murdered on the seas.Of course, without Wesley, there is no story of true love, and we know that he must miraculously return to her someday. This happens through an extraordinary, and increasingly hilarious, set of circumstances. A group of three bandits kidnap Buttercup with the intent of killing her to precipitate a war between Florin and its enemy, Guilder. These three are (in order of increasing stature) the intellectually pompous Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the Spanish swordsman Inigo (Mandy Patinkin), and the big-hearted slow-witted giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant, in one of the most no-brainer casting decisions in all of film history).During the kidnapping, however, a mysterious man in black closes in on the trail of the three abductors, and it is this man who takes on each of the three one by one in battles of skill, strength, smarts, and of course, deliciously witty repartee. There is something unusually extraordinary about these battles, however.With the exception of Vezzini, the abductors are not villains as we might initially perceive them to be. The marvelously choreographed swordplay between the man in black and Inigo, and the hilarious absurdity of the handfight with Fezzik, are not at all about winning or losing. They embody a sense of honor, sportsmanship, and nobility that is rarely exemplified in competition (both fictional and real).Inigo, Fezzik, and the man in black do not display their skills pretentiously or flauntingly. Instead, they take a strong sense of inner pride in the subtle mastery of their arts. As a result, when we see them engage in competition, there is not a sense of enmity, but a wonderful air of camaraderie.Also included in the mix are a sadistic count (Christopher Guest) with an odd physical characteristic and a penchant for pain, an albino (Mel Smith) with a stuffy throat, the deadly wrath of an R.O.U.S., and a clergyman (Peter Cook) who makes Elmer Fudd seem eloquently spoken. Most memorable, perhaps, is the appearance of Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as the miracle-man Max and his wife. It has been reported that in the middle of filming this scene, Reiner was forced to leave the set, because Crystal's improvisations were causing him to laugh to the point of being sick.Regarding the film's casting, every single choice, without exception, is absolute perfection. Cary Elwes not only easily looks the part of a daring, ingenious hero, but as an actor, he has an incredible gift for a subtle mixture of drama and comedy, one that easily coincides with the film's sensibilities. Robin Wright easily essays the role of the headstrong princess, endlessly devoted to her love (with a convincing British accent, despite her American origins).For the scene of swordplay, Elwes and Patinkin had to study fencing for months, which is impressive, but on-screen, I had no trouble believing that they were characters who had studied for at least several years. Despite his limited acting ability, wrestler Andre the Giant is perfect for the role of Fezzik, and something would be lost with any other actor in his place. And of course, Wallace Shawn is endlessly amusing to watch as the diminutive, perpetually exasperated Vezzini.We also don't have to hear Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon speak any lines to know they are portraying villains. The arrogance, callousness, and sliminess are readily apparent in their facial and bodily expressions.When all is said and done, we have witnessed a wide variety of hilarity, captivating acts of love and heroism, and of course, one of the most satisfying acts of retribution ever put on film (one that immortalizes the film's most famous quote and chooses just the right time and placement for the film's sole swear word).For someone who watches this film for the first time, and quickly catches on to the film's capricious mix of reverence and satire, the film is a marvel to watch simply for the knowledge that you do not know what will come next. Will there be a touching moment? A reflective one? An act of bravado? Or will our expectations be subverted in an act of comical subterfuge? The answer: any of them will do, as the film has a delectable variety of all of them.From start to finish, The Princess Bride is a transcendent, magical experience that constantly elicits uproarious laughter and simultaneously immerses the audience in a rich, magnificent, and almost nostalgic world of folklore that, after the end credits roll, seems timeless and undying. In the years since its release in 1987, it has grown into a cult film of legendary status, and judging by the wide variety of ages I witnessed at the screening (as well as the endless barrage of quoting), it seems perfectly reasonable to assume that the film will endure for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's enough reviews here to show how enjoyable and entertaining this movie is, but I had to put my own word in...I simply love this movie. I watched it with my parents when I was very young, and have been watching it constantly ever since. It's a movie that I just can't seem to grow tired of. For one, I absolutely love the medieval fantasy genre, both in books and movies. From a small child I've loved knights, castles, dragons. the whole sort. This movie, quite simply, puts the viewer into an imaginative world where everything seems real. Second, the characters are so enjoyable to watch, you really begin to feel for them - all of them. Even humperdink, whose name does him justice, gets pity at the end. Lastly, the grandfather's list of the qualities of the book at the very beginning are all true... this story has everything. That is why it is such a classic, when everything comes down to it. From the moving love story between Wesly and Buttercup, to the dynamic and brilliantly scripted duel between the Man in Black and Indigo, to even the hilarious bickering from Vezinni to his lovable giant, Fezzik... This movie finds a place to include EVERYTHING one can imagine. The story moves along at a great pace, and you feel as though the whole land has been covered when the book is closed. Furthermore, the whole conception of using the "telling a story" approach doesn't taken away from the realism of the story, but raises it even more by showing how mesmerized the boy is, listening to the tale - just as we are, in front of the screen.Maybe it was how I was captivated to the screen, watching it as a child... Maybe it was how I'd pop the movie in and turn a boring Sunday afternoon an exciting adventure as I grew up... Or maybe it's how I can sit down with friends and all enjoy the movie together, laughing at its funny parts, and cheering at it's exciting moments. The movie has a place in my heart, and that will never go away. A "10" on the scale, and even these words, can't begin to tell how much I love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it. With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.The plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases- many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie. If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.I have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my 'sick day' movie because it is such a joy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great adventure film in somewhat the same style as other great fantasy adventures like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride takes us on a wonderful trip along with fascinating and enormously amusing c</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film. Or, at the very least, I just can't pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it. Indeed, it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan (okay, MALE action adventure fan), but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film. It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously (at the risk of sounding shallow) girly name, because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence. Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy? Absolutely! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel, but the film is truly great from start to finish. And, indeed, the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves, and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage's initial response to his grandfather reading him the story. But as the film goes on, we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has. We can't get enough. Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley, the love-struck servant to Buttercup, a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world. Sadly, Elwes' later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well, especially after such a stunning performance in this role. Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind. Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup, but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief (it was nearly nonstop from start to finish) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film. It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films. Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini, the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out, Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini's enormous, idiot sidekick, and by far my favorite of all, Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s (`My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!'). This is great stuff. Told as a story read from a book, just like The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages. The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the most enjoyable films ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As you wish..." "Inconceivable!" "My name is Inigo Montoya..."I love this film so much.From its opening scenes of the young boy being read a story by his kindly Grandfather to the romance, action, adventure and fun of the fairy tale. The Princess bride tells the tale of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her true love Westley (Elwes)who become separated through the course of an unfortunate event involving some pirates. Westley's destiny is to rescue Buttercup from the clutches of an evil Prince so that they might be together again. Yet he's not bargained on some of the wonderful characters that he will meet (and befriend) along the way...This film is so deliciously acted, made and written that it is a treat to watch.I've lost count of how many times I've seen it now. But every time I still gain the same enormous amount of pleasure from watching it. A movie that is a delight for the young and just as much fun for everyone else.The actors are all superb in their roles ('perfect casting' does not come close to describing it!) A young Cary Elwes is suitably dashing as our cocky hero (check out the sword fighting!)and Robin Wright is good as the beautiful Buttercup. Mandy Patinkin is great as the vengeful Inigo Montoya who utters that famous "you killed my father. prepare to die" line. Everyone else gives there all, including Christoper Guest, Chris Sarandon (as the main villian), Wallace Shawn, the late Andre The Giant,Mel Smith, and Billy Crystal.Even though it is about 18 years old, the humour and sly jokes are still as sharp today as they were back in 1987.You know you are watching a great movie when you here Elwes' "To the pain..." speech near the end. You've probably seen The Princess Bride. If so...go and watch it again. Right now, and remind yourself how good it is! And if you haven't- what are you waiting for? Go and check it out now! It's worth it! Hands up who can quote this entire film off by heart! ;)Watch out for:The R.O.U.S's Elwes' and Patinkin's Sword/word fight The Miracle Max scene When our heroes storm the castle (Go Inigo! Go Inigo!) Elwes' "To the pain..." speech. (Superb. Shows what a great (and unfortunately underused) actor he is)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic fantasy for all to enjoy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a wonderful family film about a maiden named Buttercup and her "farmboy" Wesley. When Wesley goes away to seek his fortune, he is reported to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hearing this really gets Buttercup down, and it only gets worse when Prince Humperdink chooses her to be his bride.( Hence the title) To make a long story short and not give away the ending, Buttercup's kidnapped for suspicious reasons and rescued by someone familiar. She's in love and nothing can stop true love! A couple of deaths, a would be wedding, revenge fulfilled, and a couple reunited end this gala of a film. But this doesn't even sum it up, I promise! I love this film because it does not take itself too seriously and flows well across the screen. The main characters and their supporting cast are quirky and memorable. You will be repeating classic lines like, "My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!" over and over again. Through the adventures of Wesley and Buttercup you feel drawn to the characters and fall in love with their ability to amuse you. Do you want to be entertained with a light hearted fantasy/comedy? Then head on over to your local video store and pick up a copy. Ready to enjoy? "As you wish."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satiric comedy with humor and sadness, dark with the light.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an intelligent, sardonic send up of several genres that pokes fun (affectionately)&nbsp;at fairy tales, swashbucklers, love stories and basic conventions of film. One of my favorite scenes is where Inigo Montoya first confronts his quarry after years of searching. His adversary does the unexpected-and what most villains in real life WOULD do under the same circumstances, with hilarious results in the scene. Basil Rathbone probably whirled in his grave!Not by any means Citizen Kane (we already have one of those, anyway) but a champ in its weight class, with a perfect score, a fine script and good performances. Far more true to the flavor of the original fairy tales that it spoofs than even the best of Disney's takes. I loved it the first time I saw it and love it more now. Well worth watching. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Robin Wright Penn star in this classic fairy tale entitled The Princess Bride. It is based on a novel by William Goldman, who also wrote the screenplay. Director Rob Reiner brings life to this story and effectively evokes the enchanting spirit of the witty 1973 novel.The movie opens with a sick boy (Fred Savage) who receives a visit from his grandfather (Peter Falk) who intends to read to him from his favorite book. The boy is not exactly pleased to be distracted from his world of video games. However, his mood quickly changes as he and the viewer are transported to a place out of time. We are taken to Florin, a kingdom in an imaginary land, complete with dashing heroes, cowardly princes, rhyming giants, rodents of unusual size, fancy swordfights, and yes . . . even some kissing.This fairy tale begins on a farm in the countryside. There lives a beautiful, young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) who learns that "as you wish" really means "I love you" when she falls for her farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes). While trying to seek his fortune, Westley disappears at sea and becomes an apparent victim of the Dread Pirate Roberts. A few years later, Buttercup, who is now engaged to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), is kidnapped by a trio of misfits, which includes brains--Vizzini (Wallace Shawn); brawn--Fezzik (André the Giant); and sword--Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). As they sail away toward the Cliffs of Insanity, they notice the pursuit of a man in black. Now begins the adventure . . . .The central idea of The Princess Bride is that true love can conquer all. Throughout the movie, there are many hardships and trials that true love must endure. The movie keeps the viewer guessing until the very end whether or not there will be the classic fairy tale ending.This movie is appealing to me because of the classic fairy tale style combined with the witty humor, well choreographed action sequences, and intense instances of suspense. The characters are well developed and all the actors give an amazing performance which adds to the overall appeal of the movie. The Princess Bride is easily one of my all time favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic and funny fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! It's sweet, but with satirical humor. The dialogue is great and the adventure scenes are fun. Rob Reiner shows an excellent touch once again with comedy and a childlike point of view. It manages to be whimsical romantic while laughing at the conventions of the fairy tale genre. I would recommend it to just about anyone. I've seen it several times, and I'm always happy to see it again whenever I have a friend who hasn't seen it yet. I haven't watched it with any kids, but I think it has lots for them too. There are wonderful quotes throughout. I think Mandy Patinkin absolutely steals the scenes he is in as the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, bent on avenging his father's death. I gave it 8 out of 10 mainly because it feels very light, but I may go back and change to 9 thinking of how happy this movie makes me and it's rewatchability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is one of those rare, but very perfect films that everyone once in their life time has seen. Just because it is such a loved film, how could you not love it? It has action, romance, revenge, sword fights, true love, humor, friendship, etc. I was only 2 when this film was released, but I still remember how much I was in love with this film at 4. I would rewind the tape and watch it over and over again, the funny thing was my parents wouldn't mind watching it with me, it appeals to children as well as adults. I think the reason why this was such a fantastic film was due to the fact that it was the perfect mixture of a fairy tale with humor, action, and romance. Rob Reiner really knew what he was doing when he made this movie; and it all starts with a grandfather simply reading his favorite childhood story to his sick grandson.Buttercup and Wesley are two farm people who eventually fall deeply in love, but in order to get money to get married, Wesley goes off to find a job and start a life for them. But when Buttercup hears of Wesley's death by pirates, she is taken away by Prince Humperdinck who is about to make her his bride. She is then kidnapped by three rebels who wish to start a war with the prince, Vizzini, Fezzik, and Indigo Montoya(who is on a revenge streak to kill the six fingered man who killed his father). But she is saved by an unknown pirate who later reveals himself as Wesley who escaped death, but Buttercup is taken once again right as she and Wesley are reunited by Prince Humperdinck. The prince orders to torture Wesley and kill him to keep him away from Buttercup, but Wesley ends up being saved by Fezzik and Indigo who will help him save Buttercup.The Princess Bride is a classic film that will never be forgotten. It has classic lines like: Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father prepare to die. And of course INCONCEIVABLE repeated constantly by Vizzini. The acting is perfect and the sets are just amazing. Of course who could forget Billy Cristal and Carol Cane's great performance of the miracle worker and his wife? They were just priceless. Please watch this movie, it's one of those movies that's just impossible not to like, why not to like it would be inconceivable.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them. Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm. Every character is a delight and you just want to see more of them. "The Princess Bride" is based on the unsurpassed novel by William Goldman, who also penned the screenplay. While this is a movie review, I cannot recommend the book on which it is based more highly. It is quite simply the most humorous, enthralling fable ever written and will fill in many details that were impossible to include on the screen. The only other movie of this type that I can think of that is this much fun was Danny Kaye's "The Court Jester," another costumed comedy/adventure/romance that I also highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not recommend it to somebody who didn't watch it 20 years ago!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fantasy genre hardcore fan since I was a child. Whether it is a book or a movie, I have always given it a try and guess what! I have enjoyed most of them but not this one, sorry fans! Having heard all the praise and seen the high ratings and recommendations, I finally rented it and finished the chore of watching it a couple of hours ago. I almost never stop watching a movie, no matter how awful it is and kept watching this one because I was looking for something more, something close to its 8.1 rating (which should have 1.8!). I understand many people who still love it, have memories and nostalgic childhood feelings for it but I still believe there were more 80s movies in fantasy genre which had better story, better acting, better dialogues and better visual effects!!! This film is about a girl named Buttercup (seriously?) who is deeply in love with a Westly! farm boy (which could have been much better if their love was pictured more than " as you wish" means "I love you" and a kiss!). Then the boy is gone and the girl is becoming the princess bride by getting engaged to an evil prince who plans to kill her so put the blame on enemy and people get mad because they love their buttercup (again why do they love her? do they personally know her? was she specially kind to them? or maybe because their daughters were saved by this marriage) and attack the land of enemy. There are some zorro-ish sword fight in between, a very not funny kidnapper and some of the worst and most nonsense dialogues I have ever heard in a movie. Oh, I forgot the rat which was like one of those Halloween costumes that kids wear. I'm sure they acted like a better rat if they were put on their all fours and auditioned for the part! Anyway, I do not recommend it to any one who is impressed by all the love for this film. Those who love it will always love it so they'd better watch it together but do not include their kids or adults who they think will certainly love it. No please don't do that to them. I confess I wanted to express my views on the message board but i knew I'd be murdered so I wrote my review and gave it 5 stars (though it deserves much less) because I myself am a very nostalgic person and live with my memories so 5 stars to all those who have kept this movie alive but gonna show mercy on the others!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal favorite, but mediocre. The whole greater than the sum of its parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the glaring flaws you will find in this movie. It remains one of my favorite ones to watch for a number of reasons.1) It has EVERYTHING! Action, comedy, drama, suspense, revenge, fairy- tales, heroes, villains, pirates, giants, miracle men, even rodents of unusual size. There is a reason it is always among the list of Best Movies, Funniest Movies, and Best Love Stories of All Time. 2) The CAST. Hard to name a more fitting princess than the beautiful Robin Wright, Cary Elwes can sweep you off your feet as a farmboy or a masked man, Mandy Patinkin delivers the most memorable quote of his career, and the rest of the ensemble transport you into their magical world.3) It has ROBIN WRIGHT in it! Did I say that already?4) It brings out the KID in me and the nostalgia of those days. If only for two hours you can go to a distant land and be on an adventure and feel positive and young again. 5) It has plenty of MEMORABLE LINES and scenes. SOME MISSES: - SPECIAL EFFECTS are pretty lame, even by 80's standards (the rodents could not have been more fake and some of the props are sub-standard) - STORY: Predictable and full of clichés - SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: While there are numerous memorable lines, they are repeated too frequently throughout the course of the movie. The script was simplistic. And to be objective, not too funny for most adults. - ACTING: There isn't much depth to any of the characters but the script didn't give the actors much to work with, for starters. Younger audiences may not notice it, but older ones may cringe in some scenes - CHEESE FACTOR: oh boy, it has plenty. It openly deals with "True Love" in a fantasy environment so it's pretty much set-up for sappy-ness.FOR: - People who still have their inner child intact somewhere - Family movie night - Slumber Party with the girls - Reminiscing with others who have seen this movie as a kidNOT FOR: - Kids who are too young (who might get scared by giant rats, some fighting, torture, talk of killing, and kissing scenes) - People who take themselves too seriously or are jaded cynics - Grown-ups who will be seeing this for the first time and have been misled by the high ratingsBOTTOM LINE: Cheesy Mac &amp; Cheese with bacon bits. My favorite food ever since I was a kid. It was yummy then and still yummy now and I don't have to explain why I love it, I just do. If only for the fact that I've carried my love for this movie since childhood, my sentimental attachment to it would give it a 10/10.But then my Mac &amp; Cheese, no matter how yummy, is never gonna get 3 Michelin stars next to a dish with fancy truffles. As a MOVIE, stripped of my nostalgia, this one is mediocre at best. There are more imaginative fantasy movies, funnier comedies, more romantic love stories, and more exciting adventures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very rarely like to put 10/10 for a rating of something as I feel nothing is perfect. However, this movie i feel is so close to that 10/10 it would be wrong not to award it this. Although it may not be the greatest movie ever made, it is brilliant in its own right. The characters are humorous, the dialogue is witty and the cast is brilliant. It contains so many different elements which also make it a really good family film. Action, adventure, sword-fighting, pirates, romance, comedy and fantasy. It captures all the elements I could Whilst I still stand by the fact that the book is better, this is still my favourite film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best fairy tales ever put on film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of the best fairy tales ever in my opinion. The movie takes place in a sick child's (played by Fred Savage) home when his grandfather (played by Peter Falk) walks into his bedroom to read a story called The Princess Bride to him. When the grandfather is reading the story the movie is set in a farming area with the two main characters Buttercup (played by Robin Wright) and Westley (played by Cary Elwes) until Westley leaves and Buttercup finds out that he is supposedly dead and says that she will never fall in love again, until she gets engaged to a nasty prince named Humperdinck (played by Chris Sarandon) , then she gets kidnapped and held against her will by 3 men named Vizzini (played by Wallace Shawn), Inigo Montoya (played by Mandy Patinkin), and Fezzik (played by Andre the Giant) until Westley comes along and saves the princess under another identity. And then Prince Humperdinck and his men try to save the princess when she has already been saved but without even realizing and Westley is about to get killed by a little dwarf who calls himself the albino (played by Mel Smith), along with Count Tyrone Rugen (played by Christopher Guest) who killed Inigo's father 20 years earlier also known as the man with six fingers. then Westley is brought back to life by Miracle Max (played by an almost unrecognizable Billy Crystal) and his wife (played by Carol Kane). Then after Westley is brought back to life they have another mission on their hands crash the princess's wedding to the prince, and Inigo's mission is to kill the man who killed his father by repeatedly saying "My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father prepare to die." While watching this movie it reminded me of other movies like Forrest Gump a little bit because of how both stories were told, Touch of Evil because of Prince Humperdink's mission to kill his so called future wife after the wedding, and of course The Adventures of Robin Hood because of whole entire story-line to both films. The way Rob Reiner directs this movie is not only similar to the way that Michael Curtiz directed the 1938 movie version of Robin Hood, but also it brings William Goldman's book of the same name to life on the big screen. A great movie for a whole family to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is on the higher end of 'meh'. It's seen as something of a comedy classic today, and I can see how in 1987, it probably felt very fresh and as such received a very positive response. I'd have probably enjoyed it more if I'd seen it then. But I just don't think it holds up - it's not terrible by any means, but I don't think it's quite as good as people seem to remember it as being.So it's a fantasy-comedy-adventure that (obviously) doesn't take itself too seriously. As such the plot is fairly predictable and the characters largely played for laughs - which is fine - but I don't think it's actually done consistently well. There are definitely some funny moments, but I think I only laughed properly three times in this film. Partially I think it's because that, by now, we've seen this kind of comedy a lot (again, at the time, I'm sure it was a lot newer and fresher), and moved on from comedy based around the fact that apparently Spanish accents are funny (here's looking at you Fawlty Towers).It looks really cheap, and yes, I appreciate it's nearly 30 years old, but a lot of films made in the 80s (even in the 70s) had better effects and sets than this. There isn't really any ambition with the world it's set in - it's very dull and stereotypical and it doesn't really fit with the fact that this is supposed to be a kooky, original world. The guy who played the Spaniard aside, I just don't think it was acted very well either. The female lead especially is wooden, and there was absolutely nothing (even comedic) to her character or given in her performance. I couldn't really get into the 'story within a story' element either - the granddad telling the story to his grandchild is shown for about 10 minutes and there's nothing to it - I just kept asking myself why? Why did they choose this setup? It doesn't help the overall flow of the film in any way and just seemed like an odd choice.As I said, there were a few good laughs, but not enough for me to want to see this again any time soon. It has its fans but I think a lot of them need to remove the nostalgic veneer of their memory of this film and come back now and watch it. A warning: you may be disappointed. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Elwes and Robyn Wright in a fantasy story of epic proportions, how can you improve on that? Even with Peter Falk as the Narrator being interrupted by his grandson Fred Savage just seem to fit and rather than distract from an epic movie it just enhances the viewers experience.The Princess Bride is a fantasy romantic adventure movie with just the right blend of comedy, action, adventure and romance to suit everyone's taste.I love Andre the Giant as the Brute, Fezzik. Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya will forever be to me the perfect model of a Spanish duelist.His line from the move is almost as famous as the movie itself. "My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!"And the fight scene between Inigo Montoya and the Man in Black is truly epic while still being tongue in the cheek.This is a movie nobody should ever try to remake, just watch the original and fall in love with it as you do the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is catchy and I like the dialog - they are witty. I laugh so hard especially the scene when the Man in Black is trying to climb up The Cliffs of Insanity without the rope and Montoya tried to rush him because he cannot wait to kill him and the torture scene when the Count trying to get a survey from Westley (I mean who does that? But it works). From that point on things got crazy. The Princess is beautiful and Westley is amazing with his "as you wish" romanticism and charming gaze. The bond between the boy, played by Savage, and his grandfather is sweet and almost comedic especially about the kissing scenes. Overall, the story is very funny and I think it catches the attention of many people despite its ridiculous story line like reviving Westley that "mostly dead". The characters are all funny and I can't stop laughing and I'm going to watch it again in a few seconds.Watch this with your kids and friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will almost never see two ambidextrous fencers set to in any film anywhere. And it was pure coincidence that Carey Elwes and Mandy Pitilkin, Roberts and Inigo respectively, were brought together to fence for this movie. It was, according to the director, unknown in advance that either of them were that good, or that they'd have such chemistry that fencing for the fun of it distracted them from filming all through the production.Although it's a low-key Fantasy in terms of magic and monsters, the fairy-tale style carries the story nicely. A dry tongue-in-cheek wit plays all the way through, with a script that's almost entirely classic lines from beginning to end.</fullReview>

Not to mention, the Spaniard with a vendetta, the miracle max with a grudge, and the priest with a speech impediment. As well as a well meaning grandpa, and a young boy who learns an important life lesson. And for the girls it has this...

		<fullReview>The title of my review pretty much sums it up.As Peter Falk's character tells his grandson, in the opening sequence, "it has everything". AND I can watch it with my whole family!What better way to re-cast the statement "I love you" than "as you wish"?"Love never gives up. Love cares more for others than for self. Love doesn't want what it doesn't have. Love doesn't strut, Doesn't have a swelled head, doesn't force itself on others, Isn't always 'me first,' Doesn't fly off the handle, Doesn't keep score of the sins of others, doesn't revel when others grovel, takes pleasure in the flowering of truth, puts up with anything, trusts God always, always looks for the best, never looks back, but keeps going to the end. Love never dies." -1 Corinthians 13:4-8 (The Message)And "death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it a while.""God raised Jesus from the dead and set Him free from the pain of death, because death could not hold Him. For David said this about Him: 'I keep the LORD before me always. Because He is close by my side, I will not be hurt. So I am glad, and I rejoice." -Acts 2:24- 26 (NCV)Quite frankly, that'll preach! :)Best cast and most quotable, witty, entertaining, heart-warming film ever imagined. And I mean it!

		<fullReview>Just got the new DVD version this week, and watched it... memories of college years, watching it over and over on VHS, came flooding back... What to say about this film... no, the acting isn't the best; no, the special effects aren't from George Lucas; no, it's not a perfect film... but, there is *something* about this film... it takes your run-of-the-mill archetypal fairy tale structure, turns it sideways in a really fun way, and manages to capture the heart and haunt you.Sure, the story is simplistic, but this film truly does get more powerful with repeated viewings. Recommendation: watch it a few times, then go away from it for a while. When you come back to it, it'll get you in the heart even more strongly. Or at least, it did to me... friends of mine from college even used the closing theme, "Storybook Love", as their first dance on their wedding day.One final word about Cary Elwes... the boy is quite the looker... And his lines are quite memorable... "Drop Your Sword" scene in particular. And, who will ever forget "As You Wish..." Shivers!SEE THE MOVIE! SEE IT AGAIN!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is one of the most brilliant romantic comedies of all time. It is carefully constructed to fill so many film genres, including: romance, fairy tale, satire, comedy, and adventure. This film features an all star cast, who collaborated on every aspect of the film. The actors brought so much to their characters, creating well rounded personalities from even the most grotesque caricatures.The tale is based on a satirical novel by William Goldman. The film begins with a grandfather reading the story to his sick grandson, and as Goldman said: the grandfather is only retelling the "good parts" of the supposed historical tale. If you haven't read the book, but love the movie, I seriously recommend you sit down to read as soon as possible.This film is perfect for all people who enjoy a good laugh, and an even better romance. I have been watching The Princess Bride since I was 6 years old, and every time I watch it I learn something new about the story, the characters, or even the technical aspects involved. It is truly a story that will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you love about this film. No, not what did you love about it as a kid, what do you love about it now? I first saw this film at age 14, at school, having never even hear of it. So, I think I am rather qualified to give an unbiased opinion, since so many are clouded by childhood nostalgia about this film. I remember the teacher putting it on, and everybody going wild. A friend, after giving me an odd look for saying I'd never seen it, said it was like the NeverEnding Story, and I'd love it.Pity that wasn't even a remotely accurate statement.I love fantasy, before I'm accused of not, my favorite book is The Lord of the Rings.I specifically love comedic fantasy, the likes of Terry Pratchett, and gently mocking, yet also in the genre fantasy,like The Last Unicorn.This film does not succeed as a fantasy, being utterly predictable, and head scratching. I know it's not a serious fantasy, since they mention real countries, as a joke, I assume. Nothing happened in this film that I didn't see coming a mile away. The only thing that mildly surprised me was the ending, that just sort of ... happens. It's like, the story is going along, then cuts off and says 'OK, we're done now.' Most predictable of all was the story within a story element.I would forgive the horrid effects, except that many eighties movies made before this one looked much more realistic. Let us not forget that Aliens came form the eighties, and those effects hold up today for the most part.Star wars was made in the seventies. Even the NeverEnding Story, for all Falcor is a puppet, had it's moments. And let us not forget, Falcor is a pretty puppet.Then, if the film isn't a serious fantasy, it must be a comedic fantasy, right? If so, I don't know what's so funny here. Apparently, the writers are convinced the height of comedy is to repeat a phrase over and over, with how often that occurs. Like when they have the worlds smartest man use the word inconceivable incorrectly. Once worth a slight smile perhaps, at the rather simple joke of 'Ha Ha! He thinks he's a genius, but he's not really.' Then, they say it again. And once more. And once more. It's like the writers thought we were too stupid to get the joke the first time, and they really felt it was a terribly clever joke, and we had to get it! Not the only time that happens in the film, either.This film fails as a fantasy by being predictable, fails as a comedy by not being funny, has awful effects, and boring, uninteresting characters. They're all flat, I knew nothing about them at the end of the film beyond 'He's really tall, they're in love, he's a idiot and he's Spanish and wants to avenge his father.' All things you could learn in that one sentence blurb. On top of all that, the acting is bad.This movie is simply a train wreck, I can't even believe it was made. And that so many of my friends love it.</fullReview>

William Goldman wrote the screenplay, as well as the original book. I've read the book and I recommend you go check it out after seeing the film. There are a lot of little funny bits that didn't make it to the screen. The cast is excellent, from perhaps the prettiest couple in movie history (Cary Elwes and Robin Wright) to one of the funniest supporting casts ever (including Chris Sarandon, Mandy Patinkin, Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest, Peter Falk, Peter Cook, Carol Kane, and a wonderful turn from pro wrestling legend Andre the Giant). It's a classic for young and old alike and I can't say enough good things about it.

Princess Bride belongs in this category because it focuses more in the story ,making it fun, and to the characters in order for the romances to become more "realist", in which I mean to make sense the couple to want to be together and you to wanted that to.Also the sword fights are well choreographed and the one liners are clever,funny and take you off guard.

		<fullReview>I put off seeing this movie simply because of the title. I figured that this was just another chick flick. It's not...I have been told by many that I have to watch this film. I hear people throw out words like, "great", "classic", and "must see". Even my wife said to me, "You're a collector, and never seen the 'Princess Bride'?" So, I gave it a shot, and I loved it. I can't put my finger on the reason why though. I must say though, that there's something about this movie, it grows on you, and I do love it now. Let me tell you a bit about it:Hard to talk about without giving away spoilers, so forgive me if there isn't much info here, but I hope this helps you. Let me start by saying that this is a great movie to watch whether you're alone, with your friends, or even with your girlfriend. There's action, though not intense like say, Bloodsport. There's A TON of comedy. There's a love story. A fantastic cast. Sword fights, monsters, poison, dungeons, castle sieges. What more could you ask for? Despite all of these things, this is not a very serious film. Which some people like. For me, it depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a serious medieval period piece like "Kingdom of Heaven", sometimes I'm in the mood for the opposite, like "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" I would say that, in terms of seriousness vs spoof, this film is sandwiched exactly between "Kingdom of Heaven" and "Men in Tights". Not too spoofy, but not one that stays with you and keeps you thinking all night either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good mix of fantasy and reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is an American Oscar-nominated movie from almost 30 years ago that runs for slightly under 100 minutes. It features a couple names in the cast that are still very well-known today, such as Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Peter Falk, Cary Elwes, Wallace Shawn, Chris Sarandon, Fred Savage and Billy Crystal. Being an avid Columbo fan, I was mostly curious about Peter Falk here and he did not disappoint. Very likable performance and presence as an old man who tells his grandson a fantastic story. However, I must say I wished that those parts with him and the boy could have been written slightly better, then I would have wished for more scenes between the two. It was a bit repetitive, still it was cute to watch the boy warm up to the story and even the protagonists' kissing.The main part, however, is the tale Falk's character presents us and his grandson. It is a story about love, revenge, friendship and many other important issues. I personally was surprised to find many references in here used later in the popular video game King's Quest. But back to the movie: It was an enjoyable watch and I managed to warm up to the characters, even if I am not the greatest Cary Elwes or Robin Wright fan. Maybe that is why I did not manage to appreciate their love story as much as I hoped I would. If you like them more than I do, then this is almost a must-see. Still I felt that their story is still more interesting and worth watching as the one about Mandy Patinkin's character, who almost becomes a lead character the longer the film goes. I must say I was a bit surprised about that, even if I liked the actor. I guess I would have been fine with keeping his story minimal, even if the film then maybe would only have went on for 80 or 85 minutes max. It is not bad at all and also brings some solid writing, but I personally felt that it distracted a bit from the core story about the princess, her beloved and the evil prince. This movie has pretty good and memorable supporting characters. As a whole, I would say top250 best films of all time (as IMDb users voted it) is a bit too much, but it was still a pretty decent watch and I recommend checking it out. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inigo Montoya saves the day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."I know, I picked the most quotable line of this epic fairy tale (sorry for being such a cliché), but it was honestly the scene I enjoyed the most in this movie. Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of his most revered films and it has become a cult favorite over time. I didn't fall in love with it however, but I can understand the appeal this romantic fantasy has on so many people considering it has it all: a tale of true love, adventures involving pirates, sword-fights, fantasy creatures, and a princess who is forced to marry against her will. The premise is no different from that of your typical damsel in distress fairy tale, but the way the film seems to be mocking and honoring those familiar elements at the same time are what makes it stand out. It has a unique innocent quality to it while remaining funny, charming, and sweet. Perhaps I would've benefited from watching this at a younger age, but having waited so long to experience it for the first time was a bit of an underwhelming experience. I wasn't swept away by its magical and fantastic elements and the love story didn't stand out from other romantic tales. There are several fun scenes and unexpected character interactions, but during most of the film I felt a bit bored. The satire works in parts and so does the fantasy, but it just felt too familiar to win me over entirely. The screenplay was adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name. Although for this film he uses a grandfather (Peter Falk) to narrate the story as he is telling it to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). At first the grandson isn't too keen about having his grandpa read him a story, especially because it starts off with kissing, but once the adventure begins he's hooked. There are occasional interruptions that bring us back to the kid's room, but most of the film takes place in this fantasy land where we are introduced to a very beautiful woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls in love with her farm boy, Westley (Cary Elwes). The two have found true love, but having no money to marry he embarks on a trip and promises to return to her. Buttercup is shattered when she hears that Westley was killed by a fearful pirate named Roberts. With nothing more to look forward to, eventually she gets engaged with Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) of Florin who promises to turn her into a princess. On the eve of her wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) and his two hired henchmen, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) a skilled swordsman who has promised to avenge his father's death, and the strong but gentle giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who really doesn't know no better. While holding Buttercup ransom and fleeing from the site, they discover that they are being followed by a mysterious man in a black mask. He catches up with them soon and the adventure begins as these men face off with one another and new revelations are made.Allowing for the story to take place through this narrative style was one of the better decisions because it gave the film its unique dreamy style and it wasn't necessary to deliver realistic visuals. It was all part of the fantasy, although I would've preferred less interruptions, but I guess they had to give Fred Savage and Peter Falk some more lines. The relationship between Elwes and Wright was believable, but it didn't stand out because it was too familiar. However, they were both the perfect casting choice for these roles. It was Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya who stole the movie for me. I absolutely loved his character and the sword fighting scene was the highlight of the movie for me. It included a brilliant homage to Douglas Fairbanks (which I'm sure gave someone the idea that Elwes would be the perfect choice to spoof his Robin Hood character in a later movie). Montoya was probably the inspiration for Antonio Banderas as well when he was cast to play the Zorro. This character has become an icon and he was the saving grace of the film for me. The rest of the characters were OK, but he stood out. The exception and I think I'm in the minority here was Vizzini. I found Wallace Shawn's portrayal of him rather irritating and I couldn't stand him. There is also a hilarious scene with Billy Crystal playing a miracle doctor, who you'd only recognize due to his voice because he is heavily covered in make up to look like an old man. The Princess Bride had its strong moments, but somehow I never managed to fall in love with the fantasy and wouldn't consider it one of Reiner's best films. It does prove however what a versatile director he is because the film is very different from his other works. I'm still a bit shocked that the film is so widely loved, but I can't argue it isn't a good movie. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that can appeal to anyone of all ages. It has romance, adventure, drama, comedy, and somehow, it succeeds at every aspect. Rob Reiner is a talented actor's director who cares a lot about the story and his characters.The story is about a boy who is sick and his grandpa reads him a book. It transitions from what we visually see as Peter Falk narrates. Wesley is a charming yet poor farm-boy who falls in love with a woman who is engaged to the wrong man. The girl, Buttercup, is engaged to a egotistical royalty prince (Humperdink). Along the way, we run into some quirky characters that somehow win our affection from the beginning. A giant and a Spanyard, Inigo Montoya, who eventually work with Wesley to stop Buttercup's wedding from happening.Overall, a very magical experience that still holds up to this day. I loved it as a kid and I love it even more in my young adult years. This is one film that you can show your date or family. Watch this movie as you wish!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You killed my father, prepare to die"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched this movie again because I remember only watching bits and pieces of it a long time ago. I only remembered the part in which "The Man In Black" goes around besting the three guys to rescue the princess, basically everything until they exit The Fire Swamp. So I decided to watch it again but this time fresh in my mind and it actually isn't that bad.When a common woman tells her (I really don't know if it's slave or something) named Wesley to do things he consistently says "As You Wish", really meaning to say "I love you". When she loves him back he decides to go out and make his fortune however he is said to be killed by a Pirate. Later an egotistical Prince (I'm not kidding, this guy almost has the ego of William Shatner) decides to marry Buttercup and she gets kidnapped by three bumbling people: a giant, a swordsman and the brains of the operation. They decide to help the 2 feuding countries start a war but they are followed by a man in black, presumably the same pirate that killed Wesley. Once he stops all three and reveals to the Princess that he is Wesley she feels she would rather marry him then the Prince. However he won't allow that and he then gets help from the swordsman and giant to stop the Prince because someone high up in the court murdered the swordsman's father.Okay, This is a very well made movie but on some points I just feel as if I have to be the bad guy. The whole part of this being a storybook being read from grandfather to grandson I don't think contributes anything to the plot. I also need to say that the setting is off, I mean they make references to Earth locations when you have swamps that shoot fire, giant rodents, giants and a whole lot of other things that scream "Okay, this is not our world". I know, this movie is pretty much a fairy tale but it just feels wrong.On the positive notes, the humour is a little funny if you like people saying things only to have you say "Wait, what?" at it. I think the weirdest is when Wesley and Buttercup (The Princess) are in the Fire Swamp and, it looks like Dagobah from Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back if it was back-lit a little more and he comments that it's not bad, then says the trees are "quite lovely", it's just so stupid and yet it does bring out a chuckle. I guess the other way to describe it is if you've seen anything by Joss Whedon, just think that except a little bit more out there.I would also say the set design, the cinematography are a couple of things I liked as well. The sword fighting I think could have been shot a little better (Although I did like the one with Wesley and Indigo Montoya) but aside from that there is no complaint here. I also think the moments when it's intentionally corny do it really well.So if you haven't seen it I say what to expect is pretty much a fairy tale. It's simple bare-bones motivations, true love will prevail and all that stuff. Although it is extremely self aware that what it's making is that and it does satirize the whole Disney thing beautifully. I'd personally say if you want to see it then just keep what I said in mind and if that's for you then, you'll like it okay. However if it's not your thing then steer clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Fairy Tale With A Lot of Heart, Warmth &amp; Charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A romance, a comedy, an adventure &amp; a fantasy, The Princess Bride is an amalgamation of all of these and is a fairy tale that has been passed from fathers to sons for generations and here is presented in the form of a novel that is being read by a grandfather to his grandson, thus making sure that the book's narrative style &amp; structure is kept entirely preserved.The Princess Bride tells the story of Buttercup who falls in love with a farm guy but loses him and is at last engaged to the Prince of the region. One day, she is kidnapped &amp; held against her will by three hired helpers; a Sicilian boss, a Spanish swordsman &amp; a giant. But they soon find themselves being pursued by a mysterious masked man who's gaining on their trail.Rob Reiner has directed some well-known classics (A Few Good Men, Stand by Me &amp; When Harry Met Sally...) but most people are still not familiar with his name because unlike other filmmakers, he has no unique style of shooting a film or possesses a trademark. And this is another one of his films that's pretty different in style &amp; approach when compared to his other works. And Reiner does a good job at it.The screenplay is adapted from the book of the same name in a manner that preserves its narrative style, camera-work &amp; editing nicely compliment each other, visuals effects never aims for a realistic portrayal of the world depicted in the story plus it benefits very much from its sweet, tender &amp; pleasant performances from its cast, including Andre the Giant.On an overall scale, there isn't much wrong with The Princess Bride &amp; carries out most of its elements the way it's meant to be. More entertaining than what I was expecting from it, definitely showing a lot of heart, warmth &amp; charm and yet it didn't click enough with me for I'm not really a fan of fairy tales. But for those who've read the book or heard the story or even many newcomers, this will be a delightful experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the course of a story which a grandfather is reading to his sick grandson, we see the adventures of farm boy Westley in pursuit of Princess Buttercup.On one level, The Princess Bride plays absolutely fair with fairy story conventions - heroes are heroes, villains are villains, and weird in-between characters are weird in-between characters. The story plays out in a satisfactorily linear fashion, adhering to standard fantasy story tropes.And then, on another level, The Princess Bride is a subversive deconstruction of the traditional stories it mimics. It is frequently very funny indeed, it boasts some wonderful performances (both Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin play their roles with a precise combination of straight face and tongue in cheek, and Wallace Shawn is simply hysterical), and it has the best sword fight for a long time. And it is endlessly quotable. Funny, exciting and charming, it is a film to treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairy Tale Yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stand By Me" director Rob Reiner helmed William Goldman's adaptation of his novel "The Princess Bride" with Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright, and Peter Falk. This imaginative fairy tale about true love is often amusing. A girl falls in love with her servant, but he goes away and is reportedly abducted by pirates. The story is framed by another story about a grandfather who reads a story to his sick grandson (Fred Savage) about a king who wants to marry a girl so he can start a war. Meanwhile, a swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) has spent 20 years searching for the six-fingered gent who slew his father. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright at the star-crossed lovers, and Elwes bears a striking resemblance to Douglas Fairbanks when he dons an outfit in black with a mustache. Billy Crystal has a cameo as a miracle worker. Although it is ostensibly a fairy tale rated PG, "The Princess Bride" has some gruesome scenes, particularly when sadistic Christopher Guest tortures our hero. Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny touching love story (not just the fairy tale)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A boy (Fred Savage) is home sick, and to his dismay, his grandfather (Peter Falk) has come to read him a fairy tale. It's the story of the beautiful Buttercup (Robin Wright) who falls for farmboy "As you wish" Westley (Cary Elwes). He goes off to make his fortune, but after news of his death, Buttercup is being married off to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Then the princess bride gets kidnapped by three rogues (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, André the Giant).This is possibly the best fairy tale reimagining ever. Peter Falk's feign indifference narration sets off the great adventure, and Fred Savage has just the best balance. Director Rob Reiner has put together all the fairy tale snippets and create something even better. The characters are memorable. And who could forget the fun that Wallace Shawn has choosing the poison drink. Mandy Patinkin is absolutely amazing as the swordsman seeking revenge from the six finger man. And there will never be another André the Giant.</fullReview>

The handsome Westley always appease his woman with a response: "as you wish" and he reveals his love for her. This movie is every girl (no matter how old) romance. With a happy ending as narrated by a grandfather told to his very ill grandson, it depicts fantasy and the subtle ness of love. I am willing to watch this movie again and again. This movie is a classic that rivals in the silver screen with 1987's "Dirty Dancing" which both have love and romance in their respective plots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect movie for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride (1987) directed by Rob Reiner, is the perfect movie for all ages. College students love it. I watched it with my wife, grown daughter and her husband, and their two young children. It worked for all of us. The screenplay, by William Goldman, is based on his book. Not surprisingly, the film captures the spirit--as well as the details--of the original. The acting is excellent, in an appropriate over-the-top sort of way. Cary Elwes is fine as Westley and so is Robin Wright as Buttercup, The Princess Bride. However, the really great roles belong to Mandy Patinkin as the swordsman Inigo Montoya, Wallace Shawn as the Sicilian genius, Vizzini, and André the Giant as Fezzik, who is, indeed, a giant.Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife Valerie have just one scene, but it's a highlight of the film Hilarious doesn't begin to describe it.No lover of movies can afford to miss The Princess Bride. It worked well when we saw it on DVD, so there's no excuse not to rent it or buy it. It would be sad to go through life without seeing The Princess Bride at least once. (Several times would be better, but once is a must.)</fullReview>

And if you are fortunate enough to be named Prince Humperdink, then you know that there is little in this world that is more exciting than being referred to by the public as Buttercumperdink. But one thing stands in the way of the Prince humping Buttercup's dink ...true love. And little does the Prince know that death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while. And if the farmboy after your bride is wearing a Zorro costume, then you really have no chance of stopping true love. Not even rodents of unusual size can stop true love! Quick sand? Flame spurts? Butt-ugly old crones with a penchant for heckling at public weddings? Think again! And true love has a lot of assistance in the form of a few quirky characters. We've got a French wrestler with marbles in his mouth and a Spaniard with daddy issues who knows how to swash and buckle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at this movie from a completely cinematic angle, one realizes that the acting is botched terribly by many (ahem, Buttercup, ahem), everything is wholly unrealistic, and the writing is terrible; there are some truly throw-away lines, especially by Buttercup. And yet, the movie will always remain one of my all-time favorites among other such cinematic abominations as Rocky Horror Picture Show and Four Rooms. I have been watching this movie since I was 7, and I doubt I will ever stop. And to (duly) shower praise upon Rob Reiner's head, there has never been a buddy movie that has come close to rivaling Fezzik and Inigo's wonderful chemistry. And there has never been a better, awful, movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant enough fantasy adventure aimed at family audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't even heard of The Princess Bride until very recently. But evidently it has something of a good reputation and I am guessing that it may have been a sleeper hit that gained its reputation over a number of years as opposed to a film that hit the mark on initial release. Having seen it I'm still not entirely sure why this one has gained the reputation it has, as it didn't really seem all that remarkable to be perfectly honest.Its story takes the form of a sweet natured traditional adventure narrative. It's set in a fantasy land but unusually is told from the perspective of the present day with scenes of a grandfather reading the title book to his ill grandson. It has a strong romantic subplot and has very clear morals, with no grey areas. Consequently its simplicity makes it very well suited to children. But it can appeal quite well to adults too because it does have a lot of humour. It's helped in this area quite a bit by having a very good cast. There are too many to mention but my favourite character was the evil hunchback played by Wallace Shawn. The scene where he has a battle of wits with the hero over a poisoned drink is the funniest and best moment in the film for me. So all-in-all, it's certainly a likable enough movie but one probably, in fairness, not aimed at me. However, I cannot avoid not commenting on its weakest aspect because it was so, so terrible I couldn't believe it. The music. Oh, deary me, the music. For a film with some evident production values on screen it was completely bizarre that the soundtrack was so horribly tinny, like it had been composed and performed on a Casio keyboard!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuine classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is Spinal Tap", "When Harry Met Sally" and "The Princess Bride" give director Rob Reiner a trio of timeless classics. "Princess Bride" takes the classic boy-meets-girl setup and adds "Wizard of Oz"-level lines such as "life is pain, anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something" and "you keep saying that word (inconceivable)-I do not think it means what you think it means." He also adds a flawless cast including the under-appreciated Mandy Patinkin, a shockingly menacing portrayal from the normally silly Christopher Guest and the previously unusable Andre' the Giant who is somehow made to deliver an understandable and winning performance. By the turns the movie is funny, frightening, dramatic, comedic, suspenseful and whimsical. The framing device with Peter Falk and Fred Savage allows Reiner to step out when things become too intense and makes this watchable even for the younger set. In short, add this to your must see list especially if you have children.</fullReview>

The sheer excitement of it will impress it into your heart when young, and the great one-liners will have you chuckling as an adult. It is obvious that the cast had great fun making this movie, and it stars the beloved Cary Elwes, who apart from 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' and a few bit-parts, hasn't done much at all.

		<fullReview>Having just recently sat through Dungeons and Dragons (*shudder*) with my daughter, I decided that I should show her that there is indeed good in the world, blew the dust off my VHS copy of The Princess Bride, and settled down to watch it with her.I'm not going to draw a comparison, though. It'd be so unfair, for this film remains one of the very best I've ever seen. It's beautifully photographed and directed, it's extremely funny, and succeeds captivatingly at poking fun at itself too, and it's totally engaging throughout. There's not a weak piece of acting in there - okay, admittedly we're talking about fairy tale stereotypes almost throughout, but even so every performance meshes just perfectly. Cary Elwes (and what *has* happened to his career?) is just ideal in his slightly self-mocking role as boyscout meets Errol Flynn, and Robin Wright just shines as the Princess - she's possibly the most beautiful woman I've ever sen on film, giving Grace Kelly a real run for her money. Chris Sarandon makes an excellent scheming evil prince, and the comic vignettes from the likes of Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn and Mel Smith are a sheer delight.Fred Savage, who I am no particular fan of, gives a very creditable performance as the grandson, capturing the truculence of a 9 year old without once becoming annoying, and his relationship with the accomplished Peter Falk as his grandfather is touchingly and accurately observed.But the whole show is entirely stolen by Mandy Potemkin as Inigo, the bandit with a mission. His role is both a comic tour de force, and poignant too. I'm sure that even in 30 years' time, if I hear the words "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die", I'll start smiling and chuckling at the evoked memory of a movie that is in its genre simply beyond compare.Oh and my daughter sat simply spellbound through every frame. What more could you want?</fullReview>

Some of the most famous acting talents came together to form THE PRINCESS BRIDE, and 1 great director.Rob Reiner directs this all-star cast, in you not-so-average fairytale adventure. Filled with swashbuckling sword fights, tremendous thrills, incredible romance, excellent actors and cameos, a very original comedic look at fairytales, and so much more, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is the SHREK of the eighties.The acting itself is flawless. Robin Wright plays Buttercup who falls in love with her servant boy Westley (Cary Elwes). After he sets off to sea to find fortunes, she is told the dread pirate Robinson killed him. She immediately becomes a recluse, and mutters the words, `I will never love again?' Some years later, she is engaged to Prince Humperdink, who is marrying her just to kill her and blame it on a distant land---the result of which starting a war. Unaware of his plans, a trio comprised of a short man (Wallace Shawn), a revenge sought swordsman (Mandy Patinkin) and an 8-foot giant (Andre the Giant) set out to do THE SAME thing, by kidnapping her, killing her, and placing her on the distant land. In this process, the dread pirate Robinson, who turns out to be none other than her long lost servant boy, rescues her. Now they have the Prince chasing them, and the plot only continues to grow as they go through the dreaded fire swamp, and are caught up with by the Prince, who takes the servant to be tortured, eventually being rescued by the giant and the swordsman of the trio, of whom want to help him save the Princess Buttercup before it's too late.The Princess Bride is wonderfully acted, filmed, and has just a good fantasy feel to it. Like I said before, it's the SHREK of the eighties. After seeing this film, you just know it's destined to become a classic, of which it has become. Just the sheer original genius of this film earns it 4 stars, much less the rest of the film. 4/5 starsJOHN ULMER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real question we must ask ourselves here is, what rock have you been hiding under that you still haven't seen this movie? I don't think there is a more played rainy-day recess video at elementary schools nationwide. And that is really a commentary on how wonderful the movie is, because it is accessible to children and adults alike.Do yourself a favor and actually LISTEN to all of the dialogue. The level of wit is beyond so many films that are strictly comedies, and yet we also have a delightful romance and fantasy/action/adventure.Now, seriously, why haven't you seen this movie yet?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the ultimate family movie. This film has it all. Giants, sword fighting, a princess, a witch, magic, pirates, rodents and true love.I first watched this film as a young boy, and can honestly say that after all these years this film has lost none of it's charm. It makes you feel good from head to toe once viewed.The casting and acting is spot on. Nobody was ever going to win an oscar, but the acting is camp enough with out going to far. The humour runs all the way through the film to make this a real belter of a film.We can even forgive the director for book-ending the film with Peter Falk reading the story of the "Princess Bride" to his sick Grandson.If you are looking for a film for the kids, forget Toy Story or Pokemon the movie. This IS the ultimate film for Kids from 5 to 95......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Princess Bride-- A fantastical enjoyed ADVENTURE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." Those words will trigger one of two things for a person, either massive confusion or the amusing fairytale, The Princess Bride.Alan, a young boy, is sick in bed with the flu playing video games. The last thing he wants is his grandfather reading him some "mushie story with kissing." Reluctantly, Alan agrees to let his grandfather read The Princess Bride to him, a novel that has been read in Alan's family from generation to generation. Alan expects an everyday story with your usual Prince, Princess, villain, rescue, and romance. But this book had a lot more to offer, yes, including "kissing" (as said by the grandfather to Alan)? The strength of true love is essentially the makeup of the storyline for The Princess Bride. A beautiful girl named Buttercup falls in love with her farm hand, Westley. It's the perfect relationship till Prince Humperdinck picks Buttercup to become "Princess Buttercup," which she resents. Suddenly, another complication occurs?Buttercup is unexpectedly kidnapped by a group of three evil villains, "The Sicilian, The Spaniard, and The Turk" in which Westley must battle to win back his one and only love. At the same time, Prince Humperdinck also sets off to look for his soon to be "Princess Buttercup." Will Westley save his soul mate before the Prince can interfere? Is Buttercup going to become royalty? Only true love is to decide how this one-of-a-kind fairytale concludes.Whether you are looking to watch a movie for an adventure, a mushie love story, or just for laughs, The Princess Bride is for you. This movie is suitable for the whole family has been classified under many categories, including, comedy, romance, drama, adventure, and even fantasy. Not only is it a well-written screenplay and has been rated over 8/10 stars by most movie critiques but it has been nominated for five awards and has won five other awards, some including the "People's Choice Award" and the "Saturn Award." In addition, this movie also features a dynamic cast. The entire cast did a remarkable job in making this fairytale realistic (to an extent). One example is about how the combat (sword fights, flips, tricks, etc.) scenes were well done and rehearsed. They kept the viewers on the edge of their seats through every "clink" of a sword and "swoosh" from a flip. Another is how the make-up and costumes in the movie added a great effect to the cast of characters, especially to the older, more mystical characters featured, such as Miracle Max and his wife. The 1987 release of The Princess Bride shows viewers that this movie making process took time and consideration, along with an amazing cast, and a hard working crew, creating a story that's to be a great audience pleaser.Three evil villains, a cruel Prince, a beautiful bride, a hero, Cliffs of Insanity, a Pit of Despair, and so much more chaos and adventure?no one has ever had to fight this hard for true love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By virtue of the "under 29" female vote, "Princess Bride" is somewhat overrated on the IMDB, but still is a good, fun movie. I rate it "8" of 10.The recently-released special edition DVD is the one to view. The colors are nicely saturated in most scenes, it has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, and there are lots of extras, including one of the better "making of" specials. One of my favorite actors is Mandy Patinkin, and here he is great as the Spanish swordsman seeking revenge for his father's death at the hand of the six-fingered swordsman played by Christopher Guess. This was Robin Wright's first film, as a 19-year-old, playing Buttercup. Cary Elwes is also perfect as her love interest. Andre the Giant, who died in 1993 at age 45, was so fitting in his role as the giant. Overall a fine cast and a fine, entertaining, funny film. A "comic fairy tale in a strange land" as read to a child.The moral of the film, "True love conquers everything." How could anyone dislike such a story??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The inspiration for so many later blockbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The disappointment that I had with this movie I think can be attributed to how many people copied off of it. From what I have gathered, this was the first time anyone had done a non- traditional fairy tale and people loved that. But now, Disney does that every time it adapts a fairy tale. All of the elements of Princess Bride can be found in either the Shrek movies or one of the Disney "fairy tales with a twist". So Princess Bride hardly felt revolutionary to me after seeing so many movies that modeled themselves off of it. It's really too bad, because I think I might have really enjoyed it if not for that.The story follows many of the conventions of a fairy tale, so that was a little disappointing. There were plenty of good scenes, though, and much of it was amusing or at least entertaining. The action choreography was pretty good for what it was. Low budget, or at least not huge budget like we see today, but still pretty exciting and not that violent. The turns are not exactly predictable, but they aren't devastatingly unexpected. They just sort of happen.I think I was also expecting there to be more of a Monty Python or Men in Tights feel to it, which there was a little bit. But a lot of the movie had a surprisingly serious tone to it, enough that there were many times when I didn't know whether I was supposed to laugh. In some ways, this isn't bad. It can be kind of annoying to have the jokes hold up a "laugh" sign next to them. But it decreases the entertainment level a little.All things considered, it's well crafted. I wouldn't say that it's anything you should study as an aspiring filmmaker, but the people who worked on it did a good job. I wouldn't recommend that you watch it if you don't think you'll like it. You can only enjoy this movie if you go into it with an open mind. It's a good family movie, but most kids under about 8 won't appreciate it that much. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Childhood Favorite About Love and Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>https://youtu.be/Ldmi1UeMKd0 The link above contains my full review and summary of the movie. I watched it with my friend Rachel who'd never seen it before, if you can believe that! She liked it a lot (she even cried just a few minutes in!) I've loved this movie for a LONG time. I grew up on silly comedies and action movies like Big Trouble in Little China and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. In fact, I used to confuse Men in Tights with PRINCESS BRIDE because the lead actor is the same in each! The brilliant Carey Elwes! The script is my one of my favorite writers, William Goldman, from his book. If you're a fan of the movie and haven't read the book, you are missing out! The book is just as amazing as the movie and in some ways it's EVEN BETTER.The swordfight on the Cliffs of Insanity, the themes of true love and revenge, the relationship between the boy and his grandfather, the quotable lines and the AMAZING cast, make this a fantastic film. Give it a watch and show it to your friends if they haven't seen it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT movie for kids and a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie as a kid, it has a little of everything (action, romance, adventure, humor, supernatural, fantasy, to name most). But now as an adult, sadly I do not think this movie held up over time (at least for myself). I actually found it boring and rather childish, but I still rate this highly because I am sure a lot of people will like watching this.Definitely a classic movie and worth a watch, just no longer up there with my favorites. The acting is great, characters are classic, and it has a lot to like. I just wish it held up better for me, but I still recommend it (if that makes sense). Cary Elwes proves yet again that he is a great and very under-rated actor, as he carries this movie and plays the part naturally. He was pretty young in this as well, the rest of the cast is spot on in their respective parts. For kids, this movie could not be more highly recommended.</fullReview>

I'd love to be part of a movie of this caliber. Thank you so much to those who made this movie possible. I believe that those who were in this movie, made this movie what it is today. No other cast would have made this movie this great. I love my life by this movie, I know, crazy sounding, but, it's what I believe, true love does exist and all it takes is to find that one person who will see you for you and allow that moment of as you wish to be presented to them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride definitively lives up to all its "inconceivableness."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew I wouldn't get away without mentioning this classic. Seeing this film for the umpteenth time, I couldn't help but continue to marvel at all the artistic prowess given to make this film. Even the worst aspect of the film, its flat-out fake sets, enhances the sensation of a timeless fairytale. Perhaps it begins like a typical fairy tale about a peasant girl and a marriage, but soon, Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride quickly side- steps and beats its own trail with a quick twist of evil and amazing subplots. A personal favorite and acclaimed classic, Princess Bride contains many of the most quoted lines ever in the history of film along with memorably choreographed duels and rich characters.Westley (Cary Elwes, an unknown actor who later went on to star in other popular films, a dashing farm boy, falls in love with a peasant girl, Buttercup (Robin Wright). Sadly, a misfortune takes him, leaving Buttercup broken-hearted, even when an arrogant and conceited Prince Humperdinck (Christopher Guest) discovers and chooses her as his bride. However, before the marriage, she is kidnapped by three eccentric, disproportionate pirates: Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), the leader; Fezzik (André the Giant), the clumsy, wisdom-speaking idiot; and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), the wisest of the three.Then, like typical fairy tales, it poses the question that can be readily answered with a "no": is Westley actually dead? He, disguised in black, chases these three desperadoes to recover his lost love in a perilous hunt. During this exhausting journey to fight back for his love, we observe a good number of passionate kisses (hey, it's a romance) and hilariously scripted and well-choreographed duels (enough to make you forget of the horrific set pieces), though none are as frightening as the Forest and Westley's torture scenes as the undertakings are slightly painful and disturbing. But as we receive the assuring company of a grandfather narrating the story to us, it helps soothe the anxiety of the tale. But then again, an unexpected strong obscenity near the end is heard. However, due to its characteristic fairy tale formula, its virtues surely dwarfed the negative as it allowed the clear distinction between good and evil with the respective, evident deeds of each side shining.Still, this already colorful film is sprinkled by colorful subplots, like Inigo's father and revenge, fitting in perfectly and even aiding the story. Maybe Vizzini's famous "inconceivable!" may have been blown up by fans into one whole subplot itself already. As one of the few films I own, I rank this among my favorites. As the narrator in the trailer truthfully states, it's "not just your basic, average, every day, ordinary, one-of-the-mill, ho-hum fairytale." Whether seeing this for the first or millionth time, with or without a loved one, The Princess Bride definitively lives up to all its "inconceivableness."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and yet effective family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a simple fantastic family film, that follows the formulaic knight in shining armor saving the damsel in distress. Sure a bit more depth in the plot or if it added more materials from the book this is based on. It might have been a better movie for adults to watch as well. It's still a fun film for the whole family to sit through and enjoy and who knows. Maybe the simplistic style of this film is one of it's charms that makes it stand out from the rest. You can tell not much budget went into this, even the set pieces and costumes seemed like something out of a play. This movie starts out with the grandpa telling his grandson a fairy tale, "The Princess Bride". The story delves into some good messages, such as fighting for whats right, standing up for yourself, that life is not fair but you can set your own path. Cary Elwes the male lead in this, was just great. I can totally picture him playing Robin Hood or other superheroes that utilizes wits and humor. Overall this is a simple magical romantic adventure that is worth a watch.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've Finally Seen This 80's Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is almost pointless to comment on because pretty much everyone has seen it, and everyone has their opinion. And yet here I am. I'd managed to go a long time without ever actually having seen the film, though I was familiar with some of it's more popular moments from their repetition and spoofing in pop culture. I also read the script as part of an assignment in college for a creative writing course but, at the time, didn't find anything particularly special about it. It just read like any other fairy tale film with some moments of appreciable comedy scattered throughout. When a friend of mine found out I hadn't seen the movie and gave me a confounded stare, I figured it was time. So finally, last year at the age of 31, I sat down to watch THE PRINCESS BRIDE and?it was good. I enjoyed it. My daughter seemed to enjoy it. But neither of us had the reaction that most others seem to have in regards to Rob Reiner's 1987 fantasy/comedy. Since then, I've watched it a few more times and I'll admit it's grown on me more with each subsequent viewing. I've developed some respect for the film and I understand why it seems to have developed such a cult following. It sticks with you. I didn't think much of it when I first watched it, but now I can't go a day without mentally or verbally making reference to it.The story is your average fairy tale: young lovers are separated, the man is thought dead and the woman is forced into a marriage engagement with a corrupt prince. The price plans to use the woman in a plot to start a war with a neighboring kingdom, and the young man returns in disguise to rescue her. Et cetera, et cetera, and they live happily ever after. But the characters themselves are just so much fun. Reiner's casting in the film is absolutely perfect. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are the epitome of fairy tale lovers: young and beautiful, with real chemistry. And Elwes is fantastically dashing as the swashbuckling hero. As good as the two of them are, I would've much preferred an entire movie about the trio of mercenaries who kidnap Buttercup (Wright) on orders from the prince and jumpstart the plot. Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), Fezzik (André the Giant), and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) drive the first half of the film as the mysterious "Man in Black" pursues them to retrieve our damsel in distress. I loved these guys and the first half of the movie was, in my opinion, where all the best material lies. Once it all shifts to our hero versus the corrupt Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), my interest wanes a bit. There's still some good material there but it loses a lot of the fun, fantastical parody elements?the Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp with the R.O.U.S?that kept me laughing along.Despite it's minor flaws, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is undeniably a classic. It's infinitely quotable. It hits all the right buttons for a good comedy or adventure or fantasy film. And it's populated with an incredible cast. I love the 80's reliance on practical effects, from a time before CG became popular and turned everything into high-tech cartoons. The R.O.U.S. would never have been as fun a sequence if it weren't puppetry and people in suits. As fantastic as Elwes was in the hero's role, Inigo Montoya is easily my (and certainly many other's) favorite character with Fezzik in a close second. André the Giant made for the perfect simple giant with a heart of gold. His speech can be hard to understand at times, but subtitles made sure I wouldn't miss out on some of his classic lines. Chances are anyone reading this comment have already seen this movie and aren't looking to be convinced whether to watch it or not, so I'm not here to promote the film. I'm just here to admit I was mistaken in blowing off this movie for so long and I can now be counted among the myriad of PRINCESS BRIDE fans. I don't know that I'm much of a die-hard fan but it's got my massive respect for what it is and what it's become. Without a doubt, I'm sure I'll find myself quoting the film and I'll be more apt to stop and watch it when I stumble across it on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth a Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to watch Princess bride all the time as a kid. I have lots of good memories of me and my parents popping in a VHS tape of this film and eat some popcorn. As a film student and a movie critic though, I am not letting that get in the way of analyzing this picture. As a whole this movie is a bit of a mixed bag. The actors are the best part of the film. Even though it's a comedy, they play it straight which really works and makes the hilarious lines come off naturally. The second best is the writing. At times, the lines can be clunky and awkward-once again though those actors make them work-but the characterization makes up for it. These well developed characters are a lot of fun and you can't help but want to see them accomplish their task. The style and the direction of the picture are at about the same caliber. They display the action clearly and effectively so that the audience gets the picture. However some of the special effects shot look kind of crappy and a few of the props look a little too plasticy. I think though that adds to the appeal since it gives it a sense of cheesiness. Basically, this movie is pure fun with some good characters, cheesy special effects, and good one liners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Princess Bride is the movie for all ages any time, any day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is always that one movie that you see when you are a little kid that intrigues you, one that you watch over and over again and keeps your interest every single time. For me, this movie is The Princess Bride. The Princess Bride is a film that was created in 1987 and directed by Rob Reiner. It is a great film that portrays love, hate, revenge and makes you laugh all in one. It is about a young man and woman who fall in love at a young age. The boy, Wesley, works on the young lady's farm, whose name is Buttercup. Wesley falls in love with Buttercup the moment he sees her. Buttercup, on the other hand, takes a while to realize that Wesley is in fact in love with him, but even longer to realize that she actually loved him back.Once this young couple falls in love, Wesley goes overseas. After a while the word travels to Buttercup that the ship Wesley was traveling on was attached and invaded by pirates. Those pirates were known as the Dread Pirates Roberts, the most vicious and wealthy of them all and never showed mercy. Once this word was spread, Buttercup couldn't eat or sleep for days.Buttercup then, of course, was forced to move on. Prince Humperdinck chose her to be his wife and were soon to be married when Buttercup gets kidnapped by three men. These men went by the name of Inigo Montoya, Fezzik and Vizzini. They take her by boat into the ocean that night.After a few hours of sailing, they noticed another boat in the water and suspected it was following them. Later we find out that the man in the boat was Buttercups true love, Wesley, who she presumed was dead. Wesley had tracked her down and when he noticed she had been kidnapped, he risks his life and fights for her. The story continues about their adventure together to fall back in love, escape from her prisoners as well as her Fiancé, Prince Humperdinck.Prince Humperdinck was known as the best tracker in all of the land and set out to find his love. He found his Fiancé with a masked man as they were running into the Fire Swamp. His plan was to wait as Buttercup and Wesley came out of the swamp, if they even survived. It had never been heard of to spend one night in the Fire Swamp and live to see another day because there were rumors of vicious ROUS's (rodents of unusual size) that lived there. Fortunately, Wesley and Buttercup survived the night, only to be awaited on the other side by the Prince.Once again Wesley and Buttercup were separated, not wanting anything to happen to the love of their life. Buttercup agrees once again to marry the Prince on one condition, never to harm Wesley. He agrees. However, Prince Humperdinck is not a man of his word.The couple is again in search for one another. Buttercup is about to be married and Wesley has been taken and at one point was "only mostly dead". Will Buttercup end of marrying Prince Humperdinck? Is Wesley really dead? And will they be able to find happiness once again with each other?This classic love story intrigues every listener with its witty characters, the love between Wesley and Buttercup, and several different revenge plots set in place. The Princess Bride is one movie that can be watched over and over again and is intriguing at every moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it's a family movie, the story can nicely be unpredictable with all the unbelievable twists here and there. The midget getting killed by his own complicated logic, and his men eventually join Westley is really unpredictable. The movie also has great lessons for kids, about chivalry, honor and trust, which any kid should always be taught as they grow up. The acting work feels quite a standard, especially since the movie tends to be satirical and comedic. Cary Elewes did quite well in balancing the character's supposed charisma and the comedy in his scenes. Rovin Wright comfortably filled the angle for Westley's counterpart in the story. Mandy Patinkin and Andre the Giant provided most of the amusing comedic ignites for their characters' scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride (1987): Dir: Rob Reiner / Cast: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Wallace Shawn: Fun family oriented adventure that addresses the joy of fairy tales while exposing the clichés. Cary Elwes plays Westley, a masked man in black skilled with a sword. He is in pursuit of Princess Buttercup whom the evil Prince Humperdink failed to kill him for. Along the way he encounters a skilled swordsman, played by Mandy Patinkin who desires to avenge his father's death by slaying his killer, the man with six fingers. He is accompanied by a na?ve yet lovable giant, played by famed wrestling legend Andre the Giant. The screenplay is presented via narration as a grandfather reads the tale to his enthusiastic bed ridden grandson. While parents may discern some violent images, this is largely an enjoyable fairy tale with very little to deny older children. Elwes plays off the good natured over confident vibe of Westly that sparks much humour especially when he needs revived. Robin Wright as Buttercup mentally denies Humperdink to the point of warning suicide on their arranged marriage. Patinkin and Andre the Giant make for a great comic duo. Wallace Shawn plays an amusing villain whose wit is outmatched by Westly during a crucial internal battle. This is a wonderfully made fantasy by director Rob Reiner that addresses the inner child in us all. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet fantasy where tongue in cheek on occasionally goes overboard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this was the film that introduced Robin Wright to movie audiences, if you were watching the daytime soap opera Santa Barbara in the mid-1980s you already knew her as the sweet Kelly Capwell, the rich heiress who was as long suffering as her character is here. Taking time off from that show to make this movie, it was only a matter of time before she would leave the world of daytime TV behind and go on to become a bona fide movie star. Truly likable on screen, she is the perfect movie heroine. unlike other ones who have come and gone since the 1980s, she has proved herself to be a talent as well as a beauty, and performance here is sign of better things to come.As told by grandfather Peter Falk to his grandson, this ends up being a lesson to put down your video game and pick up a book, because sometimes as Belle in Beauty and the Beast would find, great adventures can take you into great places through paper, not a computer screen. I can just see the illustrations because this is a visual treat, and while at the time the whole narrative seemed unnecessary, it proves an important life lesson 25 years later.The handsome Cary Elwes plays the hero, her childhood love who has been unfortunately separated from her and now as a bandit, is all of a sudden reunited with her. But it's too late she is now engaged to marry the evil Prince Christopher Guest, Elwes' various obstacles to rescue her from kidnappers Wallace Shawn and Andre the Giant. Shawn is hysterically bad, not in his performance but in the way he keeps repeating the word inconceivable, making you laugh even more at this idiot of a character he is playing. When Elwes and Shawn go up against each other in a battle of the wits, you know this evil character's stupidity will be what ultimately destroys him, and the results are hysterical.Sometimes, however the film does go overboard, making buffoons out of various minor characters who are on screen so minimally that you wonder why the writers had them do the things that they do. Guest's elderly father, the king, is a senile old man who doesn't even hear Wright's pleas for help when she indicates that she is going to kill herself. All of a sudden when the minor character of a bishop comes on to marry Wright and Guest, his distracting stutter seems unnecessary and simply there to give juvenile audiences something to laugh at. In a sense it is cruel and ridiculous.However, a supporting performance by Mandy Patinkin as the revenge seeking swordsman who helps Elwes in his quest gives Pantinan a role to really sink his teeth into. He reminds me of the many dashing heroes at Errol Flynn had played years before, and this is a far cry from the types of roles Pantinkan had played on Broadway and on TV. There are some truly horrific moments too, scary enough for young children to be forewarned about, but for adults a reminder of the type of films that Ray Harryhausen used to make in the 1960s and 1970s. An encounter with a huge rat like creature truly is frightening! The film does have an old fashion style to it, making it a great pastiche in an error when such films as Excalibur, Willow, Legend and Ladyhawke took audiences into a world of fantasy that was sorely lacking in most motion pictures. Still attractive to look at, it merely suffers only because of the juvenile nature but has obtained a cult status that seems well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocent satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was greatly amused by Rob Reiner's "Spinal Tap," although I am no fan of low-grade touring rock bands. I am not a big fan of romantic fantasy either, but I was enchanted by Reiner's "Princess Bride." There, I said it. I never thought I would use "enchanted" in a review to describe my state of mind.In some ways, the Princess Bride is an awkward film. I got the feeling that the Director was like a fish out of water, and Reiner confessed as much in interviews later. Yet this is exactly what makes this film so great. Reiner came at it with the innocence of a satirist thinking "Am I really doing this? Am I dreaming?" A sarcastic curmudgeon (that may be an exaggeration) finding his soft heart while directing a film. You feel like the film was a journey for its director, not just for its characters. Reiner is like the little boy unwillingly listening to grandpa's story, and wanting more, more, more despite professing he's not into "that girly stuff."The movie resolutely goes its own way, from the silly R.O.U.S. attacking our heroes in the swamp forest, to the smart aleck who outwits himself in a deadly drinking cup game with the Errol Flynn-like hero. Nothing is quite like you would expect, leaving you shaking your head, yet smiling at the same time. William Goldman outdid himself in the script, after penning a great book. It's not often that the book translates so well, in the hands of the original author.This and the "Wizard of Oz" are really the only films I can think of off the top of my head that bring the words "innocent" and "satirical" to my mind simultaneously. The "Oz" is a great film with Judy Garland in a great role, but on a scale divided into tenths, I have to give "PB" the same rating. They're both unique fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny, as a kid, I always used to watch "The Princess Bride" only to a certain point (the ROUS would invariably result in my turning this off and doing something else). So for years, I'd known this as half a movie. This is my second watch as an adult, and I'm still surprised at how dark this movie gets in the second half (the machine) and delighted by the unrecognizable Billy Crystal and Carol Kane.Regardless, this is a terrific fairy tale and far more entertaining in its sef-awareness. Tongues don't come as firmly in cheek as they do here. And I can't think of a weak link in this cast, all of whom evidently relish William Goldman's script wordplay. The witty banter is laid on thick here in the best way possible, and keeps things alive when the swords are sheathed (and such swordplay is impressive, at least to this non-fencer).This is a really fun movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare when I repeatedly re watch a movie. I've been watching this movie since I was a kid. I find myself still watching it and enjoying every moment.Romance, pirates, sword fighting, and princesses. What more could you want? It's the kind of movie that the whole family can enjoy. Witty and action packed. It keeps everyone watching till the very end.Its just such a wonderful modern fairy tale, a truly classic film for parents and kids alike. If you have never seen this film why not? You really must rent it and watch it at the very least. I am 100% sure you will love watching it as much as I have over the years its why I rated it 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Princess Buttercup and Prince Humperdi(n)ck? Read between the lines(LOL).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically a fairytale sort of film with some black humor thrown in, that young children won't understand. I have seen a lot of fairy tale films, and this film can be considered a passable entry in that genre.A grandfather(Peter Falk) reads a book to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). Scenes of the reading occasionally interrupt the main story. The story is about a girl of wealth Buttercup(Robin Wright) who falls in love with a lowly farm boy Westly(Cary Elwes). This young man, aware of the great gulf between them, decides to go abroad and make his fortune and return a wealthy, worthy man fit enough to marry a princess. However complications ensue that involves a certain prince Humperdinck(Chris Sarandon) who wants to marry Buttercup.Five years later, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck after hearing news that Westly is dead. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: a Sicilian boss named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), a giant named Fezzik (André the Giant), and a Spanish master fencer named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who seeks revenge against the six-fingered man who killed his father. Two separate forces pursue them: Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers, and a masked man dressed in black.Who is the mysterious man in black? What is going to happen next? Watch the film to find out more.I do not consider the high rating people have given to this film. I personally find films like The Neverending Story, The Wizard Of Oz and Return To Oz, Conan The Barbarian, Krull and Paperhouse much superior. Thank you for reading this review. May you live long and prosper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The chocolate coating makes it go down easier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is framed by a second narrative of a grandpa telling a story to his sick grandchild, who like all pre-teen boys wants to listen to things like sports and fighting, not true love and kisses. Of course in the end he changes his mind, having being enthralled by the story like so many others. It's a very neat device which allows the film some breathing space; clichés, larger than life characters with seemingly singular purposes, fantastic declarations of true love and sacrifice, mysterious locations that challenge then are never returned to...it can be all chalked up to the fairytale nature of it. And that's perhaps a crucial selling point that may make or break an impression of the cult classic; it's simply something that you either love or hate. A relieving thing about The Princess Bride is that it never takes itself too seriously. Buttercup (Robin Wright) is by far the most serious and passionate of the cast; even the enigmatic Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) has moments of playfulness and humour. When Buttercup's desperate cries of suicide rather than be wedded to a man she does not love, the film simply takes it down a notch. The protagonists are never confronted with too difficult a challenge or too perilous a situation, and if they are in a spot, there's always some sort of device or miracle to lift them out of it. Although the main romantic storyline and the tale of revenge are indeed cliché to a degree, there's also moments where Princess Bride can step back and subvert those fairytale moments. The castle's gatekeeper straight forwardly refuses to give up the key to the gates and looks to be up for a fight, before a threat of missing limbs from no less than Andre the Giant very quickly makes him fold and surrender, in a cowardly but humorous manner. The main villain Humperdinck is persuaded to surrender after an impassionate and fierce condemnation from the lowly diamond in a rough protagonist, Westley. Only after he is tied up then it is revealed that Westley can barely move a muscle, and Humperdinck bursts out in exasperation "I knew it, I knew you were bluffing!" The important thing is that Princess Bride never descends into the areas of parody or self-awareness for the sake of it, like so many modern comedies tend to feel the need to. It relies on its sharp script and lively performances to generate humour rather than the audience nodding in recognition. There are perhaps areas of weakness that may result in the audience second guessing the narrative tone and wondering whether its camp for the sake of it or simply bad. There's a well done scene where Buttercup flings herself into the waters and is faced with Shrieking Eels (although the darkness and obscurity certainly help mask ageing effects), where the score turns ominous and we cut from a terrifying Jaws-esque display of teeth to a concerned young boy who hastily pretends to not care. There's the hilarious squabbles of heavily made-up apothecary couple Billy Crsytal and Carol Kane. And of course there's the classic confrontation between Inigo and Westley, where the duel for several minutes with both hands, flipping and jumping and dodging all around the rocky set. These scenes are weakened somewhat by others like the painfully clunky scene where Westley and Buttercup are attacked by a Rodent of Unusual Size (or just an actor in a very poorly made costume). In fact the entirety of the Fire Swamp seems rather trivial and undeveloped as a location/set (even its name screams lazy). It's of course fairly easy to push these scenes aside or convince yourself that they fit within the context of a grandpa telling a young boy a fairytale, and I suggest that you do so for maximum enjoyment. To put yourself in the shoes of the genuine innocence of the grandson will produce nothing but pure joy and magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My All-Time Favorite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon reading all of the reviews for this movie, I cannot believe how many "horrible"' sits received (Being only about four, but I digress)! The Princess Bride is my absolute all-time favourite movie and I could sit and watch it for hours on end, which I do. For starters, yes, it's cheesy and, yes, the writing is amateur-ish and, yes, the sets are all clearly mostly done in a sound stage, but guess what, mate? This isn't a "Gravity" or an "Imitation Game". This movie was made in 1987, and it has that classic diamond-in-the- rough feel to it. Someone wrote that it was "a tacky movie with tacky acting". That's the fun of it! The Princess Bride isn't supposed to be a completely serious film, and most of the actors in it were just starting out so, yes, please forgive them if they aren't Meryl Streep- quality. Another spectator voiced that "this is a fantasy piece, yet it mentions Australia's criminal record?" All I can say is that this person has clearly never read the book. Throughout the entire work, page breaks in parentheses read "this was before _____ but after taxes, but then again, /everything/ is after taxes", giving it this raw sense of being that conveys the illusion that The Princess Bride truly could have happened anywhere in your imagination.Another person complained about the "crappy writing". To said person: have you not asked a fan of The Princess Bride to finish any quote or to give you their absolute favorite quote? What does Billy Crystal get stopped for on the street? Here's a hint, it isn't even "you look mahvelous," it's "have fun storming the castle!" A few of my favorites include "Drop. Your. Sword.", "Life is pain, highness; anyone who says any differently is trying to sell you something." and "Wuuuuuuv!! Twuuuuuu wuuuuuuv!!"Back to the rawness: I cannot express enough that, while the movie is cheesy, it /was/ made in 1987, which truly gives it that sense of innocence. It takes someone nauseatingly closed-minded to not enjoy this movie simply because that implies that they don't know how to let go and just enjoy themselves every once-in-a-while. The Princes Brice wasn't made to be a 2015 blockbuster, it was mead to be something that the whole family could enjoy without being a goofy, over-rated cartoon.In addition to being my favorite movie, The Princess Bride is also my favorite book. I mentioned before how the author took breaks to continuously prove that this story truly could have happened in any time period. I also love the writing style of it. For instance, in the section where Fezzik is fighting the Man in Black against the boulders, the writer consistently spoke of Fezzik "Killing the man in one simple snap and discarding his disheveled body over the cliff.....or at least, that's what he'd have /liked/ to do."Also, what a lot of people don't know: Buttercup is an idiot. Now, I'm not just saying that because that's how Robin brilliantly portrayed her in the picture, but in the book the writer clearly said that Buttercup was ignorant. For instance, it didn't take her three times for her to realize she was in love with Westley. No, it took /ages/, and she didn't realize it truly until a broad, a /dutchess/, came and checked Westley out, leaving Buttercup scatterbrained and proceeding to knock on his flat door at five in the bleeding morning.The book also goes into depth about Inigo killing Count Reugen. For instance, rather than cutting back to Humperdinck and Westley's encounter as the picture does, there is at least a good quarter of a chapter describing the Count and Inigo's fight. At the end, where Inigo's stabs Reugen for the final time, killing him, in the book, Inigo actually rips his heart out with his sword, seeing as that is what the Count did to Domingo.In short (though, really, rather long), The Princess Bride is a movie that should be cherished for ages to come. I look forward to sharing it with my future children and English classes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that quote comes from "Beauty and the Beast", but I'm saying that for this movie instead, because this is my favorite fairy tale movie of all time. In this movie, there is a sick grandchild who is seen playing an old baseball video game, and a few seconds later his grandfather comes over to his bed and reads him a storybook where the entire rest of the movie takes place. It is about a beautiful princess named Buttercup, who orders around a farm boy named Westley that always responds "As you wish" to her commands, to actually say "I love you." We are later introduced to Vizzini, who often says "Inconceivable", Inigo Montoya who says "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father! Prepare to die!" and Fezzik the Giant. They take Buttercup to a cliff where Westley follows them wearing a black suit and face mask in disguise. Buttercup soon discovers that the man in black was the same guy she would often order around, as they are seen rolling down a hill and then going through a forest with quick sand, and R.O.U.S. which stands for "Rodents of Unusual Size". Throughout the movie, there is an antagonist named Prince Humperdinck who wants to try to marry Princess Buttercup. There is also an epic climactic battle where Buttercup is about to marry Humperdinck, and Westley, Inigo Montoya and Fezzik come to the help of buttercup, fight a lot of guards and tie Humperdinck to a chair. Then it all ends with the grandchild asking his grandfather if he could read to him the story again the next day, and the grandfather responding "As you wish". Not only is this a fantastic movie, but it also contains a fantastic song in the end credits nominated for an Oscar called "Storybook Love". In my opinion, this film by far surpasses "Beauty and the Beast" all because of its wonderful acting, storyline and just beautiful scenery. This movie is absolutely not to be missed out on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride has long been seen as a cinema classic and it has often been voted as one of the top films of the 80's, a sentiment that I would have a hard time disagreeing with. As a fan of the fantasy genre, this film falls in my wheelhouse. Despite me probably liking this film no matter what, there is no denying the talent behind the film. The story is simple, but sweet and written very well. The film is expertly directed and well-acted. The visuals even do a good job standing the test of time. In all, this was a very entertaining fantasy romp about the quest for true love. Rob Reiner's film is about a poor farm girl named Buttercup who is forced to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, but her childhood love named Westley comes back as the Dreaded Pirate Roberts to rescue her from the clutches of the prince. The film may not have the most exotic cast in the world, but there is no denying how good they were and how much fun they seemed to have. I liked Cary Elwes as Westley as well as Robin Wright as Buttercup. Andre the Giant was actually very good as Fezzik, and likewise Christopher Guest as Count Rugen and Chris Sarandon as the Prince. Overall, The Princess Bride is the film for all ages. It is the kind of film that shall be passed down from generation to generation. As a fantasy lover, it has all the elements you can ask for as you expect from such a film. I loved the theme about true love as it's a theme that will always be relevant. It's such a gorgeous film and one that is also funny. My Grade: A</fullReview>

The best point in the movie is that it doesn't work too much to make it look realistic and the usual-ness present in the princess bride made it appreciable. The movie is must watch for anyone who wants some entertainment. But among all, the best thing the director did is to take out appropriate acting out of the kid who is listening to the story.

It is an easily relatable film that can captivate an audience on the most humane ideals of the current age. Love being one of the main themes of the story, the film presents an interesting plot sequence that ideally mirrored the book. It allows the audience to grow with the main character, Westley(Cary Elwes), as he and his beloved plunge towards certain doom, and from the vile prince Humperdinck. We are presented an interesting and simplistic design, that allows for us to observe the developing character growth, with a general certainty of its conclusion. I personally loved the story because of its range of themes and it's superb storyline. It is, to me, the embodied idea of a Classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is considered a classic and to some people the greatest movie of all time. I think that it is quite a good movie but would not go as far as that. What the Princess Bride is is a fairy tale designed to capture the hearts and fantasies of those who watch it, and this movie succeeds in what it sets out to do, but to understand what the Princess Bride really is, one must look at its origins because, unlike most films, it has a very strange origin indeed, and in fact until the film was made, it was incredibly obscure. But before I discuss this, I will run through the plot.The movie is based around Princess Buttercup and a farmboy Wesley. At the beginning of the movie we discover that they truly love each other, but Wesley is poor so sets off to make some money. During the time the evil Prince Humperdink sees Buttercup and decides that he wants to marry her, and as a prince he can marry who he likes. While out riding though she is kidnapped by a rather nasty character and his henchmen Inigo and Fenik. While sailing to another country Wesley, now known as the dread pirate Roberts, catches up with her and rescues her only to be captured by the evil prince Humperdink and sentenced to lie in the pit of despair for eternity.As I said this film is your typical fairy tale with the beautiful woman, the evil prince, the dashing hero, and the nasty monsters. The original is also quite old, but if that is so, why is it not read to every child at bedtime? Well, the new book is very difficult to obtain: I managed to borrow it from a friend whose brother got it from America, and the original book is not exactly the type of book that one reads to children (though William Goldman, the screenwriter for the movie and the author of the new book claims that his Grandfather read it to him). The interesting thing is trying to date it from the movie and the new book. Goldman claims that the book that he wrote is a truncated version of the old book with only his comments added and the boring stuff excluded. Thus dating it would put it after the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 - as somewhere somebody mentions the foolishness of fighting a land war in Asia, and that is the first war in Asia that the Europeans lost (and the book does take a Euro-centric world view). Another line mentions the mafia (approximately 1850) and only criminals dwelling in Australia (1776, the year the first colony, a prison colony, was established in Australia). Only the last line I actually remember from the book.Now what about the original? Well Goldman claims that the original author stated that the book was a exposition on the cultures of the nations of Florin and Guilder (which do not exist). The original supposedly contains chapters describing, intricately, princess Buttercup's wardrobe and other such stuff. The most disturbing part of the book is the end, where Wesley, Fenrik, and Inigo suddenly die from old wounds, and Humperdink catches up with Buttercup and forces her to marry him. The movie does not end in such a sadistic way, but when knowing about this ending, it opens one's eyes to the nature of the book. One wonders why such a good movie with such a good plot would use such pathetic names as Buttercup and Humperdink? The first answer is that it is a children's movie, but the main reason is that the original book is a satire. The story is supposed to be a fairytale, but the sadistic ending seems to show how pathetic the happily ever after endings are simply unrealistic and stupid.It sounds as if the original book was some long and boring treatise with pockets of interesting story thrown in (a little like Moby Dick, which seems to be a text-book on whaling with the story of the fanatical captain Ahab thrown in). The movie on the otherhand is quite enjoyable and we must thank Goldman's grandfather for putting Goldman through the torture of listening to the story yet having the desire to rerelease it in its new, enjoyable, form. I do wonder is the original did exist, but my friend seems convinced that it does.</fullReview>

She does not love him, however, because Wesley is the true owner of her heart.She is then captured by three men who claim to be circus performers but is recaptured by "The Man in Black" who turns out to be Wesley, who inherited the ship of his captor.

		<fullReview>Yes, there's the fairy tale double coated in delicious dialog and salacious characters played beyond the realm of silliness but it's the story of true love that conquers all and is the cohesive constant. True Love conquers all, and allows for our story to play out in this fictitious land of yore. This only happens because of the indulgent set up of our good guys and bad guys full of lore, secrets, personal histories and ambitions. Smart, worthy and yet silly. Director Rob Reiner keeps us both on track with his talented cast and in sync through the Grandfather-Grandson aside, and therefore the absurd story is not so "inconceivable". Another favorite due to its quotable dialog and characters cemented in our hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will hit a particularly sweet spot, if you only let it. It will find the child in you, and tell you a story of medieval adventure and true love. There are going to be like in the storybooks, expert swordsmen, six-fingered knaves, giant rats, fiery swamps, the Dredd Pirate Roberts. The maiden will need last-minute rescuing from the cruel king.But as the kid in you becomes prepared to be engrossed, the narrator will show you that it is all goofy make-believe for the kick of making it all up as we go. It will not be epic with grand battles and pure evil because you are not actually a child, but sketch only the picaresque outline of things, trusting you to imagine the rest.So this is nice. Both the storybook for kids, and good-natured acknowledgment of its fiction.We can be both in and out of the film, poking fun at knowing it is fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A grandfather sits down to tell his sick grandson a story. And what a magical story it will be. There's fencing, fighting, torture, revenge...and kissing. The grandson may not have any interest in a "kissing book". But he will find that he can't help but be swept away, utterly transfixed by the story of The Princess Bride.This is a story of true love. And true love is a very special thing. True love can triumph over anything. Evil princes, six-fingered counts, rodents of unusual size, a Fire Swamp, a Pit of Despair. Maybe true love can even triumph over death if in fact you are only mostly dead. The two central figures in our romance our young Buttercup, played by Robin Wright, and simple farmhand Westley, played by Cary Elwes. Just as soon as Buttercup and Westley come together they are torn apart. Buttercup goes on to be a very unhappy princess. What happens to Westley? Perhaps better to ask what doesn't happen to Westley? This guy is put through the wringer. But he never gives up on his beloved Buttercup. You never give up on true love.Elwes is absolutely magnificent in this movie, perfect in every moment. He's got the humor, the look, the athleticism and heroism and vulnerability. Whatever is required in the moment Elwes delivers. And as the Princess Bride herself you could hardly do any better than Wright. She looks absolutely radiant, like any fairy tale princess should. And she pours everything she has into the role. You can see Buttercup's heart break when she believes Westley to be gone. The audience can't help but fall in love with her just as Westley did and for that give Wright so much of the credit. Even a modern-day boy who doesn't like kissing books will fall in love with Buttercup.For as wonderful as Elwes and Wright are the fun doesn't stop with them. This movie is perfectly cast all the way through. Chris Sarandon and Christopher Guest are wonderfully hissable villains. Wallace Shawn is so funny as a criminal "mastermind" who overestimates his own intelligence. For the giant Fezzik could there be anyone other than Andre the Giant? As the grandfather and grandson respectively Peter Falk and Fred Savage are terrific. Falk is the perfect narrator and Savage has his own amusing take on the story. There's a brilliant, hilarious cameo from an unrecognizable big star hidden away under old-man makeup as Miracle Max. Because every good fairy tale needs a miracle right? And perhaps most memorable of all is Mandy Patinkin. "Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father! Prepare to die!" This is a movie which has something for everyone. Action, adventure, comedy, romance and some of the most quotable dialogue ever put to film. A brilliant script from William Goldman brilliantly executed by director Rob Reiner and his wonderful cast. Someone not loving this movie would be would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is one of those movies whose stature only grows with time. It did modestly well at the box office during its original run but due to home video and television airings over the ensuing 25 years it has attained the status of cult classic. Multiple quotes have made it into the cultural lexicon and the film enjoys a healthy critical opinion.The screenplay by two-time Oscar winner William Goldman is an adaptation of his own book. At its heart it's a traditional damsel-in-distress story yet it never feels stale. Goldman injects humour into the proceedings steadily throughout and keeps the action coming, peppering it with some brief forays into romantic territory. There's also a gently satirical tone best appreciated by adult viewers.The casting is spot on. Cary Elwes has an Errol Flynn-ish vibe that's ideally suited to the role of our dashing hero, Westley. Robin Wright, as the titular princess bride, supplies the heroine with enough spunk to be endearing without becoming irksome (as so many revisionist heroines are). As for the rest, how can you not like a supporting cast that includes Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant, Christopher Guest, Peter Falk and more besides? Truly, this is one of those films where it's difficult to envision another actor being better suited to these roles.As for the visuals, I find that they're not top notch but they don't really detract from the story. In any case, it's most likely that the slightly 'fake' look was a calculated choice. So, while the sets &amp; special effects are passable they're nothing to write home about. There is, however, some nice cinematography at times, though Reiner's direction is pretty nondescript.Musicially, the film features some nice work from Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits fame. The love theme is particularly charming and is balanced by some more ostentatious music befitting the adventurous tone. That being said, the use of synthesizers is something I could do without. The closing credits also feature a decent Oscar-nominated original song by Willy DeVille (of Mink DeVille).Ultimately, "The Princess Bride" is an enjoyable film for folks of all ages. There's a little something in it for everyone, from comedy to adventure to romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly timeless film for folk of all ages to love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the 30 Second Bunnies parody of this film, I became instantly interested to see the actual film and it was truly wonderful to watch. There is so much to love and adore about The Princess Bride, I don't have enough words to use on here to describe them.The story is very heartwarming and fun to hear, a much better fairytale spoof than what Shrek attempted to do. The cast was entertaining, I loved the characters personalities and relationships with each other.The dialog is also very entertaining and well done. I quote almost every popular line from the movie, every time I watch it.But perhaps the No.1 thing I love most about Princess Bride is the romance between Buttercup and Westley. They have a much more pure and deeper love for each other than Bella Swan and Edward Cullen had for each other in all their movies.It amazes me still that this film was made by Rob Reiner, the same man who brought us the abomination known as North. Glad PB is around to wash that from our minds (LOL) I give Princess Bride two thumbs up, 5 glowing stars and 10/10. I STRONGLY recommend that you rent this movie and watch it together with your friends, family or anyone who likes a good movie.I guarantee you won't be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So why do I love this film so much? Well, for me it has everything; pirates, a giant, great swordplay, a damsel in distress, an evil bad guy, revenge, an awful lot of humour and not least a happy ending. There is quite a modern feel to it all but with the traditional values of chivalry along with a little dastardly play. Of course, some magic; how could you have a fairytale without magic? But over all, I love it because it doesn't pretend to be anything more or less than it is; a great adventure. If I ever need cheering up or I need to restore my faith in human nature I can escape into this film and when I come out the other side I know I'll feel better. No, it's not perfect, but I'd watch it in preference to many modern films any day.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 8.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal, Fred Savage and Peter Falk star Rob Reiner's 1987 fantasy based on the book. An ill boy's grandfather reads him a story of true love and adventure. This begins with an ill boy (Savage) being visited by his grandfather (Falk) who reads him a book, "The Princess Bride" that's been passed down in their family. The story is about a woman, Buttercup (Wright) and a farm boy, Westley (Elwes) who find true love with each other. Sarandon (Fright Night) plays ruthless prince, Humperdinck who tries keeping them apart, Patinkin plays Inigo Montoya, A Spanish swordsman who befriends Westley while searching for 6-fingered man, Count Rogan (Guest) who murdered his father years before and is also Humperdinck's associate. Andre the Giant plays Inigo's strong pal, Fezzik and Crystal (When Harry Met Sally...) plays Miracle Max. This is a great fairytale fantasy that's one of Reiner's best with a good cast, good score &amp; beautiful settings I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a fantasy/adventure/romance movie with much more than one would expect - there's just about enough to say its one of the best movies ever - Follow Princess Buttercup and her beloved Wesley as they evade danger, outwit villains, fall in love over and over again and eventually end an amazing story of courage, revenge and true love - See monsters attack - and see how death is conquered - Wesley is a farm boy to Princess Buttercup - Flames spark and something magical begins - An over powering, egotistical and lying man takes over - Wesley must save himself and Buttercup - New friends are made - Wounds must heal - and people must die - It will leave you breathless and wanting more - Meet a man with a goal set for revenge - Meet a man so tall and big, he'd make you cry if you tried to fight him - and see Wesley - The hero of the story - But who is really the hero, Wesley or his good luck - And see Buttercup struggle to keep her sanity - and see Wesley struggle to keep his life - and finally - See a man who will stop at nothing to marry Buttercup and destroy her and Wesley's happiness. This movie is beautiful, original and very entertaining. When viewing it for the first time, you do not know what to expect - and the story is captivating enough to make the movie seem longer than it is - and not in a bad way - the movie as is - is Oscar worthy - If you like movies such as "Stardust" or "Labyrinth" - "The Three Musketeers" or "The Never Ending Story" " then you must see This movie! The scenery is great - the characters are amazing - and you will love every minute of this movie, because there isn't a dull moment - And maybe you will feel like I do and wish there was a little more to it - or Maybe you can be content with an already amazing story - The critic in me wants more - but the movie buff in me just loves this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Summary and a Look at Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride begins with a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a story to his young grandson (Peter Savage) in modern time (presumably 1987, when the movie was released). A young woman, Buttercup (Robin Wright) and the farm-hand, Wesley (Cary Elwes) are in love, although they deny it. Wesley sets off on a journey and Buttercup is afraid she will never see him again. News reaches her later that he died on his journey, after which she becomes engaged to Prince Humpledink (Chris Sarandon). While horseback-riding, a group of bandits kidnap her. This group includes Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), and Fezzik (Andre the Giant). A masked man pursues them on boat, up a cliff, and across a plain. He defeats each of the three separately and kills Vizzini in a match of wits. He rescues the Princess and soon reveals himself to be Wesley who actually took over for the pirate that presumably killed him. They cross the fire swamp successfully but are soon caught up to by the prince and his tracking party. They take the princess home and, unknown to Buttercup, take Wesley to the Pit of Despair where he is tortured to near-death. The princess is deceived, believing Wesley to be safe. Meanwhile, Fezzik and Inigo reunite and decide that they must locate Wesley. They find him in the Pit of Despair and take him to Mircale Max (Billy Crystal) who revives him. Inigo exacts his revenge on Humpledink's right-hand man (Christopher Guest) and Wesley ties up Humpledink. The four of them ride off on horseback to safety. The grandfather tells his grandson that the kiss between Wesley and Buttercup was the truest and passionate kiss the world has known.The film's main focus is on emotion. Comedy, romance, and action are all genres that focus heavily on manipulating the audience's emotions. The sword fight between Inigo and Wesley, the most impressive in the film, utilizes suspense throughout. Wesley reveals himself to be right handed, as does Inigo, both at separate times. Inigo is disarmed twice and, even though he is a villain at this point, it is hard not to cheer him on. The passionate goodbye from Buttercup to Wesley increases her depression and regret upon hearing of his death and later strengthens the joy of their reunion. Even the grandfather helps by manipulating the emotions of his grandson, first by telling him that Buttercup wed Humpledink (much to the grandson's frustration) and later that Wesley was tortured to death. These scenes are done comically by foreshadowing that this is not "how it is supposed to be" and that these ridiculous although fitting twists will not be long-lasting. Comical elements include Vizzini's repeated "unconscionable!" line and the cowardice of Humpledink and the Duke (his right-hand man mentioned earlier). The film is very close in theme to Robin Hood, Men in Tights (1993) (also staring Cary Elwes, which also features a very similar scene where a damsel in distress jumps out of a window onto a horse).Camera angles were used in close-ups to emphasize comedic looks on the actor's faces. Vizzini's face is almost always zoomed in on when he repeats his line, the gate-keepers face is zoomed in on when he lies about the key, and the albino, an all-around comic character, is zoomed in on in his introduction. Costumes also lend themselves greatly to comedy when it comes to Miracle Max and his wife, Valerie (Carol Kane) who were wearing heavy make-up, wigs, and, for lack of a better term, old people clothes. They seem to be an old married couple who love each other but feel stuck with one another, constantly teasing and contradicting one another.Overall, the film is very successful at taking romance and action tales and spicing them up with a bit of comedy, even while taking shots of the very genres themselves. The film, although ridiculous, is easy to get involved in, largely due to the narrating of the grandfather. The comedic parts of funny, the action is suspenseful (particularly scenes involving Inigo), and the romance is one that the audience will find themselves rooting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting better every time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this was the first movie I saw with school in theater. Unfortunately it would be the only true fantasy movie that we ought to see with school, all the others were pretty much prison and serious movies with no magic. Well there is no wizards in Princess Bride but there are enough elements to consider it magical. The story is a classic Romeo and Julia one but it is executed so cleverly that it is never boring. Not only are the 2 main characters Buttercup and Westley worked out well but there is also an interesting side story from subcharacter Inigo Montoya, the sympathetic Spaniard. What makes this movie so good is not only its fairy tale theme but also its humor. There are so many scenes that put a smile on my face making me want to watch it again. People who loved the old WWF wrestling will be pleased to see the appearance of Andre the Giant playing well a giant but with soft personality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's "The Princess Bride" is about as close to perfection as any movie I have ever scene. Believe me I RARELY give 10 out of 10 stars to a movie and when I do it has to not only be superb but withstand the test of time. Its been almost 25 years and this movie has never lost a step in its brilliance. The story is completely captivating the locations are breathtaking and the array of emotions that this movie evokes from the audience is sheer perfection. You laugh, you cry, you cheer, and you smile. You couldn't ask for a better cast. Robin Wright Penn and Cary Elwes are top notch. Wallace Shawn is hilarious as the bandit leader Fezig. Andre the giant is such a sweet and gentle soul and Mandy Patinkin is nothing short of miraculous in his performance. Even the cameos in this film are priceless. Billy Chrystal and Carol Kane are so great as "Miracle Max and his wife Valarie" they could have there own sequel. A very young Fred Savage and the always entertaining Peter Falk have tremendously funny and touching scenes as the Grandparent and Grandson. I could go on and on. If you have never scene this movie do yourself a HUGE favor and rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year on Valentines Day, my family watches this movie. I've seen it so many times, I know the plot, I know what happens when. I know who dies and who lives. Yet I still enjoy watching it every year! I think it's a very unique film for a few reasons. One, it takes a fantasy story from a book and brings it to life. Like many films. But this one seems to be just as good in the movie. I haven't read the book, but I figure it is very close Two, the action, adventure and humor in the movie keeps you on your toes. What starts out as a little boy playing a video game who is stopped by his grandfather who is read a book ends with a classic tale.I rate this movie a 9/10. I know that there is swearing, and that's why it's one less. But the suspense, humor and serious dramatic emotional scenes all tie in perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is probably the coolest kids movie that isn't animated, and it holds up well for adults 20 plus years later.There, I said it.The Princess Bride is a fairytale told by a Grandpa to an initially cynical young boy who has stayed home sick. Initially the boy, played by Fred Savage in his "other" role. The story revolves around a romance between a young farmhand named Westley and a young woman named Buttercup, who with a name like that was always going to be a fairytale character, or a stripper.So being a fairytale Westley is taken by a notorious pirate named the Dread Pirate Roberts, presumed dead. This depresses Buttercup somewhat, who has only recently decided that he is eternally in love with the boy, and she had decided to marry him.Buttercup is thereafter kidnapped by a trio of kid's movie-awesome, Fizzick, Vizzini and Inigo Montoya. Fizzick is the mostest awesome Andre the Giant, now deceased. I am not sure if he tried to be funny or just deadpanned his way to eternal coolness, but either way he is hilarious in this from the first line he utters until the last. Inigo Montoya is also supercool and has possibly the most honourable and single minded quest in film history, and even Vizzini, the weasely self-dubbed genius who masterminds the kidnapping operation.So after this set up rather than worry about putting events in order, I thought I'd list a grab-bag of the noteworthy events and scenes that face Westley, Buttercup and the gang:- Shrieking eels. - Left handed sword fights - Vengeance - Death by poisoning - Quicksand - Killer giant rats - Torture - WWF wrestlers in Robin Hood style outfits - A six fingered man - Vendettas - Being revived from the dead.And furthermore, this film has a myriad of quotable lines that hold up after watching the film time and time again, not least of which is "Inconthievable", (should be inconceivable but must be said with a lithp).So to summarise I heartily recommend that even the cynical among you take a break from torture porn (hopefully only watching it) and pointless movie clichés, and watch a kid's movie where the finale simply involves; storming a castle, stopping a wedding, saving the damsel, avenging a father's death, reviving the dead and finding "twoo wuv"!You might even enjoy it.Final Rating ? 8.5 / 10. I am old, cynical and overly critical. There is no way I should like this so much, yet I just do.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film as a teenage girl and was instantly enchanted. Occasionally, things just GEL -writing, direction, music, casting- in a way that words cannot really describe. This was one of those movies.Goldman does a brilliant job of giving us a satirical fairy-tale that is not so heavy on "satire" that is steals the enchantment and romance. The swordfighting scenes are probably among the best that have ever been captured on film. The romance is beautiful (between two beautiful people; Mr. Elwes and Ms. Wright (now Wright-Penn) are, as director Rob Reiner describes them in his commentary, "two of the better-looking people on the planet"). And, leaving aside our maturity and independence, what woman was not once a girl who daydreamed about falling in love with and being saved by a dashing hero and being given a kiss like the ones shared by our couple in this film? There are classics "for their time", and there are classics of all-time; this belongs in the all-time category.</fullReview>

The cast is especially great and all actors fit each part to a "T". A young Robin Wright-Penn is able to display her versatile and talented acting ability. Mild language, that will hardly be noticed because the viewer will be paying attention to the surroundings. This movie is highly recommended for young and old as well as male or female.

		<fullReview>This is simply the greatest movie ever made!! Ever since I first watched this movie (so long ago that I don't even remember when that was) this has been a part of me and the way I live! The Princess Bride was originally written in 1973 as a novel by the Academy Award winning screenwriter, William Goldman. It was witty, romantic, and adventurous, in short: a perfect story. It looked like it could also spawn a spectacular movie. Or so Goldman thought. But for almost fifteen long years his efforts to turn it into a film ran into a wall of bad luck. Many times he almost got the film off the ground, and just as many times the production company would go under or the director would get sick. Finally, a nearly unknown director in the cinematic world stepped up and attempted to catch the eye of Mr. Goldman. His name was Rob Reiner, creator of the cult classic Spinal Tap. To Goldman's delight, Reiner had almost exactly the same great vision of the Princess Bride as himself! He immediately saw that his favorite work would blossom in Reiner's hands. And so, the movie we know today was cast and put into production.The cast was full of little known players, but each one was tailor fitted to their parts. After having seen the auditions of over 200 girls, Goldman knew as soon as she stepped into the room that Robin Wright was the one he'd been looking for to play the beautiful Buttercup. Cary Elwes was plucked out of the obscurity of c-grade film and became the swashbuckling, witty, and handsome Westley. The great comedians Billy Crystal and Wallace Shawn were given the much-loved parts of the wisecracking Miracle Max and the furious and "smart" (he considered Plato and Aristotle morons) Vizzini. Tony Award winner Mandy Patinkin and lovable giant Andre were cast as the revengeful Spanish swordsman Inigo Montoya and lovable giant Fezzik. The rest of the cast was filled out with other superb actors from Peter Falk and Fred Savage as the hilarious Grandfather and grandson duo, to the Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon as the cold, pain loving villains. All in all, The Princess Bride has one of the greatest casts I have ever seen! Add to this the amazing score by Mark Knopfler and (despite the low 16 million dollar budget) it looked like there was no way the Princess Bride could fail at the box office when it was released in 1987! Unfortunately, it was only a modest success, earning about 30 million total. But since then, great change for the better has come its way. Now, almost 30 years from its release, The Princess Bride has one of the largest fan bases ever and is considered by many as one of the best ever to come out of Hollywood.Throughout time, the cult-classic has entertained millions and it's not hard to see why! With one of the freshest and most quotable scripts and a perfect cast, this is "not just your basic, average, everyday, ordinary, run-of-the-mill, ho-hum fairytale!" In the words of Vizzini himself, it is simply "Inconceivable!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I'm an adult. I realize there have been better films made. But, I saw this film hundreds of times growing up and I can still watch it today and be just as entertained. Personally, I don't think Cary Elwes has done anything since that is as enjoyable to watch as his portrayal of Westley. I think it was geniusly cast. Robin Wright(later Robin Wright Penn) is very young here and her role is really secondary to Elwes' but, it's interesting to see her coming into her own. In my opinion, she actually goes on to do more interesting work. This film also has Billy Crystal, Mandy Patinkin, Christopher Guest(of A Mighty Wind, Waiting for Guffman, Best In Show, This Is Spinal Tap), Chris Sarandon and pro wrestling super star, Andre the Giant. How on earth can you go wrong? It also has Fred Savage(of Wonder Years) and Peter Falk as grandson and grandfather reading the story. Honestly, that's my least favorite part--the interruptions by Savage and Falk. Just give me more of Westley and Buttercup!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some forms of fantasy are pure escapism. Other forms use magic and myth to promote social consciousness. And then there's The Princess Bride, a film and book that exists in a class all its own. This is my favourite film of all time. Really, what more could you want: pirates, sword fights, giants &amp; true love!! From the Cliffs of Insanity through the Fire Swamp and down into the pit of despair, this incredible journey and brilliant tale is peppered with strange beasties monstrous and gentle, and surprises both terrible and sublime. And it's really funny! I have watched this film over and over again since I was a child and could never get bored of it.</fullReview>

(but, like most, i trust, my top five contains something on the order of a few dozen films.) you will love this film and its lines will become a part of your daily verbage.

		<fullReview>Good writing, clever plot, damn funny and campy. Director Rob Reiner's on top of his game. The casting was visionary --not one forgettable actor/character. The cast along with their "winking at the camera" reminds me of another of my favorites Silverado. A quick check with IMDb finds that most of the cast are still active 20 years hence. (Andre the Giant passed away in 1993.) All movies need a really good bad guy. PB has two lovable evil-doers --the King (Chris Sarandon) and Count'em Six-Fingers (Christopher Guest). Robin Wright Penn (married to Sean Penn) is not only a classic beauty, which this role called for, but she is a fine actress and plays Princess Buttercup nicely. Mark Knopfler's score is tasty. My wife and I just watched it for the umteenth time on our new projector and 80" screen, with sound on a high-end Bose system. We can die now, or maybe after a sequel.

		<fullReview>What a great movie! I loved this movie as a kid and I still love it now. The characters (and actors chosen to play them), the story, the present-day "commentary" - all just make this movie a classic, unforgettable movie.And if you liked the movie, you should really read the book. It is just as good - better even. William Goldman wrote both the book and the screenplay for the movie so little is lost between the two in overall story. However, the book provides additional description and back story that's just not possible in the film. The book simply enriches the film - that's how I like to think of it anyway.Obviously I read the book after seeing the movie. But if for some (strange) reason you haven't seen this movie yet and decide to read the book first, I can't imagine that the movie will disappoint. How could it?? It's just a classic any which way. And Goldman did write both book and screenplay.Bottom line - I saw the movie and read the book over 15 years ago but BOTH continue to be on my list of absolute favorites.</fullReview>

It's charm lies in the strong characters all the way around and the supporting cast is phenomenal.I do have to say that for smaller children there are a couple of scenes besides kissing that they may not want to see or the parents may not want them to see.

		<shortDescription>My favorite fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that "The Princess Bride" is probably the best fairy tale presented on screen since John Boorman's "Excalibur" (1981). Of course there's been plenty of other's I've left out, but this all just squarely my opinion. William Goldman seemed to really have a ball writing the book the film is based off, as well as the screenplay. Rob Reiner directs, much in the same league as "Stand By Me" the previous year, with some pretty hard laughs. But what gets me loving this picture so much is the portrayal of true love. Let me explain: I've never had a girlfriend, which allows me to relate to the main character and his experiences in a number of ways: Westley (Cary Elwes) is the "farm boy" for the lovely Buttercup (Robin Wright), who takes nearly every opportunity to insult him and realizes one day, out of the blue, she loves him. But Westley journeys across the ocean to collect a fortune and is attacked by pirates and presumed killed in the fray. Buttercup sinks to the lowest level of grief, and finds companionship with arrogant Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), who forces her into an unwilling marriage. But a mysterious figure known only as the Dread Pirate Roberts (could it be Westley in disguise?) appears on the scene and along with two others including the vengeance-driven Spanish fencer Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and the towering Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant), they seek to rescue Buttercup. "The Princess Bride" is pure fun from start to finish, and the cast (what a cast - many of whom are American - faking their best European accents) seems to be having a ball. But love is what is at the center, and that's what I find the most impressive. Every classic fairy tale has such qualities and "The Princess Bride" satirizes each trait and then some more. A classic, lovely story, "The Princess Bride."10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies ever made! It has all the elements of a fairy tale and/or medieval epic, but it's made with tongue firmly planted in-cheek, so it's completely enjoyable for everyone. It's a favorite of several family members of all ages. You can find romance, fighting, chivalry, classic villains, classic heroes/heroines, sidekicks, and incredible characters and beasts. Not to mention the quotability factor. I can think of about ten lines off the top of my head that are instantly recognizable. I recommend it to everyone, no matter your age or taste in movies!Westley, a poor farm boy, falls in love with beautiful Buttercup and sails off to seek his fortune in America. Upon word of Westley's death, Buttercup becomes engaged to Prince Humperdinck, the heir to the throne who cares mainly about his love of the hunt and fighting. When Buttercup is kidnapped by a trio of goons, Humperdinck tracks her, only to find her in the arms of the mysterious Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup returns with the Prince, but what will happen to the Dread Pirate Roberts? Will Buttercup ever find true love? Is the Prince really what he seems?With great performances from the entire cast--Robin Wright Penn, Billy Crystal, Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant (born for this role), Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest--Cary Elwes still shines as the understated, but hilarious hero. You can watch this a million times and never get tired of it.</fullReview>

The actual killing of people is not something that needs to be watched as much as the rest does. I thought about editing these parts out, but that is complicated I am told. A slight edit would give this a perfect 10.I cry happy tears every time I enjoy this movie, and just today I bought the DVD to replace the much worn VHS copy that has served well.Of all movies in the last 20 years I vote this in the top 10, at least.Enjoy it!</fullReview>

Most things and people looked real, and the things that didn't, you didn't mind, because it didn't ruin much of the effect of what the scene tried to convey.

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride to this day has remained a family classic. One where I watched time and time again with my father and sister. A family that you can rent at the video store if you want to have a family movie night. A perfect movie for both grownups and children. The Princess Bride is similar to Pirates of the Carrabean for the fact that both movies you can watch over and over again and never get tired of and both always puts you in a good mood-but that of course is where the similarities ends. The Princess bride starts off the the Grandfather visiting his Grandson when the kid is sick. At first disgusted with the fact that he got a book for a present instead of something like a baseball he then humors the grandfather by allowing him to read the book. In the beginning the kid is skeptical of the story "this isn't a kissing book is it?" but then slowly gets into the story and is mesmerized by the tale interupting the Grandfather and parts he doesn't like saying "Im telling you your messing up the story!" and truly becoming involved in the book. Just like the Neverending Story it is told by a narrater- Peter Falk aka the Grandfather-but that still doesn't take away the magic of the film.There are so many terrific characters.Vizzini-the Sicilian who's the brain of the trio criminals Inigo Mantoya- the Spaniard who has been studying fencing in order to avenge his fathers death and works for Vizzini because "theres not a lot of money in the revenge business" and has become infamously known for his line "Hello my name is Inigo Mantoya, you killed my father prepare to die." Fezzik: the Warm hearted giant who doesn't like violence. "Its not my fault I'm the biggest and the strongest, I don't even exercise." and has a knack for rhyme. "Fezzik are there rocks ahead?" "If we are we all be dead!" "No more rhymes now I mean it!" "Anybody want a peanut?" The Man in Black- who wears a mask because "they're terribly comfortable. I believe everyone well be wearing them in the future. A hilarious and brilliantly written duel scene between him and Inigo Then the two lovers Buttercup-who gets captured by the trio criminals because she is the princes fiancé and Westleys-famous words As You wish "Which really means I love" who was supposedly killed by pirates "Killed by pirates is good!"-so says the kid. But was he? Then lets us not forgot Mirical Max played by the fantastic Billy Crystal and his wife. "Oh true love is the greatest thing in the world, except for MLT. Mutton, Lettuce, Tomato, when the Mutton is so ripe and juice I love it...." "Don't rush me sonny, you rush you get rotten miracles." and of course his wife. "Bye bye boys have fun storming the castle." "You think it will work?"-his wife "It will take a miracle. bye bye!" And let us not forget Prince Humperdink "Teron You know how I love to watch your work but I have my wedding to plan, my wife to murder and Gilder to frame for it, I'm swamped." As well as the six fingered man, the Honorable Clergyman as well as theAlbino and the watchman. All play fantastic and memorable roles. And the plot is wonderful. Buttercups capture, storming the castle and avenging a fathers death, and of course true love. Truly this is a film to see and if you haven't yet you are missing out on an incredible journey and adventure of "fencing, torture, revenge, giants true love, miracles....s"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride, starring Robin Wright Penn, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest is the perfect combination of satire, adventure, fantasy, romance, drama, mystery, action, comedy, 'kisses' and physical comedy. Truly one of the best loved movies of all time, The Princess Bride lives up to its reputation, perhaps exceeds it.The Princess Bride is a story about Buttercup, who calls in love with a Farmboy named Westley. Unfortunately, he had no money for marriage and set off to seek his fortune. On his way, he was reportedly murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup is devastated and never forgets her lost love. Meanwhile, the evil Prince Humperdinck selects poor Buttercup as his new bride. Buttercup does not love him, but Humperdinck assures her that their love will grow. Will she ever find happiness? Will she ever see Westley again? Combining dead-on perfect casting, superb direction, an impeccable comedic script and sumptuous visuals, The Princess Bride is a marvelous piece of cinematic storytelling that, thanks to its brilliant combination of childlike wonder and adult sarcasm (that in itself being a great feat), is accessible to viewers of all ages, and something you can watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bar none, the best movie of any genre I've ever seen. Indeed, this movie has no "genre" per se. Elements of romance, adventure, action and comedy are seamlessly woven together to create this masterpiece. Mandy Patinkin and Billy Crystal give the performances of their careers. The rest of the ensemble cast turn in great performances as well.This movie is considered to be the "Wizard of Oz" of my generation, in that it was not received well when it first opened. I attribute this in part to the lack of a distinct genre category (which in this case is a *strength* of the movie) and in part to the title, which is an unfortunate side-effect of writer William Goldman's initial inspiration on the project. If you are put off by the title, get over it. You will love this movie, and like the rest of us you'll find yourself quoting it frequently in conversation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every word in this movie is the right word. Not a single character is made to be stupid for the sake of being easily dealt with; even the most incidental villain is clever, requiring the heroes to be more clever. Casting is inspired, with Robin Wright Penn as princess-ly as any woman has ever been, ( I wouldn't be surprised if Sean Penn fell in love immediately watching her entrance in the film), Andre the Giant getting my award for best performance ever by a professional wrestler, and Mandy Patinkin so perfect in action, look and word that I eternally forgive him for being such a arrogant jerk on talk shows. MORE IMPORTANTLY: This film has strong life lessons seamlessly built in: Grace under pressure, honor in all dealings, skepticism without cynicism, and the real power of faith and love are among the many plot underpinnings making "Princess Bride" perhaps the best movie ever for the whole family to watch together,(aside from perhaps keeping the baby's eyes shut when the big rats are on screen).</fullReview>

Unlike the moronic comedies of today, it shows that you don't have to be an idiot or make characters have a below par intelligent to be funny. Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin is a great combination. Although Billy Crystal is only in the movie momentarily, he is still hilarious. The fencing scene is definitely the epitome of choreography.

		<fullReview>You haven't seen The Princess Bride? Incontheiveable! Clearly you've fallen for one of the classic blunders, the most famous of which is never get involved in a land war in Asia ...I first saw this as a student on the eve of my finals, and it was the perfect antidote to pre-exam nerves. Since then I must have watched it ... oh, I dunno, maybe 30 times. Which sounds terribly sad, I know, but I just feel the need to get other people to watch it, and - well - I end up watching it too.Basically, it's just terribly funny, but also - and here's the thing - it works as a fairy tale too. Admittedly, it would be perfectly nauseating without the subversive wit and huge silliness, but when combined the result is irresistible.A word of warning to the uninitiated - give it 20 minutes to get into the swing of it. It can take that long to realize that this film has its tongue firmly in its cheek.My favourite lines? So hard to choose. Q: 'You don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?' A: 'Do you always begin conversations this way?' Or how about: 'You mean you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword and we'll kill each other like civilized people.' But I think the honours have to go to 'I'm not saying I'd like to build a holiday home here, but some of the trees are really quite lovely'.Oddly enough, I'm not left-handed either.Spread the word.</fullReview>

Nearly 20 years later, people can't say "Inconcievable!" without affecting Wallace Shawn's distinctive lisp. There are no big names in this film, no big special effects either, but it does have one of the best sword fights since Errol Flynn versus Basil Rathbourne in the Adventures of Robin Hood. It's a small film with a huge following. You only have to read the other reviews to see how much this film is loved. People are practically begging you to go see it and share in the infectious joy it brings! Do your self a favour. Seek out this film and watch it.

		<shortDescription>My favorite of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can consider this to either be ONE of my favorite OR my FAVORITE movie of all time. I first heard of this movie because my brother had to do a project playing the part of Indigo Montoya. I used to remember him reciting the verse," My name is Indigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die." When my brother bought this movie from Savon Drugs, I had the chance to watch the movie with him. Boy, it was seriously the only movie that made me laugh hard. I would say my favorite character was Cary Elwes' Wesley. His charm and smart wit made him such an admirable character. His character is one my favorite movie heroes of all time. Indigo Montoya and his giant friend were a comedic duo. Their actions and performances were cute and ,at the same time, hilarious. Performances were great, and had the touch of charm to children. I watched this when I was 8 years old, and I found myself watching this movie over and over again on TV and on VHS. It's an instant charm to children and adult alike. I was also happy that Fred Savage, I think that was his name, was in the movie as the little boy. I always liked him, after watching him in Wonder Years. This movie should always be placed in the best children classics of all time. I don't really know the movie's or book's aim, ( I think it was a parody to classic fairy tales), but the director sure did make this movie as good as it can get. I'm expecting myself to get the DVD soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankyou Willliam Goldmam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my Comfort Movie! It deserves all the accolades heaped upon it and yes! Inigo gets all the best lines. Everybody involved is on top form and I cannot praise it highly enough. I have never believed in the theory of auteurism but sometimes you can see someones imprint in a movie. In this case I would credit William Goldman as the creator of original story and screenplay. I confess to being a fan of William Goldman before I saw this movie for his books as much as his screenplays (originals and adaptions) and his book on screenplay writing (Adventures in the Screen trade) is the definitive guide. But as he would agree a great movie is a combination of talents and here everyone is at their best. Watch and enjoy! Andrew</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really is the perfect fairytale Giants, Swordsmen, Pirates, True Love, Monsters, Kidnap, An evil Prince and a beautiful Princess this movie had it all. I remember as a child I recorded this and watched it again and again I cried when the tape got eaten by the machine(Thank goodness for DVDs).I have loved this movie since I was about six years old and it has improved with age, some of the jokes seem so much funnier now. I love to watch it with my little brother because we can both enjoy it even if it is for different reasons sometimes.I recommend it to everyone I can think of very few people who wouldn't enjoy it and the actors are all brilliant Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright-Penn, Peter Falk, Mel Smith and Billy Crystal all have the comedy while remaining true to the fairy tale ideal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Is this a kissing book?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Re: the spoiler warning. I put it there just to be safe, because I do discuss one or two plot details. But if you really haven't seen this movie yet, go out and do it. Right now.) Tonight, I had the pleasure of revisiting the movie that has been my favorite since I was a young middle schooler. Each time I watch The Princess Bride, I appreciate it more and more. When I was younger, I was always captured by the beautiful love story between Buttercup and Westley, and I thrilled at his daring escapades to fight through anything, even death (mostly death, at least), to get his true love back from the nasty Prince Humperdinck. Now, dozens of viewings and several readings of the book later, I can appreciate it for its witty asides, the way it gently pokes fun at some conventions of the fantasy genre without being mean-spirited or cynical. I marvel at what might be the best cameo role ever, the Impressive Clergyman. But most of all, I wonder how I can still be drawn into a love story that has its feet so firmly planted in the realm of fantasy; how can it become so real to me every time I watch this film? Because it is so wonderfully acted, written, and directed, and this combination of factors creates a magic that can still make an old girl like me swoon. Of course, the movie has its share of flaws (weird '80s synthesizers in the soundtrack? obvious shots of body doubles doing gymnastics in the Man-in-Black/Inigo fencing scene??), but...well, I really don't care. The good parts of the movie are enough to overcome any complaint I may have.As a parting shot, if you love this movie, you really ought to read the book by William Goldman...erm, S. Morgenstern. It's even better!! (Yes, young Fred Savage, it is a kissing book; but most of us wouldn't have it any other way.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this movie on TV last night after not seeing it for many years. Intending to watch a few minutes, I watched the entire thing and remembered how wonderful this movie truly is. You can watch it on a date, with kids, with friends, it fits any viewing audience. Without a doubt, it is the perfect movie.Cary Elwes is perfectly cast as the brave, witty Westley. He's daring, bold, knows how to charm the ladies, and not bad with a sword. The bad guys, Andre the Giant and company, all give fun performances. Somehow whenever these guys are fighting with Westley, there's friendly, humorous dialog taking place. It's done in a charming way that keeps the viewed engaged but disappointed that someone has to lose the fight. Worth mentioning Rob Wright (Penn). Her character is kind of bratty but engaging and absolutely glamorous. You can't tell this was her first feature flick, good work on her part.On the flip side, you have Peter Falk and Fred Savage. Falk is just cool, there's nobody quite like him. He may always be known as Columbo but his voice is perfect for the narration and adds so much to an already stellar film. And it's too bad Savage had to grow up. It's strange that he was a has been at what, 15? Good casting on both parts, you had the sense that those two really had a close relationship.I don't know want to go on too much more about the individual characters because nobody gives a dull performance. Christopher Guest as the six fingered man, Billy Crystals cameo as Miracle Max, there's no mistaking that New York accent. Every person added a little something and deserves credit. The set design was magnificent, the music added to the playfulness and helps create a world of it's own. This movie is the perfect fantasy tale and Rob Reiner gets high accolades in my book. I doubt there's a person alive over 10 and under 50 that hasn't seen this one. This movie is absolutely stunning and it sets a bar that other directors should reach. One of the best feel good movies of all time and absolutely timeless. This one will hold up until the end of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Princess Bride yesterday, and liked it. When I first heard about watching this movie, I was all, "Blah, another stupid movie to watch," but when I started watching it, I got more and more excited. When the part with Fezzik and everyone showed, I instantly recognized one of the most popular WWE superstars, Andre The Giant and I was shocked. The best scene was when Buttercup was about to kill herself and then she hears Westley talk to her and stops. Also when Vizzini says "Inconcievable" so many times. I rate the movie 8.5/10 just because there were so many goofs and errors, otherwise it would be 10/10.</fullReview>

The music fits very well and the humor cracks me up. I would this movie to anyone and I often do. As a 37 year old male, I don't fit the under 29 female fan base that one reviewer refers to. It doesn't matter your age or sex, this is a great movie. How can you not like a movie that has sword fighting, vengeance, and true love? The casting is great, every character is a joy to watch. I enjoy it every time I watch it and I don't need to watch it, I can see it in my head, line for line. everyone should watch this movie, I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't like this movie.</fullReview>

The acting is good and although the title seem like a "chick Flick" I myself have enjoyed every minute of it. Young and old alike can enjoy this movie over and over again. Although this film has not gotten as much attention as it rightly deserves it a must-see for all those who love a good comedy or even a good storyline. This film has completely changed the way that i look at movies and has, in my mind, changed the comedy genre forever. If ever you have the opportunity to see this movie do not pass it up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite film of all time ! I've loved it since the first time i saw it which was when i was about 4 years old. Now i am 14 and still adore it. My favourite character is Fezzik (Andre the Giant). And i am so sad to have heard that he is dead now :(:( Cary Elwes plays a great part and is the most good looking of the actors in the film of its day. I love the bit near the end where Inigo and Count Rougen are fighting and Inigo won't stop saying 'My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.' He says it about 10 times i swear it is so funny. Pity he gets stabbed at the end. He doesn't die though. You know what, they should bring out a Princess Bride PS2 game...what a great idea. I recommend this film to anyone, it has many different genres, even romance. There is bound to be something you like about it. Definitely a total must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is an absolutely tremendous film and the quintessential adventure movie. It has pirates, betrayal, intrigue, torture, swordplay, revenge, and true love.The screenplay for this movie is the standard by which all other films should be judged. Every line of the script is memorable and quotable, without having inane catch phrases. (I mean, when is the last time you saw somebody called a "hippopotamic landmass") The plot is well-constructed with tension, opposition, and innovation.The acting is superb. From the bit parts to the leads, every role is perfectly casted.The only real drawbacks in the film are special effects and the synthesized orchestration of the music. It would have been better with actual instruments. Even the shortcomings in special effects are endearing, though. The Rhodents of Unusual Size are not exactly the pinnacle of cinematic realism, but it's hard to imagine the movie without them as they are.Simply put. Everybody should own this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A love story narrated by Peter Falk for his sick grandson, a young Fred Savage came to theaters in 1987, now available on DVD. But don't think this is your typical love story ? that wouldn't keep nine year old boy entertained ? no it's much more! Murder, revenge, sword fights, a giant, a pirate, torture, and don't forget a little magic from Billy Crystal! "As you wish!" The love story is key but not the only piece of this tale. With help from a great cast Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patikin, Robin Wright Penn, and Chris Sarandon. They create a kingdom with brutes, R.O.U.S.'s, the cliffs of insanity, and more.My favorite part of the movie is probably when they have to go visit Miracle Max, played by Billy Crystal. He has a lot of great one liners and he and his wife play off each other well. She maybe even be funnier than him.There's also a great scene when Shawn and Elwes have a battle of the minds, with poison.Brad Laidman of Film Threat calls it one of the greatest date rentals of all time. I definitely agree with this because it's a sweet and semi-romantic but also laugh out loud funny. A great combination.Rob Reiner of When Harry Met Sally fame directs this comedic fantasy. It's a timeless, simple story that always makes me smile. Don't forget, "His name is Inigo Montoya. You killed his father: prepare to die."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sports, fighting, giants... true love.... This may be one the greatest stories ever told since Jesus of Nazareth. It has every element imaginable. Good for all ages, this is the ultimate family-friendly movie. Funny, yet romantic, dramatic, yet filled with action... Andre the Giant, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and the beautiful Robin Wright make a wonderful team. The casting was perfect. The amazing thing is the lack of computer generated special effects that filled most movies from the late 80's on is not missed at all in this wonderful movie. This is one of the all-time greatest movies that will only continue to grow throughout the generations, should be compared with the Wizard of Oz, Gone with the wind.</fullReview>

I now have my own "Wesley" to love always.We even considered being funny at our wedding and hiring someone to sound like the priest that tried to marry Prince Humperdink and Princess Buttercup, but unfortunately no one with those skills could be found.I have finally found my "true love" and I owe it all to this movie!

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the Princess Bride. It's not a complicated film, simple in plot, boy loves girl, loses girl, gets girl back,looses her again..ah love. Throw in a former vampire as King Humperdink, three jolly good fellas trying to do the kings bidding ( Andre the Giant is just that, himself..what else can you be other?)The characters intermingle on their own agenda's,until they meet Wesley,who must rescue his beloved,from Humperdink, who has his own foul plans for the princess bride. Peter falk reading the story is a nice touch, he's reading the story to a grandchild,that's not really sure to listen or not. In the beginning, it's doubtful if you want to watch. As you go on, the film draws you in,and you begin to actually enjoy the humor and at times corny parts,and wonder will Wesley die? Will the five fingerd murder be found and brought to justice? Will the Princess bride marry Humperdink, will she live or die at his hand? Can Wesley over come all, and rescue her? Other than at times feeling a little hurried, the film has an honesty that you can watch with your kids.Throughly delightful film.</fullReview>

I actually have hundreds of DVD. What I want to explain it that PB is one of my favourite movie, really wonderful. It doesn't matter how old the movie is, soundtrack is great, characters too. But maybe the best thing is about the story: they tried to make an ironic story about fairy tales, and they obtained one of the best films ever made. I consideer it was only a lucky time: something similar to make a second part of a film, you can get the best, but maybe you can obtain the worst film ever made (Star wars 1, don't you think). It is not only the story, but the script, characters, actors/actreeses, and about everything, director.I can say this movie is one of my favourites.

		<fullReview>If you watch this movie while in a serious mood, you will most certainly not enjoy it. However, if you enjoy intentionally cheesy entertainment, witty dialogue, and some horrendously bad special effects, you have to see it.The movie starts on the farm of a beautiful woman named Buttercup. We see her treat the farmhand, Westley, quite heartlessly. As time goes on, we see her fall in love with the handsome young farmhand who has loved her from the beginning.Westley has to leave the farm to earn some money so that the two of them could be together. Later Buttercup catches word that Westley has been killed by the infamous Dread Pirate Roberts. It is after this that Buttercup is chosen by the Prince Humperdink to be his bride. She moves to the King's castle and one day, while riding her horse, she is kidnapped by a rogue band of misfits. It is here the adventure begins as a masked man begins tracking the misfits. What follows is a delightful sequence of adventure, action, and cheese.This movie is a classic that will be around for decades to come. I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

It has some of the cheesiest lines EVER and gets away with it. The main hero is the coolest, smarmiest hero of all time who is truly irrepressible. If you like Westley then you will love Prince Humperdinck who is everything Westley isn't. If this film were made today the only improvement they could make would be to the scenery and add some nice effects. I can't wait for my daughters to be of an age to appreciate the dry wit of this legendary film. A film for adult and child alike, enjoy.</fullReview>

Those who find it too 'corny' or otherwise bereft of cinematic perfection are taking the film too seriously - or taking themselves too seriously. The movie's message (and this reviewer's message) contains a nugget we should all remember - lighten up!Rob Reiner directed this 1987 movie based on the book of the same name, written by William Goldman, who also penned the screenplay. The movie has a very simplistic thrust: true love conquers all, especially in this light-hearted, fluffy comedy. Cary Elwes plays Westley, a poor farm boy in Florin who pines for the farm girl he serves, Buttercup (Robin Wright-Penn early in her career). Their fairy tale of true love and its trials and tribulations are narrated by a Grandfather (Peter Falk) to his sick Grandson (pre-Wonder Years Fred Savage). The unlikely romance between Buttercup and Westley is interrupted when Westley is presumed killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup, left alone and empty, agrees to marry Florin's Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) when he chooses her to be his bride, until a sinister plot to kidnap her and start a war with a neighboring country leads to a series of odd little discoveries and the introduction of a host of supporting characters that make this film highly witty and truly original.The plot is simplistic, and the acting is "hammy" - but to a purpose. This is a perfectly executed comedy that creates a lovable cast of characters and a series of memorable one-liners and snappy dialogue. Who can forget Mandy Patinkin's Inigo Montoya and his quest to avenge his father by challenging his slayer, Count Rugen, the six-fingered man (Christopher Guest), to an epic duel: "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya - You killed my father. Prepare to die!" Or, Wallace Shawn's self-important Vizzini who, in his intelligence, finds everything "inconceivable." Or, a noteworthy appearance by Peter Cook as the Impressive Clergyman using one of his silly voices. More importantly, Westley and Buttercup's romance is touching without being sappy and reminds us all of the importance of true love.I love this movie. It's a movie the whole family can enjoy, with no objectionable language, violence, or other questionable elements. It's extremely funny (even after watching it dozens of times) with a bit of a screwball flair. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but it's one of those movies I will always cherish for its sweet but simple story. To nay-sayers, skeptics, or movie snobs: give it a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do I begin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adore this movie. Purely, simply, truly.I first saw it when I was a little girl, and didn't understand the true comedy behind the direction, acting, and plot. It did make me laugh though, and I was swept away in Westley and Buttercup's romance.I went through a looong time of not seeing it again, but once I did, I fell in love all over again. The acting, the score, the satire, the love story. I have seen it countless times since then. I have worn out two VHS copies, and I now finally have the DVD.The chief success of The Princess Bride is that it is a satire that you care about, that moves you. Though it pokes fun at the situations and characters, by the end, when they ride away on the four white horses, you feel genuinely transported, and enamored of Inigo, Fezzik, Buttercup, and Westley. I still get a wave of happiness every time I watch this part, and a goofy-happy smile and sense of well-being every time I see this movie.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wish I Were A "Princess".......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard people talking about "The Princess Bride" on "I Love The 80s: Strikes Back". I'd heard people talking about it when I was younger even. And I'd always heard the word classic when they were talking about it. Yet, I'd never seen this flick. A travesty, I know.One day, while I was SUPER bored and doing nothing, I happened to come across "The Princess Bride" on the WE channel. I figured "Well, it's just starting. So why not?". Besides, if I didn't like it, I could just flip it, right?Five minutes into the movie, and I'm BAWLING hysterically at the thought of Buttercup losing Westley forever at the hands of the Dread Pirate Roberts. And thus, I began the adventure that is "The Princess Bride".This movie is a wonderfully refreshing take on the classic fairytales that everyone grew up with. It spoofs them, but it does it so well that you don't feel cheated or offended. And I just loved how the story was presented. The story is introduced as just that, a story. A grandfather comes to his sick grandson's bedside to read the book that he used to read to his own son. The fairytale of Buttercup and Westley really IS a fairytale. And what's better than that, really?The characters, you absolutely fall in love with. Westley is simply the perfect man and one of the most perfect characters, in my opinion. Just the first utterance of the infamous line, "As you wish.", and I was just a puddle on the couch. Buttercup plays a princess you can relate to. Fezzik the Giant, lovable. And Inigo Montoya, probably one of the best characters. His story was the one that was probably my favorite out of the movie. Just awesome. I totally rooted for him the entire time he was looking for "The Six Fingered Man". Plus, he's got one of the coolest quotes of the film.This movie is just good entertainment and is complete family fare. You can watch it with everyone and be able to enjoy it. I was laughing, I was in suspense, and I was CERTAINLY in tears more than once. The story is just so sweet and so loving, truly classic.You will absolutely fall in love with this movie. And TOTALLY wish you were Robin Wright. It's full of everything that great stories and movies are made of.And, believe me, you WILL trip to watch "The Princess Bride" over and over.......as you wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long time ago I saw part of this film. Well, it was very little, actually, the only part I saw was where Inigo fought the count at the end and kept repeating that phrase. At the time, I thought it was a serious movie, and thus I simply rolled my eyes and switched the channel. It looked awfully cheesy. Hmm. Well, it just so happens that the film was aired on television, again, today and I decided to watch it. But by the time I started to watch it, I still wasn't sure wether or not it was a serious movie. But I had heard some good things about it, so, why not? Here's the plot:A young girl and a stable boy fall in love. But since they are poor, they must seek treasures so that they can marry each other. The boy, whose name is Westley, sets out on a quest to find riches. But when he doesn't return, and the girl (Buttercup) recieves the word that his ship has been attacked by pirates, she thinks he is dead. Six years later, the King decides that he wants Buttercup as his bride, and there is nothing she can do about it but simply must cope with it, even though she still dreams of Westley.So one day when she is out on a ride, she is kidnapped by a pair of criminals, who intend to kill her, in order to spark off a war between two nations. However, they are followed by a masked man, dressed in black, who appears to be an excellent fighter...The film starts off good, and keeps that path throughout the entire film. It's funny, witty, smart, adventerous, action packed and dramatic all at the same time. Rob Reiner has cooked together the perfect recipe for a fantasy/comedy film. Anyone who enjoys a good laugh should really watch this. It's guaranteed to put you in a good mood. The script is also good, as well as the production design which gives us several believable locations. The score is also very good, and always fits the scene it's in. Very good, and gives an additional level to the film, wether it be humerous or dramatic.Cary Elwes plays the perfect Westley. It's like he was born for this part. The other actors are quite good for their parts as well, but I had some problems with André the Giant. I mean, mostly when he talks, you can't even make out what he's saying. In some scenes, it's very annoying. I do want to give some credit to Billy Crystal as well, who is quite funny in the role of Miracle Max, but his appearance is brief.All in all, a very good film. You should see it. Most likely, you'll laugh a couple of times and enjoy the good swordfighting and adventure scenes in this film... Otherwise, Go back to your 3 hour long snore-fest; Lord of the Rings!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throughly enjoyable storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of starting a film and continual flicking to the view of a granddad (Peter Falk) reading a book to his unwell grandson (Fred Savage) isn't new, yet the use of interrupting the story ads a new fresher feel to the mix.I myself watched this film with my Mother when I was (very rarely) off sick from school in 1991. Whilst watching the film and for the rest of the day after, I cannot once recall feeling ill. The score was soft, yet magically purposeful and during the most thrilling accepts of the film, notably the fight sequences (in particular involving Mandy as the Spaniard sword fighter) were really captivating. The vast array of different themes this picture evokes is also a great achievement and stirs up many emotions, leaving few unhappy with the final film. Ultimately its a romance, but its set in fantasy, makes it all the more unusual, but generally more enjoyable. There's a constant act of heroism and revenge, plus humour, wit and gripping thrills (when Westley is still a bit "stiff" in places). Also mystery and intrigue, with the legendary pirate and the tense chase involving the pirate impressively chasing after them up a rope.Having just re-watched it, it looks as if it must have influenced Gladiator and Shrek. The line "My father was ....." is similar to the Maximus speech in Gladiator and the use of daggers can also be reflected.The PG rating is a suitable choice, some craving more might think its missing more nastier material, yet the more adult references can be applied to the rating it has been given, allowing one and all to enjoy it.Finally, the fine choice of actors is great. With typical quick witted humour from Billy Crystal, the continuation of the British theme with Mel Smith and Peter Cook, the reuniting of Christopher Guest with Rob Reiner, a wrestling hero Andre the Giant, the always watchable Cary Elwes, Mandy Patenkin leading the frontier for his respected performance as a Spanish peasant who was recently in The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (what a waste) and the villainous evil (inconceivable) Wallace Shawn who delivers the line: Vizzini: Ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? Westley: Yes Vizzini: Morons.He says the line so quickly, its perfect, which rightly earns a place on the trailer.A few people in this film have interesting worked again with others from this film. Billy Crystal was in When Harry met Sally with the director Rob Reiner and also in This is Spinal Tap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best "movie" movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a movie "snob" who only likes artsy films. In fact, there are few films which I do not enjoy. However, I also appreciate *good* films, the ones that surpass the medium and really deliver what movies are supposed to: Entertainment.And on this account, The Princess Bride is quite possibly the best movie that I have ever seen. It has an excellent balance of character development across a fairly wide array of characters, maintains a steady pace that pulls you through the film while never felling rushed. The sets are lively and feel real, even when the special effects don't ;) It has action, romance, humor, and is a film that any age can enjoy.This was no $200mil superstar blockbuster. It's simply a very good film with no weaknesses. I hope that, if you haven't seen this film, you give it a shot. It's truly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am dispensing with my usual "Final Analysis" because there's no need for it here.Honestly, I did not like this movie. I did not think it was bad (certainly not like how Antoine Fuqua makes a bad movie), but there was something overwhelmingly lacking here.I blame Rob Reiner Goldman for what happened. He frequently goofs projects up with his pedestrian, lethargic manner. Also, there's too much pandering against the modern youth culture. I can appreciate such actions in 'Calvin &amp; Hobbes' when both sides (mostly balanced on the fulcrum of TV) are intelligently handled, but this is too simple. Shame on Goldman.I did not leave this movie feeling like I'd experienced something unique. Disney used the self-irony method for 'Pirates' and had two competent actors to balance Bruckheimer's exuberance. I can see why other people would like this, but I'd just as soon forget it. Scott can make engrossing fantasy, Reiner can't.</fullReview>

It is a wonderful movie overall. Anyone with a heart to enjoy a Fairy Tale, will certainly make this movie one of their top ten favorites. It is in my top 3, which are always rotating. There is not one thing that isn't great about this movie. Once again it is not then main character that make a great movie greater, it is the assembling of great secondary actors and developing their characters and making them interesting. The choices of Shawn Wallace, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant and the impressive Clergy man (Peter Cook) could not have been better.

		<fullReview>THE PRINCESS BRIDE is the story told to a sick boy (Fred Savage) by his grandfather (Peter Falk) one day. In it, a woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and her love Westley (Cary Elwes) are separated by cause of him having to go out and seek his fortune. Buttercup is led to believe that Westley is dead, but he returns five years later, dressed as the Dread Pirate Roberts, and rescues her from three thieves. Westley defeats the first, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), in a fencing duel; the second, Fezzik (Andre the Giant), in a battle of strength; and the third, Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), in a battle of wits. He then claims his prize and they head off to marry, but there is one problem: Buttercup is already arranged to be married to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Westley is captured by the Prince's men and held captive for the ten days prior to Buttercup and the Prince's wedding. Does Westley defeat the men and get the girl?THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is essentially perfect. The story is amazing and romantic, all of the characters are developed and acted to perfection, and all of the other creatures are just fantastical and scary enough to seem real. There are literally almost no flaws in this movie. Just the right bits of humor, romance, action, and fantasy are mixed in, and the result is spectacular. The love story is one of the most romantic and realistic I've ever seen, while the fantasy bits are practically unmatched. Nearly every scene is considered a classic in some way, and the build-up makes the end thoroughly satisfying and amazing. My particular favorite scenes include all of Westley's battles with the men, the ROUSes and the rest of the Fire Swamp, and Mandy Patinkin's classic scene: "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." Rob Reiner is a marvelous director.As for the acting, everyone is... well, perfect. Mandy Patinkin plays probably the most famous character, Inigo Montoya, to perfection, and Andre the Giant is wonderful as the big, but kindhearted, Fezzik. Their accomplice Vizzini is brought well to life by Wallace Shawn. Robin Wright Penn is spectacular, as is Cary Elwes as probably my favorite character of the movie. Wonderful cameos are made by countless celebrites; among them, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, and Peter Cook. The cast is virtually perfect--every part is acted to a tee and brings the story more to life than you'd expect was possible.THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a delightful movie. Hilarious, fun, romantic, charming, thrilling, magical... in a nutshell, almost perfect. It's not the best film I've ever seen, but it ranks right up there and is pure enjoyment in what filmmaking should be. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Flick overall - one complaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the humour in this little tale ... it was a cute story.The characters were diverse and interesting. Billy Crystal was funny and Mandy had a great line. The fencing scenes were even humorous but well done.The sole complaint I have is when the grandson swore at his grandfather. This was really unnecessary, and I would have thought more class from Rob Reiner. I don't know how old Fred Savage was at this point but I can't imagine adults instructing a child to say that. There was one bad edit on Peter Falk when he was preparing to read, from over his shoulder he opened the book, then they cut to a front-on view and he opened the book again. Oops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie more times than I can count. Everything about it is just awesome, and it has helped fill in many wet afternoons growing up with my brother and sister. We all love this movie, with it's corny dialogue, great one-liners and great cameo roles, my favourite of these probably being Billy Crystal's miracle max. The amazing thing has been growing up and finding that many of the people who have become my best friends through high school and university also grew up loving this movie. repeat watchers who like a drink when they go out would also be interested to know that you can make a great drinking game out of sitting and watching this movie. There is a website that you could find just by going to a search engine and typing in Princess Bride drinking game but its not entirely necessary as the basic idea is that whenever a great line is said, such as true love, as you wish, my name is Inigo Montoya, inconceivable etc, everyone has to drink. As well, when Wesley gets pushed down the hill and yells as you wish, you have to finish your vessel, and everytime the old lady goes boo, boo, etc you drink on the boo. Once the movie is finished, whatever you've been drinking will have you off your face drunk and ready for a great night. An unbelievable movie and easily a ten in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie for Kids and Adults (on two different levels)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was in college, and oblivious to what was happening in the "real world" , I could never understand why my sister's children loved this movie, and re-enacted it over and over and over again. Suffice it to say, I had never watched the movie myself--I prided myself on only watching art flicks, and didn't have a TV in my apartment--so I really didn't have a good basis for judgment. Then, ten years later (and a new mom), I again attempted to watch the movie, but couldn't get beyond the first few moments. Now, more than 12 years later, with my daughter a pre-teen, we sat down to watch this movie (which just happened to be showing on our local TV station), and both of us were in hysterics the entire time. I believe this show is one of those cult classic movies and it takes a certain attitude or ambiance to be in the mood to appreciate it, but once you get it, you get it. The humor is on two different levels and there are double entendres everywhere to delight the adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't imagine having a childhood without seeing this movie. I neither remember when I first saw it nor how many times I have seen it. But it's one of my favourite films and I kwon the script nearly by heart. As the grandfather says, the story of The Princess Bride has a wonderful beginning, especially because of the soundtrack. I think Mark Knopfler did a very good job. I love the way the story goes on: Buttercup's kidnapping, Fezzik's rhymes, The Cliffs of Insanity, Westley's fights against the 'villains', the fire swamp (I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here but the trees are actually quite lovely). The Princess Bride has adventure, love, passion, humour, rhymes ;), it's the perfect story to escape from reality. I read the book a couple of months ago, and it really disappointed me, the author's lucubration is lengthy and boring, but I have to admit the beginning is fantastic: This is my favourite book, although I have never read it. Just wonderful.</fullReview>

I was pretty gutted when I found out he was actually American I can tell you, but it's all credit to his acting ability. He's brilliant in all his films in fact. The Princess Bride is very very funny and has the best sword fighting scene in any movie in the world ever ever ever. It has a great script and a great story line, which I think is enhanced by it being so unlikely, that just adds to the fairytale, and it's very beautiful too.

		<fullReview>Very well done, on many levels. A great comedy with wonderful action, and just enough romance. The sword play was beautiful, almost effortless. The score was appropriate. The movie was a childhood favorite of mine, but when I discovered the book a few years ago, the entire story took a new life.The book was a satire which was abridged by William Goldman, originally by S. Morgenstern, and it was wonderfully written. The fact that there is actual history entwined within this fairy tale just adds to the appeal. The movie must be taken as it was meant to be portrayed, as the true comedy is in the nuances of the story.The actors did a superb job of playing their characters, and after reading the book, Andre the Giant play the part of Fezzik beautifully. Wallace Shawn was the embodiment of Vizzini... although less than Italian.As most book to movie transitions go, a good portion of content is lost, but a well made movie nonetheless.By far my favorite movie.10/10</fullReview>

It is for light relief and one big Laugh.The dialogue is great, and if you happen to have a vocab that is respectable, it will be even funnier.

It has everything that anyone could want to see! Romance, Comedy, lovable characters, evil villans, a game of wits, everything! I also have the book, which is written well. I recommend the movie over the book, though, but the books does delve more into the story of Buttercup. I'll just say she did not start out as the most beautiful girl in the world. The movie is so wonderful and some of the characters are still making great movies today. This movie was a huge debut for modern stars, such as Robin Wright and Carey Elwes.

		<fullReview>You really can't argue with casting Andre the Giant as a giant.Actually, you can't argue with much when it comes to "The Princess Bride".The film begins with a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a book to his sick grandkid (Fred Savage). The book is "The Princess Bride", and so we meet the titular princess, Buttercup; her true love, Westley (the wonderful Cary Elwes); and a bevy of good and evil fairy tale beings trying either to bring the lovers together or tear them apart."The Princess Bride" works as both a playful sendup of fairy tales and a smart entry into the genre. William Goldman does a fine job adapting his novel, and director Rob Reiner gracefully mixes comic absurdity with swashbuckling romance. What more could you want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Light, amusing -- a cross between action and stand up comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this video to watch with my 2 sons, who are 10 and 13. All of us enjoyed the movie, though none of us absolutely adored it.I liked the way they interrupted the movie at exactly those points where my boys were becoming uncomfortable to show the little boy who was listening to the story -- as told by his grandfather -- and also becoming uncomfortable. It was uncanny that at the very moment where one of my sons might walk out of the room, the little boy appeared saying he did not like the story. This helped my kids sit through the movie.This also helped prevent the suspense from getting too high for the kids. The suspense was also kept low, because the characters kept pausing to make humourous remarks. There was a kind of odd tension between the movie trying to be an action movie and also trying to be stand up comedy.A lot of the lines were quite funny, though none of us was rolling on the floor. The two leads were incredibly good-looking. I'm surprised they haven't become more famous since then.One thing I didn't like was that the lead woman was depicted as so helpless. At one point the hero was battling giant rodents and the lady just watched. She picked up a large stick but didn't even bonk the creature who was attacking the man she supposedly loved. That was a sexist depiction. I can't imagine any real woman doing the same.This is not a movie that should be watched for its great acting or profound message. It's light and fluffy for a low stress, unintellectual experience. It is very suitable for elementary school age children -- and even my middle schooler seemed ok with it.</fullReview>

LOTS of humor (mostly dry wit, which I love, but I understand that type of humor is not for everyone).Hmmm. I never knew that it was Directed by Rob Reiner, since it became one of my favorites while I was still quite young (15). I'm starting to understand just how great a great filmmaker he is. So far that I know, three of my favorite movies are his: The Princess Bride, Misery, and Stand By Me.BTW, that two of them are also Stephen King adaptations is probably not a coincidence, since he is my favorite author.I give it a 10.</fullReview>

I probably have seen this incredible and unique film hundreds of times and shared it with every person I know. Even in my college dorm we would play it on the weekends. I believe that it is soooo special it will stand the test of time with no hesitation, this movie is my favorite. words cannot describe my love.... for the Princess Bride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a heartwarming comedy adventure. It begins as a typical child playing video games who gets visited by his Grandpa and gets told the story of The Princess Bride. The child hates the initial romance introduction, but grows to enjoy the story. Monty-Python-esque moments follow and the cast are brilliant, most significantly the late Andre The Giant and of course the hero Cary Elwes who played Wesley. These characters amongst others help drive the message home and do a great job of creating drama and tension and at the same time light-hearted quotes. Simply brilliant. They don't make them like this any more.4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is my favorite movie of all time. Ok, so everyone has their favorites. What is so great about this movie is that I have NEVER shown it to someone who didn't immediately love it. Even my sister, who hates movies. This is because it really is great on so many levels. It's an action film, it's a romance, it's a comedy, it's a fantasy, it's.....ok, so it's not a psychological thriller, what do you want!? Clearly the movie is poking fun at itself, but it does such a good job that you almost forget it. Unlike, say Scary Movie, which just relentless makes fun of it's subject, The Princess Bride takes the idea of a Fairy Tale, and laughs WITH it, not AT it. The subtle satire and quick wit sadly can't be found much anymore, which only serves to make this movie even more special. The casting is perfect, with even small roles standing out. If you haven't yet: see this movie! If you don't like it, then it must be either because you just don't get it, or that you have become like the rest of Hollywood, cynical and jaded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but I like the book better. Why?It's all in the details. DETAILS! I want everyone to go and read the fantastic book by William Goldman. The entire time, he's getting you to think it's been written by another person named S. Morgenstern (hence, the guy who wrote the book in the movie). The book is so layered and rich, and the introduction to Westley and Buttercup's romance is so much more complex. And Buttercup is such a BITCH in the book, until she finally realizes the true depth of her love for Westley. They would need to make a miniseries of this to show how truly awesome the book is. My favorite scene in the entire book is sadly excised from the movie. It's the speech that Buttercup makes outside of Westley's hovel when she realizes that she loves him, and the scene following that. It's staggeringly beautiful, and the line, "there have been five great kisses marked down since the invention of the act swept across the world. Well, this one left them all behind," comes during THAT scene, not the end. JUST READ THE BOOK!That being said, I adore the movie. Despite the fact that it hasn't aged very well, it's consistently funny, very single line from the book that I love is there. "I want my father back, you sonofabitch", "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means," and of course, "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." As you can see, I ADORE Mandy Patinkin as Inigo. He's witty, smart, sorrowful, and just plain sexy. And Robin Wright Penn and Cary Elwes are just FANTASTIC as Buttercup and Westley. I've loved Cary ever since I saw him in Robin Hood: Men in Tights. He outdoes himself here. My favorite scene, however, has got to be when Westley fights Fezzik. "I do not envy the headache you will have when you awaken. Until then, sleep well, and dream of large women." LOL! Gotta love Westley!In conclusion, I love the movie. It's one of my favorites. However, if you want the TRUE ending of The Princess Bride (to understand it's touching meaning), read the book.</fullReview>

They don't have to lower themselves to nonstop nudity, swearing, and big explosions as with the typical muck put out these days. The face off between Vizzini and Westley is classic, I just roll with laughter every time. I can only give a higher rating to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003). I know there is lots of violence in them, but the story and drama are totally captivating for 9 hours of film.</fullReview>

And if those guys weren't enough, throw in a makeup-covered-beyond-recognition Billy Crystal, cute little Fred Savage at about age 10, and a stunning array of medieval costumes, scenery and music.

		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is different from your usual fantasy film. It's not as cute as Star Wars or as meaningful as Lord of the Rings. It's just made to entertain you. From the fast, snappy screen-play to the great performance from Mandy Patinkin, this defines good fantasy.The story focuses on two departed loved ones: Westley (Cary Ewles), a farmer boy supposedly killed by pirates and Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) a dim witted girl now being forced to marry Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). Westley returns to take his love back from the evil Prince, and he must face great odds and villains like Count Rugen (Christopher Guest) to do so.Helping him is giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) and vengeful Spainard Indigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin). Patinkin plays Montoya passionately and comedicly, making him the most interesting character in the movie.All in all, The Princess Bride never lets you down. Great movie, 9/10.</fullReview>

I discovered it accidentally when I was about 14, ten years later I still love it and so do all of my friends, okay, one or two don't and I have to admit that it causes some friction, but we try to tolerate them. It's one of those films that you end up quoting all of the time, I can see that it might be annoying when we re-enact the sword fights for the millionth time, but it's fun "HALLO, My name is Inigo Montoya! You killed my father, prepare to die!" It's difficult to say exactly what it is about the film that makes it so good, it's well written, with clever lines, the action is good, the plot works well, the acting is great, it just all works somehow. It's really hard to explain, I mean what could be good about a film where Columbo is reading a bed time story to the kid out of the wonder years? But somehow it just works.

		<fullReview>The reason I love this movie is because it entertains on so many levels. I can enjoy the clever story line and witty dialogue, while the kids love the monsters, action, slapstick humor, and larger-than-life characters. Cary Elwes does a fabulous job of playing with a straight face, while almost winking at the viewer the entire time. Everyone seems to be having a good time playing their parts. Who will be able to forget lines like "Inconceivable!," "As you wish," or "Have fun storming the castle!" Plus a make-believe land with the Fire Swamp, the Cliffs of Insanity, and the Pit of Despair. An over-the-top fairytale? Of course, that's the point! But with twists, humor, action, wonderful swordplay, and fun performances all around, this movie gives us so much more. By not taking the story too seriously and throwing in every story-time cliche imaginable, Rob Reiner has created a simply fun movie that our family watches over and over again.</fullReview>

The performances are just as they're supposed to be. Like the script, not too serious without being corny. Just the right balance.

All the performances are good (although Chrystal is too showy for my taste) but Patinkin's is exceptional. Also features an endearing performance by wrestling star Andre "The Giant". Special note should go to writer William Goldman, who does an almost perfect adaption of his wonderful novel. Reiner acquits himself well, particularly through the wit and style of the performances (some of them from actors who have not done work so good in the rest of their careers), but relies on close-ups a bit too much. Reiner should be credited, though, with letting the material speak for itself for the most part, providing fairly straightforward camera movement and positioning. Best scene for me -- Elwes and Patinkin's classic duel atop the cliffs of death (or whatever they're called).</fullReview>

Peter Faulk is a great choice to play the grandfather, and Fred Savage is a cute choice as the sick grandson. Down the line, this movie is perfectly cast. Especially Billy Crystal and Carole Kane as Miracle Max and Valerie. "Get back, witch!" "I'm not a witch, I'm your wife!" :) You've got to love the wit and charm of this movie, and if you don't, then I have only one question for you. "What's your problem?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this movie incredibly funny, but the plot keeps moving along quite well. Once you see this movie, and are initiated into the club.. you will understand what R.O.U.S.'s are, who the Six-Fingered man is.. and what, exactly 'As You wish' really means. The 'movie' the movie is set in is barely present, but with a young Fred Savage and an always-great Peter Falk, it makes an amusing setting for the comedic story that unfolds. After seeing this movie more times than I have fingers and toes.. I can only say "My name is Inigo Montoya.. you killed my father.. prepare to die!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconceivably good fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a fond spot for this movie. Its gentle humour and simple values (and perhaps offputting title) combine to make a movie that just keeps going and going.If you asked any person in the street to tell you what sort of film might star the diverse talents of Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal and Peter Cook, they might have a hard time coming up with an answer. I can't think of a more varied cast for any film.If a film leaves you muttering some line of dialogue for days, or even weeks after you've watched it, then you know it must be pretty good. But when a film drags that same line out of you year after year after year, then you know it must be something special. You too will look incredulous when something goes wrong in your life and the word "Inconceivable!" will spring unbidden to your lips. Trust me, it happens.Princess Bride is an action comedy that must be seen to be believed. There are no flashy special effects, no CGI. Just simple, honest comedy and action.Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie for everyone with a head or a heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite claims to the contrary, very very few movies can truly be enjoyed by all ages. This wonderful fairy tale is an exception. There is enough action to keep squirmy young boys involved, including some pretty good sword fighting, enough humor to keep intelligent adults laughing, and enough romance to make tearful girls weep.The Princess Bride is one of the few movies that is translated faithfully from the book, yet still works well on the screen.The acting ranges from very good to brilliant.The best part of this movie is the smart dialogue; every other line is a quotable gem. The jokes are almost never telegraphed, explained, or mugged; but pay attention and you'll hardly stop laughing. You might have to watch the movie two or three times to actually make out all of Andre the Giant's lines but, in the case of The Princess Bride, that's a pleasure.This is a low budget movie and the visual and special effects reflect that but somehow, in the film's fairy tale setting, it all works.Most Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie having heard nothing but good things about it. I know now what everyone has been talking about. The Princess Bride has to be one of the greatest Fairy Tales I've ever seen.Cary Elwes, the only Robin Hood who can speak with an English accent, played Westley, a cocky Zorro-type hero who is driven by his love for the Princess Bride, Buttercup. Cary Elwes fits the part. He had that cockiness in his voice, yet every word he said was serious.The story was great. Too bad Fred Savage kept interrupting it.The fight scenes were some of the greatest I have ever seen without the use of special effects. If you have not seen this movie, you need to.

		<shortDescription>Why everyone must watch this movie and why I think you'll want to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comments: One of the best movies of all time. With an excellent cast, and just the right amount of action, comedy, fantasy, and romance, this is a movie you'll want to see again and again. It is the only movie I can watch over and over and never tire of. It does have purposely overdone humor, so I guess if you have no sense of humor at all I wouldn't recommend it to you. However, if you like sword fights, people with accents, princesses, great one-liners, or just long for the days when there was such a thing as true love, then it is the right movie for you. Also, I would strongly recommend the book, which is also by William Goldman.Summary: Buttercup's heart died the day she found out that her dear sweet Westley was killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Prince Humperdinck decides to marry Buttercup, not caring whether or not she likes him, since he plans to kill her anyway. The Prince hires three guys - one a master swordsman, another a champion wrestler, and the third the brains of the operation - to kidnap Buttercup. Will the Man in Black be able to overcome the kidnappers and save Buttercup? Inconceivable! And who is the Man in Black? Will twue wuv twiumph? And that is only the beginning . . .An important comment: Most people I know have at least part of "The Princess Bride" memorized, and, honestly, if you don't know what "mostly dead" means, then you're really not worth talking to. Helpful tip: If for some strange reason you don't like this movie, don't tell anyone -- that is, unless you want to be ostracized from normal American society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a bit of a hard time getting my friends to watch this movie. What self respecting dude would watch a movie called "The Princess Bride" with his buddies? Well let me tell you I have yet to meet someone who has seen this movie and didn't love it. A great comedy with so much fun, laughter, action, and touching in just the right spots. The power of "true love" may be the driving force for the characters in the movie, and probably what some women viewers would focus on (hint to guys, rent this with your girl and you'll get points for the romance and it'll actually be a movie you'll enjoy. What can I say chicks dig the whole fairy tale aspect, and you'll like everything else). The comedy, characters, and even some action are what make this a movie for everyone. This is a fantasy and comedy period. But who says a comedy can't touch your heart in just the right amount ... a swordsman spending his life avenging his fathers murder, a grandfather (played perfectly by Peter Faulk) comforting his sick grandchild,and of course the power of "true love". Long live the dread pirate Roberts.</fullReview>

It has, to my knowledge, touched people's hearts all over the world (and brought a tear to many as well I think). When I watch my DVD now it seems a bit dated (special effects climbing the cliff weren't so hot!) but its charm wins out. All foster children who come to my house have to see it and those who don't want to watch it still end up enjoying it, despite themselves (true of the Shrek movie also). The magic cast and the magic story go down in history (alongside the best of Walt Disney's animated films) as a classic 'feel good' solution to anyone who might be a bit down in their life and need a bit of fantasy, love, escapism, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films ever made, there's something here for everyone.Bill Goldman's book has always been a favorite of mine, but I didn't think it was filmable without major surgery. Who better to perform the needed cuts than Goldman himself?Firstly, the framing story is wonderful. Peter Falk as the elderly grandfather to Fred Savage gives one of his finest performances, and Fred plays perfectly off him.The real story is impossible to describe. There aren't enough superlatives. There's not a single wrong move made by any of the actors. Andre "The Giant" Roussimoff is a great big teddybear, Cary Elwes is the perfect pirate prince, and Mandy Patinkin is flawless as the vengeance- driven Inigo. Chris Sarandon is appropriately sleazy as Humperdinck, and Wallace Shawn is a hoot as Vizzini, the nasty little Sicilian.The two standouts are Nicholas Guest, whose character of Count Tyrone Rugen is a precise blend of two of the greatest movie villains of all time: Henry Daniel and Conrad Veidt. He's oily, sneaky and evil, and manages it without twirling his mustache and cackling nastily.And Robin Wright, in her first film role, is luminous. I fell in love with her the instant I saw her.As to the story itself, if there are echoes of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" here, it's because of the writer, who loved those characters so much that they couldn't help but leak into the story.All told, this is one of my favorite films, and I can't recommend it highly enough. See this one over and over again. Make your kids watch it. Don't tell them it's a kissing story, though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There, I said it. Why is this such a classic line in the minds of many? I don't know, really. But I do know that the way that Mandy Patinkin delivers it in this film has 'classic line' written all over it. It's one of many classic lines, though, really, and with William Goldman the creative force behind the screenplay and the book on which it was based, it's no wonder. Rob Reiner, who by the time he started this project had only had the superb "This Is Spinal Tap" released to the public as evidence of his directorial talent. The rest of the credit belongs in large part to the perfectly-cast actors and actresses who peopled the slightly off-kilter fairytale realm in which the story is set.I first saw this film (most of it -- I missed the very beginning) when, one night, I randomly turned on the TV and -- what are the odds -- was surprised to find something that actually seemed worth watching. I didn't know quite what the heck I WAS watching, but I knew that it was something right up my figurative alley. The self-aware and self-mocking humor and somewhat skewed dialogue and perspectives appealed almost as much as the obvious genre blending that, as I found out later, was probably largely responsible for the studio's failure to effectively market the film. I even recognized Christopher Guest, who played Spinal Tap's incredible lead guitarist, as one of the bad guys -- all right! You just know it's gotta be a classic, right? During one of those annoying too-frequent commercial breaks that mar US network television I found that the movie's title was "The Princess Bride." I'm glad that I didn't see it advertised by name first because the odds are good that I'd have never bothered finding out that this movie is far, far more than the sum of its title. I sat happily rapt through the rest of the movie and a few years later, holed up sick in a motel room on a tropical island, again saw all but the first part of the movie. Finally, a few weeks ago, I bought the Special Edition DVD of the thing. I'm glad I did. I've watched it twice with no voiceover commentary and one time each with commentary by Rob Reiner and William Goldman, respectively. And I'm just beginning!My guess is that this has basically become a cult movie, and it seems that its popularity these days is largely based upon discovery of the movie via word of mouth when it was first released on videotape. I seem to like some of the quirkier 'cult' movies, and this is one I like very much. It's also unusual in that it truly is a 'family' movie, but one that'd appeal to a good number of the Rambo-wannabe young males who'd ordinarily have nothing to do with something titled "The Princess Bride." Actually, I guess I was among that number to an extent.One of the film's greatest qualities is that it simultaneously manages to be both fairytale and fairytale parody. It lampoons the whole world of fairytale and fantasy while, at the same time, celebrating it. Most of the characters within play it for laughs, for the most part, other than the title character (who is, after all, a fairytale princess and not a female Groucho Marx) and Mandy Patinkin's Spanish revenge-bent swordsman, Inigo Montoya.The cast, largely composed of lesser-known talents (at least at the time) and notably absent the big megastars that were then dominating the box office, is superb. The leads were basically unknowns, the beautiful and talented (nice English accent!) Robin Wright, who'd later go on to play Jenny in "Forrest Gump," and the suave and handsome Cary Elwes, who'd make a great Errol Flynn. Cary Elwes was a rare combination of male beauty, physical ability, and a sense of humor. Those qualities make him perfect for the part. Wally Shawn is also perfectly cast as the supremely intelligent (or so he thinks) Vizzini. Andre the Giant plays the role of giant that was (literally) made for him to play -- he does a good job and is very appealing as the archetypal gentle giant. Chris Sarandon gets to go way over the top to great effect as Prince Humperinck (apologies to Englebert, but did they choose the name just 'cos it's inherently funny?) and Christopher Guest shows off both another flawless British accent and the ability to quite effectively and quietly capture the feel of your basic model psychopathic sadist. Peter Cook even gets to make an appearance as a clergyman with a speech impediment. Billy Crystal is amazing in this film, in his role as a 'miracle man.' His ad-libs, too, add to the film. Carol Kane is also effective -- both of them in extreme make-up -- as his wife. Back in the present day reality, Peter Falk is great as the grandfather who's patiently reading the tale to his grandson, well played by young Fred Savage. I've saved Mandy Patinkin for last because of all of the stellar performances within this film it's his that is perhaps my favorite. Maybe some of it's empathy with his character -- some of us unreformed romantics empathize more with the lyrics of "The Impossible Dream" than others do -- but I thought that his was the performance of a career. And the initial swordfight between him and Cary Elwes was incredible, even moreso because the two actors trained long and hard to do all of it (other than a flip or two) themselves. Most impressive.The story's packed with great lines -- it's not that the story is overly complicated or deep as much as it is that the characterizations are so intriguing and the lines so good -- but I'm outta room and all I can say is that you've got to catch this one for yourself. Have fun storming the video store.</fullReview>

The book is more detailed and although Goldman has nicely scripted his novel for the screen, I choose the book over the movie (but when I read it, I have a definite picture of Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, etc. in my head).

		<fullReview>Quite possibly my most favorite movie of all time. It may not be polished or serious enough for most critics, but it does best what movies are supposed to do. It entertains, makes you want to fall in love, and most importantly, it makes you glad you're alive. The "As you wish" line alone should have secured the movie a place in any "Best movies of the century" list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Eddie Van Halen, Wayne Gretzky, Micheal Jordan and Arnold Schwarz, this movie IS THE STANDARD for all romantic comedies about action and swordfighting that all movies in the category before and after will be judged against, and promptly given a back seat. This amazing tale full of one-liners, witt, character and action is entertaining to the end or "to the pain" shall I say. There isn't a movie in the world that has made me laugh, cry, mad, aroused, frightened, happy and all of the other emotions at one time. This movie makes you forget about the hardships and pain of the real world and gives you hope in the betterment of life. "Life is pain.. and anyone that tells you otherwise is selling something." They are trying to sell you something: this amazing film. Buy it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic swords'n'love adventure sprayed with humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has earned the topspot in my book over adventure movies. All acting is superb and on the mark, both regarding timing and humour. Add to that the interwoven tale of a grandpa reading loud for his sick grandson, and you have a classic tale for the whole family. The cameo appearances doesn't get much better than this either, with Billy Crystal and Mel Smith showing their faces (in some disguise) at various stages. Heck, I even love the soundtrack, gently composed by Mark Knopfler!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A forgotten MASTERPIECE of High Fantasy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply a beautiful MASTERPIECE of fantasy. This is THE perfect fantasy movie. Excellent story, brilliant and original casting, great humor, perfect set design, amazing figthing choreography, enchanting soundtrack, excellent special effects (because we don´t notice them) and a great direction from Rob Reiner setting the perfect pace for a story like this. I really liked the departure from the normal Dungeons and Dragons formula of fantasy to a more fairy tale aproach. Very original and a very brave thing to try, in a time where the movie audiences seem to think fantasy have to be something with big muscled man holding big swords and slashing people, Conan the Barbarian style.It really bothers me when i read people saying this fairy tale type of movie is just for kids. I bet this are the same people who think a movie with lots of guns, shootings and cardboard villains are a very adult thing. Oh boy... I´m 29 and i love this movie. I can´t even believe this is a Hollywood production !How come no more movies like this were ever made ?! Then again, in a place where things like ID4 are huge a success i can see why there is only one PRINCESS BRIDE.PRINCESS BRIDE is a magnificent movie. Watch it along with, LADY HAWKE, LEGEND, NEVERENDING STORY and even KRULL, and you´ll be watching the best in fantasy ever made.</fullReview>

The book is extraordinarily entertaining. But the movie?. Lots of people seem to like this film. But compared to the book (how shall I put this delicately?), the movie sucks. Buttercup looks only like a pretty girl, not the hypnotizing beauty of the book. Fezzik looks only like Andre the Giant, not the world-class strongman of the book. And Westley looks like a wimp. A wimp. A total wimp. The great hero Westley is a wimp wimp wimp. Even his mustache is a joke, and it makes me sick to look at it. I hate this movie. Please read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i would not say such things if i were you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have anything bad to say about The Princess Bride (which is inconceivable), don't do it while I'm in the room. This movie came out twelve years ago, and I know one person who doesn't have most of it memorized. If you don't believe me, walk into a crowded room and say "Mawiage," and listen to the rousing chorus of, "Mawiage is what bwings us togethaaaaah...today. That bwessed awwaaaaaingment. That dweam within a dweam...So cherish your woved ones, and wove, twue wove wiw fowwow you foweva..." For those of you who think Robin Wright's acting was less than stellar as Buttercup, take a closer look (and read the book). One of my favorite parts of the movie is when she tells prince off, beginning with poetic fury, "Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love,and you cannot track that, not with a thousand bloodhounds, and you cannot break it, not with a thousand swords, and when i say that you are a coward..." as the music swells in the background. Then it seems to deflate as she--clearly having used more than her daily portion of brainpower--ends with "that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the face of the earth." Not only is this the most timeless movie I've ever seen, but it is also the most well-cast. Who would think to cast the towering Mandy Patinkin as the petit and agile Inigo, or to cast Andre the Giant period? I can only urge those of you who haven't to read William Goldman's book. The dialogue isn't quite as sharp, but the book is all-together hilarious, and expands on the plotline and all of the characters, with detailed history of buttercup and westley, inigo and fezzik, and an unforgettable description of the zoo of death (which is only the pit of despair in the movie). If this isn't enough for you, it has a color map of guilder and florin!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching it I simply don't like this movie at all, I just don't get what people see in this movie. It purposely looks like a cheap 1980's TV movie, the parts that are meant to be comedic are just poorly executed and for the most part the film is actually really boring. The Princess character is by far the worst character in the movie, while she and Westley were in the swamp, Westley gets attacked by a giant rodent and while this is happening, she just stands there doing nothing, doesn't even have the thought of helping him pass the sword he dropped, I understand that this movie is about the concept of true love but I don't think this women is worth it, all she is is this stereotypical damsel in distressed emotionless women who just can't think for herself such as her life choices and common sense.Sometime after this Westly gets captured, and tortured until killed to death, only to be bought back to life in the most stupidest fashion I've ever seen after being actually dead for some time, it just doesn't make sense. And about that evil Prince, no-one kills him yet this Inigo Montoya character who is arguably the best character in the movie gets a free pass to get revenge on the guy who murdered his father, I think the movie should have been about him, but instead we get this bloated mess. Before watching this I thought it would be a more "epic and gritty" film, but that does not appear to be the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched The Princess Bride probably a dozen times, but I have only viewed the film because it is on my top ten of classic movies. I have never had enough knowledge to properly analyze the film and provide an educated review. Thanks to a film class, I know feel as though I can give a proper assessment of the film and my view as to why it is such an amazing film.In my opinion, the theme of the movie is for pure entertainment that includes comedy, action, sorrow, empathy, imagination, and of course 'true love'. Most of the movie revolves around true love and the battle for the cause. The Princess Bride is a fairy tale of a farm boy named Westley (Cary Elwes) and his true love Buttercup, played by new actress, Robin Wright. Their love was torn apart for a brief moment when word got back that Westley had been murdered by the Dreaded Pirate Roberts. Three years pass and Buttercup is now engaged to a conniving, scheming Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). In a plot to start a war with his enemy country Guilder, the Prince has Buttercup kidnapped by three men, the inconceivable Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), a sword dueling revenge seeker Inigo Montoya played by Mandy Patinkin, and the oddly lovable, but not too smart Fezzik played by the late Andre the Giant. The trio doesn't get too far when they encounter the Man in Black. The Man in Black defeats the kidnappers with skill, strength, and wits, but his encounter with two of the three is not quite over. Buttercup assumes that the Man in Black is the Pirate who killed her true love until she hears him scream, while rolling down a hill, "As you wish". The two lovers are reunited. Their elated happiness is cut short when the Princess catches up to them and Buttercup offers to return to the kingdom if he returns Westley back to his ship. The cowardly Prince lies to the future princess and has Westley taken to the 'pit of despair'. In a jealous rage, the Prince kills Westley so he may marry Buttercup. Unfortunately for Humperdink, Indigo and Fezzik find the mostly dead Westley and revive him with a miracle pill from the hilarious Billy Crystal who plays the Witch Doctor.The new trio devise a plan to break into the castle to stop the wedding so Westley and Buttercup may be reunited once more and so Inigo may have his revenge against the six fingered man who killed his father played by Christopher Guest (Count Tyrone Rugen).Both Westley and Inigo achieve their goals of reuniting with true love and revenge. The foursome ride away on four white horses into the sunset to live their fairy tale lives.I enjoy how the director used set back drops, lighting, musical score, and camera angles to provide the viewer with an enjoyable experience. From the very beginning you know the era and country region of the setting for the love story. The rolling country, the wood cabins, and the lack of population allows the viewer to know that it's probably turn of the century time period. The writer, William Goldman hints that the theme is a love story with in the first 10 minutes through narration as well as with visual aesthetics. The film reaches both the adventure lover, the comedian, as well as the soft hearted with the use of dialogue, action, and images. The film is filled with action scenes from sword fighting, wrestling, battling of wits, and of course a little blood. If you are one that enjoys comedy this movie is for you as well. The screenwriter and director do a fantastic job of adding human into the film with the one liners, the awkward moments, and great characters. If you enjoy fairy tales about true love and happiness, well you will be hooked in the first 10 minutes. All the little details of action, humor, and love are tied together with a magnificent score that will get your heart beating and your emotions running.One of the aspects that I picked up during the movie while analyzing was the great camera angles and lighting. One scene in particular that stood out was when Inigo was using his father's sword and spirit to guide him to the Man in Black. Before the sword starts leading him, the lighting behind Inigo hints that his father spirit is there and guiding the sword. The light surrounds Inigo and he looks like an angel. I never noticed that before now. I also enjoyed that the director took the objective point of view for most parts of the film. He allowed us to sit back and watch the love story unfold by using wide shots and large backgrounds. I don't think that there were many scenes that had dead screen areas either. Overall, I loved this movie before I watched with an analytical mind and I still love it. If anything I enjoyed it more for those areas that I have missed in previous viewings. I am glad that this film is for pure entertainment and it is not a struggle to watch. It's one of those films that you can come home from a stressful day at the office or during those rainy weekends, pop a little popcorn and the movie into the DVD player and sit back and laugh, feel, and love every second of it. I love this movie and I think you will truly love the movie as well.Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the wittiest, clever and downright great films I have ever seen. I first saw this film when I was around 7. I did not really understand the humor or message behind the film, but merely laughed when everyone else did. Now that I am more intellectually capable, I am able to understand the clever humor behind it. At times I found the film a bit cheesy and unrealistic (giant rats in the Fire Swamp and the rolling down the hill) but overall a great watch. I has very quotable lines and tells a very great story. The moral of the story - To never give up on something that you believe in (again cheesy) - still sends a true message that his home. An amazing film!</fullReview>

So OK here is my review of the movie The Princess Bride which is a feature length action adventure fantasy comedy romance flick from the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven..... I believe it was released in the summer of that year in July or perhaps June or maybe August..... The Princess Bride is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful, heart-warming story. Basically a fairy tale, but with some 20th century sensibilities and witticisms. Very funny at times. Some great, and quotable, lines.Rob Reiner's direction is spot-on. Never a dull moment - the movie just motors along and you hardly feel the time pass. Good performances all round. Cary Elwes, Robin Wright and Mandy Patinkin don't put a foot wrong. Hard to single out any, but Mandy Patinkin's, as Inigo Montoya, is probably the pick of the lot.It's not just the main characters who deserve our attention. Some big names in minor roles, and they all deliver in spades - Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Cook, Mel Smith.A modern classic and ideal for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to share with your kids like the grandfather did with the book ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not surprising that Rob Reiner chose to narrate "The Princess Bride" from the frame story of a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a book to his sick grandson (Fred Savage). The film is a fairy tale written by an adult who understood children, not any children, but modern children impregnated with action films and video games, who would more likely open their minds to thrilling sword-fights and adventures than anything involving 'a lot of kissing'.Reiner amusingly punctuates the story with the kid's reaction as to reassure the most skeptical of us that this won't be your typical 'fairy tale' fantasy. And rightfully so because the overture would hardly make kids lower their guard, the film starts with a (typical) love story between the beautiful Buttercup (Robyn Wright) and her servant Wesley (Cary Elwes). Wesley obeys every demand with an enamored "as you wish", until Buttercup realizes she loves him too, and the film hasn't make it to the fifth minute before the two leads embrace in land of Florin's bucolic landscape.The signature shot of "The Princess Bride" cuts immediately to the kid who can't listen anymore to that cutesy stuff, and at this time, Reiner got us, and by us, I mean, children and adults, the audience is relieved to see that the emotion shared by the listener is taken into consideration, and will work as the premise to a whole other material. I remember very well, the first time I saw the film, on 7th grade class, we were all 12 or 13-year old preteens and our teacher used the film to illustrate the value of 'narrative structure', we were all, 'what the hell is that?' until that immediate reaction, and the story could finally pick up.Wesley leaves the country to get rich and marry Buttercup but he's taken by Dread Pirate Roberts, known for never leaving anyone alive. Buttercup, out of despair, agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) but she's kidnapped by three eccentric outlaws whose different frames works like a comic-book gag. There's Vizzini, the Sicilian boss, played by a cunning and detestable Wallace Shawn, Inigo Monotoya (Mandy Patinkin) as the skilled swordsman and Fezzik, played by champion wrestling Andre the Giant who doesn't seem to carry the symptoms of gentleness ? not yet. They take the Princess offshore, followed by a masked stranger who seems to be Private Roberts and Prince Humperdinck and his men.When the film was screened, the teacher referred to many scenes as parodies : the Screaming Eels were an imitation of "Jaws", the investigating styles of Prince Humperdinck were borrowed from Sherlock Holmes, the masked estranger combined with Montoya's Spanish accent made Zorro, and so on and so forth. "The Princess Bride" could easily be labeled as a parody, feeling and talking like one, but I'm positive that the film isn't as much a parody as it's a fairy tale, in fact, it deliberately floats between these two levels, making possible to touch your heart with a genuine innocence, not incompatible with its sharp wit.And this is another power of the film, it takes some distance from Disney-like stuff without turning it into derision either, it's like a wink to the audience with a friendly tap on the shoulder. The story presents a series of adventures where we discover that there are more than simple characters in the film: Montoya plans to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, he's already prepared his speech and naturally, with the repeated "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die", everyone cheered in the classroom, not to mention the last quote before the final slay. After triumphing over Montoya and Fezzik, there's also an unforgettable duel of spirits with Vizzini whose outcome is not only unpredictable but cynically hilarious.The film is full of eccentric characters that all have their shining moments. It also reminded me of these Grimm fairy tales we read on 11th grade, where everyone served a purpose, the villains, the antagonists, sometimes a place like the Forest with the fire spouts, lightning sand, and Rodents of Unusual Size, the helpers, like an unrecognizable Billy Crystal and Carol Kane, as Mr and Mrs. Miracle Max who'll resurrect the hero and allow the film to conclude on a satisfying way. And there's the eternal idea that brains triumph over brawn have and the way, Wesley defeats Count Humperdinck (Sarandon is excellent!) is also funny and original at the same time.The film has the wit and fun of Rob Reiner's "Spinal Tap" but it ends with the same bittersweet melancholy than his "Stand by Me", when after the excitement, we're left with the feeling to have witnessed something so miraculously sweet and tender, (the music helps and the "Storybook Love" enhance that emotionality) that we've had our share of thrills or fun and we're not that reluctant to have a final kiss at the end. The grandfather closes the book before the kissing, but the kid's reaction again matches ours ? the film is one beautiful romance and deserves a romantic finale, we wouldn't have accept it from a spoof, but if it was one, the film wouldn't have been this endearing and so lovable classic."The Princess Bride" is a timeless classic full of unforgettable characters, a sweet thought to the late Andre the Giant who marked forever Cinema with his giant footprint, and unforgettable quotes. The grandfather couldn't give a more appropriate answer than his 'as you wish' when his grandson asked him to tell him the story again the day after. And like the book, the film can be seen over and over and I'm looking forward to show it to my little girl when she'll be old enough to appreciate it, hoping that her generation wouldn't be made of children reluctant to watch such a cinematic treasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've worked with a few people over the years that served as good barometers of other people, so I'd always say "if you can't work with so-and-so, the problem isn't so-and-so". The people who couldn't work with so-and-so inevitably couldn't work with most people.If you don't like this movie, the problem isn't the movie. This is a story with universal appeal. In my experience, be wary of people who don't like The Princess Bride. The movie is heart-felt, humorous, exciting, touching, teaching, entertaining, fast-paced, quirky, familiar, different and above all, true to human nature. Some things, or attitudes towards things, in life reveal a person's true nature. This is one of those great pieces of art that is endlessly entertaining and enlightening at the same time. Many a great movie (IMHO) are not for everyone, but this one is. Young, old, big, small, seen it before, never heard of it - put in the princess bride if you're in need of some entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this title a few days ago. I became curious because of the high ratings and the reviews posted. I was a bit hesitant at first when I saw that it's quite an old flick (1987). Finally, was able to watch this film last night. I can't help but to create an account to register just to rate the movie. How thankful I am that I gave it a try because it really made my night. We enjoyed it a lot! It's an entertaining film. We laughed hard. The characters were great! The film was brilliantly done. The characters were well-chosen. Each one of them portrayed their roles excellently.. There are values to be learned. I loved how polite and well-mannered the main characters were; Westley,, Buttercup, Inigo Montoya, Fezzik. The value of the word, "please," was mentioned. Inigo Montoya was a respectful person and kept saying "thank you" whenever he asks a favor or request from someone. The script is admirable. You can watch this just with anyone; even with your kids. It's a film for all ages. It doesn't contain violence .This film is highly commendable. It's worth watching. When the movie ended, I want more and wished that there's a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just reading through the reviews of this while watching it again. I had to add to them, not to agree with fellow lovers but to rebut the flaws in the reviews of the haters.People are saying it's vacuous ( okay, my word not theirs) and highly flawed. They've missed the point. Clearly the special effects are deliberately bad, as is the name Buttercup. Much of the humor is located in its tongue-in-cheek cheesiness. The dialogue is incredibly corny, not because the writing is poor but because it's just that clever. The actors deliver the lines perfectly and together, they all make this film laugh out loud funny. The story within a story format is great and Peter Falk's delivery of his lines is spot on. The bad guys are deliciously bad, the albino's glorious and Billy Crystal steals the show. You don't need to have seen this back in the 80s to love it. I was introduced to it in the late 90s and a friend introduced one of her mates to it just this year. He loved it.You have to approach this film in the right spirit. If you do, it's a hilarious ride. So it's not a feminist triumph. Who would expect it to be? Since when are fairy tales full of women doing it for themselves? There are actually some nice messages in the film about loyalty, love and sportsmanship but it's not designed as a commentary on human nature so stop looking for that and just enjoy the wonderful characterisation, the humor, the deliberate ridiculousness ( I mean, honing a dagger on a rounded rock -really?!) and the memorable (and highly quotable) lines. It's smarter than it looks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever and fun fantasy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most well-known and respected fantasy films and for a good reason. The Princess Bride is a genre-defining film that has endured the test of time beautifully and still stands as one of the best adventure films and the one film you should see if you're interested in swashbuckler films.What I like the most about this film is its unpredictability. Sure, it's an adventure film aimed for all audiences, so the good guys are going to win and all that, but the way they go about accomplishing that task is what makes this film enjoyable. You're never sure what's going to happen next, the characters are very creative and there are a lot of them, the plot twists come right out of nowhere and the humorous tongue-in-cheek tone ties it all together. There is drama and high stages, yes, but it's still an adventure film and meant to be enjoyed with a smile on your face.The story develops rather erratically, going from one scene to another with very few tie-ins, but in this case it works, because the whole film is told more like a fairy tale than a typical story. So it's more of a preference of style than a flaw.If I were to nitpick, I'd say that the frame story involving a grandfather reading his grandson a book while he lies sick in bed is not as interesting as the actual story and sometimes the kid's interruptions in the story come at the worst possible times. This is only a nitpick, however, because the banter between these two is actually quite humorous, which keeps it from becoming an annoyance. It'd be interesting to see just how well the actual adventure would flow without the frame story, just for comparison.I like this film, I like a lot. It has a strong story, it's fun and charming without being immature, its characters are great, it has a lot of memorable dialogues and as a whole it's just bursting with imagination. One of the best adventure films I've ever seen and well worth your time, whoever you happen to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride:The 25th Anniversary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a fan of director/producer Rob Reiner's classic Comedy This Is Spinal Tap,and also being mesmerise by his elegant adaptation of Stephen King's short story The Body with Stand By Me,I have oddly found myself intensionally staying away from seeing his Comedy Adventure Fantasy film The Princess Bride for a number of years,due to having seen a clip of the movie years ago on TV,that didn't connect with me at all.Checking four days ago to see what was coming out at my local cinema this week,I was shocked to discover that they were holding a one-off screening to celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Princess Bride.Shortly after reading about the screening,I began to get a sudden feeling that something about this film might be pretty special,which led to me running down to the cinema,to pre-book a ticket so that I could at last pay my long,overdue visit to what sounded to be a very special princess.The plot:Paying a visit to his ill grandson,the grandfather is sad to discover that his ill in bed grandson is not resting,but instead playing Video Games.Grabbing his grandson's attention for one moment as he enters the bedroom,the grandfather decides to make the most of his opportunity by turning off the TV,and taking a book off the bedroom shelf called The Princess Bride that he used to have read to him when he was his grandson's age.Hearing objections from his grandson,the grandfather tells him to give the novel a chance,as he begins to read The Princess Bride to him.The Princess Bride:Spending all of her life on a farm,Buttercup enjoys passing the time by riding the horses that she owns,and also lightly teasing a farm boy called Westley,who replies to Buttercup's teasing with a smile and the words "As you wish".Warming to Westley, thanks to him always taking her teasing with good grace,Buttercup begins to feel that Westley's words of "As you wish",actually mean "I love you",which leads to Buttercup and Westley finally opening up,and falling in love with each other.With neither of them having enough money to afford a wedding,Westley makes the painful decision to leave Buttercup temporally behind,and go to work on a ship,so that he can gather enough money which will allow him and Buttercup to have the marriage of their dreams.Promising that he will return to his beloved soon,Westley's promise soon becomes a fading memory,when Buttercup receives news that Westly's ship has been attacked,and that there are no sign of any survivors.5 years later:Gathering the pilgrims of Florin,Prince Humperdinck announces that on the upcoming 500th anniversary of the city's creation,he has decided to mark the day by choosing a pilgrim who he can get married to:Buttercup.Despite Humperdinck's happiness over the choice of his future wife,Buttercup finds the memories of her first love Westley to have a strong grip on her,which leads to Buttercup feeling completely empty over her future marriage.Riding around the woodland area of Florin,Buttercup is stopped in her tracks by three men called Vizzini,Fezzik and Inigo Montoya,who quickly grab,and kidnap Buttercup.Dragging the still-alive Buttercup's body up the Cliffs of Insanity,due to them wanting to start a war between Florin and a near by city,by placing Buttercup's dead body in the other city.The kidnappers suddenly see a strange image which leaves them completely in shock,due to the image being of a masked wearing man climbing the Cliffs of Insanity and quickly catching up to them,with the strange man looking as if he is willing to do everything possible to get Buttercup out of the kidnappers hands and off the Cliffs of Insanity.View on the film:Adapting from his own 1974 novel,William Goldman's amazingly lean screenplay allows the grandfather and grandson (played by a very good Peter Falk and Ben Savage) to "interrupt" the unfolding Princess Bride story taking place,which allows for any moments when the film could possibly fall into the clichés of the Fantasy genre,to instead be paunched by Goldman's subtle comedic hand,which led to everyone in the cinema awing and laughing none stop for this brilliant movie.Bending the worn out and tied roads that have been taken with a "damsel in distress" Fairy tale,Goldman superbly shows the enthralling missions that the characters face with a perfect seriousness that makes sure the viewer laughs with the characters,and not at them.Along with the Fantasy parts to the tale,Goldman also jam-packs the movie with sharp,hilarious Comedy that offers something for all ages.This is thanks to the Comedy going from delightfully silly slap-stick (which wine is poisoned?) and perfectly delivered one-liner's , ("Hello,my name is Inigo Montoya.You killed my father.Prepare to die!.") to even some surprisingly satirical moments (the late Peter Cook playing The Impressive Clergyman,and the great line "I've hired you to start a war,It's a prestigious line of work,with a long and glorious tradition!.)Revealing an epic eye for scope that he had never shown before,with the Ireland and England locations being shown at their full beauty,co- producer/director Rob Reiner strikes the perfect balance of allowing the locations to create an enchanting,unforgettable atmosphere,whilst also keeping the movie from flying away by placing all of the characters feet firmly on the ground,which allows for the hilarious Comedy moments to hit their target every time.Brilliantly complementing the astonishing locations,Reiner never allows any of the characters to fade into the corner of the screen,but to instead shine the movie on each of the characters,which helps to make each of the characters feel that they are at the very centre of this truly magical tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Princess Bride is one of the most solid movies ever made: nearly everything about it, except the dated special effects, works very well. It is a memorable, fun movie full of good jokes and should be a movie that works for all age-groups. It is not one of those family movies that are only cool for the children but instead this movie has several layers of complexity and is directed by a rather talented director who also directed Stand By Me, another excellent film.This is one of the must see for film buffs. I wouldn't rate it higher than 8/10 because it lacks that visceral dramatic power that prevents it from attaining true greatness (i.e. like Kurosawa's Ikiru).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.Several years ago I worked in a great company where the 'art' department wouldn't even talk to you unless you knew all about this movie. So many parts of it are so great, not the least of which is the fencing that Rob Reiner insisted that they practice over and over. I once read that Mr. Reiner kept telling the actors - throw the lines away - this isn't theater. They're funny, so keep going! And it shows in the movie. We would all swear that Mandy Patinkin was a world-class fencer. Just a great actor, I'm afraid.So many of the lines are so memorable, like "inconceivable!" With the follow-up line of "you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think means".And of course the part with Billy Chrystal and Carol Kane and Peter Falk. If you've never seen this movie, get out from under the rock and see it. You will see what you've been missing all these years. Inconceivable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Benchmark For Fairy Tale Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a romantic comedy adventure film based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman.The movie features Cary Elwes, Robin Wright,Mandy Patinkin,Chris Sarandon,André the Giant,Christopher Guest,Fred Savage,Wallace Shawn,Billy Crystal and Carol Kane.It combines comedy, adventure, romance, and fantasy. It was directed by Rob Reiner from a screenplay by Goldman. The story is presented in the film as a book being read by a grandfather to his sick grandson, thus effectively preserving the novel's narrative style.The screenplay offers a tongue-in-cheek fairy tale depicting stable boy- turned-pirate Westley's journey to rescue Buttercup, his true love, away from the evil prince, whom she had agreed to marry five years after learning of what she had believed to be news of Westley's death. With help from Prince Humperdinck's disgruntled former employee Miracle Max, swordsman Inigo Montoya, and a very large man named Fezzik, the star- crossed lovers are reunited. This is a delightfully postmodern fairy tale.It is a deft, intelligent mix of swashbuckling, romance, and comedy that takes an age-old damsel- in-distress story and makes it fresh.The Princess Bride has often been copied, but never equaled.Thus,it has proved to be the benchmark for fairy tale movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The arclight was showing several retro movies, and when I found out this movie was one of them, I immediately bought tickets. Just got back from watching The Princess Bride at the Arclight where Cary Elwes did a question and answering segment after the film. He was so nice. He stayed until everyone that wanted a pix took one with him, and he would ask your name and shake your hand too. What a class act. And the best Westley that could've ever been cast. Swoon... ;) The princess Bride was always my favorite movie as a kid. I love everything about it. The wit, the physical comedy, the love story, the action, And all of the cast is perfection.

		<shortDescription>Great adventure/romance flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is such a great film. There were many fantasy flicks on the eighties (And some of them were incredibly good, as "The Neverending Story") but this has to be best of them.It was incredibly enjoyable and funny to watch, basically, it is a parody of the classic fairy tales, but it is not a dumb and shallow spoof like horrible movies such as "Dance Flick" or "Meet the Spartans", instead of that it makes fun of several of the clichés that appear in many fairy tales. And, at the same time, it has lots of adventure, and heartwarming moments, specially the ending.It also has a beautiful love story...Not many parody films have that."The Princess Bride" is a great film for the whole family. It has fun, excitement and lots of heart. It is definitely one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

I am under the age of twenty and I love it, my favorite movie, line for line. I feel perhaps they are cynical, and are trying to compare it to films that they see today. Yea the graphic do suck, but I dare you to remake it better. Sorry little anger showing. I even read the book, of which it follows pretty darn good. And many of the review complain about the actors- and their over acting. If one was to read the book the original author makes them even cheesier (and in Buttercup's case, blonder) then they act in the movie. They brought it back some in my opinion. It's funny, heart warming, and come on girls who doesn't like a good romance, and guys this one has corny jokes and word play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So many perfect elements... Where to begin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In '86 I was lucky to find an old paperback copy of William Goldman's "The Princess Bride" at a yard sale. I had already read some of his novels, and while I hadn't heard of this particular one, I quickly consumed it, enjoying it tremendously. It was a very clever, but ultimately affectionate, parody of fairy-tale conventions with an equally clever and complicated narrative. It was a fun, memorable book, and when I heard not long after about a film adaptation, I wondered how much of the book's clever tone would translate to the screen.Quite a bit, as it turned out. Rob Reiner's movie version is an outstanding movie, and one that I was pleased to see holds up incredibly well, even a quarter-century later.The brilliance to this movie is in its tone. As I said, it's a parody of fairy-tale conventions. Goldman's characters start out as cardboard-cutout stereotypes, and the events of the story itself are outlandishly improbable (up to and including resurrection), but even as the story gently mocks those conventions, it ultimately still depends on them in the end.The characters are marvelous. Vizzini and his outbursts of "Inconceivable!!", kind-hearted Fezzik with his rhyming, and Inigo Montoya, with his graciousness, honor, and drive for revenge. Carey Elwes' Wesley is a great balance of clever humor and chivalry, and Robin Wright's Buttercup is a smart, strong fairytale princess. All the performances are note-perfect.And the script is brilliant (as well it should be, with Goldman adapting his own novel). The dialogue sparkles, with enough memorable lines to fill a book. We get to love these characters, and care what happens to them (when Inigo finally gets the chance to avenge his father's death, it's surprisingly dramatic and emotional).The story in the film is simpler than that of the book. Among other things, the book goes WAY further into Vizzini's, Fezzik's, and Inigo's backstories, and it's absolutely a worthwhile read, but there was no way it could have all been translated to the screen. As I say, it's an unusually good adaptation.I enjoyed it even more than I did on its original release. That's an easy definition of "classic".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the "haters reviews"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sick and decided to take a few films from the local library to kill some daytime. "Why not see 'The Princess Bride' again?", I thought. I was surprised to see how old it is already. The movie is fun and funny. But reading the reviews from those who hated it seals, for me, why it is so good. This is a film from a book, and a pretty good book at that. The screenplay was, refreshingly, written by the book's author, William Goldman, so what was filmed was OK by him. The Haters make several common errors in their misunderstanding of the film.1: Who ever said this is a children's film? It's a contemporary fairytale peppered with irony, and only one person who didn't like the film said he had read the book. You need more sophistication to understand irony. The satisfaction depends on knowing how things normally go, how they could go, and why opposite outcomes are funny, not visual punch lines to obvious jokes. If you don't read and don't listen well, you'll not enjoy this movie.2: Plenty of people complained about the scenery, acting, and costumes. They entirely miss that what we see on screen is the story as imagined by a young child as he hears the book read to him. That concept allows for certain inconsistencies and stylized actions, such as scenes where others complain about a certain creature looking "obviously fake" It's intentional.3: Most people complained about Wallace Shawn being annoying. That is absolutely so, he is so damn irritating that I usually go elsewhere when his face and voice appear in anything. He's like ketchup on pancakes, just doesn't belong and ruins the whole thing. He is not at all what the book character was supposed to be and I can only assume that Rob Reiner owed him a big favor. I remember being hugely disappointed when he showed up and it took me several minutes to regain my attention to watching the movie.But, golly, the rest of the movie is so fun and freewheeling that you'll be left behind if your imagination needs to be spoon-fed every morsel. We who love it, love it, and we understand why. For the rest of you, there's reality TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Rob Reiner may have created the most endearing romantic comedy of all time in his latest project, "The Princess Bride."Based on the book by William Golding, the story really begins with a young sick boy (Fred Savage) by his grandfather (Peter Falk) who reads to him "The Princess Bride."The real story is actually within the story (although we go back to the boy and his grandfather from time to time).The scenario is not distracting from the funny modern fairy tale. A young girl named Buttercup (Robin Wright) falls in love with the farm boy, Westley (Carey Elwes). They share true love. However, Westley must seek his fortune to marry her, so he becomes a sailor. His ship is captured by the Dread Pirate Roberts and he is no more.Although heartbroken, she agrees to an arranged marriage with Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three men, Viccini, Indigo (Mandy Patinkin), and Fezik (Andre the Giant).Tracking them are two people: Prince Humperdink, and the Dread Pirate Roberts. The Dread Pirate initially wins, revealing himself to be the long-lost Westley. But Prince Humperdink pulls the upper ante to retake his bride and punish Westley.Westly must escape the torture chamber that awaits him and reunited with his true love. For help, he relies on Indigo and Fezik.The movie may sound convoluted, but even a young audience watching will understand how things unfold. Even better, they will laugh. Still, this is not the ultimate strength.The first are the characters that mesh well together like a song and dance. There is chemistry for humor, light-hearted conflict, and battles of wits. One of the best scenes is when Westley has a sword duel with Indigo. Fortunately, mutual respect and quick wits both prevent a duel to the death.Another is a hand-to-hand combat with Fezik, who is worried that his idea of sneaking up on Westley and crushing his head with a rock is "not very sportsmanlike."A subplot exists for Indigo as he seeks revenge against the six- fingered man who murdered his father. This leads to another great sword fight and one of the best lines in any movie.The only gripe is many of these characters talk so fast and with accents, it is had to understand them at some points. Of course, that will make you want to see it again.Another strength is the writing that gives a good romantic fairy tale as well as some good morals along the story. It is also not as predictable as some might think. What happens to the antagonist may surprise the audience.In any case, Rob Reiner has done it again. While "Spinal Tap" is still his crowning jewel, "The Princess Bride" serves both as good family fun and the perfect date movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1980s were the golden age of the fantasy movie ? Excalibur (1981), The Dark Crystal (1982), Legend (1985), Willow (1988) and many others, sword-and-sorcery sagas for the blockbuster generation. But what those aforementioned pictures also had in common were high-production values and emphasis on aesthetics and stylisation. In some cases this was to hide the lack of a decent story. The Princess Bride by comparison is a decidedly minimalist affair, devoid of special effects (bar a bit of puppetry and prosthetics), atmospherics and big fight scenes. This is a fantasy movie which must rely on other things for its appeal to the viewer.The Princess Bride, adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, is really quite a light and simple story, more of a fairy tale than a work of what is normally called fantasy. Its world is too cosy and its baddies are not really evil enough to give it a sense of danger. It also contains a fair few plot holes along the way. It is however saved by two cunning devices. First is the framing narrative whereby Peter Falk is reading the story to his cynical grandson. The grandson's attitude pre-empts criticism, allowing the story to acknowledge the weakness of its own opening and challenge the nay-sayers to keep watching. Secondly there is the constantly humorous angle, a wit in the words that is often self-deprecating, and more irreverent than outright hysterical. The humour is all within character, so not enough to classify The Princess Bride as a spoof or even really a full-blown comedy, but it prevents the viewer from laughing at the corniness of the movie, because it gives the impression that all along the movie is chuckling at itself.Conveniently enough, director Rob Reiner had a background in comedy, and part of his skill in this area was selecting good comedy actors. The Princess Bride provides great opportunities because it has a lot of minor characters that aren't necessarily comical on paper but can be made funny in the way an actor plays them. Because these parts could be interpreted in a number of ways Reiner is more or less free as to who he casts in which role, and he actually seems to have stacked them so they get better and better as the movie progresses. First up is Wallace Shawn, great at doing indignant pomposity. Then there's Mel Smith, rarely seen in films but a fine character player from his days in TV sketch shows. Then we come to Billy Crystal, whose act is a masterwork of timing, working brilliantly in tandem with a lively Carol Kane. And finally there is the brief cameo by Peter Cook, a model of decorum and propriety? until he opens his mouth. Wonderful stuff.While we have the cream of the crop in the small parts, it seems this production could not afford big stars for the leads, and we get too relative unknowns as the heroic Westley and his eponymous princess. Someone may have had the idea that Cary Elwes would shape up to be a modern-day Errol Flynn. He certainly has the looks and can pull off a swashbuckling swagger, but he just doesn't have the necessary presence or charisma, and it's no wonder he was picked mostly for supporting roles after this. Robin Wright is similarly bland, although to be fair despite being the movie's namesake her character does not really have a lot to do here. Better things can be said of Mandy Patinkin who brings the right blend of cheekiness and earnestness to his part (Inigo was my favourite character when I saw this as a child). An honourable mention must also go to Andre the Giant who is surprisingly good considering he's a wrestler hired for his bulk. He struggles with the language but it's clear he was an intelligent and sensitive man.It is essentially all the little touches that make The Princess Bride what it is ? the wit, the quirkiness, the set-pieces. And yet, it being a fantasy picture I do find myself wishing it had a little more of the glamour and spectacle with which its contemporaries were filled. It may win out in the comedy stakes but it lacks the wonder and enchantment of Labyrinth, Legend or The Dark Crystal, and thus it falls short of brilliance. This is a little picture that works well on its own terms, and belongs solidly in the category of good plain fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie, it blows me away. It's just so great it's hard to believe. I like spoofs and that's one of the reasons I love this movie so much. Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, pick a spoof, they're all great but this movie, as much as it parodies the fantasy genre, it's an incredible adventure in itself. The sword fight between Wesley and Inigo might be the greatest fight I've ever seen. The acting is great too. I love the combination of Mandy Partinkin, Andre the Giant, and Wallace Shawn. They're so hilarious together that every time I watch the movie I want to rewatch their scenes again. The dry sense of humor that goes on between Partinkin and Shawn is the highlight of the film. It doesn't last long but every moment is hysterical. The word 'Inconceivable' makes me crack up every time I hear it. I always love Cary Elwes and he is, of course, great in this film. He's cool, collected but isn't afraid to kick ass and take names. I also love the relationship between Fred Savage and Peter Falke. They work so well together, even though they're only in a few scenes. Billy Crystal is hilarious. Chris Sarandon is the guy you love to hate. Christopher Guest (who of course had to be in the movie because it's directed by Reiner) is the guy you love to hate even more than Sarandon. It's action, adventure, comedy, romance, parody and swashbuckling blended so well together it's simply stunning. It's just so rewatchable. So many moments that I could talk about for hours. My all time favorite movie. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride starts as a Grandfather (Peter Falk) visits his ill Grandson (Fred Savage) &amp; decides to read him a classic fairytale, he opens the book &amp; begins to read the story... In the kingdom of Florin a farm-boy named Westley (Cary Elwes) &amp; his boss Buttercup (Robin Wright) fall deeply in love with each other, Westley leaves &amp; Buttercup receives word that he has been killed by the dread pirate Roberts. Five years later &amp; Buttercup is engaged to be married to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) even though she has no love for him, shortly before the marriage Buttercup is kidnapped by a man named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) who then sets sail for the kingdom of Guilder where he plans to kill Buttercup in order to start a war between Guilder &amp; Florin but Buttercup is saved by whom she thinks is the dread pirate Roberts with Prince Humperdinck &amp; his army close behind...Produced &amp; directed by Rob Reiner this was written by William Goldman based on his 1973 novel of the same name, while not drastically different I haven't read the book so cannot compare the two but I really enjoyed the film on many levels for it's action, it's adventure, it cuteness &amp; sense of humour. There's a neat wraparound story in which peter Falk tells the story of The Princess Bride to his young grandson &amp; there are several amusing moments in which we cut back to the pair who make several comments, the sort of comments that a young boy might make while listening to an old fashioned fairytale but it's also nice to see him become engrossed &amp; caught up in the story like anyone watching The Princess Bride will, the point that mere words on a page can captivate as much as a computer game is well made. I would call The Princess Bride itself more of a swashbuckling adventure adventure yarn rather than a straight fairytale, for some reason the fantasy elements are downplayed quite a lot with only giant Rats &amp; Westley being brought back to life (if he was dead anyway which is never made totally clear) the only fantasy aspects. The Princess Bride seems more interested in amusing one-liners, sharp, witty dialogue &amp; sword fight action which is fine as it all adds up to a throughly enjoyable light hearted fantasy romance. In fact the main aspect that The Princess Bride lifts from the average fairytale is the idea of true love conquers all, it's a strong &amp; constant theme throughout thankfully without ever getting to mushy or sentimental. The Princess Bride manages almost perfectly to balance seriousness &amp; parody with an assortment of wonderfully drawn character's all of whom have great personality &amp; some great moments. At just over an hour &amp; a half the film never lacks pace &amp; keeps moving all the time, it's easy to see why the young Fred Savage gets so engrossed in The Princess Bride &amp; I am sure most viewers will feel exactly the same way.As I mentioned earlier I am a bit disappointed at the lack of overt fantasy elements, even the settings &amp; locations from woods &amp; ancient Castles look a little drab. The ROUS (Rodents of Unusual Size) are dwarf actor's in Rat suits which look a little tatty but at least they have fluid movement &amp; still look better than a modern CGI computer effect probably would. There are some great fencing &amp; sword fighting scenes, some of the best you will ever see to be fair as th makers don't seem to go for historic accuracy or realism &amp; just go to town with various stunts &amp; improbable gymnastics.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 the production values are good &amp; it looks nice enough having been mostly filmed on location here in England. The acting is good, Cary Elwes as the smooth, handsome &amp; likable Westley shines although Robin Wright is a little flat in comparison. Billy Crystal, Mel Smith &amp; Peter Cook all have comedic roles.The Princess Bride is a highly entertaining &amp; witty play on the old fairytale clichés that is a cracking action adventure film in it's own right. What's not like? I thought it was clever &amp; humorous &amp; heartfelt &amp; exciting. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun fairy tale for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The synopsis of this film in the TV guide suggested that this film's target audience would be young girls; but as I'd heard good things about it I decided to give it a go; I'm glad that I did, as it was a lot of fun. The main story is in fact a story within a story; a grandfather, played by Peter 'Columbo' Falk, visits his sick grandson and reads him a tale about a young woman called Buttercup who is destined to marry a prince she does not love after her one true love is killed by the dread Pirate Roberts. Shortly before the wedding she is kidnapped by ruffians who plan to kill her in order to start a war. As they take her they find themselves pursued by a masked man in black? a man who claims to be none other than the dread Pirate Roberts! He manages to free the girl and when he removes his mask she is shocked to see who he is. Unfortunately she is soon back in the hands of the dastardly Prince Humperdink. As her wedding day approaches it looks as if nobody will rescue her but this being a fairy tale there is somebody who wants to free her and he won't let a little something like being dead stop him! This film is a lot of fun and will probably amuse children and adults alike although some scenes may disturb younger children. The cast do a good job and it is clear that they were having fun making it; the heroes are suitably heroic and the villains suitably villainous. While some of the scenery and special effects looked less than convincing by today's standards that only adding to the charm and giving it a feel of swashbuckling films made in the sixties. I'd certainly watch this film if you get the chance and you don't have to be young or a girl to think it is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can easily say that this is my favorite movie of all time. Back in elementary and middle school I would watch this movie at least twice a month. I knew all the lines by heart before I entered high school and I still know them now that I am in college.If you haven't seen this movie then shame on you. Best movie of its time and of its genre. The wit and humor is timeless and fun to use in every day life. It does happen, I assure you. My whole family loves this movie, including all the guys. I think they like it for the Fire Swamp and Pit of Dispare scenes. You'll get no spoilers from me, just go see it for yourself. I guarantee that you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless, funny, action-filled love story!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is a fun ride that audiences will enjoy. When you mix pirates, sword wielding Spaniards, good-natured giants, evil masterminds, six-fingered counts, and the Cliffs of Insanity, what do you get? An adventurous, fun-filled, action-packed movie that will have you laughing, crying, cheering, and counting your fingers! The story opens to find a young princess, Buttercup (Robin Wright) and her servant, a quiet, well-mannered Westly (Carey Elwes). As they fall in love, Westly decides he must leave Buttercup to pursue his fortune so he may provide a life for her. Westly leaves and is not heard from again, thought to be killed at the hands of the Dread Pirate Roberts. Buttercup, broken-hearted, is then betrothed to a Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon) who is not as kind as Westly.At this point, the movie becomes a witty, dialogue-driven, action flick. Buttercup is kidnapped by an evil mastermind (Wallace Shawn) and his henchmen; a Spaniard (Mandy Patinkin) bent on the revenge of his murdered father, and a giant (Andre the Giant) who just wants to do things right. Chasing the kidnappers is Buttercup's fiancé, Humperdink, and the shadowy figure in black, the Dread Pirate Roberts.Not all are who they seem to be as the characters interact. The action continues as the settings change quite rapidly throughout the movie, as does the pace. This tends to keep the viewer reminded of the original theme of the movie, which is the love story. And even though it is of the age old plot to rescue the beautiful princess from the mean old bad guy, the entertainment value of the film is well worth it. Movie goers that may have seen the film "Willow" can relate to the type of plot, settings, and characters here.Though the comic lines and sometimes even silly dialogue might suggest this film is aimed at children, the action sequences might suggest otherwise. A few scenes display violence and blood, contemplation of suicide, and big, scary rodents.Another positive for this film is that it is timeless. It should never grow old and out of date as it has a medieval setting, including castles, villages, horses, torches, and swordplay. It is a great story that any one, at any age, can relate to because it appeals to the hero in all of us. Viewers will love the characters, the action, the love, and will find themselves rooting for the good guys?.or are they the bad guys?</fullReview>

Mandy Patinkin and Cary Elwes get in some neat swordplay,Robin Wright is very pretty if a little wooden.The rest of the cast ham it up to a greater or lesser degree(think Alan Rickman in almost anything).Along with Bryan Forbes' "The slipper and the rose","The Princess Bride" represented a late 20th century take on the fairy story.Mr Forbes used music and dance and "serious" actors,Mr Reiner a script by William Goldman that worked on many levels and young,vigorous actors.I suspect it succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is an epic fairy tale with its tongue firmly in its cheek. For me there were echoes of Monty Python in the stiff upper lip British dry humour, and of that great British tradition, the Panto, in the feel of watching it.I can see why some people would not like this film. - perhaps somewhat slow-moving for some; - the emphasis is on dialogue - at a certain "polite, witty" level which not everyone will appreciate- the sets and special effects are wobbly to say the least - as I said this evoke as feeling that you are watching a pantomime rather than a fantasy movie - I suspect this was deliberate and for me it adds to the charm of it.My opinion is that you will hate the movie if you wanted it to be something else. My suggestion: give it another chance. Enjoy the gentle and unusual humour. Let it be what it is. Let it grow on you. Otherwise - prepare to die!For me, The Princess Bride stands alone, and stands as a classic. Not perfect, but a quirky treasure for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes ask people I know what they think of the "Princess Bride." Most say it was a great movie. Many say they could watch it on TV over-and-over. Some say their kids had seen it on TV reruns,and the kids liked it top-to-bottom - but they hadn't seen it. Some said it was a kids movie. Some said that they watched a little of it and turned to another program. Most did not see it on the big screen but cought it on TV. I hang with them if they loved it top-to-bottom, even better if they could quote some of the dialog. I hang with them if they hadn't seen it, or, even better, if their kids had seeen it (apple doesn't drop far from the tree). However, if they had the chance, then tuned it off, I drop them. They are twisted and dangerous people. If they say they saw it, but it is a kid's movie, I pity them: they have pudding heads and unformed hearts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride was indeed a priceless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I must say, Rob Reiner did it again. What an entertaining, fun movie. I did not realize that it was Robin Wright's first major film. No wonder everyone fell in love with her. Her facial expressions were priceless. I would have to say, however that Mandy Patinkin stole the show. His acting skills are so brilliant. I believe he could portray any role however its difficulty. Also, I love it when he says, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." I dedicate this comment to "Andre the Giant" whom I loved as a kid growing up. I watched his "fake" wrestling matches with my friends, and we always were very supportive of him. I thought it was great that he got to make a film with such good actors. "The Princess Bride" is a timeless piece and has its humor as well as its intense moments. Now that's pure genius. Thank you to the writer of this great film. It will be a classic like "The Wizard of Oz", "Oliver" and "The Sound of Music," the musicals. Also, who can resist Cary Elwes? How easily he made his character come to life. He portrayed his character effortlessly. (You really went from bad to good, Sean Penn, when you left Madonna for Robin. Well done! She's a true beauty. Well, sorry, I did not realize that they are now divorced too.) Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon were excellent as well. The casting was perfect...absolutely perfect. It's hard to believe it's a 20 year old film....lol.</fullReview>

All of the performances are exceptional and this certainly ranks among the few movies in the last 30 years that is perfectly cast. It has the feel of a spoof, which is no surprise with Rob Reiner at the helm. Yet at the same time it is very genuine and sincere.No other picture for me has such a plethora of infinitely quotable lines, and I still use many of them to this day. They always bring a smile to my face. I don't have anything negative to say about the Princess Bride - it has a wide appeal and with good reason. Enjoy with my warmest recommendations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, "We've just seen the Academy Award winner." If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile . But these are merely the window dressings. The screenplay is enchanting. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion. What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account is still a beautiful love and adventure story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fairy Tale With Plenty of Bite to It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grandpa (Peter Falk) comes to his grandson's (Fred Savage's sickbed) to entertain him - he's going to read the tale of the Princess Bride - a story with fencing, and giants, and all the excitement and adventure the grandson craves, with some love scenes as well. What Savage and the audience do not realize is that they are getting a bunch of the oddest figures in a fairy tale that one can imagine.On the surface THE PRINCESS BRIDE tells us the story of Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn). Westley a groom on Buttercup's estate who falls in love with (and is in love with) Buttercup. But he is lost at sea, and she reluctantly agrees to marrying Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). She is kidnapped by the a trio of brigands (Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, and Andre the Giant) who seem to intend to kill her. This can have serious repercussions on the relations of the two neighboring counties (one of which is ruled by Prince Humperdink). But the kidnappers are pursued at sea by a mysterious pirate ship. They are pursued on land too - and confronted by a legendary pirate (Elwes). He has a confrontation with each, concluding with Wallace Shawn, who outsmarts himself in a dizzy philosophical duel. So it goes in this crazy story, with it's wizards, giant rats, cruel rulers and their assistants (Christopher Guest) and duels and vengeance and true love conquering in the end. The chief villain is not physically destroyed (not even the original SHREK avoided that cliché), but left universally ruined by humiliation. The second hero neatly avenges his father. The fact is the characters behave rather realistically in this story. Guest when confronted by a physical threat behaves realistically - he flees. The marriage ceremony is presided over by "an impressive clergyman" (Peter Cook) who gets so carried away by his own eloquence he fails to do an important act in the ceremony. A wizard and his quarreling wife (Billy Crystal and Carol Kane) give a charm to help the heroes, wave pleasantly as they leave, and then admit they couldn't care less about these people.I do not think any other attempt at a filmed fairy story was ever so satiric, except the above mentioned SHREK and it's sequels (which came after THE PRINCESS BRIDE). THE WIZARD OF OZ was funny at points, but it was not a satire of the genre (and the two wicked witches in the film were destroyed). Nothing by Disney was satiric. You can consider the cartoons on ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE (FRACTURED FAIRY TALES) as a precedent, but that was a television show - not a movie. Also they were told quickly (within three or four minutes tops). But THE PRINCESS BRIDE made the fairy tale grow up. It did not forget the charm of the genre - the wonder of the dangers confronting Buttercup and Westley are there (and quite real) throughout the film. So is the warmth of the occasional scenes and comments between Falk telling the story and Savage hearing it. But they certainly knew how to make the story more accessible to adults by the spoofing. It is a very well done film and deserves a "10".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Think This Happens Every Day?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening shot of a 1980s era computer game to the Mark Knopfler song which accompanies the closing credits, nothing makes this reviewer yearn more for the days of childhood. Witty, clever, moving and brilliant, The Princess Bride is less movie and more masterpiece.The classic plot-within-a-plot works marvellously here, with the fabulously crusty Peter Falk playing the eccentric grandfather who reads the story of the Princess Bride to his sick-of-school grandson (wee Freddy Savage). The latter's typical boy bedroom gives way to the lush storybook scenery of Florin and Guilder: The Fireswamp; The Thieves Forest; The Pit of Despair; The Cliffs of Insanity. What ten-year-old could resist? Robin Wright does an enviable job playing the Princess Buttercup, but it is Cary Elwes who is the real star here, playing Westley/The Man in Black/Dread Pirate Roberts (all the same man) in the role of his career. Dashing, mysterious, but always acerbic ("the Fireswamp certainly keeps you on your toes") he skates and shimmies his way through this movie, drawing together a mutated group of merry men ? the swashbuckling swordsman intent on revenge, the giant with a heart of gold and a penchant for rhyme. His mission, of course, is timeless: dispense with the bad guy (the evil price, naturally), save the kingdom and run away with the girl. Classic.Wesley and Buttercup's initial romance ? "hear this now: I will always come for you" ? belies the tone for the rest of the film; with its sweetness and innocence the viewer may be forgiven for thinking the film is going to be devoid of darkness. On the contrary there are a few things that occur that give a glimpse of the underbelly of what initially seems perfect: the malicious Vizzini, upon encountering Buttercup riding in the forest, tells her that as there is no one around for miles, "then there will be no-one to hear you scream." Or the fact that after being forced to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck, Buttercup almost knifes herself in the heart. This uneasy wedding between storybook and darkness is reminiscent of the Brothers Grimm (the actual writers, not the awful movie) and in fact the movie as a whole is like this. The viewer gets the feeling that in order for there to be happiness, an equal amount of sadness must be dispensed elsewhere. As a child viewer these complex concepts might not be realised but they are appreciated ? there is no way that one would want the prince to get away scot-free, and the fact that he does jars. Although that's not the way life works, it should be the way children's movies work, and that may have been this reviewer's first fully-formed adult thought in a world of barbie dolls, the Muppet Show and peel-off nailpolish.Whew. But I digress. The darkness adds brilliantly to the film, fleshing it out into a saga which hooks the viewer to the very last frame. The script complements the epic cinematography ? Billy Crystal's turn as a miracle man is particularly good ("true love is the greatest thing in the world! Except a nice MLT ? mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, when the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato's fresh") ? and there are laughs all the way for adults and children alike. Huge laughs. Belly laughs. Laughs of complete astonishment and glee. It is a very sophisticated and layered script which continues to delight and surprise after multiple viewings, as when Buttercup warns Wesley of the ROUSes. "Rodents of Unusual Size?" He retorts, "I don't think they exist." Many of the best lines go to the support cast:Fezzik: I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. Vizzini: Am I going MAD, or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.But the leads also get their share, with Westley replying to Humperdinck's call to surrender, "you mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept." Inigo the revenge-bent Spaniard marvelling that the boat behind their one is catching up to them ? "I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using?" And let's not even mention the Impressive Clergyman's speech impediment.Overall the inversion of the classic fairytale genre and the brilliant acting and script are tied together with the whimsical and stylish directing of Rob Reiner. Like an onion the viewer can peel away at this movie to see what's underneath, then peel some more. The direction never descends into flippancy but nor does it escalate into snobbishness, and Reiner is content to let the film unfold at it's natural pace. Of course after many, many viewings it is hard for this reviewer to pretend to have any degree of impartiality when writing, but surely this lack of objectivity demonstrates exactly what a good movie should achieve: a love of it over and above things that make sense. Like the Fireswamp this movie keeps one on their toes. I am, of course, awarding 10 stars to what remains a nostalgic memory and what is still a masterpiece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All About The Storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to understand what's being made fun of here, in order to appreciate it. The targets here are those dramatic fantasy movies that were failures, things like "Krull" and "The Dark Crystal", or those that took themselves perhaps a bit too seriously, like "The Neverending Story". The production values of the 'within the book' parts of this movie are deliberately placed at lower quality than those of the targets -- all part of the joke.Nothing within the 'Princess Buttercup' story would be acceptable to a grown-up audience. So what makes this work is the transparent effect of envisioning this the way a ten-year-old would see it, not the way a grown-up would see it. Added to this is the layer of the grandfather reading the story to the grandson. This is engineered to be the same thing as Reiner laying out the story to us. So we have here a story that matters not at all; it's nothing without the device of framing the storytelling a certain way. It turns something utterly preposterous into something delightful and timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A story of true love that harks back to old Hollywood. All the performances are strong, It's not one of those films where one performance stands out and makes you go wow, look what they can do. For me it's about putting a group of actors together who, without fail, compliment each other.Over the years it has gained a somewhat cult status, which is strange for a film of this type, could it be that the story and the deft touches appeal even in this cynical world of ours. That could be it, it shows us a time, abet imaginary, where things are simpler, honour is important and true love is worth fighting for.This film is a joy to watch, every now and then I will return to it, expecting it to have aged. I am never disappointed, it's gentle approach and wit always hook me within the first 15 mins and I'm there to the end waiting for the Grandfathers line. Magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world that every day becomes more mired in tragedy, from selfish acts of terror to crippling natural disasters, it becomes increasingly difficult to believe that what I do matters. How can one take any pride in making movies while people offer their lives to help others?Then, once in a while, I read comments like those about this picture. As I run down the list, I see the many ways in which this picture has touched the lives of so many of you, on so many levels. Here is a story that is truly priceless in its timelessness, a movie that really did make a difference, a movie that reaches so broadly that it embraces virtually everyone. A picture that gives so much to its audience. This picture succeeds in taking us away to another place, a place of innocence and nobility, of honour and love; a place that grows ever distant from us. For that, Rob Reiner and William Goldman, thank you. For the last eighteen years of having this picture to escape to, thank you.But most importantly, for restoring my faith in the importance of this business, thank you. I only hope I can contribute to something as meaningful somewhere along the way.</fullReview>

I can't say there are any great values presented - although there's nothing questionable, really - but it's just a fun movie to sit down and laugh at. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good laugh at some REALLY funny stuff - not just the ordinary, cookie cutter jokes that most other movies provide. I also loved the storyline - it was cute and touching, and while the outcome was obvious from the beginning (as all fairy tales are), the path on which the characters would take to produce such an outcome was very interesting. It is a great movie! I strongly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't see how you couldn't like The Princess Bride. Everything that makes up this movie is incredible; the style of it, the acting, the scenery, everything is wonderful. I haven't read the original book that the movie is based on, but after seeing how god the movie is (courtesy of Rob Reiner), I should most definitely read it.The casting is perfect. Cary Elwes plays Westly, a poor farm boy who is in love with Princess Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and follows her every command with "As you Wish." When Buttercup is captured by three men and then eventually forced to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), It's up to Westly to rescue her. All of this is being told to A grandson (Fred Savage) by his grandpa (Peter Falk).The scenery is beautiful. From the pirate ship out at sea facing the shrieking eels, to the deadly Fire Swamp, the visuals and scenery will leave you in awe. Don't forget about the Cliffs of Insanity, where and epic fencing battle takes place.I remember watching this as a child and loving it very much. As I watch it again when I'm older, I love it just as much and I also realize how good of a movie it is altogether. If you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY recommend buying it right now instead of reading this. You'll want to keep it forever and watch it many many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers may be ahead, mate! I've loved this film for as long as I can remember; it's always been at the top of my 'favorites' list. Viewers have loved this film for nearly twenty years and still find the humor fresh and hysterical every time.The film could be viewed either as a fairy tale romance or satire; or both. The Evil Prince Humperdinck tries to steal and kill beautiful Buttercup from her darling Westley. Handsome Westley tries to rescue said heroine; he succeeds. They quite literally ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after. That's the gist- but you're missing out on a good deal of hysteria and laughter.Every actor in this film shines in some way. Cary Elwes is simply the perfect Westley(readers of the book, you've got to agree, I'm a book fan as well). Dashing and charming, he's lovely. Robin Wright Penn is a lovely Buttercup, with a bit more girl power than the book allows; which can be viewed as great! Very pretty; she's a good Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is hilarious and the perfect Humperdinck. Doesn't the name say a good deal? Chris Guest is cunning and somehow funny as the true villain, Count Rugen.On to the supporting cast, which I could view as shining more than the principals. Andre the Giant is absolutely charming and lovable as Fezzik- I cheered when I saw that he got to rhyme! Wallace Shawn portrays the slimy Vizzini so well that you really don't like him, but want to burst out in laughter anyway. As for Mandy Patinkin- he may beat out Westley for my absolute favorite. Mandy is one of my favorite actors from screen and stage; amazing and powerful on both. His Inigo is absolutely perfect and his comedic timing's quite good. I've always liked Inigo and rooted him on. You cheer and shout as he slays Rugen. Billy Crystal is of course, hysterical. Peter Falk and Fred Savage are an adorable on screen team.I feel like I'm running out of room; so I'll just say that the entire cast is hysterical and wonderful.All in all, this film isn't one to miss, as a cult classic or classic romance. You choose!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this movie about 5 years ago with my dad. He had loved it, and decided to force my sister and I to watch it. We were immediately turned off by the title. The Princess Bride? Sounds like a rather stupid film.It wasn't. For the duration of the film, my sister and I were entranced. Then we watched it again. Before long, we could recite half the movie.Then, a few years later, we were having out annual Halloween Movie Fest. We decided, on a whim, to watch the Princess Bride with, say, 5 or 6 of our friends. Half had seen it before, the others never had. Well, needless to say, they learned quickly. Within minutes, we were all going along with Vizzini's infamous "Inconcievable!", and laughing our heads off.If you enjoy movies that have a nice blend of action, comedy, and a little romance, then this movie is great for you. If not, watch it anyway. You may be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing through and through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up on this movie and only now do I seem to realize how truly beautiful it is. I always considered it one of my favorites, but now, when I analyze it as a whole, I realize this movie is just amazing through and through. With such a low budget, I'm still surprised how lost I get in the settings. The humor is dry and clever and the love story is simply beautiful. Anyone who sees this movie should go in with the mind to see absolute greatness, from the acting to the story itself. Recommended for anyone and everyone who likes to laugh and doesn't like "kissing books", because after this they will surely be converted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacular movie for all ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is filled with so many wonderful stories within on enthralling romantic adventure comedy. And that is what makes it so great. I have watched so many movies in my lifetime, but none can match the diversity of this one.First you have your true love encounter between Buttercup (Robin Wright) and Westly (Cary Elwes) which is the basis for the duration of it. Westly sets off on his own to 'find himself' never failing in love for his princess. Meanwhile, Buttercup has been manipulated into marrying the local Prine Humperdink (Chris Sarandon) as a token to the villagers to prove his understanding of the lower class. Of course, it's really all about him. During the courtship, you can tell that Buttercup still awaits her Westly to come looking for her. This is where the many wonderful stories unfold in this romantic fantasy.Westly comes back to find that his love has been taken by some rogue men for ransom, but there's a twist in his character at this point. He's not exactly the man he used to be. These rogue men are an odd bunch. There's Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) the philosopher, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) the swordsman, and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) the 'strongman,' which is an understatement. Westly has to rescue his princess from this band of misfits. The outcome is one not expected.Throughout the movie a grandfather (Peter Falk) is reading this story to his sick grandson (Fred Savage) who is sick and missing school.Nobody can deny that this was well thought out in the way it was written. My favorite line (probably to others as well) is by Inigo who is out to "...avenge my father." This is a definite must in anyone's movie library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time! THe thing is,I saw this in the theater almost eighteen years ago and at the time,while I enjoyed it a lot,I didn't realize what kind of special movie it was until I'd watch it again years later.To me,what marks this film as special is the fact that it dares to make the simple method of storytelling as the crux to the film. Even though the movie is,on face value,a tale of the love between Princes Butercup(Robin Wright,now Penn)and her servant boy Westley(Cary Elwes,whose career since seems to be underusing his talents),it's also many things:a caper,a comedy,a uniquely created characters,a drama,a morality tale and a love story that isn't as clichéd as it might appear. It's unapologetically anachronistic and yet still seemingly true to the sword-and-sorcerer fairy tale genre.It's also the underlying tale of the ability for the bond between a grandfather(the always solid Peter Falk) and grandson(Fred Savage,pre-"Wonder Years")to supercede a contemporary kid's need for all the comforts and instant gratification kids tend to expect anymore.BAsically,this is a well crafted weaving of two stories to fit one movie. Very strong supporting roles from Billy Crystal,Andre the Giant,Mandy Patinkin,Christopher Guest,CArol Kane,Wallace Shawn and Chris Sarandon also flesh this story out effectively.It makes me sad that Rob Reiner doesn't seem to think he needs to direct anything even remotely like this film anymore.Mark KNopfler's score is absolutely beautiful,too.I could try to say more to tell you why I think this is such a great film,but you'll just have to see this yourself to get the idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, you can find those in a common fairy tale. And we do get all those elements in this movie I'm going to talk about, The Princess Bride. Usually fairy tales have many similarities, whether the story, the characters, the sequences, the romance. The Princess Bride is a no exception. In fact, the whole plot of this movie is more simple, compared to those common fairy tales. To sum it up, this movie is only about rescuing a princess from an evil prince.Okay, here are the longer words: there was a girl, named Buttercup. She and a farm boy named Westley were lovers. But then Westley had to go somewhere, and was reported dead. Buttercup was so sad, and adding to her sorrow, she was forced to marry an evil prince, Prince Humperdinck. But, as you have guessed, Westley actually was not dead, and he must save princess Buttercup from evil Humperdinck.Then what's so special about The Princess Bride? Well, first of all, I was personally impressed by the script, written by William Goldman. The dialog was smartly written, full of funny, witty and memorable lines. Furthermore, although this movie can be simply categorized as a comedy, it does have a very powerful love story. One thing that's amazing about fairy tales is the emphasis on love. They speak about true love, which I think is getting harder to find in this modern world.Oh, I forgot to mention that this Princess Bride story is actually read by a grandpa to his grandson in the movie. I like this kind of take. Sometimes the story has to be paused and pushed back and forth because of the grandson's interruption. This slight variation is quite effective. OK, let's continue. Next, what good is a fairy tale without some good versus evil fights and some adventure? Don't worry, you'll find them in this movie. And they were impressive. I particularly love the fencing sequence between Westley and Inigo Montoya. It was really entertaining to watch. Cary Elwes, who played Westley, and Mandy Patinkin, who played Inigo, actually received extensive training in sword-fighting prior to filming this movie. And yes, they performed the sword-fights all by themselves.Finally, this is a suitable movie for all ages. I mean, it's suitable for lovers, because of the love story; for kids, because of the adventure and good versus evil theme; and for adults who will be captivated by the memorable dialog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of two lovers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just plain old wonderful! My kids enjoyed every lasting moment we saw. Now just because there is a lot of kissing, its still kid friendly. It's a wonderful tale about two lovers, sounds like your basic adventure, right? Wrong. Now this is about a tale of farm kids falling in love but the ugly,rude, infanticide king trying to destroy their love. Filled with action-pack secrets, &amp; comedic kid lines, this is one of the best family movies out there. Now of course, there is ups &amp; downs of this movie. It's old, and as my kids thought it would be in black &amp; white! Plus, it has lots of violence that you might not want to show your kids. But I guarantee you, this will light up your home with stories for the walls to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amusing fantasy farce from Rob Reiner, based on the William Goldman novel (or is it William Golding? I keep forgetting...) When little Fred Savage falls ill, his grandpa Peter Falk comes to read him the tongue-in-cheek story of "The Princess Bride".A haughty, beautiful blonde farm girl named Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) eventually falls in love with her stable boy Westley (Cary Elwes), but he has no money for a marriage so he heads out to sea to find his fortune. His ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts and he is believed dead. Years later, a stoic, emotionally traumatized Buttercup is a princess about to be wed to the evil prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). In an evil plot to stir up a war, she is kidnapped by three lugs, the pompous Vizzini, the jaunty Spaniard swordsman Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and the gentle giant Fezzik (the late Andre the Giant), only to be rescued by a man in black who looks like Zorro who turns out to be the Dread Pirate Roberts who just turns out to be... Westley! But our hero has his luck cut out for him, climbing the Cliffs of Insanity, dueling, wrestling, falling down ravines, facing the dangers of the Fire Swamp and having to survive death so that True Love can conquer all.Like I said, very funny and enchanting with well tuned performances from the jaunty cast. Ah what a beauty Robin Wright Penn was in this film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite 'sick' film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is definitely the best film for days when you're off sick, snuggled up in bed and not feeling too hot, which was exactly how it was introduced to me by my mum. It always perks me up no matter what and despite the fact that it was made in the 80s it still rocks and gets better the more times you see it. If you've already seen it but haven't read the book, are you insane?! What are you reading this for? Sprint down to your nearest bookshop and get a copy!! It's "The Princess Bride" by William Goldman. So go! Stop reading this and read the book instead! Despite the fact that the film is one of my favourites, the book has to be my favourite book of all time and probably will remain so forever. In fact all my friends agree with me and I don't think it matters if you've seen the film first or read the book first, both should appeal to everyone! In fact I recently forced one of my friends to watch it (he's refused twice and said it looked rubbish and girlie) but behold! After about an hour I stopped it, teasing him that I wouldn't force him to watch any more of this rubbish and he looked physical pained. You should have seen the look on his face! He immediately got up and tried to get the remote off me, begging me to put it back on so he could find out what was going to happen to Wesley (I stopped it at a particularly exciting part). It's got something for everyone: there's fencing and giants and evil princes and heroes and (incredibly irritating and stupid) damsels in distress and midget geniuses and a pit of despair (the zoo of death is much better in the book) and miracles and the grandson who comes in with funny one-liners every now and again (eg "Hold it, hold it. What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports?(suspiciously) Is this a kissing book?" or my favourite line: "oh, murdered by pirates is good") and revenge and torture and dragons, just kidding, no dragons, but it's got everything else! It's a bit like a fairytale but sooo much better. And it's funny! So you see, anyone from little kids to the elderly, girls and boys alike will enjoy this film. And if you don't then you're just a really strange person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you go into not knowing what to expect. Fortunately, you will be satisfied in every aspect with this little action/romance/comedy movie! There's swordplay for the action guru, a fairy tale-like love story for the romance moviegoer, and gags and dialog you'll never forget for the comedian. The Princess Bride will appeal to both kids and adults alike. It has non-graphic mild violence and a torture scene. The acting is superb, the stunts are very believable, and the story is charming. All in all, this movie is such a classic, you are guaranteed to never get bored, no matter if it's your first time watching, or your hundredth!</fullReview>

Inigo Montoya: Probably he means no *harm*. Fezzik: He's really very short on *charm*. Inigo Montoya: You have a great gift for rhyme. Fezzik: Yes, yes, some of the time. Vizzini: Enough of that. Inigo Montoya: Fezzik, are there rocks ahead? Fezzik: If there are, we all be dead. Vizzini: No more rhymes now, I mean it. Fezzik: Anybody want a peanut? I LOVE it!!! Also, I love the "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father: prepare to die!" This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I hope you will like it as much as I do!! It will always be on my top ten list!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is one of the best films of 1987 Robin Wright Penn gave an amazing performance as Buttercup a girl who fell in love with her farm boy Wesley (Elwes). When she receives word that he was murdered her heart is broken and vows she won't ever love again , but five years later her beloved Wesley returns just in time to rescue her from marrying an evil prince but not without the help of an unlikely bunch of characters. The chemistry between Cary Elwes and Robin Wright Penn is quite remarkable they help to bring the two main characters from the book to life in this wonderful movie. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys adventure or doubts true love I give it 10 out 10 , my favorite character is Wesley he never gave up on Buttercup or doubted true love.</fullReview>

Certainly, the variety of characters, for all the tastes!!As example we can consider Vizzini: "the mind". His movements, his loquacity make him a funny caricature, antidote to sadness! As well as Miracle Max, a crazy greedy alchemist with good intentions. Then, Fezzik, Inigo, Westley...

		<fullReview>I like this movie, but I'm going to point out it's weakest point first: the Princess Bride herself. As the heroine of this tongue in cheek fairy tale, Robin Wright is lovely, but sorta wooden and unemotive. I don't think she cracks a smile once. Other than that, this is one of those fun movies that anyone could watch and find something to enjoy.Though Inigo Montoya is probably the most quoted character, I thought Wallace Shawn's character was the most fun. The versatile Christopher Guest is also a hoot. This is one of those films like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" or "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" that will continue to be watched for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the Fiend's favorite movies. It has all the elements of a great fantasy, love story, action/comedy and rolls them all together with care, love, and talent.This was my introduction to Cary Elwess, and the shining star in Andre the Giant's life. I had occasion to meet Andre after his making of this film and before his death, and he literally carried a copy of this movie with him every where he went. This movie, to him, was more worthy of pride than his entire life's career as a pro-wrestler. Billy Crystal, who also starred in this production, became his closest friend, and later dedicated "My Giant," to his pal Andre.Just a little history from a buff.This movie contains swash-buckling action and sword play, strong-man elements, pirates, princesses, castles, revenge, and true love. For what more, could you ask.An all-star cast gives us all star performances. If you are a fan of fantasy, this is a definite must-see.It rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Wit and Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With adventure, fantasy, and romance, "The Princess Bride" is the perfect movie for those who like films with the aforesaid content. This movie smoothly combines fairytale and wit. Directed by Rob Reiner, this fairytale has unique twists, with swordplay, giants, and a six-fingered man. The film originates from the book by William Goldman. It was also Goldman who wrote the screenplay.Like most great films, "The Princess Bride" needed to have appropriate cast members to play those characters created by Goldman. Those who hired the cast certainly did a good job. Wesley, played to perfection by Cary Elwes, was very heroic, witty, and believable. He is the perfect "knight in shining armour", though in this film he is in black and sporting a mask. Buttercup (Robin Wright) has her flaws, such as not being quite convincing enough, but is otherwise played well, considering the type of acting needed. Other well-known actors are hidden throughout the film, such as Billy Crystal as Miracle Max, Carol Kane as Valerie, and Peter Cook as the Impressive Clergyman.Not only does a film need a good cast, but also a good story line. This, "The Princess Bride" has this. The story begins with the tragic love story of Buttercup and Wesley, who leaves to find his fortune but whose ship becomes captured by "the dread Pirate Roberts." Over time, Buttercup becomes a princess and pledged to marry Prince Humperkinck (Chris Sarandon), who conspires to have Buttercup kidnapped and killed, then blame the murder on a neighbouring land. Buttercup's three kidnappers include a giant named Fezzik (Andre the Giant), a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), and a genius named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn). The trio is well on their way, when they realize a mysterious man dressed in black is following them. This man later turns out to be Buttercup's long lost love, Wesley.Fortunately, "The Princess Bride"'s only downfall was special effects, which did not take much away from the film itself. Perhaps the most obvious is the R.O.U.S. (Rodent of Unusual Size). It can be plainly seen that it is a man or woman in a costume by the way the rodent crawls on its knees instead of its paws. Another unbelievable scene is Wesley climbing up the Cliffs of Despair. One can definitely see the rocks are not really there. The props crew should have painted the picture rocks the same colour as the 'real' rocks."The Princess Bride" is a well-rounded film that warms the heart. It is great for all ages and both genders. Local critics give it three thumbs up and five out of four stars for its charming quality and endless humour.</fullReview>

It was a very sweet, fun fairy tale kind of movie and I very much liked how the movie was made(the story being read to a curious child by his grandfather).This is very much a feel good fairy tale type of movie in the form of Ever After and The three musketeers. It's also a very sweet story with the standard "love conquers all" type of message but you believe it in the story of Buttercup and Westley.I thought Mandy Patinkin was particularly good as the fierce yet inherently decent Inigo Montoya. And of coarse there's Cary Elwes for many a girl to swoon over-did anyone else notice how much of a resemblance he has to Brad Pitt?My only negative, is a scene or two were surprisingly violent for this type of movie and people not expecting that maybe in for a surprise. But that is my only strong negative.All in all a very sweet feel good movie that's well above average and is definitely worth checking out. My vote is 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who don't like the movie, I can't really say disparaging comments to because it's not Oscar material. But when it comes to safe, family entertainment, this is one of the best. Just the classic battle between good and evil, declaration of honor and pride, the molding of love and friendships. It's a movie I'd definitely recommend to anybody who loves a good laugh (Billy Crystal provides quite a few), and a happy-ever-after ending. Cary Elwes was a gem, and the other actors were certainly very talented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE PRINCESS BRIDE (1987) **** Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant, Peter Falk, Fred Savage, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Cook. Whimsical and beautiful fairy tale based on the novel by William Goldman (who did the screenplay) with valiant swashbuckler Elwes facing all sorts of adversity in his pursuit of the beguiling enchanting Wright (her debut) as the fair Princess Buttercup. Some colorful characters and tongue-in-cheek humor poking fun at fables and storytelling nicely done by director Rob Reiner. Beautiful music by Dire Straits' frontman Mark Knopfler. Best bit: Vengence seeking Spanish swordsman Patinkin after Guest with his rehearsed promise, "Hello my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father... prepare to die!" and best line to use from a movie by saying "As you wish" and meaning "I love you."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ever heard of Plato? Aristotle? Socrates? Morons." This is one of the best pieces of comedic acting I think I've ever seen, partly because simply looking at this balding midget with the absurdly self assured smile can leave me in hysterics and also because of the sheer cheek of it all, the way he says it with a slight lisp and a raised eyebrow as if emulating someone much more handsome and suave than himself. And the timing is truly impeccable. Where is Wallace Shawn amongst the list of the comic greats? It is a true injustice that the man has not been seen as the god he is.This film is full of the most wonderful characters; even the image of this cracked old guy, S. Morgenstern writing of pirates and giants in his senility is a wonderful one and I was loathe to admit he was fictional. I loved the idea of this audacious old guy writing a book doomed to obscurity only to be found and revered by this cool grandad (Columbo or Peter Faulk if we're going to get picky and I feel I should when discussing this film) and read to the kid from The Wonder Years (who was so rightly cast in everything in the late 80s, his face when he disgusted, inquires `Is this a kissing book?' is a picture of scornful perfection. How sad that all he is now is 'The Mole' in Austin Powers 3).So Columbo tells the story of The Princess Bride and eventually the cynical kid becomes engrossed which is exactly how my love for this film started. Some things are severely hampered by their titles. Many, consider things beneath them simply from the name, and that's why people miss out on the joys of Buffy The Vampire Slayer which on the surface I'll admit looks like idle crap but is awash with surreal humor and endearing characters. Much in the same way, as a world-weary 11 year old I was wary of a film with the words Princess and Bride featuring so prominently in the title but as soon as I saw Andre The Giant (an idol of mine at the time) rhyming about peanuts and the hilarious swordfight (also wonderfully choreographed, swishy hand movements, acrobatics and all) I was won over. After watching it enough times to confidently quote it (`I'm not left handed either' whoever saw that coming?) it's become sort of a comfort blanket. I've grown to love Prince Humperdink and his shamelessly hysterical lack of morals and childish campery who expresses his displeasure with terrifying rage: `I should be very put out'.But this film has depths I never really considered until my 20th viewing. for instance The Dread Pirate Roberts was real, I read about him as a little girl, he was the longest pirate ever to be marauding and this film nicely explains how (and I firmly believe that this explanation is accurate). It is also anti war (no, it is) as it thoroughly takes the piss out of creating wars `we're starting a war, it's a long and prestigious line of work' (or something to that effect, apparently i'm not as familiar with this as i believed... i'll just have to watch it again...) So, a political satire and historical account, too.I do however have one quibble and it's a biggie... In the fire swamp they fall into a pit of sinking sand and the amount of debris on top varies from shot to shot. such oversights in continuity are simply unacceptable...This film is charming and brilliant and incase I haven't hammered my point down quite hard enough yet. I love it. Oh! and this film contains the greatest line in film history (bonus points for featuring it more than once): "My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!"10/10, actually 9/10 for the continuity... ahemSubtle and sweet spoofery at its best :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a handful of movies that fall into your view through your childhood and they capture something. From that day ever after you look forward to being sick from school because you know you are going to lye in bed all day wrapped up watching these movies and stuffing your face with junk food. The Princess Bride is one of these movies. It is also a movie that when you hear your friend hasn't seen you slip out purchase a copy and slip it into their collection. Then maybe a week or two later you'll get a cool. You probably won't understand that much. Just a serious of inconceivable, my name is. hello lady. then a sort of mad laughter. At least that's the way it goes for me. This is one of those movies all right and it's the stuff of legend.</fullReview>

None of us are tired of watching this movie even though we have lost count of the number of times we've viewed it.Every segment of the movie is well done. The adventure, romance, and comedy are clean.It's hard for me to say which scene I liked the best, but "The Battle of Wits" comes to mind if I must pick only one. Also the scene with Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife.I am very thrilled to see this movie as #88 in the top 250.

"It'd take a miracle" when Miracle Max is waving the good guys on their way.

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride has been a favorite in my family for years. Hip and exciting enough to reach the younger generations (yes still!) but a classic that any adult would be left cheering about.Many comments have been made about the outstanding direction, about the storyline, and main characters Westley and Buttercup. What truly made this movie one of my favorites while growing up were the supporting actors. Mandy Patinkin as Inigo plays a truly outstanding role in this film - he adds depth and honesty in this wonderful courageous character, who at many times falls victim to lifes pitfalls yet still has the strength to jump back into the fray.Along with a dozen other characters and cameos such as Andre the giant who plays a wonderful supporter as Fezzik in a role...well...built for him. :) The supporting characters make this movie a film for everyone - young or old.On a side note which I have to mention. The book "The Princess Bride" is phenomenal! If you love this movie please look for the book. The "good parts version" by William Goldman* is an illuminating look into the movie and the characters. Buttercup is a ditz, but charmingly so - and completely hilarious, Westley is still the cunning hearthrob and Inigo is still on his quest for the six fingered man.Want the full story on Fezzik's childhood, and wrestling career? Or Inigo's childhood? The story of Count Rugen's sword? Read the book. I promise, you wont be disappointed!* - William Goldman also wrote the screenplay for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the screenplay for Misery, the 1994 movie Maverick, and the screenplays for The Chamber and Hearts in Atlantis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes, when renting a DVD, I'm surprised to find a gem, that I missed on its original run. Rob Reiner's "Princess Bride" is one of those. For it's duration, I was transported to my childhood, and watched a dream play out on the screen.The film on its original release was badly marketed. If one of my films had been butchered that way, I would have been screaming to the rooftops. To his credit, Rob Reiner did not strangle the head of Business Affairs at Fox.This movie is pure storytelling by the premier screenwriter of our time, directed by an actor's director. It's hard to believe Reiner brought it in at $15 million. He is admittedly not a special effects wizard, ala Lucas, but nevermind. Each of his films has been something special, and in my opinion, Reiner hasn't received the recognition that some of his peers have enjoyed.It's not surprising that a son of Carl and Estelle Reiner should have a spark of genius himself.After renting the movie, I bought two copies. One goes in my collection. The other I put into storage at a Los Angeles Film Vault. When my daughter has children, that pristine copy is meant for them.Seldom has a movie had such cross over that adults and children love it. Although it failed to turn a profit at the box office, I trust later incarnations in VHS and DVD have remedied that. Today, our children read fairy tales that go back centuries. I would be very surprised if some 23rd century viewer wasn't charmed by this film no matter what the media. Bravo to the actors, the writer, the producer and director. Yes and to Norman Lear, who footed the bill. You did yourselves proud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An ill, bed-ridden little boy is paid a visit by his eccentric grandfather. The grandfather reads him a bedtime story, and the result is an enchanting, adventurous fairy tale about a young princess named Buttercup (Wright) who's kidnapped by an evil prince and separated from her one true love Westley (Elwes). With the help of a crafty swordsman and a gentle giant, Westley battles thieves, bandits, and fearsome monsters in order to try and reclaim the woman he loves. Classic story from director Rob Reiner isn't always on target, but it's woven together with rich performances, engaging swordplay, spry humor, and beautiful set design. The cast is simply perfect in this memorable and warmhearted adventure that you can enjoy again and again. ***</fullReview>

Even after 15 years, I have yet to find a film that even closely resembles this classic. That's why it will have such staying power, a presence which one will remember and pass it on for others to see. The film was well cast, from Wallace Shawn to Billy Crystal, all the way down to Mandy Patinkin, Christopher Guest and Andre the Giant. Sadly, Cary Elwes proved to be his own demon by starring in some fairly horrid films after this feature, forever placing himself in the annals of B-stardom. Hopefully, this film does not fall into the doldrums of anonymity. If you haven't seen this film, go out and get the DVD. You won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out in theatres. I was twelve at the time. In my unusually self-important childhood wisdom, I declared to all of my friends and relations that "The Princess Bride" was the best film of 1987. I suppose I was attempting to become the next Roger Ebert at the time. Now that I'm older, and I've seen many of the more seriously acclaimed films of that year, I still think I was right at the time. Has any film ever satirized a story form(in this case, the fairy tale) while embodying that form so perfectly? And has there ever been a fight scene written so intelligently as Westley and Inigo's duel? This film is a joy from start to finish, and it is one I will treasure for as long as I live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film again as part of a series on cult movies at the George Eastman House. The film student who introduced the film said something that I think sums up the `cult movie' genre. She said, `cult movies are ones we accept for what they are; we just enjoy them, no strings attached.' This is exactly how I feel about The Princess Bride. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I sit down to watch it, and am swept up in the story every time. The tale is a perfect blend of fairy-tale, romance, swash-buckling action and comedy. I think that's why people can watch this movie over and over again. It is funny, immensely quotable and action-packed, and it also has all the classic fairy tale elements: heroes, villains, a princess, and a giant. I have seen this movie more times than I care to count, but I love it every time. Rob Reiner did a great job with this film. It was made to be a cult classic. The most-loved and remembered parts of the film are ridiculous, like ROUS's (Rodents of Unusual Size) and Miracle Max's miracle pill, but in Reiner's fairy-tale land, they are easily embraced. The fact that the story is told by a grandfather reading to his grandson allows the audience to be swept up in the tale with the young grandson. The cast of The Princess Bride is amazing. They play off each other so well and make the film entertaining from beginning to end. The characters are funny, yet sincere, and there are so many moments in the movie that the viewer remembers forever after. Their quotes form the inside jokes of many cult movie fans. The actors all turn in memorable performances, and their ensemble performance makes this film a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is one of my top 5 favorite films of all time. It has it all - romance, swordfighting, giants, passion, true love, quests, etc. Any movie in which Billy Crystal has a minor - although memorable - role is a movie that will appeal to just about everyone. This is the movie to show to a diverse group of people as there is something for everyone in it. There are a couple of deaths, and one swear word but other than that, it's a movie that the whole family can AND WILL enjoy.For those of you who have seen the movie, here are a few of the classic lines: "No more rhymes, and this time I mean it." "Anybody want a peanut?""Do you think it will work?" "It'll take a miracle.""As you wish.""Wuv. Tawoo wuv is what bwings us togewer today.""My way doesn't seem very sporting.""So you mean, I'll put down my sword, you'll put down your sword, and we'll kill each other like civilized human beings?""You seem like a decent fellow.

		<fullReview>What can I say, this is THE perfect fairy tale on film. I would go as far as to say it surpasses Snow White and that is saying something. OK, the Peter Falk/Fred Savage bits may be laying the cheese on a bit thick, but they do add a knowing narrative punctuation as well as making the fairy tale world seem even more wonderful and fantastic in contrast with a sick-bed in the mid-80's. Besides, they're straight out of Golding's book.The story is perfectly paced, rushing through all the backstory and getting to the action right from the outset. All the elements you expect in a fairy story: sword-play, damsels in distress, monsters, insurmountable odds overcome, miracles and above all, true love.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are excellent leads with Andre the Giant and Mandy Patakin in support. I think top marks have to go to the script though. It's the story that makes this film, in particular the language used and way the characters interact. This is one of those films that spawns quotes. You will see lines from this film in signatures on bulletin boards across the web. That's gotta mean this is a much loved film reflected in it's deserved IMDB top 100 status.So if you're feeling down or just plain ill, watch this for an instant dose of sunshine just when you need it.</fullReview>

Not since "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" has a movie been so quoted. All the acting by previously unknown actors is superb, considering the budget the movie had. "The Princess Bride" is a movie many people missed in the theaters. See it now, or see it again, and you'll see how good of a movie it is for people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've ever doubted the magic and timelessness of this movie, show it to 9th graders.Youngsters who have grown up watching the inane films of today's pop culture are completely mesmorized by the wonder of this film.It's intelligent, witty, funny, touching and overall entertaining.To those of you who feel the need to compare the book to the movie, I say, "Stop!" There's no reason to compare. The book was wonderful in it's own right but so is this movie.And I mean it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I downloaded this movie &amp; the entire time I was watching it, it seemed partially familiar. By the fight seen on the cliff, and the poison death, I KNEW I'd seen it before, several years ago. I guess because it's over 10 years old, I don't hear people speak of this movie very much, which is a shame, as it is a wonderful movie! It reminded me a lot of Robin Hood, Men In Tights, so if you liked this movie, I recommend seeing that one also. Last night, I was looking up Robin Hood, Men in Tights and discovered that these two movies have the same lead male actor! Not I want to see more of his movies, because I really like his style. I wouldn't be surprised if the two movies have several other common cast and crew. Make sure you see this great film!</fullReview>

It has unforgettable characters such as Westley(Cary Elwes)who does a perfect job as the hero,as well as help from former enemies Inigo(Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (Andre the Giant).The acting is great, the story line is fantastic and unforgettable quotes.(Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.You killed my father. Prepeae to die!). I also had the pleasure of reading William Goldmans book in my 10th grade english class which was a real treat.I have not a single bad thing to say about The Princess Bride.I'd tell anyone to see this movie in a heartbeat.Definately 5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has always been one of my all time favorite movies. I bought the DVD recently and watched it for the umpteenth time and it amazes me that even though I practically know the film by heart, I still laugh throughout. The performances are universally excellent, especially Elwes and Wright as the leads and Patinkin who delivers one of the most famous lines in movie history (at least as far as my generation goes.) And that brings me to my point in this review: this should be a classic for EVERYONE. I'm a teacher, and I've asked my students if they've seen this movie (eighth graders) and the majority of them have not. This absolutely amazes me. My instant response is: "Go get it. You will love this movie, I promise." To this day I have not met someone who dislikes The Princess Bride -- and really, how could you? Comedy, adventure, romance...it's all here!As is true of most movies from books, the source material IS better than the film, but I didn't read the book until years after the movie had become a cultural touchstone. So once you've seen the movie, do yourself a a favor and read the book -- you'll be enchanted all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heroes, Giants, Wizards, Villians, True Love (, and a spectrum). Not just your basic average, everyday, ordinary, run-of-the-mill, ho-hum fairy tale.The Princess Bride is simple wonderful. The most recognisable actors take up supporting roles, giving Robin Wright and Cary Ewles the chance to capture the screen, and the audience.Romantics amongst you will enjoy this as a love story. Non-romantics will enjoy the humour and sarcasm.The acting is of a good quality, though admittedly its nothing spectacular. The story is excellent (NB. The book is even better than the film) and direction is good. The tempo of the film varies nicely, allowing the audience to take a breather, yet doesn't leave you looking at the lights.My only complaint of the film is that we completely miss out on a few of the highlights featured in the book. I prefer films that haven't had the hollywood treatment, and avoid the happy ever after ending. In the main this film avoids the hollywood standardisation. It has however deserted the books unusual and intelligent ending for a less brave finish which leaves you satisfied.Ultimately, this Oscar winning film is not a classic, but is very enjoyable and well suited to a wide audience. Kiddies, grannies, parents, teenagers and couples will all enjoy the story. Separately or together.The R2 DVD contains few special features, a trailer and a few profiles. The quality of picture is good and the clarity of audio is to be appreciated. Disappointingly (and to my amazement) there are no subtitles. You'll want this film on a media that will last.8/10 Watch the film, read the book and send me the T-Shirt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get the very obvious out of the way immediately. Cary Elwes is gorgeous, perhaps in this movie more than anywhere else.Having said that, let's move on to the meat of the film.It must be understood that "The Princess Bride" is, first and forever, my favorite book. William Goldman's brilliant masterpiece has been lovingly transferred from the page to the screen with only some necessary changes, and the result is a charming, fun-for-the-whole-family cinematic joy ride. Rob Reiner may be Meathead to a lot of people, but to me he'll always be the guy who gave us this movie.Buttercup (a young Robin Wright Penn, in her first starring role) is a beautiful girl who one day realizes that Westley (Elwes), the young man who does the grunt work around her farm, is in love with her. Not only that, but she's in love with him too. Before they can be married, he sets off to America to make his fortune and is promptly abducted and murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Deeply shattered, Buttercup reluctantly consents to be the bride of hunting-obsessed Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), heir to the throne of their native Florin.It's a story within a story, actually. A wizened grandfather (endearingly played by Peter "Columbo" Falk) is reading the novel to his ill grandson (Fred "Wonder Years" Savage), whose vivid imagination produces the visuals of the movie. As the story strengthens the bond between the two of them, we get to enjoy Buttercup's up and down adventures en route to her wedding day to the prince. She gets kidnapped. She gets stolen from her kidnappers by another apparent kidnapper. Marvelous performances are delivered by such Hollywood notables as Wallace Shawn, Mandy Patinkin, Christopher Guest, and the late, great Andre the Giant. Show-stealing cameos are given by Billy Crystal as Miracle Max, the disgruntled wizard-of-sorts, and Carol Kane as his witchy wife, Valerie. The late Peter Cook puts in a brief but unforgettable appearance as an ancient bishop with a speech impediment.Do they live happily ever after? Do we find out what really became of Buttercup's true love? Is there anything better than a nice MLT (mutton, lettuce, and tomato sandwich)? If you don't already know, I think it's time you found out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cary Ewles has my deepest admiration for this. All the actors in this movie do. Driven by an incredibly intelligent and tight script, this movie leaves you laughing as it demands your attention and respect for it's wit and occasional subtle seriousness. If it were poorly done it would be ridiculous. The sets are purposely set-like, the costumes mundane, and the various obsticles stereotypically "once upon a time", but together they make happy magic. Every line is superbly delivered and the zing of fun never leaves. You KNOW it's a fairy tale, it SAYS it's a fairy tale, but what it really is is a never-tiring comedy that works for all ages, and will probably make you laugh and sigh. It works like it's hero, with "wit, steel, and speed".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar to 'Spinal Tap'...really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a wonderful piece of work by Reiner. His 'Spinal Tap' movie is considered by many to be one of the greatest rock movies ever, even though it is a spoof! In many ways, Reiner has pulled the same trick here. The middle eighties was a brave time to film a fairy story, and it would have been so easy to go for a slick, urbane allegorical story set in Manhattan or some such. Reiner goes the other way, and parodies the fairy tale genre, ramping it up and camping it up with ridiculous characters and settings. This gung-ho larger than life approach has given us a wonderful fantasy with heroes we love to love and villians we love to hate. And whoever penned the line "...with eyes like the sea after a storm" please make themselves known. Call me an old romantic, but I would lay down and die for any girl who said that about me :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most Brilliant Films ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when it premiered in the theatres in 1987. My mother took me to see when I was a child, and we both loved it. Many years passed, and while I remembered it, years went by before I saw it again. Some years ago back in high school, friends and I were discussing it and we all reminisced about how much we had enjoyed it as kids. So, we decided we had to see it again and dashed out to rent it. What a surprise! It was like seeing it for the first time again, only this time it was even better! It was so amazing and so hysterically funny that we had tears in our eyes from laughing so hard. From that day on, it was added to my 'favourite films' list and every year that passes I love it more. I own it on VHS, DVD, and now wonderfully on the brand new Special Edition DVD. Out of all the various films I own on VHS and DVD, The Princess Bride is the only film I own three copies of. Now, THAT's dedication! ;-) I have to say the regular DVD edition from last year was sadly disappointing. It only has a chapter search, original theatrical trailer, and the film on it. So, if you haven't purchased this film on DVD yet, I highly recommend the Special Edition version which arrived September 4, 2001. It is exactly what I have always wished for, full feature commentary, actor interviews, "making of" featurettes, etc.This film is an amazing classic, a film I feel that is generally enjoyed even more by adults than children. That is certainly the case for my own generation that remembers it from childhood as well as adulthood. With it's satirical comedy, witty romance, and high adventure, for me this film ranks high with other classics such as Breakfast at Tiffany's, Rear Window, and Notting Hill, which are some of my other favourites. Not to mention some of the most spectacular scenery. For many years after so many viewings I thought that the Cliffs of Insanity scenes were filmed on the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland. I am happy to report that with the Special Edition DVD this confirms my belief as correct! I realize that some scenes were shot on a set, but mostly they really did film it on the Cliffs of Moher. I have been to the Cliffs of Moher, and they are even more breathtaking in person than on film. For anyone who hasn't been there, the Cliffs of Moher (pronounced "More") are 700 ft cliffs that drop off sharply into the Atlantic ocean off of the coast of County Clare in the West coast of Ireland. Ireland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and the wonderful scenery this country provides really adds to the ambiance of the film.Anyone who enjoyed this movie should definitely read the book this film is based on. It's a wonderful book and seeing the differences between William Goldman's book and his screenplay is fascinating.</fullReview>

I simply can not recommend it enough.Some have commented negatively on the *very* low budget special effects and sets, but I find that they fit perfectly with the movie. It is not meant to be a big budget Hollywood spectacular - it is meant to be a story of fantasy, a story of "Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles...", and that it most certainly is.My only "gripe" is that the DVD has pretty much no special features.</fullReview>

It has Andre the Giant (R.I.P), Shawn Wallace, and many other great actors playing great characters. This movie has something for everyone. And if someone tells you that they did not like this movie more than likely they probably liked the movie Good Burger. It is a great movie and is worth seeing at least once. But I suggest many more times than that. Because it continues to get better with each time you sit down and watch it. If you don't fall in love with the characters I feel sorry for you.</fullReview>

I think everyone should watch it, just because it is cute, which I am normally against "cute" movies, but I still love them. There are so many funny lines, and even though the acting might leave some things to be desired, I still like Billy Crystal. A timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>may contain spoilersAfter a long exhausting mundane day that has my head whirling, nothing brings back my sense of balance as fast as a good film. Curled up on the sofa with a large bowl of popcorn, I start The Princess Bride and immediately gain a partial identification with the grandson in the respect of just not feeling well. Then, the story begins, and I feel transported to a magical realm filled with dream like images, the cottage, the country, the hills. And there, two beautiful people test each other and discover true love. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I am grabbed at this point and the day with all it's stress is totally forgotten. I am immersed in the interaction of these two characters.As any idyllic moment can never be sustained, thus begins the adventures therein, painted in those same dream like images that speaks louder, perhaps, to the subconscious than the dialogue that pacifies, teases, and delights the discriminating mind. I believe it is the union of these two elements, the visual as well as the verbal, that has activated the alchemical elixir to turn what could otherwise be an average film into one of pure gold.The Dream unfolds. Sailing past the riverbank shrouded with giant trees transforms into what now appears as a dark blue ocean under what must be a full moon. Light dances on the water. On the ship, is sanctuary, and lamp lit gold light bathes the voyagers. The princess bolts from her present reality, and plunges into this dark watery void, suddenly vulnerable to the unknown monsters that rise from its depths, a nightmare quality that plunges us all into fear. After being plucked from certain fate, dream like again, the boat has instantly arrived at the foot of the cliffs of insanity. The impenetrable barrier of the rock cliffs of despair rise seemingly forever upwards and is only tamed by the dream like image of the characters climbing the rope at an amazing speed, a visual statement that all obstacles can be overcome.Throughout the whole of the movie, even the poses of the characters remain artistic and true to the form of dreams and imagination. Conjure up an image of a dashing swords man, daunting pirate, regal prince, gentle king, pompous bishop, and they are there. The visual artistry is carried through to the end, whereon our heros ride off on beautiful pure white horses. My heart soars. Pure Magic. And no matter how stressed I was before watching the film, at the end I feel good and can go to bed with a smile on my face.Many people have commented favorably on the dialogue on which I agree, yet few have touched on the graphical metaphors and artistic imagery which I believe has enhanced The Princess Bride enough to make it one of my all time favorite films. It's a 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the fantasy of every little girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a time in every little girl's life when she wishes to be saved from the clenches if evil by some handsome prince that she can live happily ever after with. She will go so far as to dress up as a princess, find a boy, and threaten him into saving her from the scary "laundry room monster". Threats work on little boys in this way.she says she will kiss him if he doesn't comply. Thus, a little girl can enjoy the fantasy of being a mistress in distress for a wonderful and magical - five minutes. Now, we can avoid our little boys from getting the cold, or worse yet mono, by simply playing a movie in your very own living room. This magical movie is called "The Princess Bride". If you've never seen this movie, it is a must see and it will make you feel as if you were a little kid again. When I showed this movie to my little sister of ten years, she was amazed. we had no sooner finished the movie when I heard from her little mouth, "Can we watch it again?!" If you don't want to see it yourself, do your kids a favor and do not deprive them of seeing this masterpiece of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get in touch with your inner child.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greats of modern cinema. A screenplay by the author and music by none other than Mark Knopfler of Dire Staits fame are just the beginning. This delightful fairy tale is as appealing to adults as to children. Maybe that's because it brings out the child in all of us, thanks in no small part to Rob Reiner's virtuoso direction.Robin Wright, as Buttercup, and Cary Elwes, as her true love Westley, were at the beginning of their careers here, but their performances are flawless. The entire cast, many of them marquee stars in their own right, delivers unforgettable performances, but Mandy Patinkin is the standout. His line "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." is a classic.If you ever feel that you've lost touch with your inner child, pull this one off the shelf and revel in it anytime you feel the urge. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a bottle of aspirin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was sitting at home in a snowstorm with a fever, chills and a bit of nausea. Time to watch a movie - but which movie? I spied my copy of the Princess Bride I bought after getting my DVD a few months ago. The last time I saw this was several years ago on VHS at a friend's in monophonic. What a spectacular experience on my new Sony Trinitron with a good stereo sound system! The nuances of color are wonderful and the sound track impeccable.I have seen this movie several times over the years, and enjoy it just as much each time. How many movies can you say that of? Still, you don't want to wear it out. My suggestion is every home should have a copy of The Princess Bride, but save it for when someone is sick, just like the book in the movie. It sure made me feel better, even though I am a grown up.Rob Reiner and the rest of the crew deserve a lot of credit for this movie. It is one of those gems where everything seems to fall into place perfectly. Thank you!Evidently there is at least one cynic out there, though, who was not touched by this gentle fairy tale, which is ironic considering one of the greatest cynics of all worked on this movie: Norman Lear, creator of All in the Family. I agree with "markwilson" about Titanic; if I had to watch that when I was sick, I would probably shoot myself. All I can say, Mr. MW, is if The Princess Bride doesn't cheer you up, next time you get sick, make sure you have a big bottle of aspirin, and drink plenty of tequila.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a near-perfect fantasy/adventure/comedy, and one of the best films that the 1980's have to offer. Based on a hilarious book by S. Morgenstern and scripted by William Goldman, Rob Reiner showcased a deft touch for directing material which required just the right tone to work. The casting made the film, IMHO. Cary Elwes was a dashing Wesley, Robin Wright a beautiful Buttercup, Andre the Giant was born to play Fezzick. And that's not even mentioning the great cameo by Billy Crystal.By following the spirit of the superb source material, The Princess Bride proved a winner. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect No Matter What Kind of Movies You Like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. For the longest time, people would ask me if I had ever seen The Princess Bride, and I would say, "Um...no. That sounds like a stupid movie." But then one of my friends practically forced me to watch it, and I thought, "Well, it's a half-hour of my life: if it is bad, it won't kill me, but if it is good, then all the better." Well, needless to say, I loved it. I usually don't like the fantasy movies, but this movie was funny (maybe hilarious is a better term), romantic, action-packed, and keeps you guessing. I finally saw the whole thing not too long ago, and I loved it so much that I had to buy it. Since I did, I think I have seen it about 5-6 times a week. And every time I watch it, I laugh at the somewhat unrealistic beginning, and pretty much don't stop laughing until the end. Also, all the characters have such diverse personalities that you can't help loving each and every one of them. From Westley's comedic outlook on life, to Inigo's revengeful outlook, each and every character brings this story to life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so pleased that there are so many other people who love this movie as much as I do. I first saw it at the age of 14, and I still love it, though I am now twice the age and have seen it dozens of times. It is such a brilliant movie on so many levels - the kids love it for its fairy tale value (so do a few of us grownups), but there is a brilliantly subtle blend of humour and satire which underlies the whole movie. The love scenes are not overdone or mushy and the action scenes are finely crafted and brilliantly executed. The movie is full of witty dialogue and quotable quotes galore. We own this movie on DVD (after much searching) and I will definintely play it regularly to my children (when I have some). Something for everyone here, except those with no heart, little intelligence, or even less humour. I hope to wear Buttercup's blue dress when I get married, as I think it is the most beautiful costume she wears.Please, if you haven't seen this movie, get comfortable with someone you care about and do it soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very rich and charming film. If you haven't seen it yet, definitely rent it now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I waited this long to see this. I guess I expected 'the usual.' Well that is exactly what you won't get, even in the context of "Once upon a time.."The tone is so sincere and gentle that even the farcical aspects never really overwhelm the whole. It never sinks to low humor or schmaltz. (Westley's unruffled optimism has a great deal to do with this.) Even the visual and physical humor is subtle and delightful because each instance is not belabored (e.g., our first view of the large medium and small circus performers, The Dread Pirate Roberts as Zorro, the lighting-speed rope climb, Vizzini's demise, the suction cups, the bellows, Westley as baggage). And nothing is frenzied, even when there is ?less than half an hour before the princess weds' or the violins play madly.The script is fantastic. Every character gets a few great lines, and every aspect of the film is treated with humor--nothing and no one escapes, yet there is no hard edge, no sting. Supremely quotable.The casting is inspired and the characters are interesting (except perhaps Buttercup, because she plays the only straight role--but she is very beautiful). Westley, Inigo, Fezzik, and Vizzini are truly memorable. The hero has a delightful cynicism. The swordsman is also sensitive; the giant is also reflective. The Sicilian is a brilliant political conspirator and not the player seeking vengeance. The evil count maintains an interest in empirical observation while torturing Westley. The evil prince reveals himself slowly and doesn't sneer or gloat to excess. My only criticism of the characters is Billy Crystal's portrayal of Miracle Max. Why bother with the heavy makeup if he just plays Billy Crystal? His part was hilarious, but brought me right out of the movie. I wish he'd stretched a little here--his range is so wide when he tries.The unexpected touch of reality inserts itself often into this fairy tale: 'Get used to being disappointed', Australian poisons and land wars in Asia, 'Life isn't fair', 'Life is pain? Anyone who says differently is selling something,' ?I'm swamped,' the 'shortage of perfect breasts in this world,' and the conspiracies to incite war between two nations named after monetary denominations.There is a variety of underlying morals to the story, presented without preaching: the lasting ties of true love, the sacrifices made for friendship, the importance of family, that things worth having are not easy to obtain, don't ever give up because you never know what could happen.This rare and endearing film seems to appeal to everyone, even 7 year old buys who hate kissing. I feel sad for those who did not fall in love with this movie--they seem doomed to lives of bah humbugism. But there's always hope...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard -- good grief, it's IMPOSSIBLE -- to expand on what other commenters have said. But with a movie like this, nobody can stop me from trying anyway! So here are some specifics to add to the general cheer:1. This movie proves that there's still a place for the hackneyed phrase "entertaining for all ages."2. I'm not the least bit surprised to hear some reviewers report that this movie affected their love life or even catalyzed their marriage. I don't know of any contemporary film, and in fact I'm hard-pressed to think of any film of ANY era, that addresses "true love" so openly, so perfectly, and with such lasting effect. Here is a film that treads boldly in an area that almost always suffers from excessive schmaltz or cuteness, yet handily escapes both. Anyone who dislikes The Princess Bride is probably a very unhappy and pitiable person.3. This movie has the wrong title. I can't suggest an alternate but I'm sure I would have seen it years earlier had it been named something else -- possibly *anything* else. ;)4. It's a major accomplishment for a movie that doesn't easily fall into one of the ultra-standard drama categories to rate a spot on the IMDB's "Top 250" list, especially 13 years after its release.5. If you're the kind of person who reads the "Memorable Quotes" section here before you see the movie, try to resist that. The most precious lines in this film -- and there are dozens -- have many times more impact when you don't see them coming.6. See it with someone you care about. Or if that's not possible, see it to help you realize how easy it is to care about someone.</fullReview>

If you check the filmography of each actor credited for The Princess Bride and click on "Sorted by Ratings", you'll see that this film is rated either #1 or #2 for ALL BUT ONE of its actors. In other words, this film is populated almost entirely with people who did some of their best work in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best tributes for this film for came in 1989 when I saw it at a second run theatre in Pittsburgh run by the Pitt theatre department. Most of the audience was college students, many of them dressed all in black theatre students, who at the end when Peter Falk said, "As you wish," let out a huge collective "Awwwwwww." This film speaks to the idea of true love, on many different levels - obviously the romantic version between Westley and Buttercup, but also the true love between friends who will do anything for each other, as Fezzik, Inigo and Westley do for each other, and also a true paternal love as witnessed by Peter Falk's final line. I cannot see this movie enough times.</fullReview>

Then the kidnappers take the princess Buttercup and the scenes with Inigo Montoya and Fezzik and Vizzini are fabulous...especially when The Dread Pirate Roberts climbs the cliffs with his bare hands...

		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is one of the few movies ever made that captures romance, wit, true love, honour, action and flawless acting as well as this one does, and wraps it up into a nice little package.The script is amazing, the accents are great, and there are some pretty fun one-liners: "Nah, he's only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead". - Mad Max "You son of a bitch" - Inigo Montoya "Think they'll make it?" "Not a chance!" (waving cheerfully) - Mad Max and his wife (Valerie??)And the acting talent is amazing! "Jumpin' Jack Flash"'s Carol Kane and Multiple Oscar-presenter Billy Crystal and wonderful in their roles as Mad Max and Valerie; TV actor Wallace Shawn, little-known Patty Matinkin and ex-wrestler André The Giant all have excellent characters, but, undoubtedly it's "Liar Liar"'s Cary Ewles and "Forrest Gump"'s Robin Wright portrayals of lovebirds Westley and Buttercup, that steal the show. "Wonder Years" starlet Fred Savage also appears.The special effects, settings and costumes are absolutely stunning (even by 1987's standards) and all help the film create a majestic fantasy feel. Brilliant. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something for everyone...an unbiased look at my favorite movie of all time:)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How anyone could give "The Princess Bride" a grade of "1" is to me "absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable!" This story has such a myriad of features, "fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles," just to name a few. If you're in to logical deduction, you'll get a good laugh when Wallace Shawn's Viccini and "the man in black" engage in a highly entertaining battle of wits. If it's serial killers you like, pay special attention to the character of Count Ruger, a demonic villain obsessed with pain, played to perfection by Christopher Guest. If you're more the heartwarming sentimentality type you'll enjoy the scenes between the narrator, a loving yet undoting grandfather played by Peter Falk and his at-first-bratty but increasingly lovable grandson, played by a prepubescent Fred Savage. If what gets your blood pumping are those "When Animals Attack" specials, you'll be interested in seeing Carey Elwes' character, Westley, battle it out with a Rodent of Unusual Size. If you're like me you'll love it all! If however, you are looking for superficial, big budget special affects, you might have to wait for Schwartzennager's next movie. Yes, all in all I'd have to say with an objective eye that "The Princess Bride" has something for ALMOST everyone. And for all you grinches out there who can't find your niche in this film, let this message "echo in your perfect ears," I hope for your own sake that "some day you might not mind so much."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can remember sitting at my friends Jess' house when this movie first came out and absolutely loving it. It appealed to my little girl love for fairy tales, prince and princesses, and knights in shining...well..in tight black pants. I also loved it for the time period. Now, watching it I love it for all those reasons and more. I appreciate the tougue in cheek humor and can enjoy it's silly, almost campy attitude. I love this movie. It's just such a simple joy to watch and one can't help but be happy after watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 5-year-old daughter saw this movie for the first time last Sunday night. My husband and I watched it with her, naturally, since it's one of our all-time favorites. At first she was a little skeptical (much like Fred Savage's character) ... you know, the old "What are you trying to do to me now, Mum?" bit. "Trust me," I said.Well, throughout the movie she kept saying things like "She's not really married to Humperdink, is she?". "Is Westley hurt?" "Are they going to be okay?". And at the end she unconsciously mimicked Fred Savage yet again by asking "Can we watch this movie again tomorrow night?". Smug grin. My work is done here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inigo Montoya: "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!"Immortal words spoken from the most heartfelt character, second only to Westley (the farm boy) in this film.This is an AWESOME film filled with adventure, revenge, and true love."As you wish" is the ear mark phrase bellowed by our hero as he sets out on his life adventures which eventually lead to fighting for his love. The earmark phrase for is fist is "to the pain"... as he "battles" the despicable Humperdink in the quest to save his true love, Buttercup.If you have seen this film and don't think it is awesome I can't imagine what is so. In any case I would heartily recommend this to any and all potential viewers.The closing words by Fred Savage as we finish the movie should serve as recommendation to all: "Grandpa, maybe you can come over and read it to me tomorrow."Which is how we would all feel about this beautiful story if our hearts let us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first premiered 13 years ago. At the time it was on a first date with a girl I adored. We both fell in love with the movie and we saw it 5 times at the theater. I have bought the video, later on the Dvd, and if I see playing somewhere on direct TV, I will still watch it. The movie is about true love as I married the girl I saw the movie with. We even used story book love as our wedding song. The cast of characters are wonderfully played. All the way from Peter Falk to Andre the giant to all the cameo appearances. I have been reading most of the user comments and very rarely do you see a movie where all comments are all the same. We all love this movie and it makes me wonder why it has never garnered the attention like some other "feel good" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure genius! Why do I say that? Well... is this film making fun of the genre, or is it embracing it? Both, it seems!Rob Reiner's instant classic film sweeps us away to the story of true love between a fair maiden and her lovingly loyal servant. An abundance of humour, of thrills, and of "inconcievables" follows. Goldman's fantastic adapted screenplay (of his own book) gives us laughter, drama, and warms our hearts -- and those of generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some rather negative reviews of this film here and I don't understand why. The Princess Bride is the type of movie that I can watch over and over, despite its imperfections. Normally these things (technical goofs, average story, etc.) would bother me, but I think the key here is that it's a movie aware of its limitations.Everyone involved in this film seems to have had fun without taking themselves too seriously. I mean, really, how can you take a movie with lines like: "you rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles." seriously? Are people expecting high art? Please... I wish people who watch this movie would just try to have fun with it instead of looking for the various flaws.9/10 for sheer fun &amp; entertainment value, and for the great lines, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another one of those films to further solidify Rob Reiner's place in film directing history.This wonderful film exploits every cliché you can imagine from fairy tales to Camelot style "B" movies. At the same time, it has a very real story that keeps it from being the Mel Brooks pure farce in which star Cary Elwes would latter also play a part - "Robin Hood: Men in Tights". Despite rompus fun, this one utilizes virtually no sight gags, and, as such, the dialog remains the driving force of the film - you find yourself reciting lines long after the last time you see the film (and I recommend seeing it regularly - it's still good every time).All in all - it's at the top of my recommendation list for kids ages 2 - 202.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to meet a person who watched this move and didn't find it evnjoyable. It's a simple, yet innovative idea: they made a classic, archetypical Dark Ages hero/romance flick, but set it right on the edge between satire and earnestness. The whole story is, supposedly, a book a grandfather (Peter Falk) reads to his sick grandkid (Fred Savage). It should tell you all you need to know about this film when, the first time the two estranged lovers find each other and embrace, you all of the sudden hear, "Wait, I don't wanna hear about kissing."The principle actors here are all very good. Cary Elwes is fine as our dashing hero. Mandy Patinkin is his foil/friend, with his own subplot. Robin Wright is fine as the damsel in love and distress, and Chris Sarandon makes a good evil, scheming villain, and he's a highly underrated character actor (see "Dog Day Afternoon" if you don't believe me).The real beauty of this film, however, is the performances turned in by such actors as Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, Carol, Kane, and that noted thespian, Andre the Giant. Shawn, for instance, is the con man with a list who is the early (not final) villain. His character is short, has a lisp, and uses the same word (he prounounces it "inconthievable") to address every situation (which leads to the best quote of the film, Patinkin's response "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.") It's this kind of dialogue that seems out of place in such an action/romance film. "The African Queen" or something or the like, while being fine movies, would never have a character like Billy Crystal's "Miracle Max", who plays a sort of caricature of a Jewish parent (to me, anyway).The beauty of this film is that you aren't quite sure if you should be laughing, or should be caught up in the story, and the beauty is that you can do both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Love. What can now these days be seen as "inconceivable" is brought effortlessly to film in this tale of a couple parted by "death" brought back to life amidst fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, monsters, giants, chases, escapes, miracles and a really annoyingly snotty prince. The film is brilliantly cast. Every one fits their part perfectly. I can't imagine anyone else but Cary Elwes playing Westley, Robin Wright playing Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin as the vengeful Inigo, Andre the Giant as the good natured Giant, Wallace Shawn as the "brilliant" Sicilian...so on and so forth....each character in each of their quirks fits the bill in this fantasy great....all the way down to the priest with the speech impediment. Together they make one of the greatest stories ever told. It brings hope and wonder back to a world that is lacking both. It is just pure goodness (matched with subtle, yet delightful humor) . If you are looking for an escape from the way things work in this day and time, I definitely suggest watching this movie and taking it to heart. It will remind you that there is still good left in the world and that true love is the greatest thing God has given us. Westley and Buttercup have to be one of the great couples ever to have "lived" If you are looking for other movies that personify this goodness that does exist in human nature, i would have to suggest the timeless Anne of Green Gables. Next to the for-mentioned Westley and Buttercup, the two characters fated to be together Anne and Gilbert through her he naive optimism and imagination and his charm also bring back the good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly the best movie to watch with a partner. The love story is one of the best I have ever seen, rivalling and possibly surpassing Casablanca. The script that goes with it is brilliant as is the acting and screenplay. Rob Reiner has created a masterpiece that must be watched by anyone and everyone.Some great acting performances by almost all of the cast, watch especially for Billy Crytal's cameo. Andre the giant does quite well with Fezic, the kind-hearted giant, and Mandy Patinkin's performance as Inigo Montoya is incredible.The swordfight scene between Wesley and Inigo deserves special mention as it has been voted the best in any movie by IMDB and displays the talent of the fencers very well. The conversation they have during the fight is also excellent.I cannot praise this movie enough and can find no flaw. Watch it, and watch it again, preferably with girlfriend/boyfriend/husband/wife. You'll both enjoy it tremendously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is in my opinion the perfect example of a simple, brilliant film-making. It has everything; humour, excitement, villains, sword-fights, unbelievably funny one-liners and one of my most favourite movie quotes: "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father, prepare to die!" What else can you ask for in a movie?All the roles are perfectly cast. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are still today one of the loveliest on-screen couples I've ever seen, and the story and chemistry helps it make me believe in what I call "true love". There is nothing more beautiful than true love. The Princess Bride always reminds me of that.Mandy Patinkin is excellent as Inigo, Andre the Giant as Fezzik and all the other small roles too.I also have to say that Mark Knopfler's music is magically perfect. I can't stop listening to it. It is so beautiful and makes me feel so too.Script, sets, cinematography, costumes.... everything seems so perfect and I suspect making this film was a great joy. Rob Reiner's finest work, without doubt, and an example for all filmmakers: this is what cinema is about. True love and true adventure.All the Disney adventures and all the action adventures can't compete with this one. This is probably once in a lifetime experience and I'm happy to say that I'm a fan. Of course there are people who don't like it and really want me to explain for them what is so special. I always think of the things I've written here and reply: "As you wish!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To quote an Irish friend, this movie warms the cockles of your heart. Actually he was referring at the time to It's a Wonderful Life, but it applies equally to The Princess Bride (and more in my opinion!). It's a bit of a spoof I suppose, although the word doesn't seem gentle enough for the light humour in this story that has everything - action, adventure, romance, comedy. I know everybody says that, but it's true! If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop reading reviews of it and go out &amp; rent it - in fact skip that part &amp; go right out &amp; buy a copy. I have watched this movie more often than any other &amp; will often pop it in the VCR to cheer myself up on a rainy day.

		<fullReview>I first saw the Princess Bride about five or six years ago, and since then have only seen it a few times. But when I was in the video store, I saw it on the shelf and said to myself, "I don't watch this enough". When I put it in the machine, I discovered that it was just as good, or perhaps even better, than the first time I saw it. It is just the best action/adventure comedy in the history of movies. This movie has everything; giant rodents, shrieking eels, really bad guys, and a hero in a Zorro costume. I like the sword fighting, the monsters, the humor, everything! The overall best scene in this movie is when Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (Robin Wright) are making their way through the Fire Swamp. The part where the giant rat leaps onto Westley right after he says, "I don't think they exist" is funny as hell! And after it is all over, all you'll want to do is leap out of your chair and say, "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."I give it a 10 out of 10, the perfect movie!</fullReview>

Mandy Patinkin, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, and Christopher Guest are all terrific. Robin Wright (Penn) is lovely. Just plain fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this film? It is one of my all time favourites that has a truly superb cast mixing well know and established actors (Billy Crystal, Peter Cooke, Peter Falk) with at the time unknowns (Carey Elwes, Robin Wright). I watched this many times as a kid not appreciating various aspects but watching it now I realise how corny it is in places and that only adds to the films excellence, this film could not have been totally serious with Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Peter Cooke as the impressive Clergy Man. This is one the whole family can enjoy, either together or alone. Every so often a true Gem of a film comes along and this was one. If you have the misfortune not to have seen this film then I highly recommend it, if you have already seen it, I'm sure you love it and I urge you to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like the subject says. There are a handful of videos I consider essential to anyone's collection, this is near the top of the list. There are technically better movies of course, but none of them have the heart and humor of The Princess Bride. I think the performances of the actors is a big part of what makes this film so good. Billy Crystal and Carol Kane shine in an all-too brief scene, and Mandy Patinkin is simply a joy to watch as Inigo Montoya, a performance I have never seen him match to this day. It is a children's movie that any adult could (and should) watch and should be at the top of any parent's list of films their children should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I had the flu, and I hurt all over so badly I couldn't sleep. I was trapped on the living room couch, wondering if I'd ever recover, and the only thing that made me feel better was "The Princess Bride." I think I watched it five times that night. That was about 10 years ago, but even today I can't watch just a little of it without watching the whole thing, and I can't watch any of it without smiling. It does an end run around my pessimism and cynicism and gets right at the uncorruptible romantic inside me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the whole romantic comedy world, this is probably the best film of them all. I can't think of anybody who wouldn't like this movie as it has everything - action, adventure, romance, revenge, and loads upon loads of laughs. Furthermost, while humorous and witty, it can get so greatly romantic at times it hurts. Because of this, I'd recommend this movie most to couples wanting to watch movies together. I guarantee you won't go wrong with it. In short, this is basically the perfect movie, and I don't think there's a person alive who wouldn't appreciate it. Happy viewing, especially to you couples out there.</fullReview>

Of course some of the wonderful points of the novel fall by the wayside in the picture, but there's still that sense of parody and at the same time, earnest desire to tell an amusing story. The music is deliciously simple and descriptive, a good sidekick to the audience. In short, a film about everything. And if I may say this... READ THE BOOK AS WELL!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid movie fan who admires a huge variety of films for myriad reasons, I still count "The Princess Bride" among my personal favorites. I loved it when I first saw it as a kid, and I love it now. Moreover, among my friends, who have widely divergent tastes in films from mine and from each other, this is the only film whose dialogue we can repeat in progress throughout. (I don't believe I have seen this movie in at least five years when no one consistently quoted lines during the movie.) Swashbuckling swordplay, cleverly self-parodic dialogue, and an overall sweetness of character that even I can't snicker at -- this is a damn great movie.To repeat: simply a joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening to the end, the film grips you as no other fairy tale can do once you leave your childhood behind (not lost, but hard to find). You rediscover the feelings you felt before, but as an adult, try not to show. The best chase sequences and fights you will ever see. Even a sword fight that could be even better than any you have seen before. This is a tale that the whole family can watch, but in which the adults can find something different from the children. Love, giants, death, castles, swordplay, kissing. It is truly a "hot fairy tale", as the book says. And remember, the director and writer made "Misery" together. The director alone made "This Is Spinal Tap". What you know of their genius from other sources, will be found in this film. Just see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie ever for all ages to enjoy. The Princess Bride has a little bit of everything -- comedy, adventure, romance you name it, it's there. The story is all about - True Love - and that with it you can survive unspeakable odds and events. It tells of the love between Westley and Buttercup, the gallant Inigo Montoya on a quest to honor his father, and the obnoxious Prince Humperdincks quest to have Buttercup for his own. The rapport between the characters is wonderful giving leave to some of the best quotes that you still hear people reciting today! My favorite line has to be "Ello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, now prepare to die!" If you have not seen this movie, please rent it and then see if you don't fall in love with it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah, yes ... The Princess Bride ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dazzling tale of a princess, a peasant, swordplay, revenge, good and evil - so why does William Goldman feel it needs a frame story? The frame story he uses in the novel is intrusive and, to be frank, pungently offensive; here he uses the more conventional device of having an old man tell the story to his grandson, which may be hackneyed but is nonetheless a distinct improvement. At any rate it helps me understand why the frame story is there. It's Goldman's way of announcing that he has a real corker of a story to tell - a story so superb that it's simply impossible not to be enthralled by it. Goldman is daring us to find fault. `My main story is SO GOOD,' he says, `that I can afford to encumber it with this irritating framing device, and it will STILL make your heart pound. I can dare you to be indifferent and you'll STILL care.'And he's right.So are you ready for it? Can you handle what Goldman is presenting as the Ultimate Story? Then proceed - and I'd advise you to proceed with the film, rather than the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite film, no question.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For such a simple film, this has left a huge impression. From the coolest sword fight ever, to the best performance by a rhyming wrestler, this film in perfect for everyone who still thinks Marilyn Manson is just a freako, and not the holder of ultimate truth in the universe. Billy Crystal must wish he had more roles like this after his recent crapolla and Cary Elwes should have been the coolest guy in the universe after this. (Maybe he ran over a cat or something.) If you know any children, turn off Minecraft, and force them to watch this. And sit down with them, you'll love it. Oh, ans since I'm editing this, and the new rules are forcing me to make the review longer. Read the Book too. It's quite different, but both are works of art in their own ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most dramatic use of the word "bitch" ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a contradiction in terms. By all rationality it should not be as popular as it is. It is basically one cliche after another played out on some of the most obvious soundstages ever seen. Somehow Rob Reiner has made one of the most popular and endearing fables of all time. I still have not ruled out a pact with Satan. Somehow though, it all works brilliantly. Cary Elwes' dry humor, Mandy Patinkin's delectable portrayal of a Spaniard, Andre the Giant's paradoxical boyish charm, and Wallace Shawn's immortal use of the word "inconceivable" have made this the fairytale of the latter half of the 20th century. As always Reiner relies on the innocence of childhood to win audiences as he plays out the plot within a plot of Peter Falk reading a young, sick Fred Savage a story in a moment of grandfatherly bonding. Throw in a beautiful damsel in distress, an evil prince, a vow of revenge, a miracle man, a senile king, the greatest sword fight in cinematic history, incredibly large rodents, an abbot with a speech impediment, a holocaust cloak and a wheelbarrow, and you've got a movie that no one except those who have forgotten how to believe in fairies could dislike. The fact that the dialogue is infection only adds to the addiction. Yes, this is a ten. Why? My God I wish I could figure that out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely my favorite movie. I have long sections of it committed to memory (including sound effects!).If you enjoy multiple genre works, you should be interested in this film...it delightfully blends romance, comedy and action. Along with memorable characters (Fezzik, Miracle Max), it has witty dialog ("You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."), a great chain of events leading to the climax (sword fight, wrestling match, battle of wits, etc.), and a satisfying ending in both the fantasy world of Wesley and Buttercup and the real world of the sick boy and his grandfather.If you like the movie, you may also like the book (by William Goldman...still in print), although not for the same reasons. The book uses narrative to amuse where the movie uses surprise or quirky characters. And the "abridger's" description of the "original" text is quite amusing, as is the 18 page (I think) foreward describing the ordeal to acquire an original" manuscript.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say that because last summer my aunt revealed that she had never seen the princess bride. She's lucky I wasn't in the room at the time. I would have dragged her to the television and made her watch the movie. She said she never watched it because she thought it was a kid's movie. Well, she's been set straight and hopefully has watched it since. This is a movie every person should be required to watch. It's a fairy tale fable with a beautiful princess, a dashing hero, an evil villian, a six fingered man, a gentle giant, a Sicillian, a revenge seeking mandy patinkin, a wizard(and his quarreling wife). Not to mention sword fights, magic, humor, and an endless love. Not a bad way to kill two hours. My score-8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family has had this movie longer than I can remember and I've seen it 100s of times. As little kids, my brother and I would pick up sticks or any kind of long cylinder-shaped object and say "Hallo! My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!" Hey, we still do! Practically everyone I know has seen this movie. You can quote any line to one of my friends and everyone with start saying things like "Inconceivable!" and "Mawwage". I have one friend who watches the movie almost every week, once she watched it three times in one day.The best thing about this movie is that while kids can watch it, (with only 1 swear word and not too-disgusting scenes) adults love it too.If you like movies with sword fights, romance, medieval-type settings, and some silliness, you have to see this. Swordfighting movies are a big part of my favorites, such as "The Mask of Zorro", "The Three Mustkeeters", etc.When I was little my mom also read the book to my sister and me. I recommend it, especially because of the added background info. of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a film with an appeal that is nearly impossible to really analyze. I've had countless people tell me how much they love it, but nobody has ever been able to define exactly what is so great about it. It is an undeniably silly film, with its strange blend of comedy, fantasy, romance, and adventure, its eccentric characters, goofy dialogue, and unrealistically cinematic locales. And yet all these elements somehow come together to create the best film of 1987, and a classic for all times. I have seen it perhaps more times than any other movie, which is a little odd because there are other films that I like more than this one. But this film stands in a class of its own. There has never been a movie quite like it. Rob Reiner does a brilliant job of juggling the disparate, even contradictory, elements and blending them together seamlessly. William Goldman actually improved on his original novel with a screenplay that is funnier, sweeter, and altogether more tightly written than the book (although he did leave out Buttercup's wonderful speech to Westley when she confesses her love to him, which would have made a great addition to the film). It is perfectly cast, with Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and the ever-brilliant Christopher Guest as stand-outs. It's just a marvelous film that defies description or labels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once when I was in the Navy, I was on an extended deployment where we spent over 70 days at sea. About 8 of us would watch a movie every evening--since we had over 200 titles on board we had an unofficial rule that we would never watch the same movie twice in a given 70 day patrol. We also were 8 guys with several distinctly different tastes in movies so we took turns either picking the movie or enduring another's choice. The night we first watched PRINCESS BRIDE, it was remarkable how each and every one of us had really loved that movie. It was the ONLY movie that ever violated the once per patrol rule--we saw it once a week and enjoyed it more each time we saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My only real problem with this movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... is that it is billed first and foremost as a children's movie. I just purchased the movie and it comes in a children's clamshell cover and begins with previews of video tapes that might appeal to a two year old.Ok, it _is_ in fact, a fairy tale. I buy that. But the ending contains a sword fight which makes one as squirmish as anything in the movie Scream! And the dialog is some of the wittiest I've heard from any movie, children's or not. In fact, minus the bathroom humor, the Naked Gun series is much more child-oriented (and certainly more childish) than The Princess Bride.So what is The Princess Bride? It's a witty, funny, entertaining fairy tale spoof, which never takes itself too seriously. As most reviewers before me have already pointed out, the movie contains an over-abundance of quotable lines. Unless you're almost dead, or all dead, you can't help but enjoy the dialog.What makes this film refreshing is that it's a true spoof of the fairy-tale genre, and succeeds as well or better as Airplane succeeds as being a spoof of hero movies, or as Scream succeeds as being a spoof of horror movies, or as Naked Gun (aka Police Squad) succeeds as being a spoof of police detective flicks.Some more quick points: 1) I don't know if you'll ever see a Cary Elwes performance as good as this. 2) The scenery is magnificent. 3) Robin Wright is a sight for sore eyes. 4) I think we're really due for a Princess Bride II.Oh know, I'm rhyming!Westley: You mean you wish to surrender to me?

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a terrific movie, great for those times when you're feeling down or unhappy. It picks the spirits right up, and that's a wondrous thing for any film to do. Excellent performances all around from Carey Elwes as our hero, a pre-Forrest Gump Robin Wright as the princess, and Fright Night's devilish Chris Sarandon as the malevolent Prince Humperdinck. But, the standouts are definitely the late, great Andre the Giant as the thoughtful Fezzik, the wonderfully annoying Wallace Shawn as the "evil" genius Vizzini, and the true scene-stealer, Mandy Patinkin as the avenging swordsman Inigo Montoya. A great family film, a good date movie, and all around a terrific movie-going experience.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself a movie "buff" having seen 100s upon 100s of movies and I will put this movie up against all of the classics!!There is nothing lacking in this magnificent movie. I have watched this movie with my children so many times, they can quote it! As you have read in others comments..this is a highly quotable film (Fezzik, jog his memory.)!It is sweetly done, romantic, heroic, sad, funny...although not mentioned much are the scenes "outside" of the story between Peter Falk and Fred Savage. To see how spending time together, reading a book, brought this young grandson and his grandfather closer together was very touching!One of Rob Reiner's best. He will be hard-pressed to top this wonderful movie. GO BUY THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people would argue for classics, like "Ben Hur", or "Citizen Kane". But I prefer my films to have dialogue and to not have a hole in the plot so big you can drive a tank trough it.The Princess Bride could, possibly, make the crossest miser on earth smile. It's hard to not feel good after watching it. The presence of wonderfully talented actors and the absence of superstars lends to the sheer believability of the story. Mandy Patinkin is excellent as Inigo and Andre the Giant proves to be a positively huggable and enjoyable actor.It's rare to find a fairy tale that can TRULY entertain children and adults alike. This is one of the few.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years, while my kids were growing up, I thought this was the best movie ever made. Then I saw Casablanca again, and moved it down to number 2. Get this movie, view it umpteen times with your kids, until they are spouting all the great sound bites verbatim. Then put it on your shelves next to Casablanca. No room on your shelves? Take Citizen Kane and all the other movies you'll never view again and put them in a box and put the box in the attic. Now you have lots of room for fun movies like this one. Add Ghostbusters and All in the Family if you haven't already.Some of those sound bites that you'll remember the movie by:"I beg your pardon, but this is not as easy as it looks.""There is something you should know. I am not left handed.""Inconceivable!" "I do not think this word means what you think it means.""Get used to disappointment.""Think it will work?"

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's an enduring film that everyone I know likes immensely. This is because this film is not limited to one age group. When I was a kid I saw it for the first time and loved the action and the romance. As I grew, I learned to appreciate the exceptional writing and the comedic timing that every player is gifted with. The lines would be only half as funny if you didn't know how they were delivered. Every line in this movie is quotable; in fact, in my circle of friends, this is the most quoted movie.

		<fullReview>In a society so characterized by hate and violence, it is refreshing to occasionally have a film that forgets all those hidden rules and entertains the child inside of us all. The Princess Bride is without a doubt one of these movies! It will almost assuredly make you drop on the floor and roll with laughter. This is Rob Reiners greatest comedy, and not far off from being his finest all together. Reiner not only creates a histaricall movie, but also ties up all the loose ends with unmatched comical acting, and beautiful scenery. From the beginning scene with the sickly child, through the very end, this movie is guaranteed to make you laugh. I only wish that there were more movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable (and extremely quotable) fairy tale, but still less than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is revered by Gen-X-ers and 80's babies, along with THE GOONIES and other children's films that have a certain adventurousness and whimsy to them. I, however, was born at the tail end of the decade, and missed out on a lot of these cinematic treasures as a child. Finally, I have rectified that by watching this film, which is firmly ingrained in the pop culture consciousness. Does it live up to the hype? Yes and no. From a filmic perspective, the narrative is a bit formulaic and cliché, like the storybook tales that this movie takes its inspiration from. On the other hand, there are plenty of moments of pure genius that make it stand out from the rest. Fortunately, the latter outweighs the former and overall it was a perfectly enjoyable viewing experience.The story, although about the titular Princess Bride, is actually framed by a grandfather reading a book to his sick grandson. I think that this part is essential to making the film work because it gives the audience a way to understand the story and how it works on more than just a surface level. Fred Savage's character is the audience stand-in and his questions and commentary can represent the questions of all little boys who have been told fantastical stories by their own relatives. The grandfather can represent the director, or any family member who has served a storytelling role, and guides the audience through this familiar, yet not too familiar tale. The story of the Princess Bride itself is reminiscent of many a fairy tale, and like many before it tells how true love overcomes great obstacles. There is a great cast of characters, many serving up some choice and memorable dialogue that has gone down in the pantheon of great quotes. My personal favorites were from Vizzini, Inigo Montoya and the Impressive Clergyman.In terms of quality, Rob Reiner did a great job directing his actors, who all give great performances. Even Robin Wright does an impressive job for her first big-screen role which, aside from Jenny in FORREST GUMP, is the role she is best known for playing. The filming aspect was also quite well done, with most of it being done on well-constructed and detailed studio sets. The cinematography, while not particularly memorable or flashy, was competent in workmanlike kind of way. The real weakness here is the script which, while serving up plenty of individual moments worthy of praise, didn't always flow naturally, and not because of the framing story either. There is also a long stretch of the movie where Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) disappear, which just seemed odd to me. In my opinion, the story could have been fleshed out a little more in some respects. Still, what is there works for the most part, and I can't really fault it for trying to mix things up a bit.Overall, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is a perfectly enjoyable movie, even if it doesn't live up to the enormous praise heaped upon it. The movie does have some flaws, but those are mild in comparison to the great storytelling on display and great dialogue, which enhance its replay value. Highly recommended, especially if you haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can clearly see this is a Rob Reiner film in every sense. The whole production has that silly visual humour that most would associate with Mel Brooks...although not as strong. When the film came out it had moderate success and has since gone on to be become a bit of a cult, yet I'm not entirely sure why in all honesty.Based on a novel of the same name the story is the quintessential fairytale fable. A young dashing hero who was thought to be dead must save his true love from an evil Prince in his castle. There are sidekicks, magicians, evil henchmen, knights, places of peril and the odd oversized creatures.The unique element in this rudimentary idea is the comedy factor, a combination of spoof and slapstick both verbally and visually. In short you could say this was an early live action version of the Shrek franchise but not as 'out there' with the fantasy. Every typical fairytale scenario has been slightly twisted and lampooned just enough to make it funny but not as an outright spoof. There is still a solid plot here despite the fact its predictable as hell. The other unique angle is the fact the whole film is being narrated by Columbo to Kevin Arnold in the real world, a story within a story, so you're never completely sure if things will pan out as you'd expect...(but they do).Now while I can't deny the film is a nice gentle old fashioned type of yarn it is extremely basic and largely unimpressive visually. I realise its more of a character piece than effects extravaganza but there really isn't much to soak up fantasy wise. It doesn't help me especially because some locations they filmed at the start, and the castle, are not far from my folks so it didn't give me any sense of wonder. There are some nice locations most definitely but it all looks too real if you get me, not much like a fantasy realm.The film works mainly because of the characters, well some of them. Elwes is the perfect well spoken Flynn-esque hero without a doubt, he has good comedic timing and spoofs the classical silver screen hero very well. He virtually plays this character again in that Mel Brooks Robin Hood film. Wright is the perfect blonde fairytale Princess, utterly stunning! Sarandon does the slimy evil Prince to a tee and for me the best of all was Wallace Shawn as the low down crafty 'Vizzini'. Such a shame that Shawn's character dies so early on as he's the best thing going on in the film laughs wise. There are various other famous names in here too but for me they felt forced. Peter Cook's silly clergyman lisp just fell flat on its face, Mel Smith's Albino dungeon keeper felt out of place and not particularly funny whilst Billy Crystal was clearly Billy Crystal in makeup and not in the slightest bit amusing.Had this come out now I don't think it would do too well, or any better than it did back in 87. The whole idea has been done and drained by a certain green orge plus other animated flicks. Back in the day the idea of a spoof fantasy was a bit more original but even then it didn't fare that well and I'm not really surprised. I can see how this might not have appeared very enticing to cinema goers at the time.There is little to no violence so its perfect for the younger viewer whilst adults can enjoy the soft satire. Even though this is the epitome of a true fairytale I can't really say its a rich magical experience because there isn't much of that going on. Its a pleasant cozy ride that will relax you and not put any pressure on the brain. A pure organic tale but also rather underwhelming.'Inconceivable!!'6/10</fullReview>

For every film I see that wishes to be a romantic comedy, or swords and swashbuckling, or just plain funny, I wish they could take a look at this one, which manages to combine the three, without effort, it seems.Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are both gorgeous and dead-pan, Mandy Patinkin is a hero of the best kind; "You killed my father, prepare to die" is a theme and a catch-phrase solely down to his presence. Every actor was the best I've ever seen them, which says much about the director. Drop.Your.Sword. And enjoy.</fullReview>

Though you may think it is another fairy tale movie created for kids only, or that it may be boring or unappealing since it is "old" and it isn't filled with special effects, you should think again: it is absolutely amazing. It has an special something that makes it funny, catchy and simply lovely.

This movie truly gives us an escape that fills our hearts with a number of emotions. Every girl wants to be Buttercup, and have a prince that she calls her own. I have to say that I have wished I were her many times over. A good movie, in my opinion, gives you something to quote. Well, this movie does that to a wonderful degree. I feel as if I can walk up to someone as say "As you wish" and they are going to know what I am talking about. Also, this movie makes you feel that true love is out there and pure. I think this movie is a must see for everyone. I know that I am going to buy the DVD and show my kids one day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***There is a minor spoiler below** First I want to say that I DO NOT hate this movie. I gave a "7" because there are a few things in this film that I strongly object to. 1. Inigo using the "S" "O" "B" term. (right before he kills Count Rogan.)2. The grandson using a word in the wrong way. (When he finds out that the Prince doesn't die.)3. The R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents Of Unusual Size) fight was too long and not necessary.Other than those things, this is a entertaining movie. Not among my Top 30, nor will it ever be. Cary Elwes did a great job as Weslry, and I have to mention the great performance of Andre The Giant. He was funny, and very strong. Too bad he died in 1994. Anoother actor's performance is noteworthy. Mandy Patkintin and Wallace Shawn, who played Inigo and Vizini respectively. Billy Crystal stole the whole movie, even though he was only in the movie for about ten minutes. His character was very important as it turned out. Overall, this is a good movie, but I recommend you mute the words above, and the fight scene with the R.O.U.S.'s. My Score: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is an amazing movie for people of all ages. It has so many elements to it that it can be classified under multiple genres, and the acting is excellent. Having read the book, I can assure you that the script is very accurate for those of you that detest books that are made into movies poorly. (Here it must be pointed out that William Goldman, the author of the novel version of The Princess Bride, was the screenwriter for the movie version.) The Princess Bride is an endearing movie with all the ingredients needed to produce a "feel good" experience. It is highly recommended by this "critic." (And ladies, it is a great movie to watch with gentlemen because it has a lovely romantic side amidst all of the sword fighting and action. Plus, the wit and humor that penetrates the entire film is highly appreciated by both genders.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is a great family film with "fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles..." When Buttercup's true love, Westley, is said to have been killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts, she vows that she will never love again. When Prince Humperdink decides that he wants her hand in marriage, she accepts, but with no love in her heart for him. She is kidnapped one day on her daily horseback ride and is brought across the sea to Guilder, the sworn enemy of Prince Humperdink's country. A masked man in black follows Buttercup's kidnappers and defeats an expert swordsman, a giant and an all-knowing Sicilian. Buttercup finds out that the man in black is actually her beloved Westley and they hide in the fire swamp to get away from Prince Humperdink, who is trying to win back his fiancé. Chaos, torture, death, miracles, revenge and true love ensue. This movie has all the makings of an action-adventure film with sword fights, wrestling matches, torture devices, chases and escapes. What makes this movie special is its witty remarks and the perfect comedic timing by the superb cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood favourite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of movie that entire families get hooked on and you can always recognize a fellow fan, even through a simple "inconcievable!" or something perhaps a little more obscure like "We are men of action...".I've never written a comment but i felt i'd like to start and figured i'd better start with my favourite movie of all time. I know movies seldom deserve a rating of 10, and that if i were to pick this movie apart as i do with others i'd find a reason to rate it otherwise, but i just can't. This movie is perfect to me. I think it's the same uncanny feeling of enchantment i experienced the first time i saw it (as is the story with most people) that keeps me loving it with every new viewing. I have most definitely seen the Princess Bride more than any other movie (and it even came out a year before i was born..) and yet still i can sit down and simply marvel at it, as i did less than an hour ago. The sword fight remains my favourite choreography in any movie (challenged only by the duel between Hector and Achilles in Troy) and i will always love the witty dialogue. And of course, love is blind, so i can even forgive the corny fanfare whenever you see the man in black. Some of the lines are so beautiful they still astound me. Buttercup is so pure and Westley is so beautiful. The movie was perfectly cast.I recently read the Author's note in the novel by William Goldman, where he talks about getting the movie organized. I highly recommend reading it to any fan, it is very interesting and you will truly feel as though you were part of its creation.This quote says it all: "Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles... " The taglines are pretty good too. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>sorry for my clumsy English, but here it goes.this is perfect. it was a great inspiration back in the 1987. in the name of true love, we could invade "girls only" slumber parties, with nothing but a dagger of the mind and a quick quote: as you wish, this is true love..., (or if going for dramatic sympathy) hallo, my name is... Those were the good old days.Now you have to pay drinks and play straight just to get attention. But no matter how bummed you feel about adulthood (or any other hood for that matter), The Princess Bride will still take you back... or move you on. depending on if you are in or out of love.do you thing this happens every day?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't suffice to call "The Princess Bride" a fairy tale; this movie is a surprise every step of the way. Here's how we might describe it: "All in the Family"'s Meathead directs an epic tale of Columbo reading his grandson a story of Forrest Gump's girlfriend in love with the slimy guy from "Twister"; the "Fright Night" vampire and one of the "Spinal Tap" guys hire a wrestler, the "Ragtime" salesman, and the guy who had dinner with Andre to kidnap the woman; one of the "City Slickers" also plays a role.Okay, that's a silly description. But my point is, this movie is like nothing that you've ever seen. With ROUS and various political references, the whole thing is a mile a minute. The cast couldn't have been more impressive: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Andre the Giant, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, Peter Falk and Fred Savage.And some of the lines? Let me just put it like this: if you don't come away from this movie occasionally uttering "Inconceivable!" and "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!", then you must be numb.I quite literally can't find anything bad to say about "The Princess Bride". Always emphasizing teamwork and intellect over brute force, and never degenerating into sappy love, it may be THE perfect fairy tale. As everyone wishes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb, sublime, imaginative family entertainment from Rob Reiner. Tongue in cheek fairy tale/adventure that hits the ground running with a breathless first 25mins of fantastic set pieces that includes one of the best sword fights in cinema as well as some great characters. Vezzini, Fezzick and Inigo are characters that stayed with me all through my childhood but until a recent watching of this film I hadn't realised just how good this was for adults &amp; children. It hasn't dated at all in the intervening years and compares well with modern fantasy films mainly due to a tone that wouldn't benefit from expensive CG.All the cast are memorable, Chris Sarandon as the pompous prince and Christopher Guest's Basil Rathbone style duke are great villains but Wallace Shawn as Vezzini steals best baddie honours. For the good guys Cary Elewes is superb as the Errol Flynn style hero swashbuckling and joking his way through duels, torture, chases and more with support from Innigo (the always superb Mandy Patinken) with Andre the Giant the ideal person to play Fezzick the good natured giant. Memorable cameos include Peter Cooke, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane and Mel Smith. As the Princess of the title Robin Wright really fits the bill looking like she just stepped out of the pages of a fairy tale but never letting her performance slip into the sappy, mushiness it could have become.It's magic spell never loses grip through chases, romance, duels and brawls its a treat my one complaint I wish it was longer so there was even more to enjoy. 9/10</fullReview>

But as far as love stories go, this is most definitely the best movie ever made.It has action, adventure, love, death, and beautiful beautiful scenery. There is no reason not to like this film. Robin Wright and Cary Elwes make the most beautiful couple too! Not to mention the other characters, just awesome.I watched The Princess Bride for the first time when I was 12 years old, (1988) and I love it just as much as I did then. It is a family movie, suitable for any age. There is only one bad word it it.I love The Princess Bride and forever will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic cult movie, otherwise known as "The Greatest Movie of All Time."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant I felt it would be wrong to make a hobby of writing movie reviews if I didn't start with my favorite movie of all time.So, the movie was made in the late 80s. The reason I mention this is because if you haven't seen it, prepare for a smattering of cheesy acting and low budget glory. However, this does not detract from the overall appeal of the film. If anything, it adds. For the 80s, this is an exceptional movie. For any time period, this is an exceptional movie.It all takes place in the imaginary kingdom of Florin, ruled by the charismatic and devious Prince Humperdink (imagine what elementary school was like for THAT guy). Technically, he is not yet the king, but in the same way that Cardinal Richeleau ruled France in The Three Muskateers, so does Prince Humperdink rule Florin.The heart of the movie opens on a small farm, where Buttercup, allegedly the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, is living her life. She commands Westley, the farm boy, around for pleasure. Eventually she realizes that Westley loves her, sparks fly, and we are hit with one of the movie's most infamous lines: "Hold it, hold it! Grandpa, what is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? (pause) Is this a kissing book?" Westley has no money for marriage, so he sets out in seek of fame and fortune. In a matter of weeks, news comes back to Buttercup that Westley has been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later the Prince decides that he is going to take Buttercup as his wife, and the movie sets into action. A mysterious Man in Black (like we don't know who it is) comes to get Buttercup, and faces impossible odds to get her, fighting master swordsmen, giants, and of course, Vizzini, in the classic Battle of Wits.The movie is a fairy tale, and as such, we know right from the beginning it is going to have a cheesy happy ending. Does that really matter? Of course not. First off, it's just entertainment. Second, the point of the movie is that true love conquers all. A nice little romanticized thought, even if evidence of this fact often fails to be seen in the real world.For the most part, the acting is solid. Cary Elwes does a knockout job as Westley, Robin Wright as the na?ve but charming Princess Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, the master swordsman seeking revenge for his father, Andre the Giant as Vizzini, the big hearted yet small brained giant, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, the criminal mastermind with a large IQ and yet no real intelligence, Billy Crystal in a strange turn as Miracle Max, and Peter Falk as the grandfather telling the story to his sick grandson. The acting is not flawless, but for the type of movie that this is, it is spot on.This is the must see movie of the century. It has action, romance, comedy, adventure, and suspense. If you haven't seen it, you must.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (a must see)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those odd films which is very high in the overall IMDb charts, much loved, and although it is overrated it is still a good, entertaining film with much to recommend it. It begins with an old man telling his grandson a bed time story of princesses, giants, magic, and mystical lands which the kid hopes will have no kissing in it. Naturally it does. We are thrown into the world of Buttercup, a beautiful young girl kidnapped by the evil Prince Humperdinck. It is up to her true love Westley to save her, but she thought he was killed by pirates. Along the way he meets many strange people and creatures, travels across dangerous lands and eventually must fight the evil Prince.This is a story which takes all the usual fairy story traits and aims to light-hearted with the moral about love conquering no matter what is thrown at you. It is engaging and unusual and succeeds in being a cult hit. It realises the cheesy stuff involved, that young boys don't particularly want to hear love stories, but ones full of adventure, but this is suitable for all. The cast has some good cameos from Billy Crystal to Andre the Giant, Robin Penn is pretty but good have been better, and Carey Elwes is as annoying as always, but this is his best, and most effective role. There is some good dialogue, and everyone should enjoy it, but it falls short of other films of its kind from the same era such as Willow. The action is often less spectacular than other films, and the comedy, although refreshingly unique does not always work. These are minor things though, and it is clear to see why so many love it.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a very well made fantasy-adventure about revenge, giants, kidnapping, and true love. It is also my favorite movie, and I'd like to tell you why.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, it captures a reminiscent, fantastic sweetness of character, tone, and in its message that is all but extinct today. By resorting to the simplistic morality that endeared Frank Capra's films to millions of fans, Reiner resurrected however briefly the long-forgotten art of the adventure. One that is devoid of compromised morals, conflicting motivations and questionable, misplaced heroism.The purpose and motivation of every character in The Princess Bride is pure and true, no matter how outdated the standards are that set them. When viewing this film you're instantly reminded of the swashbuckling tales of Captain Blood, The Mark of Zorro, and The Adventures of Robin Hood. The lines are drawn quite clearly between hero and villain, and heaven help whoever stands on the wrong side of that line.The focus throughout is not on the cinematography, nor the music; both of these are merely tools to heighten the tension of the situation, or intensify the loneliness and futility of it. The focus is diverted completely to the endless, illimitable determination of Westley to overcome all obstacles in the pursuit of his true love. Each character is given depth, however fleeting. Each character must be sympathized with, or scrutinized for their wickedness.There is no wasted dialogue, no wasted scenes, nor movements, nor expressions. Every word spoken and step taken further the character's fixation in the mind of the viewer, strengthening or weakening, inspiring sympathy or revulsion.The actual fantasy opens with a young Westley and Buttercup (Never mind how silly their names are, I'll get to that) growing up and falling in love on a farm, the story unfolding through the narrative of Peter Falk. It's a simple tale, boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy leaves girl to make his way in the world to support her. Unfortunately word travels back to her that he was killed by pirates, Buttercup is thrown into depression, and untimately snatched up by the Prince of the land for a wife.Buttercup doesn't love her husband, yet can't help her lot in life. Her only solace is a horseback ride she enjoys alone. It is on one of these solitary rides that our story truly begins. She encounters three men: a mischievous, despicable hunchback, played by Wallace Shawn, a Spanish swordsman without equal, played by Mandy Patenkin, and an enormous giant, played by Andre Rousimoff (known to the world as Andre the Giant).It becomes apparent early in the abduction that the only true villain among these three is the hunchback, Vizzini. The other two, Inigo and Fezzik, are merely hired help. Circumstances that are never elaborated drew the three of them together, and one can only assume that money is the explanation. It's easy to see the friendship that Inigo and Fezzik share, probably forged for the most part by the cruel jibes and bullying of Vizzini, which is comical at times despite it's sadistic nature.We discover all too soon that Westley is relentlessly following the kidnappers, and is willing and able to do anything it takes to rescue Buttercup from their clutches. Westley pursues his love across a sea and up a towering cliff that no mortal man should be capable of climbing, yet he does. He defeats all three of the assassins who kidnapped Buttercup in turn, dispatching them with frightening skill, strength, and cunning respectively. One can only wonder in awe at how this simple farmboy can so easily defeat a swordsman of such skill, a giant of such strength, and a criminal mastermind of such devious genius. Westley frees Buttercup and they disappear into the mysterious and deadly Fire Swamp, with the Prince and his men breathing down their necks.This story is framed and interjected occasionally with the narration of Peter Falk's character and the observations of his grandson, played by Fred Savage, who as the story progresses goes from nonchalant and irritating to sympathetic and excited. Savage's character does serve his purpose, which is the message and the moral of the film.Yes, the names are silly. I've wondered many times where a writer could come up with names like "Buttercup" and "Humperdink." Fantasy can, by right, be unrealistic and still achieve it's purpose, still enthrall and enchant. The comedy of this film is one of it's greatest aspects, especially the cameos from Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, and Peter Cook. The comedy is sometimes deadpan and satirical and occasionally tongue-in-cheek, and always is very well delivered.The acting is believable, the cinematography, editing, and music all serve their purpose. The dialogue I cherish, as there are nuggets of wisdom to be found at every turn, such as "Life is pain, highness. Anyone who says different is selling something."All in all, a very good film, and one I dearly love. It may not be a classic, but I have hopes that one day it will be. If there are enough people out there that love it as much as I do, I'm pretty confident that it'll be cherished by generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely done fantasy romance comedy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a grandfather reading to his grandson, and we get to see the story he is reading unfold before our eyes. Rather good movie that entertains in so many ways. The cast is excellent, even Andre the Giant is very good in this one. Turns out he is the only wrestler that can act. The story is fast moving and has some nice twists and surprises along the way, they surprised me the first time I saw this one (I won't give anything away though). What made this film good for me though was that it contained quite a lot of humor and it really worked well. I loved Cary Elwes delivery and Patinkin was also very good in his role too. Billy Crystal and Carol Kane also make memorable appearances in this one. Though one of my favorite scenes has to be when Cary's character has a battle of wits with the one guy. One of the funnier scenes I found in this one. There are also nice set designs like in the fire swamp. The periodic interruptions also work, as they never let you forget that it is a simple story being read by a grandfather. Good movie all around and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read "The Princess Bride" for the first time when the paperback first came out. By the time the movie version was due to come out I read it again. I no longer had my old copy, so I bought a new one (The cover had been attached upside down, which I thought was cool).There are very few books that I have read twice, let alone bought twice. I loved this book. It's a great fantasy love story, told with style and wit. And, like all great fantasies, the characters are bigger than life -- and sometimes, just a bit corny.It's just enjoyable, first to last. Part romance, part adventure, part revenge story ("My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die") and all fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute story, but needs improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before actually sitting down and watching this movie, I had heard that the film was a classic, must-see. I had also heard that the film had some sort of following since it was so well appraised. That being said, I had high hopes for something cute, cliché, and funny.This movie was definitely cute. This movie was definitely cliché. But funny is a bit of a stretch for me. Maybe it's because I'm not an 80's child, but I just didn't get any of the humour that was in this movie. I felt that what was obviously supposed to be comic relief just turned out to be awkward. And perhaps the directors might have intended this, but the first twenty minutes of the movie I wanted to just quit. The actors were so half-hearted, the whole plot line was just a little bit ridiculous and I shared the same feeling as the little boy being read the story: "Why am I here? Why am I watching this movie?" And so, right then and there, I would've given it a 5 star rating had I simply stopped the movie.But as the story went on, the characters developed a bit more and whether you want to or not, you feel yourself rooting for the hero to get the girl and for the Spanish swordsman to get revenge for his father and of course for the no good Humperdinck to be locked away. And for this, I upped the rating. At the end of the day, it really is a cute story. However, don't be expecting stellar acting performances, particularly clever plot twists nor great special effects (i.e. the blood in this movie literally looks like ketchup). Don't expect any major exploration of deep themes, and for feminists don't expect a strong female lead. But if you're feeling like a classic, damsel in distress short and sweet film, this may be for you.</fullReview>

Having just re-watched it I am utterly dismayed that a film this poorly written, so poorly acted and with such a jarring almost absurdly bad musical score has such devotion. I can only guess that it's nostalgia that's clouding the minds of its fans. It's not even remotely funny and this coming from the guy that gave us This Is Spinal Tap? The sets look worse than the cheapest TV shows. It even makes reference to Australia being full if convicts yet has a Medieval period setting, hundreds of years before Autralia's convict influx. Did nobody vet the script? Where's the alleged humour? Please give me a funny line that I may have missed. This is woefully amateurish stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knowing modern fairy tale that sits between affectionate spoof and poor B-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man visits his sick Grandson, he keeps him amused with a fairy tale. We find that the beautiful Buttercup has lost her true love and years later has agreed to marry the evil Prince Humperdinck. She is kidnapped by three mercenaries but is later rescued by a mysterious masked man. When she discovers the identity of the man she faces a dilemma between returning to her intended or staying with true love. When the decision is made for her Wesley must fight (with a little help) to win her back.There is something about this film that requires you to be in the right mood to watch it. The story is pitched as a standard fairy tale and it feels like a B-movie, if it was played straight. Happily Reiner adds spoof and comedy to the mix that allows the fairy tale to follow the traditional routes while poking fun at itself. The story is still nice, but really it's the knowing comedy that makes it.The comedy is generally consistent ? gentle rather than cruel. The film uses unlikely fairy tale mechanisms (like having the ideal thing to hand when needed or the idea of honour etc) with a knowing wink to the audience to let us know it's not serious. It also uses comedy cameos by the bucket ? some work well (Billy Crystal, Wallace Shaw) and some work less well (Peter Jones and Mel Smith are unused). And the rest of it is full of absurd humour. Most of it hits the mark ? but if you're not in the mood of this type of silly affectionate humour then you'll probably dislike it.Elwes is good ? he looks like a handsome B-movie actor and plays it like such, while also spoofing himself. That's why he was so good in Hot Shots too. A young Robin Wright does the wide-eyed damsel in distress so-so, but she doesn't get the same comedy as the others and feels a little dull. Mandy Patinkin is really good in a hammy role and has a good character. Shaw is hilarious in a small role and even Andre the Giant is good ? if a little hard to understand at times. The villains are well played by Guest and Sarandon ? indeed they have the best characters as they don't play it for laughs as much as the others.Overall this is an enjoyable little film from Reiner ? it doesn't have the development or the sharpness of much of his other, funnier work but as a gently affectionate spoof it works just fine if you're in the mood).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's inconceivable that this movie is rated so highly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. I don't know what it is, but it may have to do with how old you were when you first saw it. I'm guessing that when the movie was first released, a lot of guys took their dates to see it ? women typically love romantic themes, even when done badly ? and got laid that night or something, hence they remember it fondly. Or it's possible that even younger audiences were fans of TV's "The Wonder Years" and loved Fred Savage or something. But for anyone who wasn't younger than 25 at the time of its release, this movie's popularity is an enigma: As a comedy, it's not very funny. As a fantasy, it's just bad. It has some qualities as an action adventure, though it comes off as a cheap imitation of a cross between the Robin Hood story and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (a silly movie that works, at least for most guys, in a way that the Three Stooges do not); shame on Peter Cook. Overall, the story is childish, the dialog is juvenile ("She is alive, or was an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her I shall be very put out". Come on!) and repetitive, the sets are pathetic, the acting is abysmal (Andre the Giant and that annoying little dweeb, please), and the special effects (rodents of unusual size) ? ugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but rather an Errol-Flynn-remake instead of fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that this movie is a cult - I just never knew why, not when I watched it first in the 80ies and not now after re-watching it. I do love fantasy movies, I do love the 80ies and 80ies movies, but this is the point: there are sooo much better 80ies fantasy movies: Legend, Neverending story (part 1!), Willow, Labyrinth etc. etc., heck, even the two Ewoks-movies are better fantasy movies than this outmoded attempt of (rather) a newer version of an Erroll Flynn-flick (than a fantasy movie). And if you include newer attempts: try the perfect fairy tale Stardust! This is how it should be done! There is not much magic, no interesting characters or even creatures (the best one being the ever-amazing Carol Kane in a tiny role). The "hero" is arrogant and misogynist, the "heroine" a ridiculously dumb, dependent, damsel in distress-girl, always relying on/ crying for the help of a man - goodbye emancipation... . The boy listening to the story annoyingly interrupts the plot repeatedly - why this lame frame story? To stretch the length? And the most eminent theme annoys me (personally) the most: the repeated romance-BS is simply superfluous - just emphasizes the lack of real/good fantasy-elements. Rather superfluous all over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The princess bride" is a good family movie and I can absolutely understand that so many people refer to this movie as a classic. I found the story both exciting and cute. A classic fairytale. Still there is some things that bothers me. For example: The quality and effects is pretty bad (but I didn't expect more from a movie that was made in 1987 either), the acting is pretty bad as well, the sexism is tediously stereotypic and what's up with the albino man? He looks awfully disgusting! (Nothing against albinos tho, I could just barely look at his scary mimics and nasty mouth, yuck!). Could be better but still it is OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen better fairy tales.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully-set fairytale movie where a grandfather reads a story to his ill grandson. As he reads, the fairytale (about a princess who searches for her true love while she is forced to marry a power-hungry prince) comes to life on screen via the grandfather's narration.While the medieval setting and seaside landscape were beautifully staged, giving the movie a definite fantasy feel, the pacing of the plot was incredibly slow, especially during the first half of the movie, and some of the acting was quite amateurish. Robin Wright did a OK job portraying the vulnerable princess bride, and Andre the Giant and Mandy Patinkin portrayed the two sidekicks with much courage and a little bit of humor. Even the appearance of Billy Crystal as Miracle Max was one of the few treats in the movie. However, Cary Elwes as the sword-wielding Westley was acted out somewhat poorly. It appears he tried too hard to be gallant, sophisticated, charming and strong, like a typical prince, but ultimately came up short. Chris Sarandon couldn't pull off a menacing and sinister lead villain in his Prince Humperdinck role (he looked like a deer in headlights), and Wallace Shawn in his Vizzini role was extremely annoying and irritating - always yelling and screaming throughout his role (I hope the filmmakers don't think that is considered great acting).You won't find much stuff to laugh about in the film, despite the fact it's supposed to be part comedy. You will find some cliché prince-princess romance elements between Westley and the Princess Bride and the grandfather/grandson angle gives the film a family touch. There is more adventure and action in the second half of the film, so the story does eventually give a little more exciting. Overall, though, it's a slow-paced, average movie in which I think is a little overrated.Grade C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lively swashbuckler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those well-loved 1980s classics that I'd never seen before, so I thought I'd better get around to watching it as everybody else has, it seems. It turns out to be a slight but lively swashbuckler in which various heroic characters team up to battle a dastardly prince and his allies in a quasi-historical world.The film had a budget of 16 million dollars and yet it looks rather cheap in places, but I guess that's part of the fun. Although the narrative is set in some kind of unspecified historical past, the script is replete with modern-day gags which work nicely somehow. It's the humour that makes this so entertaining, and without these gags I think it would have been rather ho hum.Cast-wise, we're saddled with the weak and weedy Cary Elwes as the erstwhile hero and Robin Wright as the uninteresting damsel-in-distress, but the best actor by far is Mandy Patinkin who excels as the master Spanish swordsman. Patinkin has natural wit and flair, plus plenty of charisma that really comes across. Christopher Guest and Chris Sarandon are the pantomime villains, there are cameos for comedians like Billy Crystal, Mel Smith, and Peter Cook, and a nice supporting role for lovable wrestler Andre the Giant. In fact this is an all-star thing with a wraparound story involving Fred Savage and Peter Falk. THE PRINCESS BRIDE was shot mainly in the Peak District here in the UK, which looks fantastic, and contains a lovely fencing bout that brings to mind the likes of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Watch how the last half hour was extensively ripped off for ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only a fairy tail...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is a family movie in which we watch a grandfather reading a story to his grandson. And we are transfered from the words of the grandfather inside the story and we watch a story which combines romance and love with fights and much of adventure.First of all I have to admit that I did not expect to like so much this movie. I liked this movie because it was a nice surprise for me and also because of the nice direction which made by Rob Reiner. The most important thing that I liked in this movie was the whole story which showed us that true love always finds the way to win and from whatever happen to it, it will always win. This movie also shows us what is the definition or even better the meaning of true love and what a man and a woman who are in love have to do in order to be together. I also believe that the interpretation of Cary Elwes who played as Westley has to be mentioned because it was really good and equally good was the interpretation of the beautiful Robin Wright who played as The Princess Bride.Lastly I have to say that "The Princess Bride" is not just a nice fairy tail as my title says but is something bigger and better. This movie shows us what difficulties has true love to surpass in order to win and finally to have a happy ending. One other thing that I really loved in this movie was the combination of some comedy moments with some romance moments. "The Princess Bride" is a family movie and I strongly recommend it because I am sure that if you watch it you will have a great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've loved this movie from the first time I ever watched it a VERY VERY long time ago, it was probably in the early 1990's or so. One thing that I love is just how freaking funny it is and how its about true love...about never giving up and that true love conquers all and just about not giving up. Like the guy that keeps asking people how many fingers they have because of the man who killed his father. This is a great movie for the entire family. And I for one have never grown old of watching it. I wished that it came on TV more and that I could find it on DVD d opp that I could own it and watch it anytime I wanted. I give it two thumbs up for sure and a rating of 10 stars. &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the Kingdom of Florin, the beautiful Buttercup is heartbroken when her true love Westley is killed by pirates. Five years later, she is betrothed to Prince Humperdinck, but she does not love him. When she is abruptly kidnapped by three bandits who are then pursued by a mysterious masked man, it appears that all is not what it seems ...Some movies just seem to hit all the right notes, and The Princess Bride is one of them. It works both as a pure fairytale of love and adventure, but also as a wryly tongue-in-cheek comedy, and it has just the right balance of action, humour, romance and intrigue to suit everyone; a true family film if ever there was. The best word to describe it is delightful. With its deliberately old-fashioned tone it may not be the most original story, but it's so full of inventive scenes, crazy characters and hilarious lines that it just sweeps you away right from the start and makes you cheer for the heroes. It features a truly wonderful cast, with the then relatively unknown Elwes and Wright both great in the leads, Guest a wonderfully sneaky six-fingered villain and rib-tickling supporting roles from Shawn, Falk, Crystal and Cook. Perhaps best of all though are the unlikely pairing of Patinkin and André as the desperadoes-turned-good-guy-buddies Montoya and Fezzik; Patinkin is simply perfect as the revenge-seeking swordsman and this is pretty much the only movie where you can see the late great André Roussimoff, who stood seven-foot-four, was a legendary wrestler, and who gives an incredibly gentle and charming performance. I love adventure movies; I always have and I always will. Whether it's Robin Hood, Tarzan, Indiana Jones or whoever takes your fancy, cinema was made for thrills and spills, and this is a terrific example of how to do it right. It's packed with great scenes - the as-you-wish opening, Fezzik's rhymes, the dual between Westley and Montoya, the deadly game with the poisoned chalice, the Pit of Despair, Miracle Max, storming the castle ("If only we had a wheelbarrow !"), Montoya's triumph, many more. It's also one of those movies where all the technical elements are unobtrusively brilliant. This is particularly true of the charming acoustic score by Mark Knopfler (the guitarist/singer of rock band Dire Straits), but the photography, costumes and sets are all first-rate. Brilliantly written by the near-legendary Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman (Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men), though the movie itself was funded independently and shot in England. All of Rob Reiner's movies are good, but four he made in the mid-to-late eighties - This Is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, The Princess Bride and Misery - are all just outstanding and outstandingly different, and The Princess Bride is perhaps the best of these. Don't miss it, and if you have young children, make sure they see it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Monty Python but definitely entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It struck me as a combination of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' and Rob Reiner's own 'This is Spinal Tap'. While it has moments of laugh-out-loud slapstick humor like the former, also tries to invest a story of its own no matter how clichéd the characters or storyline is (of course it was intentional) as the latter. The exchanges between the kid and his grandfather starts a little disconnected but develops wonderfully as the story moves on. But Cary Elwes was the weak point as he neither has the comic timing nor the persona to pull this off.The bride (Robin Wright) falls in love with her farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes). When Westley heads out to the world to make a living, the news of his death in the hands of a dreaded pirate devastates the bride. An egotistic and scheming Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) betroths her to hatch an evil plot. By staging an abduction and blaming the neighboring kingdom, he plans to woo his citizens to back his war. He uses the help of Vizzini (Wallace Shawn) the brains, Inigo Motoya (Mandy Patinkin) the steel and Fezzik (André the Giant) the muscle. When the dreaded pirate comes thwart his plan, it becomes personal.Rob Reiner knows how to make a slapstick. Just like 'This is Spinal Tap', he doesn't go all out nasty - but picks the essential clichés and use it to his advantage. But the movie is far from perfect due to relatively shortage of gags where it ebbs and tides between lull and hilarity. The thread between the grandfather and kid was so important for this movie to click as they interrupt the fairytale in the exact moments where it starts to become too much or too dull. The trio of the brains, steel and muscle were so perfect together and they produce some real entertainment. Cary Elwes was missing the quality that the rest of the cast had - natural comic timing and comes off as a weakling and makes it difficult to root for him.Not a Monty Python but definitely entertaining</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been meaning to watch "The Princess Bride" in full for ages and finally got around to it. I enjoyed it but was slightly disappointed.The movie opens with a sick young boy being visited by his grandfather, who offers to read him a story. The boy isn't very enthusiastic at first but he gradually realises that this fairy story is slightly different to those he has heard before.The script (by Hollywood royalty William Goldman)is full of comic one-liners that are mostly aimed at adults, while the basic framework stays within the fairy tale genre with a beautiful princess, a handsome hero and a nasty villain determined to get his way.While it is very watchable, I thought the film wasn't consistently funny enough for adults, though kids will probably be happy enough with the fight and chase scenes The performances are excellent, particularly Peter Falk as the grandfather, Robin Wright as Princess Buttercup and Carey Elwes as the hero. The supporting cast are also very good.</fullReview>

This unusual film is refreshingly different, being at once funny, exciting and moving. A large amount of the credit must go to William Goldman's screenplay, adapted from his own novel; and director Rob Reiner's ability to pull it all together in just the right way.Mark Knopfler's simple theme music, Norman Garwood's production design and Adrain Biddle's cinematography all compliment proceedings.The cast round things off, with Robin Wright making her debut alongside the debonair Cary Elwes. Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest and Wallace Shawn are all suitably malevolent while Andre the Giant has a ball. Peter Falk, Billy Crystal and Carol Kane all drop by, while Mandy Patinkin is great as master Spanish swordsman Inigo Montoya.Wednesday, April 26, 2000 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride- Best Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess bride is an amazing tale of Buttercup and Westley, two lovers separated by an evil Prince Humperdink and the terrifying Dread Pirate Roberts. When Buttercup is kidnapped by a Sicillian, a giant, and a Spaniard named Inigo, Westley follows and rescues her. The best scene is when Inigo and Westley have a sword fight. Most movies have cheap fight scenes with unrealistic props and politically incorrect sequences (no offense to these movies). The Princess Bride's sword fights, however, use amazing choreography with the most real-looking swords I've ever seen in a movie. Inigo is an amazing swordsman out to avenge his father's death. In the end, after another awesome sword scene, he finally kills Rugen, his father's murderer. Overall, this was a riveting action action/romance film. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my favorite movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been my favorite movie ever since the first time I saw it in July of 1991. I remember the day well, I had just had my 8th birthday and I was on my way upstairs to play Super Mario World on my new SNES when my father was flipping through the channels, and found this movie. At the time, I was really into wrestling and my favorite was Andre The Giant, when my father told me he was in it I asked him to tape the rest and I'd watch it later. After dinner, my brother and I watched the movie and we were hooked, we spent the rest of the summer watching that movie practically every day. We even had our parents buy us plastic fencing swords so we could act out the dueling scene between Westley and Inigo. To this day, whether consciously or subconsciously, I compare every film I watch to 'The Princess Bride' because I look for a movie that has just the right amount of every genre you can think of; drama, comedy, fantasy, epic, love story, fairy tale, period, modern, adventure &amp; suspense. All those in one movie, not to mention Andre gives one of my favorite performances ever. Sure, he's playing a gentle giant much like he was in real life but for a man who had to learn his lines phonetically, that's something. Last but not least, Robin Wright who's portrayal of the beautiful, innocent, kind-hearted and pure-spirited Buttercup captured my love...and still has it. Overall, if I could only watch one movie the rest of my life, it would be 'The Princess Bride' by S. Morgenstern, okay well...William Goldman.</fullReview>

This fun adventure film features swashbuckling heroes, cowardly villains, a magician who sounds like a Jewish stand-up comic, and Rodents of Unsual Size. Wright is lovely if rather wooden in the title role. Elwes is appropriately dashing as the hero. The best performance is given by Patinkin as a vengeful man bent on finding the six-fingered man who killed his father. It's all a story told by Falk to grandson Savage and their scenes are quite amusing. It is a very simple and silly story that is enjoyable to watch but hardly the neo-classic some have made it out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have seen it countless times, with my family, with friends, or by myself when I've needed something funny and comforting. It is the princess story that all kids love, but without the corny and dumb aspects that usually keep princess stories from appealing to humans over the age of 10. The Fred Savage character is a clever way to make fun of the genre while still indulging in it. The whole fantasy world that serves as the backdrop is beautifully done, certainly much more basic than today's movies (Lord of the Rings, for example), but it is no less magical, and I don't think kids today would have any trouble getting pulled into the world of rodents of unusual size, fire pits, and albinos.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Falk, Christopher Guest, Mandy Pitikin, Wallace Shawn. Just those names alone, the body of work, along with Billy Crystal, Carol Kane, make this one of the best movies ever filmed. it takes a lot for a movie to not age, by which I mean that you enjoyed it as a kid, as I did this, but you still enjoy it as an adult. Story of love, good over evil, done in a classic style of days gone passed. The "Dread Pirate Roberts" shows that the good guy can wear black.A story of revenge, one that keeps the villain from being over the top, and makes you cheers when he gets his due fate.I've seen this movie more times then I can count. I loved Crystal and Kane's banter back and forth as Crystal strives to revive Wesley. How ever, one thing stuck with me more then anything. More then the final scene in which Wesley and his true lover are finally together. It's when Mandy Pitikin's character finally slays the villain, played to perfection by Christopher Guest. As the villain begs for mercy, Pitikin's Ingid asks "Give me all that I ask for and more." To which Guest's villainous character replies "All that I have and more." as he takes one last blow to Inid. The classic response, as the attempt is thwarted, and the villain slay ed, when Inid replies: Give me back my father, you son of a bitch!" I could imagine the theater full of people standing and cheering.It's a classic that should be watched time and time again, for it is truly one of the best filmed stories of all time. A true gem and personal fave.</fullReview>

Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are perfectly cast as the lovers, as are Wallace Shawn, Andre the giant, and Mandy Patinkin as the "poor lost circus performers", Chris Saradon as the purple wearing put out king, Billy Crystal as the mutton loving miracle man, Carol Kane as his bewitching wife, Peter Cook as the Weverwand of twue wove, Peter Falk as the cheek pinching grandfather, and Fred Savage as the grandson who is suspicious of this kissing book. Rob Reiner brings them all together with a lively script by William Goldman that features fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, and miracles. Goldman won an Oscar for his work on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and the same spark is in The Princess Bride, it's most evident between Andre's Fezzik and Patinkin's Inigo. The frame of a grandfather reading to his ailing grandson gives the movie one of it's more relevant meanings, everybody likes a good story, no matter how much of that icky kissing is in it. The end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I told my sister I got the DVD as a Christmas present ad was tickled and she said "Oh, you like THAT kind of humor?" But the universal appeal of The Princess Bride is not about the humor. It's a stellar quality of it, mind you, but not why it remains so timeless.Everyone says there is something in it for everyone. They mention sword fights, romance, action, drama, comedy, etc.... It's the dream, however. It's the complete fantasy told in a manner accessible to every single person.It skips over (transcends, even) concepts that overwhelm our everyday lives and reminds us of the passion for life, the dreams we had, when we were young. It skips over concepts like politics, religion, law (in the sense of legalese, especially), philosophy, logic and reason, status quo, and so much more.The Princess Bride gives us a rare gift in helping us to remember the seemingly silly dreams we had when we were kids. It makes it possible, if only for a moment, for us to forget all the responsibilities we have as adults and truly live just for the wonder of all that we could possibly experience in life.Somewhere, somehow The Princess Bride expresses your dream. So few ventures into literature ( be it prose, poetry, or drama) have managed to capture The Dream so well.Well, unless you identify with Prince Humperdinck. Then you're o your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can you say about this incredible film? The casting was perfect, the acting was perfect, and the writing was perfect. And the soundtrack was pretty darn good too. Andre the Giant? Perfect! I will add something. You know the scene with the shrieking eels? Well they just found a very similar creature (half shark / half eel) over in asia. Apparently it is a species that lives very low beneath the surface of the ocean and has only been seen on occasion when one is dead or near death and comes near the surface. They recently caught a near dead one and put it in a pool for its last few days of life. Anyways, that discovery made the shrieking eel scene a lot more spookier for me. :-D -LOSTFLIX</fullReview>

And with the first few words the story develops into a perfect combination of adventure and comedy.My favourite lines come from Í?igo Montoya, "My name is Í?igo Montoya. You killed my father, prepare to die" has to be one of the most repeated words in the film, along with "as you wish". Who would have said that a script full of catchphrases would create a wonderful film.There is an element of magic, a big one, you will find on tales of princesses, heroes and villains. There is a romantic story and there is time for laughter in a very innocent film, with a fantastic script, good acting, great matching music... well, it has it all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Eighties Film: The Princess Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride (1987): Starring Robin Wright Penn, Cary Elwes, Chris Sarandon, Christopher Guest, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant, Fred Savage, Peter Falk, Billy Crystal, Peter Cook, Mel Smith, Carol Kane, Anne Dyson, Willoughby Gray, Malcolm Storry, Margery Mason, Betsy Brantley, Sallie McLaughlin, Paul Badger...Director Rob Reiner, Screenplay William Goldman.Based on William Goldman's novel, this is the film adaptation (that he himself wrote) from director Rob Reiner. Released in 1987, it became a fantasy romance cult classic from the 80's. It was the film debut of actress Robin Wright Penn (Jenny from Forest Gump), a wonderful beginning to a lengthy career. She plays the eponymous "Princess" Buttercup a country girl in the fictional land of Florin, who falls for the stable boy/field hand, Westley (Cary Elwes). It's a match made in heaven, but when Westley goes off to seek fortune and fame, he is kidnapped by the dread Pirate Roberts and his crew. Buttercup believes he died and is obligated to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) who wants only to use her as a political pawn, unbeknownst to her, so that he may declare war on the rival country of Guilder. While out riding her horse, Buttercup is kidnapped by bandits. They are Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Fezzik (WWF wrestler Andre the Giant). The bandits are in turn pursued by a masked stranger in black, who turns up to be none other than Westley. But after the lovers are reunited, Prince Humperdinck intervenes, forcing Buttercup to give up her true love in order to save his life. Through a series of "miracles", such as the supposed resurrection of the "almost dead" Westley by Miracle Max (Billy Crystal), and through the help of reformed bandits Fezzik and Inigo, the princess is saved from the clutches of the villain. And all of this is a story within another story- that of a young boy (child star Fred Savage who was beginning work on the TV series "The Wonder Years") who, bored of playing sports and Nintendo video games, gets a visit from his grandfather (Peter Falk) who reads him the Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern. Gradually, the boy is hooked into reading. Much of the film contains witty, tongue-in-cheek satirical humor, as if the whole plot is a parody of a traditional fairy tale romance or romantic adventure, and indeed this film contains elements of both. We have the "miracle" performed by Max, the daring escapes by Westley, the Fire Swamp full of Rodents of Unusual Size and the classic plot of a brave hero rescuing the princess from the villain. The cinematography by Adrian Biddle is remarkable, but only in the shots of outdoor locations such as forests, mountains, ocean and countryside. The interior of homes and castles are clearly bad studio sets. The music by Mark Knopfler is neither impressive nor memorable, often sounding electronic, but the love song "Storybook Love" sung by Willy De Ville during the closing credits was a major hit at the time. The costumes by Phyllis Dalton are lovely and accurate to this Late Medieval/Renaissance Europe world. There is much to like and dislike about this film, but generally audiences have enjoyed it, simply because it's a feel good romance adventure film. William Goldman and Rob Reiner remain faithful to the original novel, which is a rarity and a good thing when it comes to novel-to-film adaptations. However, the downside includes not only the bad musical score but the abundantly cheesy dialog (in the novel it works, but not in the film) most of this being one-liners and clichéd, common remarks. Also, although the acting by Mandy Patinkin and Andre the Giant is good, their heavy accents make it hard to understand what they are saying. Robin Wright Penn is a superb actress but she is doing nothing worthy of even a Golden Globe in this film, as she is simply portraying a nearly Disney-like princess heroine, which means she is uninteresting, flat and passive, never doing a thing to help herself and instead waiting on Westley her knight in shining armor. But don't get me wrong, this is a great film and a classic from a decade (the 80's) that saw many fine films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite movie!!! It's amazing and I feel sorry for people that have never seen it. It has everything!!! I haven't found another movie that I like so much!! One time I watched this move 5 times in one night!! Yes I'm addicted!!! I have a couple of favorite parts in the movie, one is in the beginning and Westly says As you wish to Buttercup and it would be nice if that actually happened!! Another one is when Vizzini tries to figure out what cup of wine is poisoned! Probably the most quoted part of the movie in my house is when they go to see Miracle Max and his wife comes out saying "Liar, Liar" and he says "Get back witch!" and she says, "I'm not a witch I'm your wife." It's so funny and we say it all the time. Of course I also like the part when Westly comes back to life because of true love and that is why he is only mostly dead. I also like the part where you think the eel is going to eat Princess Buttercup, but then it cuts back to the grandpa. That was amazing because you weren't expecting it at all. I also like when they are jumping out of the window, her dress just looks really cool. So pretty much I love the whole movie and couldn't imagine it being done a different way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride is a great family movie that appeals to many different generes of audience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride has got to be the best movie ever created from my point of view for the following reasons: It has every element a classic chick-flick needs, and is therefore great for watching with a bunch of your girl friends for a girl's night, but it also has the elements of an action/ comedy movie, so the guys love it too, and don't mind watching it. It is completely quotable, and will leave you laughing for days afterward as funny scenes come to mind. It's simply amazing. I have not yet found anything that can compare to it as far as what range of audience enjoys it- my little brother, my dad, my best guy friend, my best girl friend, my mom and I all love it, and we have incredibly varying tastes, but there's something in The Princess Bride for all of us. And the cast of characters...wow. There's really nothing more to say. With the beautiful Buttercup, the handsome farm boy Westly, the Man in Black, Fezzik, Indigo, Miracle Max, the old King, Valarie, the Queen, the albino, Prince Humperdink, Count Rugen, and Vizzini, the chemistry on screen is overwhelming. It drags you in time after time, always better then the time before. This movie is a timeless classic. Made in the 80's with a huge following today. Read the book-The Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern (Goldman's pseudonym). If you think the movie's good, you don't know what you're missing!!! "Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in class while learning about medieval history. When the teacher said we were going to watch the Princess Bride, the class cheered. At, first I was thinking the Princess Diaries, but this movie is 1000 times better. It is pretty much a classic fairy-tale with some twists. It has scary eels, cheesy rats, giants and fencers, riddles, and a whole lot more. In the beginning, the movie follows around a bunch of different characters, until it gets to the main person. I thought that was pretty unique. This film also goes in many other directions, a normal fairy-tale wouldn't do. The most definitive example is when the main character says "There is a shortage of perfect breasts in the world, you wouldn't want to ruin yours." when the princess is about to stab herself in the heart. There are some flaws in this fairy-tale however. Of course, the rodents are pretty cheesy, but I can let that one pass. It is kind of romantic, (or, very romantic) for those who dislike it. The storyline is fairly predictable.-All Spoilers Below!!!- But, the main flaw is that Wesley, the main character, seem to perfect. He is better at fencing than the Spaniard. He is stronger than Fezzik the giant. (Well, defeats him.) To top that off, he outwits Vizzini and Prince Humperdink.-Ending of Spoilers- So, if you are into romance, or classic-like movies, or are perhaps trying to see any movie that's good, this is the movie for you.8.5/10</fullReview>

I've checked out sufficient of the previous postings to realize that virtually everyone rejoices in its blend of irreverence and wonder, likewise enough posters have described the storyline to make another description superfluous. What we have here is a wonderful time-capsule comprising the best elements of the Errol Flynn Robin Hood plus the 30s version of The Prisoner Of Zenda (Goldman's own favorite movie is Gunga Din of the same vintage)with extra added ingredients.

		<fullReview>I don't get how some people don't understand the comedy of this movie. It's very much a fairy-tale spoof, sort of a more subtle version of Shrek. That's where much of the comedy comes from, as well as from some of the sheer silliness that provides a stark contrast to the setting and tone. I love sheer silliness, when used properly, and this movie does exactly that.The Princess Bride is my 3rd favorite movie ever (#1 is Head, #2 is UHF), and for good reason. It is wonderfully written (by the same guy who wrote the book, thankfully), superbly directed (by the same guy who directed North, ironically), and perfectly acted (by the same people who, um, played other famous roles).Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Men In Tights) keeps Westly exactly where he should be, as a caring, yet caustic, hero. Robin Wright Penn (Forrest Gump) handles Buttercup wonderfully as the 'straight man' to all the off-the-wall loons she's surrounded by. Andre the Giant (WWF) shows that not all wrestlers make bad actors. Chew on that, Rock! Mandy Patinkin gives us one of the greatest film characters of all time: Inigo Montoya. NO ONE could've played that role better! Wallace Shawn (good actor in lots of bad movies) thankfully gets a good part for once as the Sicilian genius Vezzini. (Yes, Sicilians are geniuses.) Chris Sarandon (probably related to Susan) delivers Prince Humperdinck in such a way that almost seems dull at first, then you realize he's intentionally making the Prince look like cardboard, and does a great job of it. Christopher Guest makes an enjoyably hateable Count Rugen. I have great respect for actors who can make villans both delightful and despicable. Peter Falk (Columbo) serves us well as the Grandfather reading the story, and Fred Savage (Wonder Years, the Wizard) actually entertains for once, rather than annoys, as the sick Grandson.Then there are the small parts, which manage to steal scenes from this already genius cast. Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife Valerie brighten the screen from beneath all that age makeup. Peter Cook is the Impressive Clergyman with the hilarious speech impediment. ("Mawaige is wat bwings us togever today.") And there's so much more.So go ahead then, bow if you will, bow to the critics of slime, "Bride"-haters of muck! Boooooo! Because this movie is a gem. It should be cherished, not chastised. I don't mind if you don't like it, but don't tell me it's a bad film. 'Cause if The Princess Bride is a bad film, then why don't you tell me what a good film is?No? Okay, then, "As you wish."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget everything you've read about this being compelling to all ages. This is first and foremost a movie for kids. To me the movie was quite a disappointment, considering the rating it has been given by the users of IMDb. I found it childish but I can't truthfully say that I was ever really bored. I had expected more laughs, from the man who made the outstanding "This is Spinal Tap" (1984) but had to settle for perhaps about three or four funny moments. (The inconceivable bit actually being very funny.) What bugs me the most is that the movie was aimed (perhaps unintendedly) at children because of the scenes involving the little sick punk Fred Savage and his grandpa Peter Falk (the actual storyteller). The scenes are so awfully disgusting in the "cute" kind of way to anyone above ten.Keep that in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my three all-time favorite movies, and I'm not really sure why. Everything just works. Rob Reiner, the director, nailed it. Peter Falk and Fred Savage nailed it. Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Andre the Giant nailed it. Christopher Guest totally nailed it with his villain-with- the-flat-affect characterization of heartless, truly heartless, evil. Even Mark Knopfler nailed the score.How can you not love a movie with the characters "The Ancient Booer" and "The Assistant Brute." I've watched it several times since it came out, and it draws me in every time. It's a truly iconic fantasy.My current theory on why the movie works so well is that the characters seem to respect each other. The Dread Pirate Roberts, Inigo, and Fezzik not only respect each other as adversaries, they seem even to care while they are adversaries, making their morph into friends completely credible. It's ensemble acting at a high level, and it makes it almost necessary for us the viewers to care about them, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film during the 5th Game of the 1987 World Series, an intense game (my Minnesota Twins vs. the Atlanta Braves), that I just couldn't watch. My mind wasn't on the film, so I couldn't appreciate it as I knew whoever won that Game would take the series. After that I began to see it on TV and video and realized it was an OK film. My most recent viewing on the Blu-Ray DVD helped me not only enjoy the beauty of its cinematography, but its story, pacing, acting, directing, music score, swordplay and stunts. The cast is perfection save for over-the-top performances by Billy Crystal &amp; Carol Kane. Cary Elwes shines as both a humble farm-boy and later as a debonair, swashbuckling pirate in his portrayal of the hero Westley. Wallace Shawn is brilliant as Vizzini, a sly but silly, lisping villain, Andre the Giant is absolutely charming as Fezzik the hulking, but kindly Giant, Mandy Patinkin is terrific as Inigo Montoya the dashing Spanish swashbuckler as are Chris Sarandon as evil Prince Humperdinck and Christopher Guest as Count Rugin the six-fingered scoundrel. Robin Wright was stunningly beautiful and endearing as Buttercup and Peter Falk and Fred Savage as Storyteller and grandson were fine. The story is clever, funny, dashingly adventurous and expertly directed by Rob Reiner. I even liked the song Storybook Love by Mark Knopfler. You must see it on Blu-Ray DVD, it's AWESOME. BTW, the Braves won that game but my Twins won the World Series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun fairytale satire, as much as it is a successful fable for pure genre fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner was on a streak in the mid 80s, and though it could be argued he his his peak at the start with Spinal Tap, this and Stand by Me can be considered two other important works in his decidedly since mixed career as a director. Princess Bride is as self-conscious as comedies get, but it's also a lot of fun for the whole family, and it's not just a typical aside to say so. On the contrary, as an adult now I find it funnier seeing it for the first time then I might have if I had seen it as a kid. This isn't to say that it doesn't have some special quality about it, that it's almost like a sprightly live-action cartoon. But there's a generous wink and nod behind most of the good jokes in the film, like how dialog between many of the characters point out some of the loops medieval fantasies take, in small things like climbing up a rocky cliff or in drinking a poisoned drink or going through a nasty swamp or in the convoluted mechanics of a "Machine", or even how to revive one from the dead with a, uh, whatever it is that's given to Cary Elwes.It's the tale as simple as can be: girl and boy fall in love, girl loses boy, girl gets engaged to bad man, girl gets kidnapped by dastardly (and inept) figures, girl gets re-captured by a man in a mask that turns out to be the boy again, boy loses girl again, boy comes back from dead, boy and girl go back together again. OK, a bit complicated, but the fun in William Goldman's script is seeing how the questioning of the archetypes goes hand-in-hand with telling a conventionally satisfying story. There's not a whole lot of dimension to most of them- certainly not to the bride- but that's part of the excitement is to see how the characters meet their fates (particularly Patikin's character, who will stop at nothing to kill the six-fingered man who killed his father, as he says about ten times while in the big climactic sword-fight). And why should there be, as the story itself is being read to a precocious child (Fred Savage) by a mustached Peter Falk.Actually, the script probably isn't even the best part, and neither is Reiner's often wonderful direction (though it helps, minus the score by Knopfler which is way too cheesy even for the material here). What makes this so watchable a comedy are the actors, who are all at the top of their games. Wallace Shawn (inconceivable!), Andre the Giant, Billy Crystal (65? can't do it for that), Patinkin, Christopher Guest in his most deadpan character yet, and Elwes and Robin Wright Penn in such straight roles, are equally enthralling and hilarious in how they dance around such good material, giving it the proper edge when needed and light touches of pure irony as well. Being more aware of what some of these character actors and stars have done now it makes for it to be hilarious, but what makes it work for kids too is that the actors never stray from being true to the goofy levels to their roles. This isn't quite Monty Python being dealt with here, but more family-friendly satire, and it's a success through and through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...without viewing it first. This is, sadly, one of the worst fantasy movies I have seen. Everyone except the leading actress seems to think this is a comedy. Constant jokes, no thrill, hardly any fantasy and a rushed storyline in the beginning... I believe this could have been a very good movie if it was a bit more serious and had the same character as, for example, "The neverending story" or "Legend". It had very little fantasy elements, which disappointed me, as I was expecting more magic. I also think a flashback to an earlier point in Westley´s and Buttercup´s life would have been nice. I can not seem to make up my mind if this was an attempt for a comedy or a parody...I would imagine that children find this amusing though. I would also imagine that the book is better than the movie (they almost always are!). I will probably never see it again, unless I have a very bad hangover and can fall asleep watching it.</fullReview>

I show it to everyone who stays over at my house and have not met one person who didn't like it. To not think this movie is great would be "utterly inconceivable"!! .I know every word to the movie and quote it all the time. Buttercup and Wesley are the perfect couple!!It truly does have everything.To quote the Grandpa it has "Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles..." and anything else you could possibly want in a movie!! If you have not seen it go out and buy it you will like it!!! It is pure enough to show to little kids, but funny and exciting enough for adults and teenagers,tooGO BUY IT OR AT LEAST RENT IT...NOW...OR..

		<fullReview>I love this movie more than just about any other in the world. The only thing that comes close on my rating meter is the three-way tie between the first three Star Wars films.I will agree with something I read in another review: The movie is not the book. The book is infinitely better than the movie, and dearer to my heart than any book except the Bible. I advise that first-time viewers watch the movie first, to become acquainted with the story and characters. Then go get the book, and discover the depth of character history.I must say one thing, though, for those who have never read the book and are planning to: THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON AS S. MORGENSTERN. Goldman made him up. Goldman also doesn't have a wife named Helen or a son named Jason or a father who came to America from Florin. (The fictional countries of Florin and Guilder get their names from forms of currency.) He wrote the story for his two daughters. The truth about Morgenstern confuses a lot of readers, so I thought I'd be helpful there.But if you love fantasy, see this movie -- and read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took my daughter to see this film when she was less than 10 years of age. I was not in the slightest bit interested in seeing this flick and felt at the time that I was making the ultimate parental sacrifice. The movie was a second feature and did not start till late, by which time my daughter had fallen asleep. I was determined to get my money's worth so I stayed ...and stayed...and stayed. I loved it.I am middle aged and am almost embarrassed to say this, but this is my favourite film of all time. I loved everything about it and adored the characters, particularly Inigo (Mandy Pantinkin, Fezzik (Andre the giant)and Westley (Cary Elwes).There are many who will think this film is ordinary or even ridiculous. But there are some who will be enchanted by it's magic, as I was. It is technically, not the best film ever made but it is indeed my favourite.</fullReview>

The film had been recommended by another friend, and I was only casting about for a film a 9-year-old would enjoy. I wasn't expecting to love it myself! I believe I've now watched this move more than 20 times, and part of my enjoyment comes from the clever writing that created many memorable lines.

This movie takes the basic elegance and beauty of the archaic fairy tale and breathes life into it on screen. It is a film that can be watched over and over again with little loss of meaning. In fact, the only downside to it may be the way it compels avid fans to quote dialogue while others are watching, a habit that is annoying to anyone but the one who is doing the quoting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from being a superb movie on its own merits, TPB is the best, most faithful adaptation of a book I have ever seen (rivaled perhaps by "The Silence of the Lambs"). This is certainly due to the fact that the book's author, William Goldman, is also an accomplished screenwriter, and did the adaptation.My only disappointment in that respect was that Inigo's story -- which was almost a complete chapter in the book -- had to be reduced to a few lines. (As Inigo would say, "No time to 'splain; let me sum up.") With it went one of the funniest characters in the book, a friend of Inigo's father named Yeste.So see the movie, and read the book; and the movie is good enough that it really doesn't matter which you do first.By the way -- does Count Rugen's torture machine go up to eleven?</fullReview>

The problem, I suppose, is that I made the mistake of reading the book first, and there were passages so brilliant I found myself jumping up and down at the sheer audacity of Goldman's prose and wanting to read it out loud to anyone who would listen. Wonderful and funny and wise and witty.Goldman may have had a hand in the script, but I think some heavy handed clutz must have been guiding it. For instance, they missed the crucial point about Buttercup completely. Sure, she was the most beautiful girl in the world, but she was still just a young, silly girl, and a shallow one at that. I could go on, but let me just say that if you loved the movie, fine, but if you REALLY want to have a good time, go find the book. The story of Inigo and his father alone will be worth the search, and the description of the swordplay on top of the Cliffs of Insanity will knock your socks off!God!

		<shortDescription>An overrated, under-acted farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask anyone who saw the Princess' Bride if they liked it 10 yrs ago and they will undoubtedly say "Yes". However, this is one of the most overrated films of all time. The Princess' Bride combines corny slapstick humor with the moronic acting of a young, mask wearing, Cary Elwes. Fred Savage also makes an appearance as a young kid (big surprise). Add a poor script and some horrible special effects, and you have 2 hours of shmaltzy, low level, movie making. I tried to watch the Princess' Bride 3 times to appreciate its offerings. All 3 times I have turned the VCR off in disgust.My advice to anyone who has seen the movie, continue appreciating what has become somewhat of a cult classic. To anyone who hasn't seen it, skip this slow moving, uninspired piece of drivel.</fullReview>

I understand that the point was you were meant to be regressing back to childhood and stories of princes rescuing damsels in distress, but it just didn't work, I instead found myself cringing.Also the film fails in remaining effective and has become easily dated, ending up like a poor TVM.

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of movies in my day and this one still ranks at the top of my list, even after a decade. I am ashamed to admit that I did not see this "sleeper" hit at the theater. It was not until my father rented it and forced me to watch this "kid's" movie that I was able to appreciate this movie. I have now seen it so many times that I can practically recite the entire movie verbatim! Yes, this is a silly movie, a tongue-in-cheek theme is rampant throughout the film, but it's smart and dare I say, "sassy." All of the characters are wonderful, even though some are a bit more tame in the movie than in the book (by that I mainly refer to Humperdink who was much more straightlaced and militant in the book than in the movie where he was portrayed as more of a bumbling idiot!). Princess Bride pokes fun at traditional romantic movies by exploiting the melodramatic child in all of us. All in all, this movie has a little bit of something for everyone: "fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles." This is a must see for all ages!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really did not see the appeal in this film - maybe it's because I first watched at the age of 19 rather than a lot younger. I didn't think there was much of a plot, and there seemed to be no relationship ever forming between the two lovers. I literally could not believe I'd wasted an hour and a half watching this alongside two friends who had grown up with it and adored it. Honestly I think I would probably have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen it when younger and grown up with it. Seeing it as a young adult just made me hate the whole thing and want to criticise every aspect of the film. I don't plan on ever watching it again and if you are also a first-time watcher at a later age I can't imagine you'd see what the hype about it is either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece as you would wish for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is going to date me, but when I was a kid, my sister loved the soap opera 'Santa Barbara,' and because of Robin Wright, she wanted to see 'The Princess Bride.' It became one of her favorites, getting me to watch it. After watching and only being a kid, I just "liked" it. Since then, I must have seen this 20+ times. It is truly a timeless classic, made with pure heart, adventure, comedy, excitement, romance, etc ? in other words, all of the needed elements of a masterpiece. (I do use the word "timeless" if you forgive the He-Man guys behind the all-but two-year-old Fred Savage and the high-tech "video game" he is playing. Other than that, it can be viewed in any decade.) We have Grandfather that reads the said-title to his ill grandson and so the story unfolds, beautifully. Westley and Buttercup are the central characters in this fairy-tale land, but all of the actors/characters have such depth and realism, it's almost never-ending in excitement when one appears, leaves and/or returns. You will see hilarious comedy, exciting sword-fighting or mind-games and true love. This movie is also perfect for the whole family. You might see people die, but it's as graphic as people simply falling off screen. Little blood, no nudity, no language, no sex?I love the fact when they set out to make this, they didn't need to add any of that in and now have an all-time-classic. I'd hate to ruin any of the surprises, or the people the characters meet along the way or the near-death experiences they take with strides, so I would just highly recommend this all ages, to all audiences. If you've already experienced one of the best movies of all time, enjoy it again; see how movies should be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Fantasy Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is one of the most sincere and heartfelt fantasy movies I've ever seen. The movie is framed as a story that a grandfather reads to his sick grandson and it's a perfect idea for a movie that has some tongue-in-cheek takes on fantasy clichés.The story begins with Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and Westley (Cary Elwes), two farmers who fall in love. He decides to leave and return one day a rich man to marry her. Then she hears he was killed by a pirate and Prince Humperdinck decides to make her his bride. But when they least expect Westley returns for 'true love' and the story turns into one of the funniest and most fast-paced adventure ever. There are deadly eels, giant rodents, dangerous forests, giants, revenge-obsessed swordsmen, and miracles. The heroes are noble and fair, and the villains despicable. And true love wins in the end. A movie has never been more honest about its intentions than The Princess Bride.The cast is mostly great, especially Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin, a swordsman looking for the man who killed his father. Penn could have been a more interesting character than the usual damsel in distress, but I guess some clichés you just don't touch. Peter Falk has a short but adorable role as the grandfather trying to pass to his grandson some of the pleasure of reading books.The Princess Bride is a wonderful story that should appeal to anyone who never lost their sense of wonder and who still like to see the good guys truly win without compromises, something rare these days in mainstream cinema. It's a charming movie that has no pretensions about what it is and which does everything right. Watch it and love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only (slight) saving grace is Cary Elwes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start out by saying to the legions of fans that I just did not find this movie to be that good. Now, don't get me wrong...I love a lot of 80s movies, AND Monty Python, AND I have a pretty good sense of humor. All the rabid fans of "The Princess Bride" seem to use those as guidelines for who likes this movie, but I'm not buying it. This just did not do ANYTHING for me.My college roommate was shocked and appalled freshman year that I had never seen, or even heard of, "The Princess Bride." So, she had me set aside some time to watch it with her. Let's just say it was like this: have you ever been watching something, and thought "when does this get good?" That was exactly what I was thinking by about 20 minutes in. I gave it a fair shake: I'd never heard of it except for the glowing reviews of my roommate, and we also have pretty similar tastes in movies for the most part, so I was expecting it to be at least fairly good if she liked it THAT much. Ah, geez, was I wrong. It was all I could do to sit through this. I won't go summarizing the entire movie, but these are my main points:1. Cary Elwes is pretty good as Westley. But then again, I like him. I didn't really like any of the other characters at all, especially not Buttercup. I didn't even really want Westley to end up with her.2. This whole "quotability factor" is blown way out of proportion. Especially this "inconceivable!" line that everyone thinks is so great...only mildly amusing at best.3. The sheer repetitiveness of all the "Prepare to die" and "Inconceivable" stuff is ridiculous and tiresome (it gets that way VERY quickly). Even the oddly endearing "As you wish"...you just get tired of hearing it. All the "un-funniness" really just takes away from the few amusing parts.4. When it comes down to it, I was just bored. The story is so up-and-down, all over the place...I don't know how a child could sit through this, when I was waiting for it to end before the midpoint.Just my opinion...this movie is WAY over-rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only seen a part of this film, up to the part where Inigo Montoya and Fezzik revive the Man In Black and team up with him. But it is enough to form some kind of opinion about it.I fail to see what is so great about this film. Why has it achieved such a cult status in the USA? In my opinion, this film is just an enjoyable comical fantasy, nothing more. There aren't any particularly innovative characters, scenes or jokes. The plot is interesting enough, and some of the scenes (such as the sword fight between Inigo Montoya and the Man In Black, or the torture scene with the machine) are particularly amusing, but I still don't think they are enough to make this film such a huge classic.This film reminds me a great deal of Monty Python's "Holy Grail". Now THAT is a classic film worthy of a cult status. Sure, there are funny characters, scenes and jokes in this movie too, but in "Holy Grail", they are much, much funnier.</fullReview>

Found it to be overly cheesy and I guess it just tries to hard. After the class was over with, I put the movie in the back of my mind as one to never watch again. That was 1997.So I hadn't watched it until a few days ago when my roommate took it out of the DVD selection as something to watch. So I watched it again, well, some of it. At one point I got up and went to my room. I have better things to do with my time. It's attempt to be witty and fun just came off as horribly staged to me. It was a just another cheesy Hollywood piece of junk. Someone mentioned on here that this was the Shrek of the 80's. I disagree, Shrek was much more fun than this dull thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon reading the comments in this board, I again attempted to watch this movie. This time, I decided to try with the help of some die hard Princess Bride fans to point out the "charm" of the film.To make a long story short, I am truly disappointed that the American public believes this to be a good film. That the masses are so drawn in to this pointless, under-acted, substandard, ferociously uninspired remake of a mediocre book is just more fuel for the fire against the "ugly american." Are we this stupid? Is it this type of entertainment that explains why long lines of traffic form to watch the aftermath of accidents on the freeway?For those who are unfamiliar with this film, let me summarize: A masked Cary Elwes tries to save a Princess, Buttercup. That's it. The rest of the plot is unimportant. Fred Savage, stretches his acting abilities by playing a cute kid, while Andre the Giant (arguably the best performance in this film) plays...well...a giant. The humor in this film is slapstick and truly unfunny. While watching this film with my friends, I actually lost a little respect for them as the guffawed during each unfunny and uninspired "joke."There is a place where all movies should go to die, I am surprised that this film still has fans. Furthermore, it is films like this which should make Hollywood ashamed of itself. Pointless, stupid, moronic, boring, cheesy, and horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is this on the top 250 list?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was like five twelve year olds trying to improvise a Shrek movie in their basement. There's nothing new or unique about this movie. If you like to watch movies, don't watch this. My face turned red when watching this movie. I was so embarrassed. I'm starting to think that the ratings and reviews are just a joke. I fell for a bad joke. If you haven't seen the movie, but you're thinking about doing it, remember that the reviews and ratings aren't legit. Spoiler warning. The poison drinking scene made me laugh uncontrollably. It was the worst scene I have ever seen. I couldn't breathe. Even though I laughed, I was mostly sad and embarrassed. I regret seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about this movie, especially praise for it's mix of comedy, romance, and action. Well, they certainly did have all 3, but none of them came off very effectively to me. Most of the jokes didn't work with me, evident by my family laughing as I sat in silence trying to deduce what was so comical about a given line. The action was not too exciting to me, although the coordination on the sword fighting was pretty good. The romance was...arguably absent, to put it gently. I didn't feel any real connection between Westley and Buttercup since they fell in love as soon as we are introduced to them. No build up, no suspense, no nothing. I also found the idea of them being in love totally unbelievable. He did odd jobs around the home and she fell in love with him? Pretty low standards there, Buttercup.Aside from these ineffective aspects, the story also had me emotionally slamming my head against a proverbial wall. I always thought Twilight was the worst offender in the category of having a female lead who is totally bland and male dependent, which hence causes a completely agitating love story to ensue, but Buttercup and her relationship with Westly might just take the cake....OK that's going too far. However, it's still pretty bad, and the story suffers horribly because of it. Most of the movie came off as a way to please adolescent girls who dream of their own prince charming saving them from everything and tending to their every whim and issue. Aside from Buttercup, the characters range from forgettable, to decent, to pretty good. The only character I came to actually like was Inigo, but that isn't saying much given his competition. Overall, I really don't get why this movie is rated so highly, but if people enjoy it, good for them. I'll be avoiding it from now on, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing - especially for a Top 250 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm writing this, The Princess Bride is ranked 194 in the IMDb Top 250 list with an average rating of 8.1. Considering the rating and the fact that I love fantasy, I had high expectations. Long story short - I was very disappointed.It's not that The Princess Bride is bad. It has its moments and a unique kind of humor. But the overall impression is lackluster at best. The plot is thin, the acting is sub-par, the main characters nothing but clichés and the special effects are barely worth a laugh. Just look at those guys it rat costumes. Is that supposed to be frightening or hilarious? To mention a few good points, the minor characters of Inigo Montoya and Fezzik are very good. Also the cuts between the plot and the frame narrative about a grandfather and his grandson are pleasantly surprising. On the other hand, the frame narrative itself is unnecessary and only exists to provide the beginning and the ending that the plot is missing.Why do one third of the viewers rate this 10? According to my wife, she loved the movie as a kid, but was disappointed too when she saw it recently. I guess it just did not mature well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one of the few people I know who truly does not like this movie- and I usually love fantasy. Although the movie had some great (very quotable) lines and several strong characters, it seemed very two-dimensional to me.The main problem I had with this movie: (some minor spoilers) - Buttercup is a complete ditz. She has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and her bravest act is to contemplate suicide when she believes her "true love" to be dead. Even the earliest Disney princesses had more personality than her. I thought we were past movies in which the fair maiden does nothing but let the handsome guy come rescue her, but apparently we aren't.All in all, I felt that this movie had some good parts, but I simply could not get past Buttercup's character enough to enjoy the rest of the movie. Therefore, I give it a 5.0 out of 10 for being fun and original, but anti-feminist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride (as of 31 October 2002) commands 86th place on the Internet Movie Database's 'Top 250 Films' list, which rather begs the question: WHY??? It is a somewhat alarming thought that there are only 85 films in the world considered to be superior to this mish-mash of action and syrupy sentiment held together by cheesy acting and wobbly scenery. Admittedly, there are some elements of the story which are really rather good, including the large variety of perils our hero (Westley) and heroine (Buttercup) must face; the shrieking eels, cliffs of insanity and fire-swamp are original and nasty pitfalls awaiting the unwary.Unfortunately viewers must wade through a lot of dross for these occasional rewards and the plot is a perfect example of this. A grandfather is reading his rather peevish grandson a story about two young lovers with somewhat unlikely names. Buttercup's sweetheart (supposedly killed by pirates five years ago) is in fact still alive, cleverly "disguised" with a black blindfold and an incredibly silly little moustache and pigtail. But Buttercup has become engaged (against her will) to the nasty Prince Humperdinck. This of course is a cue for multiple sword fights and near death experiences as the soulmates prove that true love will conquer all. Apart from the notable exception of Christopher Guest who plays Humperdinck's sidekick Count Rugen with a deliciously understated sadistic malice, the acting is largely overcooked. Perhaps this is just as well; if the viewer's attention is monopolised by the actors, they will be less likely to notice the bendable swords and polystyrene rocks. This is not to say that the film isn't entertaining - it would certainly while away a rainy Saturday afternoon - but to accord it the status of a classic is inconceivable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was disappointed by the quality of this movie, having been encouraged to rent it out by its high IMDb rating. It felt like a B movie: pretty much everything was weak. The plot was unexciting, the timing of the "gags" was awful, the set was ludicrous, the editing was substandard, the lighting was quaint, the lead actress lacked appeal, the lead actor - what's with that little moustache?, and the comedians weren't (with one honourable exception) funny. The honourable exception was the clergyman as played by Peter Cook. We miss you, Peter. But what on earth were you doing in this morass of mediocrity?! For the first twenty minutes I kept thinking that it would get better to justify its rating. Not a chance. So how did it get into the IMDb top 250? Come on guys, let me into the secret here. It can't be a "cult" thing, you could go to any bad movie and laugh at how bad it is. So is everyone marking it based on some hazy recollection from childhood? Have you actually WATCHED it recently? If this movie came out today, it would tank at the box office and struggle to get above 5.0 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, I rented this film because I knew it was rated 94 on the IMDb Top 250. I guess the fact I had such high expectations removed any chance of me liking this film. I felt it was utter trash. There was very little I could say was even mildly amusing here...Much of Andre's (The Giant) lines were about as effective as he would have been if he'd tried to play a slim, short, well-spoken Englishman. Cary Elwes was a pathetic hero - I felt no affinity towards him whatsoever. The short, bald guy managed to do only one thing - annoy the crap out of me. Overall, the story was boring, the writing was lame, the main characters of Cary Elwes and Robin Wright were one-dimensional and I fail to understand how anyone could warm to them. The only scenes I found interesting and even enjoyable were those involving Fred Savage. In short, a major disappointment and yet another example of a film that in my view has no business being on the IMDb Top 250 list.This film ranked No. 94 of all time? INCONCEIVABLE !!!!</fullReview>

I really, really loved the book.I enjoyed this film fairly well. However, the whole intricate concept which I know and love so dearly has lost a lot -- maybe 70% -- in translation to the screen, even though the same guy wrote both the book and the screenplay.Now, if you haven't read the book and you want to see this movie, then you're better off never reading the book at all; just watch the film, have fun, and stop there. However, if you've read the book, it won't hurt you to see this movie -- and in fact it's worth it to see this movie just to see Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, or Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as Miracle Max and his Witch Valerie, or even to see the rendering of the Cliffs of Insanity -- but it won't be nearly the experience you're expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or maybe I had too high expectations, maybe I have no taste, but The Princess Bride is the worst piece of garbage I've seen in months, if not years.Yesterday, after listening for years on end what a great movie it is, I went, got the DVD and popped it in my computer, curious what all the fuss was all about. I wish I didn't. I managed to put up with it for a little over an hour, and now I want that hour of my life that I wasted on it BACK! Even if one is willing to excuse the awful, cheap props, costumes and special effects due to the movie being shot in the 80s and on a small budget, nothing, absolutely NOTHING excuses to awful writing and even worse delivery. It's been toted to me as some paragon of witty, hilarious dialogue, but frankly, with one single exception (the "In which cup is the poison" scene) the rest was just painful to sit through. I saw nothing particularly funny or witty about the dialogue, and even if there was some flash of brilliance here and there it was torn apart, set on fire and then stomped on by the wooden delivery of the actors. I have never seen people who lack comic timing so badly. They sounded like they were reading a phonebook, rather than delivering funny dialogue.Though it's obvious from the rest of the review, I am severely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in fifth grade and thought it was fantastic. I mean, come on, it had action, fantasy, romance, and comedy all in one! And even watching the movie now, the only thing that doesn't hold up as well are the special effects in the film, notably the R.O.U.S., the fires in the fire swamp, and the obvious body doubles here and there.But as for the rest of the film:The acting isn't Oscar-worthy, but it definitely isn't unmemorable. The characters are well-beloved (my favorites being Miracle Max and Valerie, the bishop, and Fezzik), and the actors were well-cast in their roles and also performed quite well. If you haven't read the book (by William Goldman) that this was adapted from, then read it. The movie is very similar to the book. In fact a lot of quotes in the movie are direct (or similar) to quite a few quotes in the book. Although there are very few differences, the book is just as exciting and witty as the movie.The costumes, makeup, and hairstyling were pretty good for a 1987 film. Props for Carol Kane and Billy Crystal's makeup and Buttercup's beautiful wedding dress.And props for Mark Knopler's music score as well. Aside from the action music, most of the score is sweet, poignant, and beautiful, especially the main theme. I'm glad that "Storybook Love" was up for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song because I would have selected it as one of the best that year as well.Overall, I know millions of people have seen this film (which makes it kind of a "cult film"), but if you haven't seen it, you definitely should. Great casting, memorable characters, a wonderful storyline, great music, and lots of comedy, fantasy, action, and romance all in one. Who could ask for more? I can easily see why so many people adore this movie. It really is a treasure.My Personal Oscar Picks for this movie:Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Song ("Storybook Love"), and possibly Best Original Score</fullReview>

I personally got a little bored with all the witty diatribe, sort of the way I felt after watching three episodes of Moonlighting with Bruce Willis's eternal cuteness. Too much of anything is not very good. This is a good movie with which to pass a pleasant rainy afternoon or even to watch with a first date, but it only masquerades as a classic and only then with the teen (or thereabouts) set. I liked the Inigo character, and Andre even did an acceptable job as an actor. But I felt no compassion for Robin Wright as the bride. And isn't that what the whole story was about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched the movie because someone mentioned to me that it was her favorite movie of all time....Umm...You got to be kidding (especially for the reviewer, "Mike," who watches this movie every 3 weeks!??....)....Okay, Robin Wright is beautiful (and respectable as an actress as seen from her performance in "Forrest Gump") and the movie has some funny one-liners here and there (nothing profoundly funny here though), but what's the fascination?The movie is basically a farce with a ridiculously simple plot, poor acting (I think the acting was supposed to add to the humor....okay wow), cheap senseless humor, and unbelievable special effects (uh, remember when the "Zorro" fights the "giant rats" that look exactly like short guys in a cheap rat suit?)....I guess that's supposed to be funny too....It is truly incredible to have people comment that this movie is one of the best movies ever made or that it's a great film...because it simply isn't. I can enjoy light comedies or fantasy movies from time to time, but it's not a good one even in that genre/category. It is not an awful movie to watch and it might be enjoyable, I guess, for (up to) lower elementary kids, but it no where near lives up to its hype or the majority of the reviews seen here. It is indeed a great insult to have a movie of this quality (I gave it a generous 4 out of 10) to have it ranked anywhere near movies such as "The Matrix," "The Gladiator," "Se7en," "Amadeus," "American History X," "Glory," and etc., etc., and etc. Not worth a rental if you ask me (unless you're renting it for the kids), and definitely does not deserve to be in the Top 250!.</fullReview>

The movie could've been done a lot better and still maintain the good storytelling. I also think that the director could've done a better job in making the viewer feel more with the characters - make the passion more passionate, the hate and lust for revenge more hateful and lusting.The only things convincing in the movie were: The main soundtrack, a sound that gave me buttterflies during the first commence of the two main characters, and thrills in the end. Truly deserving of the Oscar that year.The character of Miracle-MAX - hilarious, his sarcasm is a warm welcome."...and while you're at it why don't you go ahead and give a nice papercut and pour some lemonjuice on it" - best quote of the movie and made me laugh out loudAnd the first 6-7 minutes of the movie - brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>? and all of us fans thought : "Oh oh!" Would a 12 year old franchise and a Bruce Willis in his 50's hold up to its predecessors? So with a little tension (especially when pulling out my credit card to pay for the ticket) I wondered what this may bring. Well, I have to say that the story is not bad. The acting is good. The action is definitely there, probably more than in all the others and for it being a pg-13 film probably right at the edge. Bruce was fabulous and the whole plot was believable. I think they did a good job in continuing the seemingly never ending story of John McClane who for one reason or another ends up in an unlikely life situation for the fourth time in his life and dies as hard as a human possibly can. Action packed entertainment though and totally worthwhile seeing, if you like the type of film. All in all it did not disappoint, it held up to what it promised and I might go see it again, just because the thrill of being in a grand theatre brings the action more across than on a TV. I like the title because it is one of my mottos: Never give up, but rather die with honor (like a Klingon) trying to do what's right!</fullReview>

One extra chocolate on top are the comedy cameos. It is a great film that can encompass both Peter Cook doing a C of E parody and Billy Crystal doing his shtick, both so funny. I have found that this is a film that men and women both find funny and romantic. So often comedy sits awkwardly with romance, but in the Princess Bride they switch from one to the other seamlessly. The only bad thing about this film is that it's lines are so quotable you'll be using them out of context for weeks, or not, as you wish. (See?)</fullReview>

This isn't a Tom Cruise, Ben Afleck, Julia Roberts type film and that's one of the reasons for it's long lasting appeal. It's hard to imagine anyone other than André the Giant as the lovable Fessik. Arguably the most recognizable actor in the movie is Billy Crystal in a short but hilarious scene. Most people have already watched The Princess Bride, and it's hard to find anyone that doesn't like it. As a side note, this movie is the source of one of the most famous movie quotes of all time... "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." If you haven't seen The Princess Bride, do yourself a favor and pick it up at the first available opportunity.

		<fullReview>A kindly grandfather (the always delightful Peter Falk) reads a classic fairytale to his sickly grandson (likable Fred Savage). Dashing farmhand Westley (a fine and charismatic Cary Elwes) has to save beloved fair maiden Princess Buttercup (a sweet and radiant performance by the lovely Robin Wright) from the vile clutches of evil, cowardly Prince Humperdinck (a nicely slimy Chris Sarandon). Westley is assisted by vengeful Spanish master swordsman Inigo Montoya (marvelously played with lip-smacking gusto by Mandy Patinkin) and hulking, but friendly behemoth Fezzik (a supremely amiable turn by legendary wrestler Andre the Giant). Director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman deftly blend elements of comedy, romance, action and comedy into a charming and engaging whole that pokes warm and witty revisionist fun at the conventions of fairy tales in a winningly respectful and affectionate manner. The cast are all uniformly excellent in their colorful roles: Elwes and Wright make for extremely attractive and appealing leads, Patinkin has you rooting for his honorable vendetta all the way, Christopher Guest positively oozes smarmy malevolence as serenely wicked sadist Count Tyrone Rugen, Wallace Shawn is smug perfection as pompous sniveling intellectual toad Vizzini, plus there are terrific cameos by Billy Crystal as crotchety old magician Miracle Max, Carol Kane as his equally irascible wife Valerie, Mel Smith as an albino, and Peter Cook as a mush-mouthed clergyman. The gentle humor and pure, innocent, good-natured tone give this picture an extra irresistible kick. Best of all, there's a wonderfully uplifting and positive central message about the unbeatable power of true love. Kudos are also in order for Mark Knopfler's graceful, harmonic score and Adrian Biddle's golden, sparkling cinematography. A totally enchanting jewel.</fullReview>

To find his fortune over sea and his killed by pirates. Buttercup must now marry prince Humperdink (played by Chris Sarandon in my least favorite performance,) but days before the wedding she is captured by three me and later is saved by a man in black who turns out to be Westley.OK, I didn't like this movie, for one I am a huge Chris Sarandon fan, I loved him in Child's Play, Nightmare Before Christmas, even in Bordello of Blood, but his role in this never really had me going. Another performance was Fred Savage, although a minor role, it too didn't have me going either. The final thing, which really got me, was for being a Rob Reiner movie, some shots looked very cheap and very amateur. I am not going to deny it, I loved the scene with Billy Crystal, and it is the best film with a wrestler in it.</fullReview>

The admittedly eccentric cast struggles to evoke the fairy-tale quality inherent in the premise - with Wallace Shawn, Christopher Guest and Billy Crystal being the most successful at it - but, if the film was meant as a spoof, I'm sorry to say that it doesn't have much of a bite...especially since I can hardly remember anything about it a mere two days later!!</fullReview>

I had always had "snippets" of the movie come back to memory (like that lovely scene on the cliff) for some reason. So I decided to watch it again, almost 20 years later.This is an incredible film. A wild mix of comedy/fantasy/action/romance, the movie excels in all these levels. The cast is superb, and the one-liners and catchphrases will be stuck in your head. I for one will never forget Inigo Montoya! For something made in 1987, I was surprised to find out that this film was not dated at all (with the exception of the R.O.U.S.S - see the cold war pun?), and funny, well-paced and just memorable overall. No CG effects here to spoil the fun.It makes reference to a number of fairy tales, fantasy movies and swashbuckling, making fun of them all the way through. Things do not happen as expected. And the themes of honor, persistence and true love, things that have been long forgotten, are the highlights here. Robin Wright Penn looks just like a princess and Cary Elwes is incredible in this, showing his comedic timing as well as his acting abilities. All of the cast is great really.This is the perfect movie to watch if you're in a bad mood. As a kid, I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did today. And now I know why those scenes got stuck in my head, it's because this is one of the best fantasy movies I've ever seen.9 out of 10 cups of iocane powder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I have been watching since I was about 3 years old, until now and forever more. I love this movie, it has hilarious comedy in it, a great storyline, great quotes, and it's an amazing adaption from a book. I think everyone should watch this movie. There was an amazing job done by all the cast. There's great laughs from everyone, every time I watch this movie. Wallace Shawns performance in this was great. He was hilarious, witty, and just a flat out funny person. The character Miracle Max was just one of the best characters anyone has ever thought of. And the character "Westley" had so many great insults for the prince. Like "warthog faced buffoon" and "misrible vomitous mass" I just have to say, this is one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Rob Reiner (This Is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me, When Harry Met Sally) comes this curious bu charming and non-typecast fantasy adventure. Basically a Grandson (Austin Powers in Goldmember's Fred Savage) is at home sick in bed, and his Grandfather (Columbo's Peter Falk) has come over to visit him, and his present to him is a book, "The Princess Bride", which was read to him when he was the kid's age. The Grandfather reads (narrates) and we are taken into this world; the story of the love between the beautiful Buttercup (introducing Forrest Gump's Robin Wright Penn) and the besotted farm boy Westley (Saw's Cary Elwes), who before only ever said "As you wish" to her. They almost immediately expressed their love, oh, but the Grandson didn't want to hear about yucky kissing, anyway, their love was interrupted when Westley left and apparently died at sea, and Buttercup, heartbroken, swore never to love again. Soon enough though, she accepts the proposal of marriage from the rich and handsome, and somewhat unusual villain, Prince Humperdinck (Fright Night's Chris Sarandon). But death is no barrier for true love, and soon enough, a masked swordsmen (obviously Elwes) is having to face Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) the exotically-accented swordsmen, Fezzik (André the Giant) the big-hearted giant, Vizzini (Toy Story's Wallace Shawn) the genius kidnapper, and all the challenges of this world, e.g. swamps, rodents, etc. When Westley and Buttercup are eventually reunited they are now trying to escape the Prince and his need to marry. At some point Buttercup is taken again by the villains, and Westley is badly injured, and Inigo and Fezzik are now on his side, and taking him to Miracle Max, the Wizard (Billy Crystal) to help him. In the end, after a few fights and near-deaths, there is a happy ending, and the Grandson allows the Grandfather to mention the last "okay now" kissing. Also starring This Is Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest as Count Tyrone Rugen, Peter Cook as The Impressive Clergyman, Mel Smith as The Albino and Carol Kane as Valerie. This is a fantasy adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously, and even though it takes a few minutes to get into, it is a very likable family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Willy De Ville's "Storybook Love". It was number 46 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How did this mundane film possibly garner an 8.2 rating?! Because it introduced Robin Wright to us? Because it has an interesting cast? Because of a dashing young Mandy Patinkin, a personal favorite of mine? Or because of IMDb.com's biggest weakness: predilections of voters.... I'll chalk it up to all of the above. Nothing very original, no standout chemistry. All in all, a children's film, which is fine. Most original thing about it is the ensemble cast. Not much to compare it to, with Peter Falk, Andre the Giant, a pre-Wonder Years Fred Savage, Wallace (the buffoon) Shawn, Christopher Guest, Peter Cook... quite the cross-section!

		<fullReview>Being French,having spent more than 25 years in the USA and UK and mostly with my Brit girl,I can attest,that true love,even if not perfect,does exist...that movie? No smoke without fire...you must see it! It is a great comedy-romantic story but strangely,one the the most real feeling of love movie you can see. In these times of supposed to be amazing technologies and sciences,we now see that they have limits. Love? HAs some too but so higher. I lived and live romance thru my wife and am blessed to have two daughters. My point? If ever anybody does not believe in true romance,watch this movie and if your heart does get squeezed,if some tears come up somehow,then you know it is real and trust me it is. So,fun movie? sure True love story? sure. So,when you wish to remind yourself of what romance feels like via a story,see that movie. the soundtrack is amazing too because it wakes up in us that romance is not dead,far from it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and charming fantasy adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a far away kingdom there lived a fair maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and a young farm boy Westley (Cary Elwes), who were in love. But as Westley was a poor man, he decided to go to the seas in order to find his luck, but the unspeakable happened and he died, when a pirates attacked his ship. Years later the fair maiden Buttercup is to be marry the prince, the king to be, Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). And from this the true adventure begins.The story actually begins with a sick boy, who's visited by his grandfather, who wants to read him a book, which has ran in the family for ages. This little narration, made by Peter Falk as the grand father and Fred Savage as the grandson, gives nice, warm little story of its own to the overall adventuring.Other notable characters in the film are Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who's searching high and low for the man with 11 fingers, who murdered his father, and a friendly giant Fezzik (André the Giant), who is eager give out a helping hand."The Princess Bride" is well written and fun adventure movie, that flows forwards with ease not many films are capable of. All in all, it belongs amongst the best fantasy adventures made in the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie years back, the kind of humor that was used help the movie just stick in your mind forever. Its a fable who's characters seemingly know it's fable taste yet help move the plot along with great acting in a great script. It is a true classic that if you don't see it for an extended amount of time, seeing again is just as enjoyable as when you last saw it. Cynical yet exploring, taut yet entertaining humor, the script is spectacularly written and the characters that develop over the course of the movie fit together with seem-less ease and beautiful cinematography. I love this film and if you haven't seen it then it definitely, in my opinion, is a movie that you should make a priority to see as an essential 80's movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry for being honest, and no offense to the people who've chosen this movie to best their favorite ever made, but my friend and i watched this because we we're told it's beautiful and a classic. We were so bored by about half time, that we literally suffered through the rest of the movie, hoping for it to end in some kind of fruitful way. What a waste of time. P.S. Still i must say, we did both laugh twice. But i wouldn't want to spoiler. If you like love-stories watch s.th. like "eternal sunshine of the spotless mind". Like s.th. old &amp; classic try "Dead Poets' Society" or "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest".I'm pretty sad to not have found real fantasy. i guess i was hoping for s.th. like "sleeping beauty".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Princess Bride is something that is really special. It is well designed, well directed and well acted. Rob Reiner is a very good director indeed, directing films like Stand By Me and all that. The film itself is beautiful, with lovely sets and costumes, matched with a funny and touching script, not to mention quotable. The story was simple, but very well-developed, with a few surprises here and there. As for the acting, it is superb. Cary Elwes is a very charismatic lead as Westley, and Robin Wright gives a very spirited performance as Princess Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is a little annoying, but he has some delicious throw-away lines, so you warm to him, especially when Westley insults him at the end. Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant and Christopher Guest(who bares a mere resemblance to Tim Curry's Cardinal Richelieu) were very good too, as is an unrecognisable Billy Crystal. And Mandy Patinkin is deliciously hammy as the man who wishes to avenge his father's death by killing his six-fingered murderer. But what impressed me most were the funny interruptions with the grandfather(played wonderfully by Colombo's Peter Falk)and his sick grandson(Fred Savage). All in all, an original and funny movie that is a must see. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adore this movie. Fantasy without special effects is, I feel, something admirable.The love story is with no equal and Westley is the perfect heroic lover.I felt Buttercup did not deserve him but I'm a girl so that point can be disputable (although the part with the Battling Rodents of Unusual Size where she did absolutely nothing to help her love is really irritating).The rest of the cast is superb: Inigo Montoya is great and I ALWAYS laugh with Billy Crystal's "Miracle Max". I remember having seen this movie around the X-mas holidays at my grand-parent's when I was about 5. I desperately searched for it, remembering only the "Battle of Witts", a man in black and that I liked it very much. Finally, two years ago I found the title and the movie and all I can say it's really worth watching !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical Story, But Not Magical Movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing (William Goldman), the respectable screenwriter, ever did in this fairytale which he created was the way he told it. Look at the boy's room; it has all the details of consumerism around him. So when the grandfather comes with the book, it's one wicked invitation to read again in a cold, sick, and narrow world that has no reading, true knowledge, or moralities of heroism. We all live in this room, waiting for grandpa and his book to get us out. But while being a movie about the magic of the story, it didn't have any magic further than its story ! It's a little book of children; with no big budget, big stars, or big sets. In terms of "sets" in specific, according to some of them, like the Fire Swamp, I thought I was watching a fantasy-spoof ! In brief, it has very naive look. Some saw that as a loyalty to the simplicity of being a children book, not a typical Hollywood blockbuster; hence felt rare magic. And some saw that as simply poor; hence felt frustration (I'm one of the second team !).Director (Rob Reiner) tried to master grand aesthetic cadres and tough swords' duels, evoking all the innocent ventures for the kid in us. Though, there was some slackness, as if (Reiner) was making an old swashbuckler movie, and by its technique too ! Sometimes I felt the inactivity of the postal cards more than the vitality of the fantasy adventure. It left its powerful marks on the sequence of breaking into the palace near the end.And let's not forget the movie's top problem (Cary Elwes). His charisma isn't radiant, his performance is so frigid to an extent that makes you fidget, and generally he was something between Errol Flynn's look-alike and Errol Flynn's parody ! Actually, considering (Elwes)'s weakness, putting him in the shadow of Flynn's character in (The Adventures of Robin Hood - 1938) was an ugly irony that enfeebled the whole thing. His first 3 scenes were the last good effort he did here ! Although (Mark Knopfler)'s (Storybook Love) at the closing credits almost defined the finale's romantic dreamy song in the movies from the 1980s till now, but his music score for the movie was evident shortcoming. It's a standard soundtrack for a school play or a home-made movie. Well, the insistence of this movie to be poor is just weird. The only logical explanation is that they mistook poorness for innocence ! I didn't like the climax. It was so rapid, and the real hero of it was (Mandy Patinkin) as (Inigo Montoya), whereas (Westley) triumphs just by the power of being weasel. Maybe (Goldman) wanted to assure the ability of the word as well as the illusion, just like the ability of the grandfather, as the storyteller, through the story itself. Yet wrapping it up like that was betrayal to the entire legacy of tales we heard, and movies we watched; where climax must be hot, thrilling, and satisfying. Otherwise, why they call it "climactic" for god's sake ?!!On the bright side, (Reiner) led his cast rightly, achieving tangible wittiness. (Robin Wright Penn) is the princess bride in person; a clever image that jumped from one good old fairytale. She looked, especially when it comes to her voice, like one of Disney's classic cartoon heroines, yet with unique tenderness and vibrant beauty. However her acting lacked marked personality. (André the Giant) was perfect as live cartoon character; (Fezzik) was his most lovable role, and perhaps his greatest ever. (Billy Crystal) and (Carol Kane) were so funny, I didn't recognize (Crystal) at first sight, but his signature voice, way of talking, and shortness uncovered him. Clearly he was enjoying himself to the utmost through (Miracle Max). (Peter Falk) is priceless, makes me sad why he didn't get more roles as genius as him after (Lt. Columbo) ?! The 1980s had festive banquet of fantasies such as (Time Bandits - 1981), (The Flight of Dragons - 1982), (Krull - 1983), (Ladyhawke - 1985), or (Willow - 1988). They were innocent dreams, and lacking the 2000s crazy budgets, hyped CGIs, and endless sequels, makes them even more innocent for today's viewer. But while (The Princess Bride) is innocent, it is also poor. It's a case of a movie where the script is its highest element.So when the kid in the end asks his grandfather to read it all again, and the grandfather replays enchantingly : "As you wish"; it's the real substance of this movie. It is author (William Goldman)'s homage to the story as the authentic magic. So disappointing that that meaning didn't have some cinematic magic to support it !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic story unlike any other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is very unconventional because this story is not like all of the others; it's clever, tells a great non-clichéd story--unless you tend to disagree--and the cast does an awesome job. Oh, Westley and Buttercup were meant to be together.It starts out with a kid playing his video game--so retro--and his mom comes in and tells him that his grandfather is there to talk to him. He pinches his cheek, like always. This time his grandfather brings a story. The kid is reluctant at first, but eventually gives in. And thus begins the story within the story of "The Princess Bride: by S. Morgenstern." I think that's his name, but I'm not sure. We begin in the land of Floren, and our main characters, Buttercup and Westley, who she calls Farmboy. You know, Robin Wright (Penn) and Cary Elwes look really good together. Westley has mostly said "As you wish" to Buttercup when she asked him to do something. The grandfather continues by saying that when Westley said "As you wish," what he meant was "I love you." Isn't that nice? When Westley leaves, Buttercup gets told that he got kidnapped by the "dread pirate Roberts" and killed. To this the kid says, "Murdered by pirates is good." Buttercup went to her room and says, "I will never love again." You see through the movie she means it.5 years after that, she becomes betrothed to the prince Humperdinck--it's so stupid--and she's not very happy. When she goes out for a ride, 3 of the best characters ever show up: Vizzini, Inigo Montoya, and Fezzik (Andre the Giant) who kidnap her. Right off the bat, they're funny. Vizzini is the leader, who loves to say, "Inconceivable!" whenever he gets the chance to. Inigo is a Spaniard spending his life trying to find the man with 6 fingers on his right hand to avenge his father. Fezzik is a misunderstood giant who was unemployed in Greenland. Odd, eh? Weirdest trio ever, yet I wouldn't have it any other way.Alright, I won't say more, but I must beware you of the Fire Swamp, lightning sand, and of course, ROUS's. Great film to watch, and something a little different from the rest of them. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Princess Bride" is a well-written and acted genre picture. Unfortunately, it's hampered by some significant production problems that keep it from becoming a truly great movie. Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable flick, but I had some small problems that really could have been fixed.First off, the princess' name is Buttercup. Who names their daughter Buttercup? I kept thinking they were talking about a horse when they mention her name. I suppose that if the other names were as bizarre it might have worked, but her love is named Wesley. Wesley and Buttercup? I don't think so.Second, the wonderful fight scene between Inigo and Wesley is done on a very cheap looking set, complete with fake boulders, gym mats and parallel bars. Almost every other scene is done outside in gorgeous fields, or in far more believable sets. The most exciting scene in the film is on the ugliest set. Very distracting.Third, the music for this movie is absolutely dreadful. Loud, obnoxious, full of fake synthesized instruments instead of the real thing, it sounds more fitting for a "Naked Gun" retread of the Princess Bride than the actual film itself. A new score would help the film immensley.I know I sound negative, but this is really only disappointment speaking. The film is charming, filled with wonderful dialogue, delivered with flair by stars Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin. I recommend it, but I can't help think this movie could have been perfect. Oh well, close but not quite the whole cigar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buttercup is madly in love with the farmboy Westley, but soon after her love blossoms he is captured and killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Picked by the prince to be her bride, she is rescued from ruffians by the pirate who killed her love. Will true love prevail in this tale of romance, action, adventure and more? Like many films, "The Princess Bride" isn't one i really have to praise. If you don't already love it, you have a friend who will swear up and down that it's one of the most amazing films ever. So you don't need me to convince you. In fact, you've probably already seen it and I'm surprised if you haven't. (Although, the reason for this review is that I was able to recently show my girlfriend the film for the first time, so some of you may have missed out.) As my introduction says, this is a film of romance, action and adventure. I left out comedy. The film has a lot of great one-liners and quotable jokes you'll treasure for a lifetime. Author William Goldman is incredible -- read the novel and you'll see the humor jump off the page -- and the director, Rob Reiner, perfected it for the screen. Of course, if you've seen "This is Spinal Tap", you already knew how great Reiner was with comedy.Cary Elwes, one of my favorite actors, is great in the leading role (very similar to his role in "Robin Hood: Men in Tights"). Robin Wright does an adequate job as Buttercup. And then the supporting cast is just some of the best in the business: Fred Savage, Peter Falk, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, Wallace Shawn, Chris Sarandon (who came off as sort of a jerk in person, but is a solid actor). I could do without Billy Crystal, but someone probably appreciated him.Again, you've probably seen this or have someone you know pushing it. I, too, would push it. I don't know why you're reading reviews for this film. If you're looking for people's thoughts, I'm sure they're overwhelmingly positive. I won't deviate from those people. From the six-fingered man, to the albino, to ROUSes... I love this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Princess Bride is one of a kind. The basic plot outline makes it sound like a fairy tale for children- a stableboy and a wealthy girl fall in love, the boy is kidnapped and presumed killed, only to return to save her from marrying an evil prince, blah, blah, blah. Please excuse me if I ruined the plot for you, but this movie is not about the plot. After all, it follows a formula seen a million times; what separates The Princess Bride from others like it is the way it goes about its business. The Princess Bride doesn't simply tell a nice story; it creates some of the most hilarious characters and scenes ever seen on the big screen.Cary Elwes is the stableboy Westley, who falls for the beautiful Buttercup (that's right, Buttercup- played by Robin Wright Penn), but he is kidnapped by the Dread Pirate Roberts. She eventually gets engaged to the conniving Prince Humperdinck but never stops loving Westley. True love conquers all when Westley miraculously returns and defeats a swordsman, a giant, and a genius before re-teaming up with Buttercup.The Princess Bride is, simply put, one of the funniest and most brilliant movies I've ever seen. Mandy Patinkin is utterly phenomenal as Inigo Montoya, a man who only wants to avenge his father's murder at the hands of a six-fingered man. Andre the Giant also has a hilarious turn as Fezzik, an enormous oaf whose heart is as big as his muscles.You know how this movie is going to end before you even watch it (I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't figured it out). But the ending isn't what matters. It's the journey that gets you there that does. And what a journey it is. The Princess Bride has more memorable quotes and unforgettable scenes than perhaps any other movie ever made. After over fifteen viewings, I haven't even grown close to tiring of it. You've never seen a fairy tale quite like The Princess Bride; this film is a must-rent and should be a must-own. It just doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you jump on my head about the title of my comment, please hear me out. I definitely do not think The Princess Bride is a bad film, per se. I have heard it called all sorts of things, from a timeless classic to a great fantasy romp for all ages. Neither of those things are quite true. The film is as dated as most of the Nightmare On Elm Street episodes (especially the Clown Freddy ones). It also falls into the trap of trying to appeal to everyone, and as a result limiting its audience more than it otherwise would. But what it lacks in classic status, it (almost) makes up for in some other areas. On one hand, I can see why I was so reluctant to see the film when it was recommended to me around ten years ago. It was, after all, released in the same year as the holy chunk of awesome that is RoboCop. On the other hand, I can see why it was recommended to me on two occasions that span over a decade apart. I won't put this in my list of favourite films, but I admire it for its uniqueness among the fodder that was made in the same year.I will get the negatives out of the way, since they are the smaller part of this comment. The extraneous storyline involving Peter Falk playing a grandfather who reads this tale to his grandson, played with impeccable irritation by a very young Fred Savage, was utterly unnecessary. They get in the way of the story rather than enhancing it, especially when the action is interrupted to make some comment or to beat us over the head with how universal the story supposedly is. The characters are about as deep as a puddle, and we get no sense of why Westley loves Buttercup (or vice versa) so dearly. None of what passes for motivation or character development here is shown to us, it is all told. Some of the locations shown in the film have names so daft it will make your eye muscles twitch. Yes, there were names with a daft factor in adventure films like The Goonies (a far better children's adventure film in spite of what the IMDb would have you believe), but The Goonies succeeded in making the audience not notice (or care).Now that the problems are out of the way, let's concentrate for a moment of the film's strengths. Mandy Patinkin would have been a far better choice for the focal point of the story, as he runs with the campiness of the story at a speed that would impress Olympic champions. Christopher Guest portrays Patinkin's nemesis with a grace and, dare I say it, subtlety that could have worked wonders if it had transferred to the rest of the film. Robin Wright does the best she can with a very unidimensional role. She is mainly there to tell off the villain or beg for the hero's aid. The real jewel of the cast here is André the Giant, one of showbusiness' true well... gentle giants. As he is making comedy based around his knowledge of how big he is, the softer side of him that realises he is not in the best of health even for a forty-one year old shines through every time he delivers a line. Granted, one can only understand half of what he says at best. But of all the performers in the film, André is the one that will be remembered long after the rest have been forgotten.Some of the trick shots or effects sequences are lousy. The shrieking eels sequence was obviously meant to induce tension in the target audience, but even in five year olds, if the manner in which it is set up doesn't induce laughs or groans, the eels themselves surely will. Others, however, are very well-realised, and work well enough to make the film watchable. When André the Giant carries his castmates up the face of a cliff, one does not see whether it is just trick photography or a set, but it suspends disbelief enough to leave one in awe of the character. I don't know why the IMDb lists the stunt rider of André in the final ride-away scene as being obvious. Maybe I am not as cynical or jaded as I would like to believe, but this shot sold itself well enough that I could feel sorry for the horse. This, friends and neighbours, is a sign of a well-made film.In summation, The Princess Bride is a lot better than I thought it would be, but it is nowhere near as good as many make out. For fantasy adventures, I am far more inclined to recommend The Goonies, which is far more realistic in the sense of being less normalistic than is the case here. Nonetheless, if you have already seen The Goonies, then The Princess Bride is worth a look. I gave it a seven out of ten. Of the hundreds of DVDs I have around me, it is far from the last I would watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in 1993 as the film study part of our 10th grade English course. I liked it at the time, but not overly so. But movies have something taken out of them when you have to watch it with the means of studying it.I know it is spoke highly of, so I decided to rent it to watch it again since I love fairy tales and satire and am much more of a movie buff than I was at 15.I have to say, while I was entertained throughout, I still feel, after 13 years, much the same as I did then. Often my opinions change after so much time, but not in this case. It had its funny moments, but I just felt like it wasn't quite there. There were funny parts about it, but it wasn't consistent. Buttercup had no humorous aspect whatsoever which made the mood confusing. It isn't as though I can't appreciate subtlety, but I felt that after some comical scenes with Westly and Inigo, the characters didn't remain funny. It seemed indecisive with humour in spurts so that otherwise serious people would occasionally make funny remarks.I think my overall feeling is that I don't feel pulled towards having watched a comedy or a magical fairy tale. I feel a little lost. I think it's not as funny as it was supposed to be. It wasn't full of jokes that didn't work. The ones they had were good. There just weren't that many jokes to begin with. If Buttercup had been more of an airhead as she was supposed to be in the book, it might have opened the door for more humour.I still enjoyed the film, but I feel it fell short of what it was intended to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoever wrote the script for this garbage should be flogged without mercy. This is one of the most boring films I have ever watched, plus, it made absolutely no sense. The 'acting' was heavy handed and hammy; there was enough corn in this turkey to plant a new crop in 3 Indiana counties.

		<fullReview>Let's face it. Rob Reiner is not Mel Brooks. (Perhaps both of them are glad of that...) I watched this film on the recommendation of several people whose intelligence I had hitherto respected, but was, alas, disappointed. My first reaction to the whole thing as "this film is unremittingly silly!" Andre the Giant is no Alex Karras/Mongo. "Max the Miracle Man" who brings people back from the dead? A woman who thinks she's been married without having agreed to it by saying "I do"? A hero who has to be dragged to climactic action because he's "mostly dead"? This film gives new definition to the term "willing suspension of disbelief." My biggest worry now is that friends who have become fans of this thing will trot it out and force me to watch it again. I will not be saying "As you wish."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated and Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the true wonders of cinema: Why is it so loved?I'm all for fantasy movies, and I have no problems with comedy and romance, but "The Princess Bride" is slow, cumbersome and tedious. Loaded with long-winded scenes, I found myself laughing in only two spots (the old woman and "the wine" scene). Otherwise, the laughs were non-existent.Worst still, there were no surprises and the conflict lacked intensity.The movie put me to sleep and I had to rewatch the disappointing ending.This could have a great film, but it was slow and lackluster. My only question is why didn't Elwes truly make it as a leading man? He's intelligent, handsome and can act in any genre, but just like Peter Weller, things didn't pan out as they should have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Princess Bride OKish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The princess bride ushers you into a mystical world of giants, pirates, and castles. This 1987 fairytale spoof has all the right intentions, like the story being read from grandfather to grandson it seems like it would be a nice way to just relax on a lazy day, or a day when you are sick. it's a harmless film but lacked something for me.Rob Reiner (This Is Spinal Tap) directed this film which is based on the novel of the same name by William Goldman who as well wrote the screenplay. The story begins with a sick child (Fred Savage) being read a fairytale by his grandfather (Peter Falk). Quickly we are whisked away as well with the grandson who at first is dreading the fairytale story. The story introduces us too Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and Westley (Carey Elwes) a couple who are madly in love. Immediately we are told that Westley must leave Buttercup for no apparent reason. Quickly Buttercup is kidnapped by three pirate like men, Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), and Fezzik (André The Giant). It seems like they are being followed by a Zorro-esquire character which quickly eliminates one of the kidnappers one at a time. It quickly becomes repetitive but that's not the least of the problems here. 'Zorro' quickly makes it through the kidnappers using swords, poison, and his own hands. Later on the princess is endangered by the prince of her land who plans a marriage.One of the major problems to me with the film is the continuation of certain aspects. An example of which was when the kidnappers and the princess make it up the mountain cliff by climbing, after they move on the prince somehow managed to reach the top of the mountain with the rest of his crew which includes a large number of horses. The props at times seem fake but mostly are average, the acting is OK, but the laughs just don't come. The movie sets out to spoof fairy tale movies and do, in some ways, succeed, but rarely did I laugh out loud when a joke was delivered, and in some ways these moments don't even spoof or satirize this classification of films. The film has its moments, I thought the poison scene was clever at best, but overall I was displeased with this film. If I was recommending a spoof of these types of films I would much rather recommend the 'Shrek' movies. I truly dreaded this film experience around 5 minutes in when we were jumped around making me feel overwhelmed and rushed, overall it was a unique experience which I do not think I will revisit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of an Ugly Bridesmaid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laughably sorry picture that has strangely become a favorite with many film-goers. "The Princess Bride" is a fantastical mess that is so short on direction, characterization, script and technology that it tries to win its audience over with confusion and incoherence. Obviously many have taken the bait wholeheartedly. An elderly man (Peter Falk) reads a fairy tale to his brat of a grandson (the always terrible Fred Savage). In the tale, our hero Cary Elwes tries to rescue the beautiful maiden (Robin Wright) from all sorts of bad guys (led primarily by Chris Sarandon) with whacked results. Cameos abound, dated visual effects and a script that combines every cliché from the genre make "The Princess Bride" one of those pictures you should ignore, in spite of what the overwhelming majority of the general public thinks. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hated the Princess Bride. It is a sexist pile of garbage.. Of course the woman in the movie should wait for years in vacuous idiocy for her "True Love" to rescue her instead of actually doing anything. And when it's revealed that her "True Love" is still alive the only action she takes is attempted suicide. Very good roll model for young women. I guess it takes a woman who can actually take care of herself instead of waiting for Prince Charming to get this. I can't tell you how anti female this movie is. If you think women are just window dressing for male revenge and hero fantasies this is the flick for you. If you think women can actually think and act for themselves and not sit around forever to wait to be rescued, give this a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rented this one just to laugh at how movie-makers in the 80's and 90's fancied fairyland to look like. I figured we would see ridiculous elves, trolls, magical kingdoms, talking-animals, etc. Then I figured I was gonna write a review here talking about how wrong they were, and recommend it just for a laugh.Here's how it really went: I popped it in the player and to my surprise it just looked like a fake documentary about monkeys with a couple of guys in really fake looking monkey costumes. Kind of like PLANET OF THE APES. 5 minutes in: Still monkeys 10 minutes in I asked myself "How are they going to stretch this out for a whole stupid-movie?!" I will never know. Because when a monkey becomes engaged to Prince "Humperdick", the heir to the throne who cares mainly about his love of the hunt and fighting, I was done with this garbage. Who on earth would predict the fairyland would be like that!? I returned it shortly after that and rented Mortal-Kombat 2 which was way more realistic with better fighting. In conclusion, you would be much better-off renting a documentary about apes, or even GORILLAS IN THE MIST, or maybe SHERK, which this movie is trying to be. AVOID!! Effete pseudo-intellectuals, who pretend otherwise, do not fool the rest of us who see the Emperor au naturel.</fullReview>

I went up and down the user comments and can only conclude that I must have seen the wrong movie. Sure, there were cute and funny bits along the way but for the most part this was purely for little kids. I was honestly embarrassed during almost the whole thing. This movie couldn't really decide whether it was a farcical comedy, an adventure story or a medieval saga. The only thing I felt when Peter Falk put away the book was relief that it was over and so was the awkwardness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't normally write reviews, but felt compelled to after watching this. I watched this with my g/f last night. I'm working my way through most of top films at the moment and was looking forward to it after its 8.1 rating from over 100,000 people. I'm also a big fan of the fantasy genre.Well, all I can say is this was just abysmal. Not a patch on films such as Neverending story or Willow. As others have suggested I can only imagine the high rating due to kids have fond memories of this from their child hood.Not remotely funny, at least not intentionally. The only part that had me and my g/f laughing was the part where they encounter the rats. They looked so bad it was amusing. The best part was when one leaped at the main character. It looked like someone in the studio had simply picked up the rat and thrown it at him(can't even remember his name).Luckily I fell asleep about 50 mins and my g/f had the decency not to wake me up. She assured me I didn't miss anything.If you're over 15 and watching this for the 1st time expect to be disappointed. The film hasn't aged at all well, the effects are really terrible, the small villain has to be one of the most annoying characters I've ever witnessed. Looks like they had a budget of ?20.Even Army of Darkness was marginally better than this and I thought that was terrible and not at all funny either. Receives a 2, rather than a 1 thanks to the rat scene making us both laugh hard for 30 seconds or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally A Fun Film, So No Reason For Religious Cheap Shots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's another movie I just loved the first time I saw it, but it went downhill with subsequent viewing. That's not knocking the film overall, because it is entertaining. The dialog is funny throughout most of it and the scenery is beautiful. It's a nice-looking disc which enhances the interesting visuals. The Spaniard, played by Mandy Patinkin, was the most interesting character, I thought, along with Wallace Shawn (the short, bald-headed guy). However, "Inigo Montoya's" (Patinkin) whole life was centered on revenge, a poor message to give all the kids who watched this film. Robin Wright made her film debut and looked extremely pretty.Speaking of poor messages, I didn't think the cheap shot given the clergy-figure, dressed up like the Pope, was appropriate. Of course, being a Rob Reiner film, it's no surprise the extreme left-winger would put that in the film. At the ending credits, the reverend is sarcastically labeled "The Impressive Clergyman." Also, hearing young Fred Savage utter the Lord's name in vain was not necessary, even if it was in the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Princess Bride' is a fantasy film about a man who goes to rescue a kidnapped princess that he has fallen in love with. The main problem that I had with this film is the production; the monsters and fights did not look realistic, and the romance was silly and awkward in places. The production of this film could have been much better. As a story, I think that the film succeeded. The way that it was presented as a tale from the grandfather to the boy also put it into perspective, but the production made it seem like an unprofessional film, and I did have trouble taking it seriously. As this film is generally well-liked by a wide audience, I would recommend it. Just try to not let the production put you off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ancient formulas creatively mix with new elements. In particular, the humor is wonderfully tasteful. Overall, this is a darn good movie; I could go on for hours about it.Unfortunately, it's tainted with a some rather disturbing elements. The movie closes out with a tasteless 80's-style love song. (Viewers of "The Hobbit" know that adopting music popular to an era is the surest way to kill a classic soundtrack.) Also, the sexism is disturbing. Buttercup, complete with the cheesy name, can be forgiven as the typical "bait chick". After all, as bait chicks go, she does have a few redeeming qualities and some individuality. However, even with her excluded and the time period considered, the cast is disturbingly male-dominated.These offenses are not coincidental and hence inexcusable, but they shouldn't deter anyone from enjoying the film. It's just worth lamenting that this movie, as good as it is, could have been so much more.</fullReview>

You put a cheesy romantic love story in the middle of a medieval forest and stick a few funny one-liners in there, and suddenly you've got a classic? I don't buy it. I don't think this movie is terrible like I thought Titanic was, but I don't think it was all that great either. I actually found it rather boring, the special effects lame, and the love story unbelievable. But as usual, people buy into this kind of thing, especially teenage girls. I'm just thankful that there are people around with sense who don't buy into every bit of syrupy sappy love stories Hollywood serves up. I give the movie about a 6 out of 10. I might have given it a seven, but the fact that it is in the top 100 of all times made me feel otherwise. Watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail for some great comedy, but only watch this if you are drawn in by sappy syrupy love stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The princess bride is to fantasy is as Chucky is to horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin there are a few times I will make comments as to certain parts of the story and specific details but I do not reveal any critical points in the story. To start the story itself is horrible. I admit it has a few good characters, I enjoyed the spainard. The first time I saw it it was easy to tell what would be happening 10 minutes ahead. The simplicity of it all was dumbfounding. The story is nothing more than cliche. Several people I know seem to like it some how in one way or another, something I dont seem to understand. The acting I found to be subpar but acceptable given the roles. Andre the Giant, as he has become known as, fit the role of his character very well from a physicly ominious standpoint, but his poor diction detracted from the moment most any time that he spoke. The Vizzini character was utterly annoying through and through. As for Cary Elwes, his performance I felt was decent given the seemingly two dimensional persona that the script gave him to work with. Something that really got on my nerves was how that it was chosen to retain the annoyence from the book of using that horrible acronym: ROUS. Rodents Of Unusual Size. Its one thing to include a rodent as an enemy but its quite another thing in the way they handles the scene with the rodents. When Elwes's character was attacked by one of these "rous"s he was even pinned down by this animal half his size. To me this was a horrible way to handle it. It reminded me much of chucky *shudders* (now THAT was a horrible movie) where a childs doll somehow had the weight and strength to pin down grown people. The physics of it just dont make any sense. My ultimate opinion is this. As a satire, mocking the fantasy genre, it was a masterpiece of its time. As a fantasy (which is what its listed as for some reason), it was an abomination and a slap in the face to the rest of the genre in my opinion. I cant quite put my finger on a specific of why i loathe it so much, but to sit and watch it makes me sick.Would i Reccomend this movie? If you havent seen it: yes. I have heard enough good things from other people that odds are you may enjoy it too, so you might as well struggle through it once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For an adult, this movie is way too bland and tasteless. There are only two relatively snappy and enjoyable scenes (the poison duel and the fight of Inigo and Westley). Most of the rest of the movie is simply uninteresting. The good characters are too characterless, and the villains are too unconvincing (perhaps with the single exception of Vizzini). The plot is soapy and overstretched. The props are cheap looking.Now, you might say, this can be said of a lot of other movies too. Why 1/10? Because for its target audience - kids - the movie is not simply average. It's outright disgusting. The torture scene alone is enough to get this movie banned from my family video library. It's so senselessly, meaninglessly cruel that I couldn't watch it myself, let alone show to my kids. The sick obsession with bloody vengeance ("Prepare to die! Prepare to die! Prepare to die! Prepare to die!" ad infinitum) is immoral almost to the point of absurdity. The entire movie is just a painful, endless gallery of people (both "good" and "bad") beating and killing other people by various means. There's no beauty or catharsis in any of this. Just blood.And you say this is a "family classic"? Are you serious? Now, British cinema seems to always have had a certain feel for cruelty, but when Monthy Python does it, it's at least funny. Here, it's not funny at all. It's just plain ugly.I'm having serious difficulty trying to imagine a normal sane person who can watch this movie without skipping... let alone _enjoy_ it.</fullReview>
