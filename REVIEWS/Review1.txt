		<shortDescription>Becoming A Mensch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ohhh - after my 4th or 5th viewing, I think this may be one of the most remarkable blends of comedy and drama to have ever been filmed - THE APARTMENT - in subtle ways - rises well above the conventions of any genre. It was my introduction to the great Billy Wilder, and my fondness for Jack Lemmon (a remarkable and sorely missed actor) begins here as well.*SOME SPOILERS* The cold take on the sex-and-money ethos to be found in many corporate environments hasn't dated one bit; it could be argued that THE APARTMENT stands a bit ahead of its' time in the depiction of (what would appear to be) educated employees treated like (and feeling like) tools to be used in generation of someone else's income. Lemmon's character never forgets that he's disposable, even if the optimist in him hopes that something better may be found in his superiors. Deep down he knows this to be a pipe dream - the sexual adventurism of those same superiors betrays their utter lack of ethics. Of course, Lemmon's character isn't entirely above it all; he's been more than willing to hire out his own apartment as a place for his colleagues' peccadilloes, in exchange for career advancement, which of course - as Wilder early on links amoral sexual conduct and professional/corporate/financial misconduct in a greater social critique - gets him into trouble.The dialogue is - as is always true with Wilder - very finely crafted, yet seems natural - this film is a remarkable display of the kind of reactions any of us would offer in similar situations. Interestingly, our two protagonists are also wonderfully imperfect as human beings - Lemmon and MacLaine bear some responsibility for the very serious situations they've gotten themselves into; they manage to realize this ("Be a mensch!" Lemmon's doctor neighbor exclaims) just in time to set things right. MacLaine in particular delivers a remarkable, complex performance - sweet and smart in her earliest scenes, bleak and emotionally ravaged in her climactic scene with MacMurray, naive elsewhere, sharp but hopeful at the end. The cinematography captures the entire cast beautifully - with minimal movement, abundant long takes, and a sleek lack of visual clutter, all of the principals are free to reveal their own best and worst impulses, within an environment that is stripped of artifice. The end result is a film filled with great moments one can easily identify with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful way to spend an evening--dinner, Christmas and New Year's with CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon) and 'friends', accompanied by much champagne and laughter, and spaghetti and meatballs lovingly prepared by the host himself. There's even a game of gin rummy to get into that Baxter and Fran can't ever seem to finish--here's hoping it never does!THE APARTMENT is one of those truly classic classic movies--for one thing, it has an absolutely top-notch cast, featuring Jack Lemmon (at his wryly humourous best); Shirley MacLaine (a glowing screen presence); Fred MacMurray (smarm personified); and a younger Ray Walston (still wisecracking, still hilarious). They also benefit from a clever, perceptive and timelessly relevant script by Billy Wilder, under his capable direction. Though there are plenty of brilliant one-liners, the best of the dialogue feels true and real, which adds to the feeling that you've known Baxter et al for years. I loved the score to the movie as well, artfully attributed to the Rickshaw Boys and used to great effect.There are so many good moments scattered throughout the film (I can't even begin to enumerate them all here!). A lot of them are little touches that must have been added by the actors themselves (Jack Lemmon humming as he prepares the meatball sauce is just *so* funny!). I love the madness of the Christmas party scene, and when Baxter's doctor-neighbour takes charge of the situation with Fran, slapping her awake and marching her around the living room. I also love it when Baxter first starts playing gin rummy with Fran, and she reveals how she has a talent for falling for the wrong guy all the time. Best of all, Lemmon makes such a believable, sweet pushover that you often want to shake him and hug him at the same time--the things he would do for Fran! It makes his final scene with MacMurray that much more satisfying for the audience.If you see this gem of a movie on a video store shelf, or (even better) playing in the cinema, don't let it pass you by. Join Baxter, Fran, Mr. Sheldrake and everyone else, and have a great time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare gem, this is a blessedly adult comedy with great performances, great writing and the kind of depth hardly ever seen in the more vapid, formulaic romantic comedies of today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by the great filmmaker Billy Wilder, this is a serious, sardonic comedy for people who've known what's its like to feel the pressure of compromising your principles or your self- respect for the sake of getting ahead in life. And there are very few over the age of consent who haven't had to at one time or another. This isn't the laugh out loud comedy of Jim Carrey or the Farrelly brothers, but a subtle, nuanced comedy about two people who have both been jaded in love and yet continue to hope again and again that it will someday work out for them -- mainly because despite the unlikeable things they do, they are both basically decent, nice people. Flawed and even weak at times, but good people. This is a movie that doesn't just make it you laugh, it makes you think. A rare find indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Like it Dark - Wilder and Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder knew how to make a great movie. Of course it helps to have one of the greatest all-time actors, Jack Lemon, play in your movies, but Lemon aside, Wilder was a genius. His gift for the comedic moment showed brilliantly on screen and reached deep inside the audience.The Apartment, the last of the great Black and White films, showed a bit darker side to comedy than some of his other romps such as the hilarious Some Like It Hot. Some Like It Hot is just as funny today as it was in 1959. It is pure fun. At no point in the film are we approached with anything that we would take seriously. Let's face it, most of us are not running from the mob disguised as a member from the opposite sex.The Apartment, however, brings up much more human themes and issues. Wilder is an expert and at no time does he leave you worried that it will turn out badly. This is, after all, a comedy. One mistake in the script and the movie could quickly become a deep film about suicide, loneliness, and peer pressure, but Wilder balances the subjects on the edge of a knife and allows us to smile at what could otherwise be a very depressing movie.Wilder and his films like The Apartment are very similar to Shakespeare's comedies. It can be said that the difference between a Shakespeare comedy and tragedy is often not the story, but the ending. In a comedy, everyone is married; in a tragedy, everyone dies. the same is true with The Apartment, it all hinges on the outcomes. If Kubelik dies or Baxter is left alone, the movie would be a tragedy. But since they prevail in the end, the movie comes off as a great comedic success, albeit a bit dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first time I saw The Apartment, I admired it so much and placed it in my favorite movies list. After watching it a second time on widescreen and digitally remastered DVD, my love for it just deepened. I was once again touched by Shirley MacLaine's portrayal of Miss Kubelik, a lovely but unlucky in love woman. I also laughed again at Jack Lemmon's perfect delivery of one-liners and other mannerisms. Billy Wilder made The Apartment right after the huge success of his last film, Some Like It Hot, also with Jack Lemmon. The Apartment is not as funny, but it is more accomplished and deeper in meaning. Watching it in widescreen made me appreciate more the complexity of the story. Widescreen shots of C.C. Baxter's (Lemmon) apartment shows emptiness and loneliness. The shot of Baxter's office, which has employees in desks that seem to extend into eternity, shows that Baxter is just a faceless man in a populated world. C.C. Baxter is an ambitious employee in an insurance company. He tries to work himself to a promotion by allowing his philandering bosses to use his apartment as a perfect hideaway. As an exchange for the use of his apartment, his bosses put him in the top ten of the efficiency reports. After getting a promotion and successfully asking the elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) on a date, everything was going well for Baxter. Until he finds out that Miss Kubelik is the mistress of his big boss J.D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).Miss Kubelik and Sheldrake had a summer affair and Sheldrake wants Kubelik back admitting that he still loves her. Showing vulnerability, she agrees to get back together and ends up using Baxter's apartment twice a week. Naturally there will be problems. Sheldrake could not break up his marriage, and Kubelik does not like how the relationship is going but couldn't help being in love with him. Kubelik summed it up when she said `when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.'For Baxter, things couldn't be more complex. He wants to keep getting promotions but he might lose Kubelik in the process. He adores Kubelik but he doesn't want to be unemployed. Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script couldn't have been better written. It ranks up there with the likes of great scripts of Casablanca and Citizen Kane. They filled it with small intricate details and such funny lines. The Apartment is very ingenious and inspirational. When I wasn't laughing, I was smiling. Billy Wilder perfected the style of satirical filmmaking. In The Apartment, he touches a lot of subjects. The movie deals with adultery, suicide, loneliness, and corporate cutthroats. The movie won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but surprisingly, no acting Oscars. I have seen many romantic comedies, and while many are good, most of them do not have the same heart and warmth as The Apartment. It is in my list of top ten favorite movies because it entertained me, inspired me, and showed me how to live? human-wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likewise, it's a love-fest Lemmon-wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest examples of smart, satiric comedy-drama ever created for the screen. Jack Lemmon (in amazing comic form) plays a working stiff in Corporate America--via New York City--whose bachelor apartment inadvertently becomes a love-nest for amorous, married executives. The film is extremely modern for 1960 and features a non-stop barrage of funny, clever talk. Lemmon is a mad genius at frenzied (yet sympathetic) characterization, and "The Apartment" catches him at his professional peak in the movies. Working alongside huggable neurotic Shirley MacLaine (also at her peak) and shady Fred MacMurray (parlaying his slimeball role with curt persuasion), Lemmon creates a new kind of acting: screwball realism. **** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Wilder classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon is the man.The Apartment really surprised me. The Best Picture winner starts off right in the middle of the action, but yet the first hour seems long and overrun. Too much time seems spent in trying to develop the characters (and oh so many of them) and not enough time is spent on just seeing what will happen. Just when I was about to lose faith, the film picks it up like I have never seen before. The whole sub-plot of the four guys wanting to use Lemmon's apartment for their evening tyrsts is dropped and Wilder smartly concentrates on Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray and the film creates true magic.The Apartment is more of a drama than a comedy and balances the two elements perfectly. Just after one of the more dramatic moments of the film, we see Lemmon straining his pasta with a tennis racquet. The use of the doctor and his wife in supporting roles are completely there for comedy and yet add so much to the film. The ending also rates up there with the best of all time using an old device that doesn't seem at all cliched in this film. Some say that "Some like it hot" was Wilder's best, but now I have to disagree. The Apartment is better and surely would have made my top ten had the first hour not been so predictable.How Jack Lemmon didn't win Best Actor is beyond me. His is a great performance, getting to act on more than one scale. MacMurray, another Wilder favourite is perfectly cast in the role of a family-wrecker. I wish they would have put a scene in which his wife confronts him with "The News". MacLaine glows on the screen even when she is sick and in bed.I fully recommend this film to all, it being Wilder's best makes it a must see.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I've Decided to Take My Doctor's Advice, I'm going to become a mensch."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the recent biography of Billy Wilder by Ed Sikov, it is mentioned that for the first time Wilder used as his protagonist a lovable loser. Think about it. In a whole lot of his previous films the main lead in Ace in the Hole, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17 are the people who are the takers as Shirley MacLaine describes Fred MacMurray here.In The Apartment, it's the schnook that's took who the story focuses on. Jack Lemmon creates one of his immortal characters in C.C. Baxter, a minor cog in the machinery of the insurance company he works for.Lemmon has maybe found a way to move up the corporate ladder, but it's driving him nuts. He lives on West 67 Street in Manhattan, a most convenient location for kanoodling. Only it isn't him that kanoodles. One time he allowed one of the middle level managers to use his apartment for a little nookie. One guy tells another and so on and so on and pretty soon Lemmon can't call his place his own.In walks big boss Fred MacMurray to seemingly save the situation. But it turns out he only wants exclusive use for himself and he actually does vault Baxter several steps up the corporate ladder. And unfortunately MacMurray is currently kanoodling with elevator operator Shirley MacLaine who Lemmon has a thing for.The Apartment was years ahead of its time in that it was one of the first major films to deal with sexual harassment. The whole group of middle executives Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, David White and the big cheese Fred MacMurray just look on that insurance company as one gigantic harem. As typical for 1960 note there are no women in any managerial positions at all.Fred MacMurray almost didn't play Mr. Sheldrake. Paul Douglas was cast originally, but died suddenly just before shooting on The Apartment commenced. MacMurray stepped in and got great critical reviews for another effort with Billy Wilder as a heavy. MacMurray was also starting at this time a long run in the family comedy My Three Sons on television. There would be no more bad guys in his future.Billy Wilder held out in casting for Jack Kruschen as Doctor Dreyfus the next door neighbor who is available to save Shirley MacLaine's life. The folks at United Artists were ready to sign Groucho Marx for the part. Wilder's faith in Kruschen was justified, he got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Peter Ustinov for Spartacus. Lemmon and MacLaine were also nominated for the leads, but failed to win. But The Apartment was chosen Best Film of 1960 and Billy Wilder was Best Director.Also look out for a biting performance by Edie Adams who really makes her role count as MacMurray's secretary and former flame. During a Christmas party she tips off MacLaine to MacMurray's philandering ways and then later on brings the house of cards all around Fred.The Apartment is so timeless in so many ways although women in the workplace have made great strides in the last 46 years. One thing though that does show how dated it is. It's mentioned that Lemmon pays $94.00 a month, presumably rent controlled, for a one bedroom apartment in the West Sixties in Manhattan.Now that is dated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive movie for the comedy/drama genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "The Apartment" is a film which can produce some of the biggest laughs and at the same time... can bring many viewers to tears, Billy Wilder's quaint little tale about everyday people who get tangled up in love, jealousy and infidelity boasts a top-notch cast led by the trio of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray who are tremendous. The plot revolves around C.C. (Lemmon) who unknowingly makes the unethical attempt of climbing the corporate ladder by 'loaning' his apartment to members from his management chain to entertain their 'women on the side'. Given the change of circumstances, this premise certainly could even hit home in the current office environment. Although the office party and secretarial gossip scenes could be viewed as dated, the power and attitude of the corporate executive, Mr. Sheldrake (MacMurray) is certainly symbolic. The character of Fran (MacLaine) for today's standards of course seems too submissive and vulnerable but the reward of her finding true, admirable, unconditional companionship is quite enriching and fulfilling to any who see this memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I work on the 19th floor. Ordinary Policy Department, Premium Accounting Division, Section W, desk number 861?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning of The Apartment we see C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) being lost in a sea of desks within a gigantic office room. He works for a huge New York insurance company employing over thirty thousand souls spread over twenty-seven floors. Sometimes he is working overtime; "It's not like I was overly ambitious..." Baxter tells us defensively. "You see, I have this little problem with my apartment? I can't always get in when I want to." The reason are several superiors, to whom he is lending his apartment for their extra-marital escapades. In exchange they promise to give his career a push by passing recommendations to the personnel manager, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Although Buddy Boy (that's his disrespectful yet firmly established nickname) is daily surrounded by hundreds of people, he is drowning in lonesomeness. Apart from his mocking colleagues, there does not seem to be any family or close friends. In fact, the only decent person among his acquaintances is his neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), ironically under the wrong impression that the man next door is a womanizing drunkard. So Baxter meekly adapts to the mercilessness of corporate life, putting all hopes of happiness into his career. His free evenings consist of watching TV, preparing dinner or cleaning up after the occupants of his apartment. Yes, one could say that Baxter does not exactly lead a joyful life. Yet, there is something, or rather somebody carrying light into the loner's gloominess when he falls in love with the pretty elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Although Fran likes him for his decency and kindness, she does not quite share the feelings of her ardent admirer. But Buddy Boy refuses to notice any signs of unrequited love and eventually talks her into going out with him. You can imagine how Baxter feels when she fails to turn up, and how things get significantly worse when he finds out that she is actually having intimate meetings with the personnel manager Mr. Sheldrake in HIS apartment. The image of purity Baxter had of Fran is gone. On Christmas Eve, he decides to drown his broken heart in a bar while his apartment is occupied by the cause of his misery. But Fran doesn't feel any happier than Baxter, and with the depressing effect Christmas can have on the lonesome and desperate, the story threatens to take a turn into tragedy... It is hard to pin The Apartment on a single genre. The sharp, witty dialogue as well as Jack Lemmon's hilarious mimic would hint at a romantic comedy. Yet, one cannot overlook the tragic elements which let us dive into thoughtfulness, but never too deeply. Then again the film works on a satiric level, operating as cynical social commentary on corporate culture in the sixties (which is not very unlike today's business life). The remarkable thing about this film is that these three qualities merge perfectly into each other without ever losing the balance. The Apartment is a most entertaining picture, sometimes rushing from one hilarity to the next, and then suddenly slowing down to leave room for contemplation. Sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing, sometimes both at the same time. Billy Wilder mixed these contrary moods, and most amazingly, it worked out just fine. First and foremost The Apartment deals with loneliness and the everlasting search for unaccomplished love. "I used to live like Robinson Crusoe. I mean shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were." Baxter tells Ms Kubelik. Does any relationship ever work out the way one dreamed it would? Additionally the film points out how people let themselves be treated badly out of total lack of self-esteem. Standing up for oneself and saying the simple word "no" can sometimes be an art of its own. As an able filmmaker and scriptwriter (together with I. A. L. Diamond, "Some like it Hot"), Billy Wilder once again produced a film classic of outstanding quality. I have yet to see another picture, equally consistent at providing such humorous and well-timed dialogues. The amount of memorable quotes is remarkable and the entire cast did a terrific job at delivering them. Moreover, Wilder chose to shoot in black and white widescreen, shining with beautiful cinematography, and thereby gave the film a very special melancholy mood. Maybe the greatest strength of The Apartment is its honesty. It doesn't lie to us by painting images of perfect love or of perfect people. Neither does it create scenarios of utter hopelessness. However, it shows us that although life can be unfair on default, everyone is responsible for oneself to work up the courage to achieve happiness. With the director's cynical, yet comic approach to life, the film takes itself serious and it doesn't. It lets us taste the bitter and the sweet, thereby lending itself a tone of reality. For that reason alone I don't feel cheated by The Apartment and its story never failed to cheer me up. Then again, I may be too much of a pessimistic optimist.</fullReview>

Set during the Holidays, the theme of infidelity turned a lot of viewers off. The Holiday setting however is what provides a lot of the film's best scenes, as in the fantastic office Christmas party where the secretaries are doing a CanCan on the table and couples are making out in the corner. The one-two punch of Jack Lemmon's classic performance and that of Fred MacMurray is fabulous, and the triangle of sorts that forms with Shirley McClaine makes this much more than the comedy that it is known for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A precise satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder has made some tremendous satires. "Sunset Boulevard" is one of the greatest satires on film. "The Apartment", though not as cynical, is a very good one as well. I like that the satire is a backdrop for the main love story, and yet an integral part of it. The film shows just how much people are will to prostitute themselves in order to get what they want, whether that be a family or an executive office. Wilder handles some very serious and bawdy themes with a precise touch. This film could have easily turned into a wacky comedy of errors, but he is much to talented and sympathetic for that. He gives Baxter's character some sincere emotional depth. I could almost feel his loneliness and longing in many scenes. He is never really sure what he wants and how he can get it. He is a man searching for something, and he doesn't quite know it. Lemon plays this role to perfection. He doesn't go overboard. He gives the character the right amount of silliness and charm. McClaine is very strong. Her character is not stereotyped. She is a wounded soul that is looking for respite in the absolutely wrong place. I found her very charming and lovable. Some much of the film is in the wonderful cinematography. Wilder uses the widescreen to its fullest capability. The framing is so precise. You get a feeling of utter separation and distance. I really like the nearly infinite succession of desks in the office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILDER'S GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's "The Apartment is his greatest accomplishment. It is his most successful melding of comedy and drama that he never quite pulled off again. I'm glad the Academy had enough good taste to award Wilder The Triple Crown: Best Picture/Director/Screenplay. But they still had enough bad taste to deny Jack Lemmon a Best Actor award, Shirley MacLaine a Best Actress award and Fred MacMurray a nomination and award.The plot this time: C.C. Baxter (Lemmon; in case you're wondering: "C for Calvin C for Clifford, but most people call me "Bud")lends out his apartment to executives for their extramarital trysts in the faint hope of a promotion. Eventually, his boss, Sheldrake (MacMurray, excellent in a rare straight role) finds out and wants the key for his own affairs. Meanwhile, Baxter has a crush on Miss Kubelik (MacLaine, in a strong performance)the elevator operator.For those who accuse me of spoiling the whole movie: rest assured. This only covers the first 20 minutes or so of the 126 minute feature. Wilder has many twists and tricks up his sleeve and I'll leave you to discover what happens. What amazes me about "The Apartment" is that unlike most films, this isn't about the plot. It's a study in human nature and the mistakes they make. That is a strong trait of most Wilder films (including "Kiss Me, Stupid" and "The Fortune Cookie", both hilarious comedies with a hidden meaning)Also the dialogue by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond isn't just one-liners (although they are funny; especially when spoken by Lemmon and Ray Walston)There is real heartfelt sentiment here and it isn't the syrupy kind that makes my stomach churn (as in films like "Patch Adams") Wilder allows enough to make his points and then gets back to comedy.The cinematography is fabulous too. Wilder's film (as most of his 60s films) is in widescreen Black and White (shot by Joseph LaShelle, in Panavision; one of the most unsung and unrecognized cinematographers in history, he was nominated but lost) It has a crisp,clean look and is one of the few widescreen films that actually make the viewer feel confined in a tight space."The Apartment" is a superior example of the "serious comedy", films that work as both comedy and drama. Sadly, many of today's filmmakers have lost touch with this genre. I can't help but feel that the freedoms granted today that weren't in the 1950s and 60s haven't been an advance. They've been holding us back. Smart characters have lost way to stupid and oversexed ones. That's a real shame and it's high time we go back to our roots.**** out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of the Finest Scripts Ever Written, and Jack Lemmon Creates One Of The Greatest Character Performances As The Wonderful C.C. Baxter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me Billy Wilder has always been one of my all time favourite directors and he has not made a single film that has not appealed to me. Billy Wilder sums up perfection all his films manage to succeed in what they set out to do. Billy Wilder is not just one of the greatest directors; he is also one of the finest scriptwriters ever. Creating flowing dialogue like no other and perfectly making his actors and actresses work with the script brilliantly. Billy Wilder has made dark noirs, hilarious musicals and studies of human nature. It is extremely difficult to fully describe a director as versatile and genius as Billy Wilder. His films have held up for generations and will continue to have the same mass appeal that his films have had since their opening days.On the surface The Apartment might seem like a comedy and yes that's what it is on the surface. Once you start watching The Apartment you realise that actually it is a very dark film underneath and actually has characters that contemplate suicide. The fact is that The Apartment captures the realism of the everyday workman and makes you laugh as well as feel pity. The script is what keeps the film moving and shows how the characters in The Apartment change as the film progresses. The Apartment is about becoming somebody rather than being something that someone uses.Jack Lemmon creates C.C. Baxter the young aspiring workman who just wants to have a good career and the perfect woman. Though something always goes wrong and he's perfectly able to get a woman, but not the one he wants. At times you pity C.C. Baxter because he's so kind to everyone and never gets the thing he wants in return because something will always get in the way. I think there are times in every man's life where you probably feel like C.C. Baxter in one way or another.Jack Lemmon perfectly progresses with his character to make himself one of the most distinguishable character actors ever. Jack Lemmon works with an elegant skill at comedic performances and always captures the true essence of his characters. He seems to be one of those actors who are able to find the perfect chemistry with his fellow cast. What makes C.C. Baxter so brilliant is the fact he stands for everything the film is about. He becomes one of the mot uplifting and joyous ever put on screen. Shirley MacLaine is also excellent as the lovable Fran Kubelik (C.C. Baxter's heartthrob). From first impressions you'd think she is a beautiful and happy women, but she's actually very different to what you might expect.The script is fast paced, memorable and most of all it helps sum up all the characters so well. It's a script that works so easily with its actors and helps to make some of the most superb character situations. The script is realistic as well and actually does feel like the kind of talk that would be used in similar situations in life. The script is extremely natural and the subtle undertones prove Billy Wilder's crafting of intellectual film-making.The film is actually very similar to that of its A Wonderful Life and you could say Jack Lemmon is very similar to that of James Stewart. The direction is simple and fulfilling. It captures the image of "the apartment" perfectly and though just like any other New York apartment it feels extremely likable and memorable. The film's use of music is another high point and feels perfectly hand picked for the scenes it's used in. The film is actually quite sexually vibrant and does have many sexual undertones in its dialogue. Though subtle, it definitely is there and perfectly helps add more subtext to the film as a whole. A film to be studied in depth and not just watched.A film that never gets old and always manages to make the viewer feel uplifted with happiness. A first class example of perfected film-making you're ever going to see. Yes it's a definitive must-see, a masterpiece that was way ahead of its time and much more than just a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...and then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would first like to make the comment that this is no comedy. For those that consider this film a valuable part of Hollywood cinema due to the comedic aspects need to get their eyes examined along with their minds. I do not think that I laughed at all during this film, but I would like to mention that I do not think that is a bad thing. Not laughing at this film means that it hit you at a different level. I witnessed a beautiful film with some highly intelligent actors painting a dark and disturbing picture of a sexual world circa 1960. I suppose I was thinking that this was going to be a "screwball" comedy, which completely threw me off balance when the events of this film occurred. Never have I witnessed such a bold attack on the sexual revolution of the 60s and its effect on the business world. It was a slap in the face to see the way that Billy Wilder represented corporate America and honestly, it felt really good. To see this lonely man turned away from his apartment at all hours of the night because his boss needed a place to take their mistresses was sad, not funny, yet in The Apartment it worked beautifully.To begin, this film revolved around the actors. If you would not have had such strong actors like Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray honestly conquering their roles than this film would not have succeeded as it did. It won Oscars for a reason, and even watched by today's standard of Hollywood I think that everyone involved should be very proud. Their work was the best Hollywood had to offer. Lemmon successfully portrayed this hurt every-man that you could easily find yourself engulfed within. MacLaine, beautiful in her young age, was an emotional powerhouse. Her eyes could have told the story without any words. You could feel her emotions through her eyes, and it was outstanding. I must say that my favorite actor in this entire film was Fred MacMurray. His portrayal of the typical "boss" who seems to use his powers to control instead of help, was perfect. In fact, even if you watch the film today, you may still be able to see your boss in MacMurray's portrayal. For once, it was a solid cast. It had a structured story that was heightened by sublime actors that knew exactly what they needed to do. I would have to say that this is one of the greatest pairings in cinema history, these three together could have taken Hollywood by storm, and it is evident in The Apartment.As I stated before, the characters are exceptional, but coupled with their performances is a rich story that seems developed well before its time. I was not expecting to see such a sexual driven film released from the 60s. Films of this nature typically hint towards sex, but never quite spell it out, but in The Apartment it is in your face throughout the course of the film. From the opening sequence until the end, sex seems to be the biggest underlying theme of this film. In the world of C.C. Baxter, all he seems to know is sex, business, and the occasional conversation with the elevator girl. You can't help but wonder if that wasn't what was going through the minds of our fathers as they headed to the corporate world on a daily basis. It was such a slap to the face of the day to day America. To think that in this nation portrayed with family values and moral uprising that The Apartment would emerge as the breakout film of 1960. It shocked me. I think the reason that it did so was because of the strong writing, the powerful story, and the emergence of such innocent "characters" (as mentioned above). There were moments during this film that I honestly wanted to walk into the television, tell everyone to stop, and explain what was happening because I didn't want anyone to get hurt in the end. Isn't that a sign of a long-lasting powerful film? To me it is.Overall, I must say that The Apartment left my jaw on the floor. While my wife will disagree with me, I thought that it was a brilliant moment in cinematic history. Jack Lemmon could not have been handed a greater roll, nor could he have pulled it off with such beauty and pizazz. The story will shock and amaze you for nearly two hours. We are taken into a world in which we feel comfortable in, we feel as if we have been there before, and we can only thank the imaginative mind of Billy Wilder for that. He takes those moments in our lives that we wholeheartedly want to forget and places them in the window for all to see. His mockery of corporations, of the small man working his way to the top, and the disasters that follow are nothing short of classic. I have never witnessed a film quite like this and I hope I never do again. The Apartment was a once in a lifetime enjoyment, and I cannot wait to revisit it soon to see what I may have missed!

		<shortDescription>Bosses and employees conflict in a New York insurance company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment is a story that sparkles with a scintillating script, humour, and interesting characters as employees of a large insurance company come into conflict with each other. The story set in mid-20th century Manhattan is considered a "classic". The acting, the mix of characters and script are outstanding. New York City, 1959 is written all over it. The bar scenes, the office Christmas party, the walk-up apartment on the Upper West Side, the White Plains home of one of the executives all evoke the era. Jack Lemmon is C.C. Baxter a young employee trying to climb the greasy pole of success in a huge Manhattan insurance company. Shirley MacLaine is Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the company's office skyscraper, who falls in love with one of the higher-ups, and Fred McMurray is Jeff Sheldrake, director of personnel. All deliver great performances with a strong supporting cast. The movie presents the characters, particularly Kubelik and Baxter,in ethical dilemmas and as the movie goes along, we see these two come to grips with how they are living out their lives. A great movie by director Billy Wilder, who created some heavyweight movies like Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Some Like It Hot, and Sunset Boulevard. The movie held my interest from scene to scene. It is superbly acted, and very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They don't make 'em like this anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's The Apartment was one of a huge list of movies that are considered classics which I haven't seen, and indeed knew very little about (other than the level of admiration which many people have for it). Having a vague knowledge of the stars of the film (Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine), for one reason or another I was expecting a light-hearted comedy filled with innuendo and witty banter, a tradition of filmmaking that was common around the period when this film was released. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed, as these elements are all in play in The Apartment, but what really thrilled and surprised me was the much more serious subject matter that the film deals with. To say this is simply a comedy is completely false, as it's a somewhat dark and daring study of the nature of love and infidelity, and the stunning performances and filmmaking on display had me enthralled from the first frame.The film certainly begins as a comedy. C.C. Baxter (Lemmon) is a young bachelor trying to ascend the corporate ladder by allowing a group of his superiors to use his apartment for their extra-marital liaisons. After he falls for charismatic elevator attendant Fran (MacLaine), who is engaged in an illicit relationship with Mr. Sheldrake, the married head of the company, Baxter tries to free himself from the demands of his bosses, with hilarious results. While this is certainly risqué subject matter (for 1960), the film takes an unexpectedly sombre turn when Fran makes a suicide attempt in the apartment after learning the truth behind Sheldrake's motives. What follows is a touching, and at times heart-wrenching flowering of Baxter and Fran's relationship, and if the ending is a little predictable, the journey getting there is really something wonderful.The Apartment features an excellent selection of fully-formed support characters, but the film really belongs to Lemmon and MacLaine. Lemmon's reputation as cinema's greatest everyman is really on show here, and it's impossible not to root for him and sympathise with his plight. Playing Baxter as a charming yet awkward underdog, his character is the embodiment of the 'nice guys finish last' maxim, and although some elements of his life may be a little shady to say the least, Lemmon is flawless. MacLaine is completely up to Lemmon's high standard as Fran, effortlessly making audiences fall in love with her just as Baxter has. She's just so damn cute that even when she's recovering from an overdose of sleeping pills, she exudes such a potent 'girl next door' allure that can't be avoided. Her chemistry with Lemmon is palpable, and when they inevitably end up together, it's one of those truly satisfying romantic moments seen all too rarely in modern cinema.I'm not usually one to get nostalgic when it comes to film periods, but while I do have great fondness for many more recent romantic comedies, Hollywood really doesn't make movies like The Apartment any more. Wilder's screenplay (co-written with I.A.L. Diamond) is clever, witty and engaging, particularly in the subtle motifs and unique idiosyncrasies of all the characters, and the film is just so expertly crafted. I'm determined now to seek out more Wilder films, along with catching up on my Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. I can't recommend The Apartment highly enough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is an employee in a huge corporation. To promote himself, he lends out his apartment to his superiors so they can have extramarital affairs. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), the mistress of his boss, JD Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).I first saw The Apartment when I was 17 years old. I instantly liked it, but it would never have occurred to me to label it "my favourite film". It isn't cinematic ally dazzling. It doesn't feature any of my favourite actors. It doesn't push the boundaries of what's acceptable in film. Yet over the next thirteen years, I kept getting drawn back to it- because I could see the parallels that it had with my own life. This is a story about priorities and the bittersweet nature of relationships that I found to be haunting. Not bad for a comedy.The best way to see this movie is a letterboxed DVD. It captures the intimacy of the characters better than the cinema experience and the loneliness of the spaces surrounding them better than a pan and scan version.Jack Lemmon was a theatrically trained actor who gave his all and took quite a few critical hits for it (and praise too; he won several acting prizes). The Apartment contains most of his finest work as Wilder keeps him under firm control. Lemmon finds the right tone and understands the material perfectly. In interviews, he remarked of the ending: "Billy threw a rose into a garbage pail". C.C. Baxter is an engaging character, although he can be a little overbearing at times. Lemmon is at his best in the quieter moments- that perfect stone face he projects as he says "I said I had no family. I didn't say I had an empty apartment". At times, he doesn't seem to be in control of his own body- witness him dancing around like somebody else is pulling the strings.Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Fran. She stays totally focused on the person she's talking to and delivers her dialogue sharply. You get a real sense of loss when Fran attempts suicide, because you don't pity her. MacLaine is totally unsentimental here- it's more an attempt to get somebody's attention than self-annihilation.Fred MacMurray's best two film roles were for Wilder (this and Double Indemnity (1944)) and the director uses him for maximum effect. Probably the most sordid scene in the film is family Christmas scene as Sheldrake's son opens his presents and has just discovered the word "profligate"- it's very subversive watching the all-American dad being a philanderer and a liar. MacMurray embodies everyday, uncaring, ordinary meanness here. You can see the charm and power that makes him attractive to women like Fran. You can also see the transparent snake-oil salesmanship that alienates him from people who know better and don't have to be nice to him.What I love about Billy Wilder's films (and this one in particular) is the fact that you don't have to make any allowances for him. More than any other director of his era, Wilder deals with the basic elements of humanity and these never date. Although The Apartment is a film very much of its time in its setting (Sheldrake getting his shoe shined by a black man) and references (a secretary complains that she can't rendezvous with her boss because The Untouchables is on TV that night), it seems more modern than ever. I can't think of another film that depicts life choices as realistically and as entertainingly as this one does. I've related to this film in so many ways. I've often been too eager to please and unsure whether people like me or what I do for them. I've had a crush on a co-worker who didn't return my affections. I'm often helping out damaged women. I think the movie captures the bittersweet nature of life perfectly.I revisit The Apartment once a year. Watching it is like revisiting an old friend who sets you straight. This isn't a film for everyone (despite winning a Best Picture Oscar)- it often leaves a sour aftertaste to people who may find some elements objectionable. Yet it fits in with my jaundiced but romantically hopeful view of life and that's why it's my favourite movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to movies people love to make lists of the best this and best that. You've probably seen The Apartment on plenty of best comedies lists. Which begs the question who ever decided this was a comedy? The Apartment isn't a bad movie but it's not a funny one. To even call it a comedy-drama would be a stretch as the comedy to drama ratio skews far, far away from the comedic side of things. There are no big laughs here. There are barely even any mild chuckles. Which again is not to say this is a bad movie. It's just that if all you know about The Apartment is that you've seen it on best comedies lists you are in for quite a surprise when you actually watch it. If you're in the mood for some lighthearted comedic amusement you have definitely come to the wrong film.Our story follows office drone C.C. Baxter whose means of getting ahead in life is to loan out his apartment to higher-ups at his company for their extramarital trysts. The big boss, Mr. Sheldrake, gets wind of the arrangement and he wants in on the deal. Baxter gets a big promotion, Sheldrake gets a place to carry on with his latest in a string of office mistresses. Only this mistress, probably like all before her, is convinced that Sheldrake is going to divorce his wife to be with her. Fat chance. When she discovers the truth this supposed comedy, which really hasn't been funny at all to this point, takes a darker turn. At this point any hopes a viewer might have had for fun and laughs from one of the "best comedies ever" disappear.And what of C.C. Baxter? He has his own connection with Sheldrake's mistress. Well, at least he'd like to. He's got a kind of hopeless schoolboy crush on her and when he discovers she's Sheldrake's girl his illusions are shattered. What's worse is that he knows Sheldrake's just using the girl but he dare not say anything. A guy's got to look out for his career you know? Eventually when, in a rather dire way, circumstances change Baxter may have to take a stand. Here at least the film picks up a bit of drama. Still looking for the comedy though.Your enjoyment of The Apartment will likely be related to your expectations. If what you're expecting is a great comedy you're going to be disappointed. But if you know going in what it is you're getting yourself into there is much to appreciate. The best thing the film has to offer is the performance of Jack Lemmon as Baxter. It's a great portrayal of a hapless office schnook constantly being taken advantage of. People walk all over Baxter and you can't help but feel for the guy. Lemmon gives the character great heart. And whatever little moments of comedy there are come from him. He's a performer who knows how to draw out a smile from the viewer. Fred MacMurray as Sheldrake and Shirley MacLaine as the girl in the middle of it all are also quite good. Not as memorable as Lemmon perhaps but no quibbles with their performances. The quibbles come with the story itself and with the film's billing as a comedy. Initially the film looks like it's setting itself up for some funny, if tawdry, bed-hopping shenanigans. But the laughs never really come. And the story ultimately veers down some surprisingly dark paths. How this is considered a great comedy I'll never quite understand. Not a bad movie though for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Anyone that knows about comedy knows about "Some Like It Hot", and anyone that know about "Some Like It Hot" knows about Billy Wilder. This was his next film, and the reason I mention that is that this is a serious and melancholy drama with the form and rhythm of comedy. But it's not a funny movie, and part of the genius of the writing and direction is that Lemmon's character especially only figures this out in the third act.Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an unmarried drone amongst drones in a huge insurance company, possessing of two important things: a bachelor's apartment near Central Park (check out his rent!!), and an amoral willingness to allow company higher-ups to use his place for after-hours trysts with their girlfriends and pickups they meet in bars. To C.C., the problems associated with operating a safe-house for affairs are merely logistical, not moral; in one scene, he is seen rearranging his and everyone's schedule to accomodate Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) a real bigwig, with the expertise and interest of an air traffic controller.His hope is to promote himself within the company by pleasing his superiors, and for awhile that seems to be working. It turns out, however, that Sheldrake's current flame is Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who C.C. has quite the crush on; in fact, she stands him up on their first date to meet Sheldrake at their favorite Chinese restaurant, where Sheldrake asks her to resume their affair, intimating that he will leave his wife for her (a lie that no-one except her even pretends to believe).Without going into too many details, the joy of and intelligence this is how well this triangle works itself out slowly and with some pain by all concerned. Although C.C. really likes Fran, she won't give him the time of day, first because she's already bruised and involved with Sheldrake, and, later, because she sees his flaws better than he does (and, possibly, we do). At one point they agree that it's too bad that she doesn't fall for a guy like him, but the exchange is given additional bittersweetness not only by her inability to fall for a "nice guy" but her awareness that, as he is at that point, he's not really such a nice guy. One of the beauties of this script is that it takes awhile for us to notice that C.C. is just as bad as Sheldrake is; he's totally okay with the infidelities he is assisting in as long as he gets his promotion out of it, and it isn't his business whether anyone (wives or girlfriends) gets hurt in the process. Even the resounding disapproval from his next door neighbors (who just think he's a very busy playboy from what they can hear night after night coming through the walls) doesn't get him to think. Yet Lemmon plays the role with total innocence; he thinks he's in a comedy and it takes a real life-threatening problem halfway through to get him to start considering the error of his ways. Even then, he's still just trying to work the situation, without taking any stand himself. (There are only about two actors I know of that could pull this role off: Jack Lemmon and Tom Hanks, both of whom have such audience appeal that they can be this spineless without the audience despising them.) Interestingly, for all her personality, intelligence and self-awareness, Fran isn't much better; she's no stranger to the hazards of having affairs with married men, yet has little qualms about resuming her affair with Sheldrake. Both C.C. and Fran really are willing to sacrifice their integrity for something they hope to get from Sheldrake - him, the high-floor, corner window office, her, the gold wedding ring.I've stressed that this is a drama in comedy form to emphasize that this screen play is one of the most intelligently written I have ever seen; it takes a non-story (or at least, obviously bedroom-farcical material) and inhabits it with character interaction and development of the most subtle and human kind. You expect lots of bedroom-closet-under-the couch people shuffling (like in The Pink Panther of three years later) and general hilarity, perhaps ending up with someone partially disrobed and dangling from a window; instead you find out that each of these characters has a little history of his own. I rented this the other night, thinking that it would indeed be a comedy, and about halfway through found myself thinking "This is REALLY good!". I've been renting lots of pre-1975 movies (The Sting, Spartacus, this one) in an unprecedented attack of escapist nostalgia, and have been rewarded with jewels like this. Winner of 5 Oscars including Best Picture, this is one of the best pictures I've seen this or any year. It's a cliche to say that Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore, yet the nearest thing to this is My Best Friend's Wedding?(A couple of notes I really liked: Ray Walston's character is perfectly cast and played, as usual; the whole picture is a cynical Valentine to New York and the 50's at the same time; and anyone who saw this at the time could see that Shirley MacLaine was gonna be a big star).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly downbeat but ultimately rewarding comic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age of cinema thriving on relatively simple black and white tales of right and wrong, director Billy Wilder had always stood out as daring to recognize the ambiguity in characters and situations, making his films more difficult to classify than those of his contemporaries. And while Wilder's follow up to the tremendously successful Some Like It Hot may be visually black and white (the last best picture winner in over thirty years made without colour) its classification is far more elusive than such simplistic terms. Part corporate satire, part character study, part societal critique, part comedy, part tragedy, all melding together for a superbly emotionally affecting effort , The Apartment proves to be one of Wilder's finest works in a career inundated with tremendous successes. Contrary to its reputation as one of the funniest films of its era, and its jovial sounding plot of a businessman (Lemmon) attempting to rise in the office by lending his apartment to superiors having extramarital trysts, The Apartment is no light watch, coming across as surprisingly dark and morose even when viewed in a contemporary context, let alone for its time. Tackling such heavy themes as suicide and existentialism in a surprisingly straightforward fashion for its time, Wilder works in some stellar instances of expressionist lighting to add to the frequently melancholy mood, as the viewer's heart leaps out to the genuinely sympathetic characters. But this heartbreaking drama only makes the perfectly honed laughs all the more necessary and effective, with Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's brilliant one-liners cutting through the tragic overtones with snappy wit and bristling punch (Wilder even gets a sly dig in at reportedly difficult former star Marilyn Monroe, and the closing line "Shut up and deal" has become a classic, paralleling its predecessor in Some Like it Hot). Far from being a simple comedy or drama, The Apartment blends the two seamlessly, in a bold emotional balancing act, truly showcasing the saving power of laughter. While in the midst of balancing the tragic and the comic, the film may occasionally lose its emotional poignancy, such is a small complaint in such a phenomenally impressive work. Jack Lemmon is pitch perfect for the role of constantly downtrodden but tenaciously upbeat everyman C.C. Baxter - his tremendously endearing charisma captures the viewer's heart as he chuckles through countless struggles, a cheery testament to perseverance through hard times. Shirley MacLaine gives a powerful and moving performance as Fran Kubelik, a woman struggling to make good in a one sided relationship, act outside the confines of her gender and make sense of the increasingly bleak world around her. MacLaine's offbeat charm makes her a perfectly sympathetic and endearing foil to Lemmon, with whom she shares superb chemistry. Fred MacMurray, playing savagely against type, is a scream as shamelessly self-serving corporate boss Sheldrake. MacMurray's snappy timing is put to uncommonly caustic, but just as effective use, stealing most of the scenes he appears in. Jack Kruschen and Naomi Stevens similarly raise many a laugh as Baxter's distrustful neighbours. Alternating between staggeringly funny and heart-wrenchingly downbeat, Wilder's masterful achievement easily justifies the countless accolades bestowed upon it. With a sharp script surprisingly daring for its time, and an enormously charismatic lead trio of actors, The Apartment makes its mark as easily one of the most moving, sporadically comical, and ultimately human films of its time.-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely gem - with some hard edges!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've admired The Apartment for a long time, and watching it again last night reinforced all the good feelings. Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray all give wonderful performances, full of nuance and grace. Billy Wilder's direction flows effortlessly between sharp satire (e.g. the treatment of the four philandering managers) and touching human drama (e.g. the doctor repeatedly slapping Shirley MacLaine to bring her back from an overdose of sleeping pills). The writing is great.(It's interesting to watch The Apartment as a period piece. You have to factor out Billy Wilder's satirical exaggerations - the long rows of anonymous workers at their desks, etc - but you can still see things about working life in the 50's that would make us shudder today. For example, when Jack Lemmon admits that he looked up Shirley MacLaine's insurance information, there is only a tiniest hint of disapproval from her, instead of the outrage we would expect somebody to feel today at such a blatant invasion of privacy.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baxter, an office worker, makes his apartment available to philandering executives at his office in order to move up the corporate ladder. Things become complicated when his boss takes an elevator girl Baxter has taken a shine to back to his pad.In this Billy Wilder film, Jack Lemmon is on hand with another effective comic performance. He seemed to be good at playing under-dog characters .We root for him here even though we know he is a bit of a weasel that bends over backwards for unlikable bosses. It's testament to Lemmon's charisma that we are never in doubt that he is a sympathetic character. He is more than matched by Shirley Maclaine here as the elevator girl, though. She was an elfin beauty and it's very easy to understand Baxter's infatuation with her. She is probably the best thing in this film to be honest. Her character undergoes the most extreme story arc, where she veers from comic scenes to an attempted suicide. It's because of this especially that The Apartment is a light film that has some pretty dark undercurrents. The central plot-line was pretty racy stuff for its time as well, with the apartment of the title being a den of iniquity and vice. But on the whole it's pretty light-hearted despite this. But it's often when it gets darker that it gets more interesting, the whole post-suicide attempt sequence was probably the best part of the film. The drama often outweighs the comedy in this one. While it is a romantic comedy, it's not really full of laughs and the plot-line is more melancholic a lot of the time. It also displays a definite cynicism towards the practices of big business in their carefree immorality and misogyny. It's probably a little overlong in fairness and some of the side characters and comedy don't add too much. But overall it's good enough, if perhaps a little over-rated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Not A "Lemon" Lemmon Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A timeless classic in director Billy Wilder's typical anti-establishment satirical style, this is one of Jack Lemmon's best imho. He plays the protagonist CC Baxter, working in a large insurance firm in New York City, just one of many faces in a sea of desks and office machines on a floor of the building. Though he is surrounded by a multitude of people in and out of the office, he is alone socially, having no visible family nor close friends. The main diversion (if it can be called that) he has is lending out his bachelor style apartment to the middle-ranking executives of the insurance firm for their extra-marital trysts, in return they promise him that they will put in a good word with the higher management for him to get promoted to a better position. This he complies with, even if it puts him at such as a disadvantage as having to stand outdoors in freezing weather while waiting for the current occupant to vacate the apartment. In reply to one reviewer who questioned why the philandering men don't just take their lovers to a hotel, there are two possibilities: First, they were too tight-fisted to pay the expense of a room in a hotel - why spend money when they could just use a low-ranking junior employee's joint for free, and the second and more likely reason, is that there's the risk that they would be seen by known associates and acquaintances if they were to conduct trysts in such a public place such as a hotel, and their personal affairs revealed to their detriment. But then I digress. A lot of viewers find no humour nor romance in this movie, even if it is classified as a romantic comedy, and to an extent they are right. The supposedly funny scenes are not the sort that you would want to guffaw at, maybe just a snicker or two, but on the whole it does have its light moments, mostly based on misunderstanding and misinterpretation of situations, like Baxter's doctor neighbor assuming that he (Baxter) is a womanizing playboy causing a lot of ruckus most nights in his apartment when actually it's the doing of others. The fact that he leaves a wastebasket full of empty alcohol bottles (courtesy of the executive's liaisons) outside his door doesn't help improve his standing in the doc's eyes either. If by definition of romance, one would expect hot steamy kissing and bed scenes, then prepare for disappointment, as this movie contains none of that. Baxter does eventually fall for pretty elevator operator Fran Kubelik (played so expertly by Shirley McLaine), but does so in a modulated, hesitant way, and only because circumstances begin to arise such that she ends up in his apartment (after being left behind by her lover Sheldrake), and he's left to pick up the pieces of her failed romance literally, just like he's left to collect the litter left behind in his apartment by his higher up bosses after their dalliances. Fred McMurray is memorable as the sleazy despicable Personnel Director Jeff Sheldrake, a role as far from what we expect from McMurray, who usually plays nice guy in previous movies. He is deliciously detestable in playing on the emotions of Kubelik, making her think that he truly loves her and will divorce his present wife to marry her. The other characters - the middle ranking managers, the office workers, etc serve merely as cogs to fill in the completeness of the wheel to get the story going. All in all this is a very watchable film, and one deserving to rank as one of the classics in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect, intelligent comedy **** (out of ****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's masterpiece The Apartment is everything one wants in a romantic comedy. Its humour is omnipresent yet subtle, its themes and concepts ring true, and its two leads perform with exceptional charisma. Jack Lemmon gives one of the best performances of his career as the bound and determined C.C. "Bud" Baxter, a man who'll do anything to get ahead. Shirley MacClaine is charming and moving as Fran Kubelik, an elevator object who is the object of both Baxter's, and his boss' (Fred MacMurray) affection. Truly a perfect comedy, with wit and charm to spare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gorgeous wide-screen black-and-white is not something you see every day, so imagine my pleasant surprise as I stumbled half-blind into the cinema to see New York City unfold before me, with Jack Lemmon's marvellous voice-over effortlessly introducing us to the slightly crazed but very recognisable world of C.C. Baxter. Here he is in his enormous office building, surrounded by identically-dressed worker-drones, piling in and out of elevators operated by stunning girls in uniforms, running the show with amazing efficiency. What makes Baxter special is not his work - oh, no; he's as hard-working as the next guy, no more, no less. What singles him out for special attention from those (literally) above him is his apartment. And very handy it is too, for guys needing somewhere central to take a special lady for an hour or two, no questions asked, no prying eyes, no hotel bills, no wife on the phone. Baxter has somehow got himself into a situation where his apartment, and, indeed, his life, is not his own. Lemmon is ideally cast in the role, with his nothing-special looks and his slightly ridiculous voice. It makes those moments where he's really charming all the more valuable and striking. His occasional little dances and the classic "straining the spaghetti" scene come to mind. As comedies go, this is very grim and cynical. Office life is a dog-eat-dog nightmare, with promotion available to those who do favours for their superiors rather than those who work hard. Married men are all having affairs, with very few raised eyebrows or dissenting voices. Baxter is not morally upset by all these guys using his apartment, it's just inconvenient. In fact, it's only when the woman of his dreams, the lovely Miss Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine, at her very best) turns out to be one of those special ladies, who just happens to be involved with the big boss, J. D. Sheldrake, that things have got to be stopped. But is it too late? Suicide, extra-marital affairs, jokes about sexual stamina, the wildest office party you ever saw - it's all here in this delightful romantic comedy. Back in the day when movies were about something, this was something special, even then. But now, when movies are about nothing much, this is a masterpiece. A grim, troubling, hilarious masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The APARTMENT (1960) is, as best I can phrase it, a perfect melding of comedy, romance, drama, corporate climbing, mistreatment,stomach pumps, gin rummy, Jewish neighbors, Jack Lemmon, and Shirley MacLaine.Every time that I am in a nasty mood, I sit down and watch this movie on my DVR. I immediately feel 110% better-- mood-wise. From the opening credits near Central Park (which I am desperate to see) to the ending words "shut up and deal", this movie is one of my top ten, and that's saying something.As Robert Osbourne put it in his introduction on Turner Classic Movies, The Apartment "is at once touching and witty, perceptive, hilarious, heart-breaking and quite wonderful."Let me state this as simply as I can: I am thirteen years old and still this film touches my heart. Jack Lemmon is incredibly sweet in this movie and is one of my favorite actors of all time.For any strange person who hasn't seen this marvelous movie, here's a summary: C.C. "Bud" Baxter, a corporate climber, allows his employers to use his apartment for affairs with young women, and helps the woman he loves recover from heartache inside its walls.Altogether, this movie is categorized as a MUST-SEE-MULTIPLE-TIMES, and I have one thing to say to any Apartment-obsessed IMDb user such as myself: "Be a Mensh!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder weaves his magic yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is extraordinarily so far ahead of its time and it just does not age. I saw it first in Ireland, many many years ago when censorship still reigned freely over that fair land and the scissors of the censor wore out with all the snips in this one ( another great "cutting" movie was Gigi, don't get me started!).When I saw it years later I was overjoyed at what an absolute delight it was. Imagine a movie about clandestine sex without any sex being shown at all. Not even one kiss between any of the major characters. Not even at the end when you know it's all going to work out and they're going to have a cottage and kids and everything.Jack Lemmon, playing C.C. Baxter, who was reined in pretty tightly by Billy, gives an outstanding performance. Jack underplaying anything is to be treasured (another wonderful gem being "Dad"). Here he is a wage slave in a huge life insurance company, a drone among many, but a bachelor with his own apartment much desired by his promiscuous bosses for their affairs. With the carrot of promotions dangled in front of him, C.C. obliges them by letting them use it and spends most of his off hours pacing in front of his apartment waiting for the clandestine couples to leave.the movie adds multiple layers to this. It is a comment on the soul-less offices of the day when men like C.C.'s bosses preyed on their female underlings and the loneliness of lives in the big city without community is highlighted.The black and white filming, stark in its depiction of New York, the sound track, the brilliant script which lifts what could be mundane to the level of the sublime, the believable characters of C.C. and Fran (Played by a luminous Shirley Maclaine) who never, even to the end, fall into a maudlin mess, all contribute to get a rare 10 out of 10 from me.Five viewings later, I'm looking forward to my sixth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For anyone who's ever been trapped and lonely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With thematic content that is still relevant today anywhere from NYC to Tokyo, the heart of this very real human dramedy is that quiet, simple love endures and triumphs in the end, and that there is hope for the millions of people feeling trapped and lonely in what seems to be otherwise insignificant lives. The Apartment is a beautiful and endearing film that shows its audiences the greater meaning behind the vanities of life. How love, modest elegance and principles in character ultimately overrule self centredness, indulgence, and materialistic corporate ladder decadence. In fact, regardless of the corporate settings for the main character, the essential element of the rat race that everyone plays today, as well as the content delving into extramarital adulterous liaisons, considered taboo during its time, is what ensures the film its very timeless quality, and its relevance to the modern world till today. It is these qualities that have caused the film to earn labels like, being 'ahead of its time' or a 'classic'. And what a classic it is.Billy Wilder, the writing talent behind such brilliant works as "Ninotchka", makes this film his second outing after the highly celebrated "Some Like it Hot". Many felt he might be hard pressed to top that, but in a totally different direction thematically, does so with this film. The story is much more about the dramatic pinpricks of human tragedy and loneliness insofar as it is laced with comedic turns about a man who loans his apartment out to bosses for their extramarital liaisons in order to gain their approval and climb the ladder at work. But complications ensue when he discovers a beautiful woman he desires to court is actually inimically one of the objects exploited beguilingly by his very boss in his very apartment, forcing him into an impugning quagmire. Wilder blends these elements in perfect harmony in this film, with the chemistry between the cast of the wry humoured Jack Lemmon and the cloy beauty of Shirley MacLaine (Wilder would pair them again for Irma Douce) neatly balanced with the pure wit and pacing of the script, whilst always undergirding the whole film with a sense of a genuine sanctity for compassion for the whole plot. Far from considering the film an insult on the many who play sycophantic roles on the way up the rat race or corporate ladder, or the adulterous men, the cynicism can be construed with much verecund indignation as it highlights the sadness of it all without being condescending. In fact, the characters speak of the struggle each City dweller in modern living can identify with. There is no condescending need to present anyone as perfect, overtly altruistic, overtly feminine nor elegant (MacLaine's character is a lift attendant) nor flawless in their life choices. They make mistakes, sweat over them, and regret. A real rarity for films emerging out of Hollywood on the back of the 1950s with swashbuckling heroines and heroes. Lemmon's character is a simple bachelor with an air of inevitable loneliness in the meanderings of life in a NY apartment. That's why they call them a-part-ments. You live apart. And alone. He is an amalgam of a laid back yet pre-emptively self serving corporate machine, who ostensibly is forced into playing the only role he knows in order to better his predicament of being merely yet another average diploma staffer on Wall St- to climb up the corporate-ladder in his General insurance firm. The real beauty here in Wilder's script is that Lemmon, and also Maclaine (who makes the wrong choices by being mistress to Lemmon's boss), is that both characters harness a true propensity for love and care that is nestled within, waiting to exhale whilst in the midst of them being stuck in their cyclical ruts of despair. The real satisfaction comes when both these characters reconcile each others pains, heal each other (literally too in the classic doctor scene) and find love amid the hustle bustle of the rat race in the world that goes on around them, championing each other on. They play gin rummy in the final scene, in heart wrenchingly beautiful emotional overtones, kept painfully modest by Wilder, and celebrating the simple love that triumphs over all hurts. The themes are relevant till today, and the quality of what this film achieved stylistically (as the last of the B&amp;W generation) remains extant in full living colour today, because of the sheer timeless message of hope this film carries to anyone who's ever been that insignificant other, or ordinary person to be forgotten in that apartment out there.For that alone, it deserves an 8/10.By Stephen Thanabalan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't a huge fan of Billy Wilder's "Some Like it Hot" when I first saw it some years ago, but "The Apartment" didn't let me down at all. Jack Lemmon is superb as C.C. Baxter, the meek corporate worker who loans his apartment out to co-workers so they can spend alone time with their mistresses. In exchange for his services, Baxter is rewarded with high praise and before he knows it he is climbing the corporate ladder to success.The movie also stars Shirley MacLaine as the young woman Baxter falls in love with, and Fred MacMurray as his boss -- and the man who also has his sex-hungry eyes on MacLaine.In fact in one of cinema's greatest cases of irony, Baxter accepts tickets to a play from MacMurray in exchange for a night in his hotel room. Baxter invites his crush to go with him -- little does he know that she's the girl going to his own apartment that very night with MacMurray's character! "The Apartment" must have been very risqué and controversial when it was first released in 1960. This was an era of squeaky-clean, bright and colorful romantic comedies and this put a harsh twist on everything. The implications of sex are none-too-subtle and one of Baxter's neighbors tells him to keep the noise down at night -- followed by innuendo that nowadays would almost garner a film a PG-13 rating! Lemmon is really great in his role and displays perfect comic timing and Woody Allen-like nervous twitches and neurosis. Teamed with Billy Wilder it really is a great combination and the film itself is engaging and thoroughly entertaining."The Apartment" -- along with other 1960s films such as "The Hustler" and "Midnight Cowboy" -- helped pave the way for future films, but its revolutionary status does not outweigh its lasting impact as a quality feature. This movie holds up on its own. Some films gain reputations due to their effect and for nostalgic purposes on behalf of critics and audiences; "The Apartment" really is a great movie and still is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bringing both comedic and dramatic elements together, and it's all so incredibly watchable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is one of those film-makers who tackled so many genres throughout his career. "Double Indemnity" and "Sunset Boulevard", one of his earliest productions, saw him take on film-noir and drama; with "Stalag 17" he showed that he could make films about war too; and with "Some Like it Hot" he made one of the best-loved comedies of its time. So where does "The Apartment" fall in all of this? Well it's a credit to the director, in that he merges genres so skilfully. He brings both comedic and dramatic elements together throughout, and it's all so incredibly watchable.The film follows "Buddy Boy" Baxter (Jack Lemmon), a worker in a dull office building, who allows his superiors to borrow his apartment in order to have affairs in secret. This action gets him promoted to much more senior positions, due to good favour, and his neighbours are none the wiser, assuming that he comes home each night with a different woman. He soon falls in love with Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also caught up in an affair with Baxter's boss, played by Fred MacMurray. The love-triangle is a classic comedy device, and is pulled off here so well, as Wilder adds drama to it as well as comedy.Jack Lemmon shines throughout the film, giving a comedic performance at the height of "Some Like it Hot". He is a remarkable actor, and can make even the smallest things be charming and humorous, through the use of intonation or facial expressions. MacLaine is also brilliant, and portrays Kubelik as lovely but depressed. A scene where Fran tries to overdose on sleeping pills should break the flow of a comedy by adding a very serious element of drama in, but thanks to the duo's performances, it never feels too solemn. Their shared charm, with Baxter trying to cheer her up with card games, is what makes the movie work so well. The ending which the two share together is simple yet beautiful.Even though the film isn't at all shocking today, in its time the concept of adultery was one which was not widely portrayed in mainstream cinema, and Wilder's script is a firm satire on adultery throughout. It's visually fairly ordinary, but the clutter of Baxter's apartment and business of the office are things which help to add to its appeal. In all, it's a simply charming film which hits home on some important dramatic points, while never straying far from its initial comedic intentions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No compromise from Billy Wilder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Apartment" may be the greatest achievement in Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder's highlight-filled careers. Many critics find its story gentler than some of Wilder's other films such as "Ace in the Hole" and "Double Indemnity," but I don't detect any artistic compromise. Wilder creates a believable, full-fledged love story that exists alongside the familiar dark humor, snappy dialogue, and depictions of immoral behavior that characterize most of his movies. Rather than diluting these essential Wilderian elements, the addition of a likable everyman, whom Jack Lemmon plays with perfection, throws them into sharper relief through contrast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is a really swell guy. He takes serious matter and makes it entertaining: Sunset Blvd. blew me away, and now The Apartment has put a big smile on my face. Wilder injects this uppity- atmosphere into almost every scene and it makes the film a pleasure to watch, no matter how serious the plot gets. And behind the charm of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, there is a serious plot.The Apartment is about Baxter, a New York business cog, trying to move up in his company not through hard work, or extra socializing, or self- pitching, but by lending his apartment to his coworkers' extra-martial affairs. Being a 60's film, this cannot be said directly, but the hinting is so strong you pick up instantly. The film is quite liberal, content-wise. The film shows that blackmail goes both ways: Baxter may believe he has the upper hand, with his clients on a string... but he does not, and he sinks deeper into his lie. Of course it comes across humorously, with his neighbours scolding him for his 'sexpot' antics, though the good doctor would also like if his body could be donated to science.Baxter is quite a character, an innocent everyman with his own set of faults and quirks. Lemmon is magnetic: we always root for Lemmon, even as he tells pitiful lies to his landlady and can't stand up to his clients. Even his borderline creepy knowledge of Ms. Kubelik comes off as just charm. An immensely likable character.The object of his affection, Fran Kubelik, is also quite a charmer. Her problem is men, but she knows it. She doesn't fake innocence. We have all known that flirty girl who ends up on your nerves... but Fran isn't that girl. Wilder knows just how to handle his characters.Now, more than 50 years after its release, trying to look at The Apartment academically is strange, because its era has passed. Things like that don't happen any more. Right? Perhaps not as specifically, but the cost of power is a universal theme. What do you sacrifice to try and get ahead? Property, dignity, even your love? C.C. Baxter knows how much he'll give, but also what he won't. The film ends positively, which is nice, and deserving, especially after seeing Sunset Blvd. The Apartment is wonderful, sharply written and performed, and makes a great evening. 8.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On March 27, 2002, as the world has sadly learned, filmmaker Billy Wilder passed away. No doubt, over the passing days, weeks, months and years, there will be some discussion about him and of his work. There will also be biographies, documentaries and other tributes to him. I believe, however, that he should be left to rest in peace and that the only true monument to him is in the great movies he left to us. One of these is 1960's `The Apartment'. Some might disagree with this film's Best Picture win (Considering that it was the same year as `Psycho', `Elmer Gantry' and `Spartacus'), but it's a great movie nonetheless. Jack Lemmon, In a memorable role, portrays C.C Baxter, an insurance man for Consolidated Insurance in New York. Baxter has a secret: He has been lending the key to his apartment to various executives so they could have extra-martial affairs. In exchange, Baxter's career advances so far that by the movie's end, he is the boss's executive. Shirley MacLaine is elevator girl Fran Kubelik, who has had a romance with Baxter's boss. Even though the boss is a real weasel (More on him and the actor in the next paragraph), Kubelik thinks she still loves him at the end. However, she doesn't realize that she actually has fallen for Baxter. Fred MacMurray will probably be most remembered for his role on `My Three Sons'. His early film career also involved largely comedic roles. Ironically, his most memorable film roles, like `Double Indemnity' and `The Caine Mutiny', had him adapt to villainous roles, which he did real well. Here, he portrays J.D Sheldrake, the personal manger at the Insurance company. He is a real liar, using people to get to the top (Where he is at) and having flings with others at the building. With his looks and smile, however, you would think that he could have easily played a good guy. Shows just how good of an actor he was (Or was the part just a good fit?). Unfortunately, he joined the ranks of actors who never won Oscars. Wilder's films had a common theme of people willing to do anything for happiness, even if it means breaking the law. Here, the story is about someone willing to give up his bachelor flat for a higher position at his job. In expense, he loses the trust of those around him. The main character here, like Walter Neff in `Double Indemnity' also have a similar flaw: They don't know what to do until it's too late and they never take a stand on something. Wilder's films also had great endings, often with dialogue. The final line in this film (`Shut up and deal!') has become nearly as famous as ?Nobody's Perfect'. Now that's movie making! References to previous Wilder films made in this one:Mr. Dobisch (Ray Walston), one of the executives, remarks that he picked up a girl that looked like Marilyn Monroe, who was in `The Seven Year Itch' and `Some Like It Hot'. During thr filming of those movies, Wilder had grown to despise Monroe's demands for star treatment and her poor work ethic. Thus, he also included the party-girl Monroe-esque character in this film.Another of the executives, Mr. Kirkeby (David Lewis), saw Baxter with Kubelik at his apartment and remarks that they had a `Lost Weekend', a possible reference to the 1945 film that won Wilder Best Director and Best Picture academy awards. The character name Sheldrake was also used in Sunset Blvd. (1950).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Puts Up With A Lot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment does what most love stories and perhaps no romantic comedies do, which makes it as emotionally stirring as it is. It has one person in deep emotional trouble because she's in love with someone else, and the other person is hopeless in love with her, and not only that, walked on by everyone constantly. And frankly, you really tend to care a great deal, because the film spares us nothing and really holds back on offering us relief until the last few minutes.Jack Lemmon's character is a hard-working employee at an insurance company whom other higher-standing employees use for his apartment, so that they can bring adulterous dates and flings there when they need a place to get busy, always landing Lemmon out on the street for awhile to wait till he can return to the warmth of his home. This is only the beginning of how badly and infuriatingly he is treated throughout the movie, and Lemmon's character is so envious in how he handles it. He's a man who constantly looks up at things, hardly affected by the extremely negative situations of things. When he is punched in the face by an assuming man when Lemmon really has done nothing wrong, Lemmon lies there, nose bleeding, thinking about how thrilling it is that he's been punched in the face in the name of a woman. It's hard to be like he is but it's not hard for the breezy likes of him. Why is this so hard for the rest of us? Why can't we, at our most resilient, feel the way he does towards life, and go through it with such a sensibility where he intellectualizes his feelings? The film has great atmosphere, as it takes place over the course of Christmas and New Years, which adds lots of emotional effect to its story. It's a very relieving film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Kept Secrets: The Apartment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film industry has benefited many times when friends have decided to work on a picture together. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise are some examples. But none are greater than Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon. In The Apartment, Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a lonely man living and working in New York City. He works at an insurance company called Consolidated Life. His desk is on the nineteenth floor but his superiors have been using him with the promise that they will recommend him for a promotion. A key has been floating around the office and Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) on the twenty-seventh floor calls Baxter into his office to question him about it. Mr. Sheldrake tells Baxter that it has come to his attention that there are four rotten apples in the company. It soon becomes obvious that Mr. Sheldrake also wishes to use the apartment. Once Baxter allowed one colleague to use his apartment to change into his tuxedo on the way to a function, he has not been able to refuse it to anyone. But one night changes his outlook. Jack Lemmon is amazing with his subtle humor and genuine kindness. He expertly portrays the sweet but disappointed C.C. Baxter. Fred MacMurray is sleazy and despicable as the careless adulterer. The role of Fran Kubelik was perfectly cast with Shirley MacLaine. She is excellent as the broken hearted woman trying to pick up the pieces of her life. The Apartment was written and directed by Billy Wilder. His screenplay is filled with witty comments but also sincere brutal honesty about the issues people deal with. The main character is forced to choose what he believes in: working his way to the top in any way he can or being a good, honest person. The cinematography in this film is very beautiful. Wilder used interesting shots of New York City for the setting of his tale. It is easy to understand why this film won the best picture academy award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>C.C. (Jack Lemmon) works as an accountant for a large New York City firm. There are so many employees, C.C. realizes, that getting ahead in the company is an almost impossible task. That is, until he discovers the firm's big wigs will do him some grand favors IF he lets them use his convenient apartment for their many dalliances. C.C. agrees to the arrangement and is often left on the doorstep, waiting for entry into his own habitat again. Meanwhile, C.C. has a crush on a pretty, perky elevator girl named Fran (Shirley MacLaine). Trouble is, unknown to C.C., Fran has been involved with the head of the company, Jeff (Fred McMurray). Jeff is married, of course, but that did not keep him from having his good times with Fran. The day arrives, naturally, when Jeff wants to meet Fran at C.C.'s place. Will anything good come out of deception and adultery? This is a wonderful movie, despite its serious subject matter. Lemmon gives one of his best performances as C.C. and charms the audience at every moment with his humor, good looks, and manic energy. MacLaine, likewise, is attractive and funny as the lady taken for a self-serving ride by the company's big man. Add in a down-and-dirty performance by McMurray and you have a dream cast. The secondary actors are all quite wonderful, too, and so are the costumes, settings, and production. Then, too, the script is stunning; make that a ditto for Wilder's direction. Have you been putting off a showing of this film for a rainy day? Please do not wait any longer and head out the door this instant to get this film into your clutches and onto your television screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Apartment is a pretty sweet film. I bought this on impulse purchase, after reading it was Vincent Gallo's favourite film.To make it short ? Insurance Clerk, Bud Baxter gets tied up in loaning out his modest NY apartment to sleazy Insurance executives, in return for favours that will boost his career. Seems simple, but the plot draws you in, playing around a theme of doing the right thing for the big company boss, and at the same time stripping Bud's chances with his unrequited love ? Miss Kubelik (MacClaine). The whole thing ties up well and always leaves you rooting for Baxter's plight.The Apartment is a great romance of its time, neatly directed, great dialogue and excellently delivered by a strong cast.Shirley Maclaine does well to conjure that "something", us men find crazy about the girl-next-door types. Jack Lemmon is quite excellent too, in a manner that resembles a latter day Jim Carrey. He's a bit geeky, sometimes overly enthusiastic and has no coolness about him, only to be redeemed by his eventual purity.~Paul Browne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Wilder-satire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilders acid-like satire on the double side of American middle-class morality is great stuff even after almost 50 years of wear. Jack Lemmon, in perhaps his best part, is fantastic as the quiet paper-pusher Baxter who is exploited to the maximum by his cynical employees, while he is left with nothing (career-wise and any other...wise), except for his honest intentions, being the only one in the firm with some sense of dignity and respect for human values. Fred MacMurray, in my opinion, never had a better part as the spineless boss. And Jack Kruschen gets everything out of the doctor next door! A total delight from start to finish, and despite of the comedy theme never neglecting the important one: remember to be decent! Make note of the amazing pacing and dialog that sets new standards even for a Wilder-film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder at the top of his game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon is an account executive who gets promotions by lending out his apartment to superiors in "The Apartment," also starring Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, Edie Adams and David Lewis. One of the best parts of the film for me was that in 1960, a one bedroom apartment in the West 50s in New York City was a mere $85 a month. Today you couldn't get the doorknob for that.C.C. Baxter is a lonely man whose life consists of work and overtime until people have cleared out of his apartment so he can return home. Once there, he has a TV dinner and sits in front of the TV. He's totally at the mercy of his bosses who stay longer than they should, leave him walking in the rain and cold until all hours and wake him up in the middle of the night when they meet someone in a bar. All married men fooling around. Tony Curtis claims the inspiration for this Wilder film came from him and a place he and several of his friends used for trysts.At work, C.C. is interested in the gamine elevator operator Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), but his heart is broken when he realizes that she's gone back to the head of the company, Sheldrake (MacMurray) after parting with him when she saw no future in the relationship. Worse, they're meeting at his apartment, and one night, after another realization that Sheldrake is just playing her, she attempts suicide. When she has to stay at his apartment to recover, the lonely man realizes just how lonely he's been.This is a wonderfully crafted movie and a real tour de force for Lemmon, who portrays a sad, beleaguered character out of step with the mores of his office. MacLaine is vulnerable and sweet as Fran, who loves Sheldrake in spite of herself. The cheating spouses - Ray Walston, David Lewis, MacMurray et al. do a great job at being completely unlikable. Edie Adams has a nice role as Sheldrake's secretary and ex-girlfriend, and Baxter's neighbors, who all think he's a real swinger, are very funny - Jack Kruschen and Naomi Stevens.The script is witty and cynical, pure Wilder in its look at the men of corporate America, the dumb wives at home, and the women they seduce. The character of C.C. Baxter is out of his league here, too sensitive and too nice to be in with this crowd, and Fran is too loving and good-hearted to be with a man like Sheldrake. Wilder puts these characters into a cold, unfeeling world where somehow they find one another. Maybe not so cynical after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another highly rated movie that left me unimpressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently this hasn't aged well, because many of the things that happen in the movie seem completely and totally unrealistic. Why would a bunch of executives need to use an apartment as their landing point for extramarital affairs? Couldn't they go to a hotel like any self-respecting philanderer?I did not laugh one time.This movie's premise was good, but several things plagued the movie to me: 1. it was too long. this plot was pretty standard and didn't need run for 2 hours.2, A sweet girl dates a married man who is the top executive in a company? Perhaps she isn't all that sweet to begin with. If you want us to believe you just love someone, try to have him not be the richest guy in the whole movie.Brother-in-law scene did nothing to advance the plot.Their 'love' didn't make much sense. I mean we knew he was crazy about her, but where did all of her love for him develop? And if thats the case how did she marry Sheldrake anyway? And how did her love for him develop so strongly that she just leaves Sheldrake at the drop of a hat, I though she loved Sheldrake?If it were funnier and shorter, I suppose it would have been more enjoyable, but I definitely do not understand its appeal. Its a decent movie, but I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece from master-director Billy Wilder.Brilliant comedy-drama. Starts off as a comedy with a decent plot then develops into something so much more. Soon takes on darker tones and themes such as greed, ambition, depression, suicide, infidelity, misogyny, sexual harassment and the monotony of modern jobs plus issues such as the media, advertising and consumerism.Some of the themes are so confronting and controversial for a 1959-60 movie you're surprised they're in there.Yet, in among all the negative themes are many positives: compassion, caring, gentlemanliness, neighbourliness. Great performances by Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in the lead roles. Both of them received Oscar nominations. Good support from Jack Kruschen (who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination) and Fred MacMurray. Throw these all together and you have a wonderful, thought-provoking, emotional, realistic, funny movie. A true, timeless classic of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the poster says there has never been anything like the Apartment.A movie that begins with a man at his desk and then revolves between two places mostly, his apartment and his office and that involves humor in a way just as we talk, a wicked sarcasm hidden under the wraps of humour.What makes The Apartment so very engaging is its acting and writing, both just go hand in hand, as written and directed by Billy, he extracted the exact output of what he aspired to, this reflection is evident in every frame. And this ability to extract acting as required per the script is what makes Billy Wilder one of the best directors. He took the writing seriously and wrote almost each dialogue and frame along with I.A.L Diamond, so well that I could just connect to everything that was going on screen. Jack Lemmon as Baxter is sublime and has that rarer innocent face, that does not need histrionics to act, but is so very natural. Shirley Maclaine as the very straight and at times funny Fran Kubelik, brought life into a character that was otherwise very casual. All other actors did their part so very aptly.Now coming to other aspects, this film has such subtleties and are handled so very well without any noise, its a take into the psyche of each character and what is special is that we can firstly relate to characters and even empathize to either one of them. So written ahead of it's time and acted superbly well, this is a classic that has stood the test of time. When I watched it even today, was so refreshing.Thanks to Billy Wilder for presenting a great movie. It's 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Apartment is a wonderful film that was nothing short from amazing. The acting done by Jack Lemmon was phenomenal and his facial expression reminded me of a 60's Kevin Spacey.The acting was very good, but the sounds that came from this movie where very well placed. The ending popping of the cork, knowing Lemmon's past from the movie had me on the edge of my seat. The story was witty and original that kept me laughing days after watching the movie. This is a must see for a black and white fan and will remain one of my favorites for a while. The only downside I thought was the very last scene. Although nit picky I thought they could have ended it stronger. I wasn't satisfied with her just telling him to deal the cards. I left a little disappointed in the ending, but it shouldn't hinder this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic romantic comedy with depth and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is already half a century old but it has kept its charm which makes it worthy of being considered a classic.This is one of the early romantic comedies. But besides fun moments there is also a lot of drama and a pretty original idea for the story. No wonder it won so many Oscars in 1960! On the first glance it may seem like the ah so boring good guy vs bad boy story and the female that finally gets a clue, but it is more than that. We have Baxter who lends his apartment for influential coworkers to climb the corporate ladder and we have Fran, the elevator girl, who has an affair with the boss while he promises to get a divorce. There is a parallel in their stories as they both agree to be mistreated by people with more power hoping for a better life and not seeing yet that even when they get it, it won't be as happy.A smart story is brought to us by a great cast. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are easy to identify with and they show some great acting skills with a lot of face expressions and gestures that perfectly show us the feelings of the character. I especially like Shirley MacLaine, she has some spark in her and so much freshness that take over the screen. She wasn't a big star yet when she made the movie but then she deservingly became one. Supporting cast was great as well. Jack Kruschen as Dr. Dreyfuss was great.A good movie with a good story, great cats and well presented atmosphere of its times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legends Tale....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment is a film that gave Billy Wilder all the accolade he deserved. I won't hesitate in saying that Billy Wilder gave birth to a new kind of cinema, the cinema that had real stories to tell. It was fun, it was sarcastic, it had power to invest emotionally and it made sense. His stories had charm that refuses to wear off even today. His choice to stick with B&amp;W shows the utmost care he took in his narration. The Apartment is a cauldron with the best of Wilder qualities in it. A tinge of sarcastic humor, brilliantly rounded characters and an addendum on the life in a metro. Also Billy Wilder has this incredible talent of finding the right people for the right role. Where Jack Lemmon was a delight to watch in Some like it hot, here he reaches an all together different level. A guy you can relate with, somebody you empathize with and in whose misery you feel like mischievously smiling but at the same time feeling guilty for the same. Equally fitting as his counterpart is Shirley Maclaine, vulnerable, quirky and sweet on the eyes. The supporting cast too is brilliantly fitting.Billy Wilder gave life to his movies, even the moments that in most movies would pass without drawing an ounce of attention tend to come alive in his movies and specially in The Apartment. How it encapsulates the life in a metropolitan city through a sacchariferous story is nothing short of deserving an Oscar. He adds an element of surprise and thrill in even the most mundane things and his dramas too unfold like a thriller. He is one of the most versatile directors to have put their feet on the American soil. Apartment is an exceptional tale with a simple heart and a truthful soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder is one of the most highly regarded directors of his generation and The Apartment is one of his most acclaimed films. The Apartment is a funny and dramatic, aimed with a script that is witty and tragic. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine have great chemistry and give great performances, Lemmon giving a nervous energy to his character, a little like Woody Allen but much less self-obsessed whilst MacLaine has plenty of charm and wit, but also has tragedy about her. The comedy is gentle amidst the controversial material for the time, filled with witty lines, character interactions and subtle sight gags. We get plenty of melodrama and the characters go through typical arcs, but the screenplay is so well written and the direction and acting that it makes The Apartment a rewarding experience, even during its darkest moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Baxter's Loveshack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The simplicity of storytelling is what's missing in most romantic comedies these days, especially the x dozens of repetitively formulaic over-commercialized New York centered films. Even though it touches on themes like labour exploitation, sex and infidelity there's a certain innocence and purity in 'The Apartment' which is evident in most Billy Wilder films. This is a key ingredient missing in most of the recent Hollywood films of that genre. Like most of Wilder's classics, the dialogues are smooth, witty, simplistic and funny. There's hardly any overly melodramatic moment here. Plus, who better than Lemmon to play the common man and Maclaine to play the smart, classy yet vulnerable lass. Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine were a very successful pair on screen. 'The Apartment' is one of theirs and Billy Wilder's finest films. Romance at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect a screwball comedy and you won't be disappointed ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having finished to watch Billy Wilder's "The Apartment", released in 1960, his second Best Picture winning film after "The Lost Weekend" 15 years earlier, I realized why the film didn't leave much an impact on me the first time: I expected a screwball comedy and was caught off-guard by the constant feelings of sadness and melancholy that inhabit the main characters. I felt kind of cheated 'comedy-wise'. I guess I had the right mindset this time because something deeply touched me regarding the relationship between C.C. Baxter and Fran Kubelik. (By the way, kudos to whoever from Billy Wilder or I.A.L Diamond came up with these names, hilariously catchy at first hearing but then get strangely familiar friendly-wise. )So, it's only by expecting a drama that its lighthearted aspect touched me, I didn't wait for the laughs to come yet each comedic situation worked. What is so indeed funny in the film relies essentially on an ensemble of little ironies that govern the main character C.C. Baxter. As usual, Jack Lemmon embodies with perfection the average office worker with a very small attention to the kind of little speech mannerism and details you might found in these everyday characters, he's not eccentric enough to be immediately recognizable in this vast and impressive office space (the insurance company he works in counts more than 30 thousands employees) but he manages to transcend his normality and inspire a sort of instinctive sympathy. The first irony is that Baxter is obviously the kind of awkward bachelor who's not charismatic enough to be a womanizer yet he lives the life of one. Baxter loans his apartment to some colleagues who need a spot for their '5 to 7' activities in exchanges of some vague promises of promotions. Therefore, while everyone is having a good fun in his apartment, earning Baxter one hell of a reputation, especially from his closest neighbor, the brave Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kuschyn), Baxter waits outside. Not only he doesn't have the benefit of having a good time, but he also can't even afford the comfortable intimacy that consoles from the feeling of emptiness. Because his life is indeed empty, totally dedicated to his work, insurance-wise and colleagues-wise. Another irony is that the colleagues fulfill their promises and show some gratitude toward their Buddy-Boy, that's the way they call him. So Buddy-Boy rapidly climbs the social ladder thus getting closer and closer to his boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Getting more self- confident, Baxter makes some advances to the cute elevator-girl Fran Kubelik, the girl that crystallizes the most vicious intentions from other men. But Shirley MacLaine delivers one of her finest performances as Fran Kubelik, all in nuance and subtlety, it's like she went through the kind of deceptions a little flower like her would have endured. She smiles, she's smart, but there's an inner sadness in her heart, like a little prey who's aware that she's meant to attract ruthless predators, but what can she do?By a delightful turn of events that only a Billy Wilder's script could have provided without making it too preposterous, we learn that Fran had a long affair with Mr. Sheldrake, who only endorsed Baxter's ascension because he needed the apartment. Sheldrake is an interesting character here because he's the closest one to an antagonist, striking by his lack of scruples. He pretends to be in love with Fran and ready for a divorce while he just can't accept the idea of losing her, he pretends to respect Baxter while he's only using his joint. Sheldrake is a character that mirrors the two leads' weaknesses: they accept their fate because they're convinced that a good payoff ought to come job-wise or marriage-wise. Sheldrake will be the romance's instrument by abandoning Fran in Baxter's flat, with a 100-dollar bill so she can buy a Christmas gift.Fran is left alone of a Christmas Eve and Baxter kills time in a bar, both are desperately lonely while they have the hearts that could fulfill the most beautiful dreams. We can't help but feel angry to see Sheldrake spending time with his Family while Fran and Baxter, live that way, incapable of finding the kind of happiness that enriched their childhood. It's not coincidental that the film takes place in a period where people loosen up and have fun, it indirectly mirrors Baxter and Fran's condition ? solitude-wise. Then, the film takes a dramatic turn when Fran attempts a suicide by swallowing sleeping pills but thanks to Baxter's intervention and the providential help of Dr. Dreyfuss, she'll progressively recover. And both will get fond of each other. But they still feel obliged to Mr. Sheldrake, Baxter can't make any move on Fran, and Fran, despite everything, still embraces the improbable dream of marrying the boss. Yes, it's frustrating to see such a nice couple remaining faithful to a rotten man, but I guess Fred MacMurray has a way to always keep a friendly and gentle tone in his character. And it's not up to him anyway, to help these two lonely hearts to get together.The rest of the film is pure brilliance ? script-wise and directing-wise. Billy Wilder signs a wonderful romance between two brave and gentle people who overcome their own illusions. Indeed, many Wilder's film deal with illusions, in "Double Indemnity", Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson committed a murder out of a passion that didn't exist for a money they wouldn't get, in "Sunset Blvd.' Norma Desmond's delusion of grandeur and Joe Gillis' conviction that he could use her would lead to their demises ......and in "The Apartment", two people abandon sterile dreams when they understand that they can't depend their lives on the selfishness of one person, much more where they have so much to lose, like loving each other, and dealing with it ? punchline-wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic comedy or comic drama - at any rate a must-see, Wilder-wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dramatic comedy or comic drama - a perfect combination Jack Lemmon is always a sight to behold on screen. Paired with a congenial partner he regularly strikes gold. As is the case in comedies he did with Walter Matthau. And if you're looking for the perfect female counterpart, let's submit Shirley MacLaine - a combination that worked so well that they'd be put together again in another of Billy Wilder's big hits three years later, "Irma la Douce". Everyman Lemmon and sweet MacLaine play so well off each other that it is impossible not to root for them as a couple. But boy does it take a while until the cards are dealt right...As for other assets: "The Apartment" is comedy, but not a light one - it has rather dramatic points to make and does so effectively. Just like Wilder's "Lost Weekend" is a very serious drama about a drunk, yet there's enough room for comedy, even horror in that one as well, and there's always a lot of irony and satire. Wilder, who also co-wrote "The Apartment", has the rare gift of telling a great story on the typewriter and with the camera, for one by injecting a good portion of realism and on the other hand successfully transcending genres, thus endowing his characters with more depth and believability than they would if they'd play it only for laughs. This strong dramatic aspect is reinforced by the use of black and white cinematography, widescreen shots framing mass scenes with individuality completely drowning in it, and of course the plot with its questionable morality where extra-marital affairs and a suicide attempt add the necessary weight. Now balance all that with a charming and lovable main character, and the gorgeous soulful girl on the brink, who needs to come to a realization, and you've got much more than just a romance with a lot of pathos. "The Apartment" is first rate, director-wise, and a film to be thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end, entertainment-wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Apartment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Apartment" begins with a premise that seems whimsical. We meet a man, C.C. "Buddy Boy" Baxter (Jack Lemmon), who is working late because he cannot go home. He cannot go home because someone else is having sex in his apartment. It's not his roommate or his wife or anyone else whom you might expect to be in his apartment. There is an executive from Baxter's company having sex in his apartment.The reason an almost complete stranger is using Baxter's apartment is that Baxter is a doormat. The whole thing started when he let a co- worker change clothes in his apartment. Before long he had four executives using his place for their extra-marital affairs and stringing him along with promises of promotion. The situation gets so out of control that, in order to spend an afternoon in bed to recuperate from a cold, Baxter must make a dozen phone-calls to juggle appointments. Baxter knows he's being used, but is such a wondrous shmuck that he plays along pretending to believe that he believes in their stories about promotion. The situation goes from whimsical to poignant when Baxter trades exclusive rights to use his apartment to one Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) in exchange for an actual promotion. What Baxter doesn't know is that the woman Sheldrake is taking to his apartment is the sad faced but personable elevator girl, Ms. Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), for whom Baxter nurtures a massive crush. Indeed, the first thing Baxter does when getting promoted is to summon the courage to ask out Ms. Kubelik. She agrees but is pulled back into her "love affair" with the sweet- talking Mr. Sheldrake. How can we help but feel for poor Baxter who knows he's been stood up but has been mercifully spared the details of why.Wilder isn't done torturing poor Baxter yet. The movie's premise has already moved from whimsical to poignant and now moves from poignant to cynical and bleak. Ms. Kubelik is smart enough to understand she is making a mistake, but dumb enough to keep making it. Yet, even she has her breaking point and when this comes, Ms. Kubelik tries to commit suicide by swallowing all of the sleeping pills in Baxter's apartment. This gives us the films defining image: Baxter, having a spent a wretched Christmas eve drinking alone in a sea of merriment, comes home with an equally lonely woman to attempt to snatch a few fleeting moments of tawdry pleasure only to find, passed out and dying, the object of his erstwhile affections. The scenes that follow are the true heart of the movie. Baxter cares for Ms. Kubelik, showing his love for her with his every action. He treats her not as an unwelcome interloper but as an honored guest. He does his best to entertain her, to cheer her, to defend her reputation, and to safeguard her happiness. Baxter even tries to make Mr. Sheldrake be kind to Ms. Kubelik. One could read these actions as an attempt to suck up to his boss and assuage his own loneliness, but he goes to far for me to believe that is true. Sure he is desperate for company, but Baxter is also desperately in love with this sad bruised woman in his bed. Sure he wants any excuse to be close to her, but he also shows a genuine concern for her happiness, even if that means getting her back together with another man. This movie is undoubtedly a love story, but I feel duty-bound to disillusion you of the sappy connotation that usually accompanies that phrase. It is one of, if not the, most grounded and human love stories I have ever encountered. Our main characters are a manipulative philanderer, a spineless corporate flunky, and a willfully na?ve young woman. An argument could be made that these people are so flawed and wrapped up in their own image of what they want the world to be that the don't deserve a happy ending. And Wilder doesn't provide us with one; at least, not in the traditional obligatory love-conquers-all way. Instead, his characters bounce around interacting with each other in profound, yet often subtle, ways. They are changed by these interactions and these changes shape their decisions. The movie ends on a happy note with one of Wilder's immortal unforgettable tag lines, but I make room for the possibility that the ending is deceptive. Perhaps, like Shaw's "Pygmalion," what follows the end wouldn't be so happy. I like this idea and make room for it, but I choose not to believe it. Despite how much I enjoy it when my romance stories are shaded with cynicism, "The Apartment" involves me in Baxter's life to such an extent that I sympathize with him and want, no need, him to live happily ever after. He may not deserve it, but to say that says that no human deserves "happily ever after." For that is what Baxter is, a human. A flawed tragic every man struggling to be a man in a world that wants flunkies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the greatest romantic comedy of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great films of the mid-20th century, or of all time for that matter. &nbsp;This film is contemporary with its time, 1960 New York City, yet it's themes and portrayals resonate strongly across 52 years and remain completely relevant. &nbsp;Films portraying contemporary, everyday life (no great, world shaking events, &nbsp;just events that might occur any day, in any city), in order to have lasting impact, must deal with the most basic aspects of the human soul and psyche, those things that are timeless and universal to all human beings. &nbsp; The Apartment does just that. &nbsp;After at least a dozen viewings of this film over the years, it has never failed to deliver for me. &nbsp;In fact, at each viewing, I have discovered something new in it, or perhaps rather in myself. &nbsp;This is another measure of a great film-the film and the viewer tend to grow with each other.Wilder's touch here is light but sure. &nbsp;With romantic comedies, it is so easy to stray too far into mawkish sentimentality or sophomoric humor, &nbsp;so that one loses interest in the characters because they become just that- characters. &nbsp;In The Apartment, Billy Wilder walks that fine line, and manages to blend humor with pathos and romance while "keeping it real". &nbsp;While Wilder doesn't love his characters, he never loses his respect for their humanity, even the heel Sheldrake, and thus he is able to give his viewers a genuine experience that reaches into the soul, touches it, enriches it, and uplifts it.Do yourself a favor and watch this one-it will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an impressive movie -- well acted, nicely written, heart-breaking in its own way, very funny in parts, and highly moral in tone. I'll never forget seeing it for the first time in a Drive-In Movie in Red Bank, New Jersey. I haven't seen it that often since, nor would I want to. Nobody really wins anything.The last scene has Shirley MacLaine rushing to the empty apartment of Jack Lemmon on New Years' Eve, plumping herself down next to him on the bed, handing him a deck of cards, and ordering him to "Shut up and deal." She's just found out from her cardboard lover, MacMurray, that Lemon gave up a promotion as a matter of personal honor. But I don't think she loves Lemon. Certainly she's never shown the slightest interest in him as a potential mate before. To her, he's been nothing but a pathetic jerk for whom she sometimes feels sorry. And now they're going to live happily ever after, both of them deeply in love, jobless, and broke.The doctor next door is a good man but isn't going to change. Why should he? The four randy aging office boys who have been using Lemon's apartment have learned nothing. They're probably already scrounging around for a new lair.Those are all reasons I wouldn't want to watch it too often. That melancholy is encapsulated in a few shocking moments, as, for example, when MacLaine offers Lemon her tiny mirror so he can admire his new bowler hat and he realizes that MacLaine, the girl he idolizes, has been getting shoved this way and that on his own bed two or three nights a week during bouts of intercourse with the exploitative MacMurray.Those may be reasons for not seeing it too often but there are plenty of reasons for actually watching it. It's amusing, for instance, to see and hear Dr. Dreyfus's disbelief in the hallway when he realizes another loud party is about to begin. He attributes all of this activity to Lemon, who is actually a nebbish. A shady young girl is dancing alone with a pair of maracas in the hall, waiting for Lemon's door to open. "Mil-DRED!", cries Dr. Dreyfus hurrying into his own flat.I don't know why Wilder was fond of the name Sheldrake but he must have been. He resurrects it here after it was used up on the bald guy to whom Joe Gillis make his baseball pitch at the beginning of "Sunset Boulevard." I like the other names too. Kubelik, Dobisch, Matuschka. They sound real, not made up. And the blond who "looks like Marylin Monroe" is priceless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Wilder comedies ever; one of my all-time faves!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE APARTMENT (1960) **** Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Ray Walston, Edie Adams. Bitter comedy classic that won Oscar for Best Picture about corporate climbing insurance exec-wanna be Lemmon who moonlights his apartment to his adultery prone higher-ups and winds up falling for one of their mistresses (MacLaine) who wants just to be loved. Fine mix of pathos, humor and sentiment. Billy Wilder also won for Best Director (as well as co-writing the Best Original Screenplay with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond). Also won Best Editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, a favorite movie is like a cherished old friend. You may not see them very often, but when you do, it's always a special occasion. Billy Wilder's THE APARTMENT is one such "friend" - I take it out every New Year's Eve, pop some popcorn and settle it for an evening with Jack Lemmon, Shirley Maclaine and Fred MacMurray. Everything works in this film - the crisp , widescreen black &amp; white cinematography, the measured amounts of humor and pathos, the excellent script and, of course, the incredible performances of all involved. It's my 2nd all-time Favorite Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twin plotlines of boy-gets-girl and how-not-to-succeed-in-business-while-trying- way-too-hard have never been combined more effectively. The melancholy"apart"ness of the main characters in this drama (right there in the film's title) is so keen you can taste it, for example, in the eleventh martini the poor guy drinks on Christmas eve after discovering his boss is severely doing the girl he loves and that she can't seem to get enough of it. The mechanics of corporateclimbing and romantic striving may have (but probably haven't!) changed a bit since this one was released, but the ethos certainly hasn't! Billy Wilder was a God of storytelling! The moment when both main characters simultaneously seethe 'mirror crack'd' for what it really is represents a miracle in the art of setting up an audience. No actress in character has ever been more beautiful than wasShirley MacLaine as she flees from a lethal New Year's Eve fiasco to try to save Jack Lemmon from ending it all with a champagne cork....See this movie and become a Mensch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Billy Wilder film I've seen was just so well made... Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, Sunset Blvd., etc... Here I was thinking I've seen the best of this man's work. But that all changed after I finally got around to renting The Apartment. In this film, he decides to drop the straight comic approach and makes a film that is just as funny as it is dramatic (sort of like an echo of what Chaplin did years before). Mr. Wilder's directing captures the greatest out of an already great script. Everything jives here amazingly well; the acting is superb, the characters are very well developed, the black and white cinematography is excellent, and the screenplay is among the best ever written.. it is in my opinion his masterpiece.Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are great in some of the greatest roles of their careers. Each of them has something to learn from the other and you just want to see these two connect so much! And Fred MacMurray.... the man has to be one of the most typecast actors of all time.... is it just me or does he always play the innocent looking guy who reveals his true, "evil" intentions by the film's end? But hey, that's not a complaint at all... it's a compliment! ...He's at his greatest when he plays those types of roles, and he's just as great (if not better) in this one.In any case, this film has a lot to say. It's entertaining, and at the same time it teaches us a little something about human nature. This film is one of my all time favorites and I just cannot recommend it enough...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's The Apartment is very worthy of its classic status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After so many years of only knowing about this movie by reputation, I finally saw this with Mom on Netflix disc. She also was watching this for the first time. We both enjoyed this very much. I mean, we both had previously seen Jack Lemmon in Some Like It Hot which we both laughed heartily at but here, where he's once again in collaboration with co-writer/director Billy Wilder, he also displays his dramatic side along with his comic talents. And Shirley MacLaine has a pixie charm as the elevator operator Jack has a crush on. And then there's Fred MacMurray as the sneaky, adulterous boss who takes advantage of Lemmon's want of career advancement and Ms. MacLaine's venerability concerning love. In summary, The Apartment was such a worthy classic that I looked forward to watching the extras attached to it like the commentary section. So, yes, that's definitely a recommendation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's heralded as one of the all time great comedies and even won a Best Picture Oscar, but I'm somehow just not feeling the love here. Though essentially a good hearted guy, C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is easily pushed around by his superiors at work, all with the goal of hijacking his apartment for their extramarital affairs. Fred MacMurray is cast against type as a heel with not a single redemptive quality, and I had to do a double take when he treated Shirly MacLaine's character like a hooker by pulling out that hundred dollar bill. MacLaine has some good moments, but overall, she's as one dimensional as her co-stars, which is a shame, because there were a few times that you felt genuinely sorry for her abuse at the hands of Sheldrake (MacMurray). But then you had to wonder why she didn't pull the plug on the relationship a whole lot sooner.Back to this comedy business - I can think of a few times where Lemmon's facial expressions and posture denoted an element of humor, but the more obvious attempts fell flat. Like the tennis racket spaghetti strainer - that would have been funny in a setting like "Animal House", but if you're trying to impress a girl with your wit, I think I'd stay away from going the unsanitary route. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? Probably more than anything else though, it's probably not wise to mix a lightweight script with a suicide attempt. There wasn't much funny about Doc Dreyfuss trying to save Miss Kubelik's (MacLaine) life and Baxter's noble gesture to nurse her back to health over the course of a couple days. I think the movie would have gotten more mileage out of going for a straight dramatic approach, but then again, I'm not the expert here and the film did win big in the Oscar race that year. Maybe I watched a different picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming lonelihearts comedy drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A marvellous vehicle for Jack Lemmon. This is not a film for the singleton to relish. Part of Lemmon's brilliance in this film is that one is never sure whether he rents out his flat in order to further himself in his company - or whether, as in the ambivalent, self-deprecating allusion at the opening, he genuinely doesn't have much of a reason to go home. CC Baxter is both lonely and alone. This also explains why he seems unperturbed by the pimping role he occupies and the easy manner in which he discusses it with his 'clients'.Shirley McLaine as Fran Kubelik is a wonderful stroke of casting opposite the drifting Baxter. She's pretty green herself. In fact McLaine has a fairly limited acting palette but cuts through the sassies and squeakies with persistent charm. There is no guarantee of a happy ending but I was begging for it by the end.There's plenty more to enjoy in this super film, from the supporting cast to some iconic shots: Baxter waiting outside a Broadway theatre with a cold is the defining image of the well-concealed bleak undertow of this rich comedy. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy and Drama in one scoop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the 1st scene itself I knew that this movie is going to be hilarious. This was my 1st movie starring Lemmon. I would say that just like Bill Murray, he also has a flavor of his own for comedy (May be I am saying this from my hangover of Groundhog Day). A very typical setup but quite an unusual story. It deals with extra-marital affairs in a comical fashion along with the senior-junior relationship in a typical office setting. The movie gets to its point somewhere towards the end of 1st hour where Lemmon, his boss and a female are unknowingly strangled in a relationship. The movie shows, as to what extent people can go for their ambitions but somewhere down the line they realize that it is the personal life which needs to be happy 1st for professional to be blooming. Also people's incapability to differentiate between true love and infatuation is dealt with nicely in the screenplay. Some of the scenes had really smart &amp; funny moves on Lemmon's part as he tries to juggle with his seniors. I guess it is one of the very few comedy movies to win Oscars, a perfect mix of comedy and drama indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Apartment directed by Billy Wilder has aged well.Jack Lemmon plays C.C Baxter timid but ambitious office worker who finds his soul mate Miss Fran Kubelik played by Shirley Maclaine.Billy wilder was supposed to have taken his inspiration for The Apartment from the scene in Brief Encounter where Alec uses his friend's apartment for a secret rendezvous with Laura. So CC Baxter allows his co workers to use his apartment for liaisons.He is even approached by his boss Mr Sheldrake for the valuable apartment key.Baxter's ride up to the executive washroom is assured.However it a costly ride as Fran is seeing Mr Sheldrake played with a cool and detached air by Fred McMurray.This has to be one of the cleverest comedy dramas ever written.It seems effortless in the way it veers from light comedy to tragedy.The performances are excellent especially from Jack Lemmon - His energy and precision are a joy to behold (Note a long take where he is at his desk working out statistics- comic skill of the highest order!)Shirley Maclaine gives a genuinely strong, sweet and moving performance as Fran. Praise too also to Jack Kruschen as the mocking doctor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Apartment is my all-time favorite movie alongside The Godfather.I've seen it 6 times so far.This is one of the rare movies that made me applaud for 5 minutes after seeing it.Yes,I love Billy Wilder,his "THE BEST OF" collection should probably consist of 15 movies or so,but I think he really excelled himself with this one.I've never seen a witty,sharp comedy and a strong,satirical drama blended so well.This film is filled with witty one-liners and additional script details so typical of Wilder(the suffix -wise,showing four fingers to indicate three by both main characters,etc.),yet it tackles some very serious issues,such are the loneliness in a big city,insignificance of an individual within a system(the opening scene),infidelity,and even an attempted suicide.The direction is great as usual with Billy in charge.But the real gem of this movie are the actors--Jack Lemmon,one of the most versatile and lovable actors of our time gives possibly the performance of his successful career,as C.C.Baxter who decides to become a mensch.Shirley MacLaine is the best active actress alongside Meryl Streep,and she demonstrates her immense skill as Fran Kubelik,the lovable elevator girl,who can't find true love.There's Fred MacMurray in a perfect role of a family-wrecker,so unusual for him.And the priceless supporting cast-Jack Kruschen,Ray Walston and others-made this movie what it is--an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!I don't know what else to say,except SEE IT(whoever didn't),and to the ones who did SEE IT AGAIN!!!It is shameful that Jack and Shirley didn't get Oscars for their wonderful roles,but that's another story.</fullReview>

This man is C.C.Baxter who is an employee and can't resist threats of his managers. His popularity is heart by a high level manager Mr. Sheldrake and Mr. Sheldrake wants the key of his apartment as other managers did. As different from others, this one is directly related to Baxter's life because of Mrs.Kubelik, but he doesn't know anything about this fact. He learns the reality in a office party after he had been promotioned and lastly he finds Kubelik unconscious in his house. Kubelik had committed suicide with sleeping tablets before he got arrived home and after this point Sheldrake gives a promotion to him for the things that he did to Kubelik and wants for the key one more. Baxter is ready to lose salary, career and all other things not to do this.Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine did a good job in "The Apartment". A simple story belonging to real life could be just amazing and I had a good time while watching. Of course, it is necessary not to forget Baxter's work friends and neighbours' performance, especially Dr. Dreyfuss. The director Billy Wilder reflects his feelings related to routine facts which could be in life of most of us. The time of film can be supposed as long, but I never got bored.I haven't watched such an interesting subjected film that had been screened in 60's.

		<fullReview>No one could direct a comedy like the funny man who the best actress of all time, Bette Davis, adored, Billy Wilder. Give this great director a script about a lax landlord (Jack Lemmon) who permits all sorts of promiscuity on the premises &amp; a tenant (Shirley MacLaine) involved in trysts, add the element of these two lead actors (MacLaine &amp; Lemmon) falling in love &amp; we've got the classic comedy romance "The Apartment." Ranked in the top 100 films since motion pictures have been made, "The Apartment" lives up to this proud clout most especially because of the on-screen chemistry between Wilder, MacLaine &amp; Lemmon. MacLaine is the only of the three who is still starring in lead roles &amp; counting. She's still making us laugh, cry &amp; think seriously about the variety of ways to be human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment with a little edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I had this film's DVD sitting on my desk for a while now, but I finally got to watching it and I have to say that I was pleased with the results. If I recall correctly, this is probably one of the last major Hollywood black and white films because at this point, widescreen and color were both prevalent in a bid to take back viewership from television. The Apartment is in widescreen, but not in color.Directed by the prolific and sometimes groundbreaking Billy Wilder, this film benefits from his experience, as the direction is smooth, the performances are classic and the mood balances well between moments of comedy and moments of seriousness. It is a comedy, but it has a bit of an edge because of some of the tragic subject matter in the story and so it's a more human film than say, Some Like It Hot, another Billy Wilder comedy starring Jack Lemmon.The story is about a Mr. CC "Bud" Baxter and his quest for the career fast track in a large insurance agency. To facilitate this career ambitions, he helps out his adulterating bosses in their machinations, but as fate would have it, complications in this scheme occur when a woman enters the picture. Drama and humor ensue. The humor, however, isn't all out wacky; it's an amusing real-life sort of humor and it doesn't knock you out of your seat out of laughter, but entertains nonetheless.So with smooth and experienced direction, capable acting, and an edgy story, the film manages to be solid entertainment, even when you consider that if you put yourself in the shoes of the characters, it might not be the happiest of times. Well done and not a bad film to catch. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon plays a nice guy sad sack and Shirley MacLaine the wayward waif with whom he's smitten in Billy Wilder's bittersweet romantic comedy that's long on the bitter and short on the sweet.Wilder nails the sterile world of corporate American anonymity in this film. Lemmon's character is a worker bee, whose work space is lost amid a sea of identical spaces, captured brilliantly by the art direction as a black and white version of a human ant hill. The only thing distinguishing Lemmon from the multitudes is his apartment, which the good ol' boy management staff like to use for their adulterous trysts, and which Lemmon himself never seems to need for the same purpose. He falls for elevator operator MacLaine, a brassy yet wistful cutie, who happens to be one of his boss's said trysts. Things get complicated as Lemmon has to decide which is more important to him: the moral high ground or climbing the corporate ladder.Lemmon essays a tricky role beautifully. I would have been instantly annoyed by this character had anyone else played him. It's hard to feel sorry for a doormat who can't say "no," but Lemmon makes it virtually impossible not to like his character. MacLaine, too, delivers one of the best performances of her career, a rather ballsy one in a way, as she makes her elevator operator unsympathetic through much of the movie. This pair of unconventional actors creates a refreshingly bleak romance, if there can be such a thing. The only thing that seems to be preventing both of these characters from getting completely lost in the crush of indifferent humanity is their tenuous connection to one another."The Apartment" is a perfect New Year's Eve film. It superbly taps into that feeling of being lonely while surrounded by people that only those who live in big cities can understand. Anyone who's commuted to work on a subway or bus will instantly recognize the feeling this movie conveys.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most creative ideas for a movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I had come into this movie not knowing what happens, because I have a feeling I would have enjoyed it even more. As it was, I still loved it.The idea on which this movie is based is so clever, it's hard to understand why they hadn't made it before. A young man named C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) allows the executives of the company where he works to use his apartment for pleasure, usually with women other than their wives (figures). While this is going on, Baxter finds he is in love with a certain elevator girl at the company named Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). I'm going to go ahead and stop there so I don't ruin anything for you. The plot is too creative to waste in a comment.It is hard to pinpoint exactly why The Apartment succeeds so well. Perhaps it is because the characters ring so true. This is the first movie I've seen Jack Lemmon in, and I have to say I like him a lot. He manages to be funny without breaking away from his character, something I admire in the actors of the Golden Age and something the actors of this age need to learn. There was not a moment in this movie when I felt like Bud wasn't doing what he felt was the right thing. In fact it seems to me like this movie is about Bud and Fran discovering what "the right thing" actually is. Fran is played by Shirley MacLaine in what could have been an over-the-top, whiny performance. MacLaine manages to turn Fran into a wonderfully sympathetic and strong-willed woman, despite the fact that she's stuck on the wrong guy. Fred MacMurray has a nice turn as a man who never quite understands the girl he brings to Baxter's apartment, and ends up selfishly pushing her over the edge.Of course, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond have written such a witty and character-driven screenplay, it must've made the actors' jobs easy. This is more than just a comedy, and while at first glance it seems to be very simple, the more you think about it, the more you realize how much is really there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Genius of Jack, The Best Ever... Movie wise *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes THE APARTMENT work? Is it the writing? Yes, but that's not all. The direction? It's perfect, but not what I'm really thinking of. What makes THE APARTMENT perfect is the acting genius of the one and only Jack Lemmon. His movements, the way he talks is all so... rhythmic. His performance is like music. The happy-sad, melancholy performance of the century.Lemmon portrays C.C. "Buddy boy" Baxter, a man who is often blending in with the rest of the drones in the insurance company he works at. He suddenly is moving up in the world being noticed by company big shots, such as Mr. Dobisch (Ray Walston). What's his secret? He lends his apartment to higher ranking company officials for "meetings" with certain female acquaintances. Baxter's key is circulated throughout the office to a few executives including Mr. Dobisch. Baxter seems to lead a life that revolves around work. He's a lonely guy who, would normally go home after work, eat, then sleep. Most nights, Baxter has to put that on hold for a few hours, to wait 'till the executives finish up. At the office someone catches his eye, Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine, also wonderful) an elevator operator who is the object of many of the office men's desires.*Spoilers ahead!*Throw in J.D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray... as you've never seen him before)the head of the company all the way up on the 27th floor. He has seen the excellent reviews Baxter has received from a group of executives and ties it to a rumor of an apartment key floating around the office.Sheldrake now, wants in. He promotes Baxter and gets the key. There's one slight problem... he takes Ms. Kubelik to the apartment. And once Baxter finds out he has a pretty huge dilemma. The job or the dame?Many of THE APARTMENT's scenes sparkle with great timing of great dialouge such as: J.D. Sheldrake: Ya know, you see a girl a couple of times a week, just for laughs, and right away they think you're gonna divorce your wife. Now I ask you, is that fair?C.C. Baxter: No, sir, it's very unfair. Especially to your wife.C.C. Baxter: You hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you. Fran Kubelik: Shut up and deal. That last quote is forever etched in the fabric of film as one of the best last lines ever.So many scenes in THE APARTMENT sparkle with Jack Lemmon's brilliance. Just look at the way he seem s to float around that apartment in the few scenes with he and Shirley MacLaine alone together. The way he moves a he drains the pasta through tennis racket. His energy, the way he hums. Just PERFECT!THE APARTMENT has not dated at all since 1960 and still holds strong as a marvelous film!The best ever... film wise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a career that sparkles with brilliant dialogue snippets, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond captured the 20th century living conditions to a "T" with this little quib from the neighbouring doctor in this (let's say it once more for the paying crowd) masterpiece of cinema.For all the right reasons do we sympathize with Jack Lemmon's character, whose decency and frailties mirror what could be considered the everyman/-woman. Ultimately "The Apartment" cuts to the core of a working and business society where nobody takes responsibility, be it for somebody else or themselves. Figures, charts and analysis are convenient tools to measure a human being, anything slightly emotional is considered to be a nuisance. It's impossible to generalize, but with economical upheaval, huge divorce-rates and endless talk shows about why relationships don't work, I can hardly point to anything more poignant than this one line of dialogue. The responsibilities in business as in private matters seem to have been washed away by generations of people who seem to be too confused, too scared to be alone and therefore unable to face the consequences of their actions. Simply put, not able to pay while purchasing, and hoping the bill will never arrive. "The Apartment" may have started out as a simple idea for Wilder and Diamond, but what it has generated is the most observant and truthful account of what the so called "modern society" is about.A cycle of needing, hopeful fools, trapped between paychecks, bills, values and emotional turmoil, that is fueled by the fear of losing everything. And yet, a shimmer of hope appears in the end. There is love, there always will be and being human, might not be such a bad deal. Especially next to being just an employee.</fullReview>

I first saw this movie when I was 12 yrs old, and though the sex was over my head, the human interaction was obvious. In the 45 years since, I love this movie more each time I see it. Now my son who only recently saw the film, for the 1st time feels the same way I did when I first saw it (and he's 30 years old). Fred McMurray followed this by doing a 180 degree turn into "My Three Sons"; I often wondered if the father in "Sons" was carrying on as Sheldrake was in this film. And Ray Walston went to "My Favorite Martian".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a great while along comes a movie that you'll just know you'll enjoy seeing. There was Billy Wilder directing it and he was my most preferred director of comedy films like SOME LIKE IT HOT, STALAG 17 and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH. Then it had Jack Lemmon who just had to be the funniest guy on the screen up until then for me. Then it was set in New York City and that meant a greater level of charm and sophistication to me - - and since I lived there, why not? Needless to say, I was not disappointed. THE APARTMENT was everything I thought it would be. Everything the censors allowed; and everything Wilder was known to use in his scripts, including wit, charm, topical jokes and, of course, a heavy layer of cynicism.Back then I was 18. Now I'm much older and watching it again was like flipping through the pages of an old family album...and why not? As Ray Walston says in this film..."We're just like one big happy family." Here is vintage Wilder doing everything most directors avoided doing, like giving us adultery, crummy business ethics, a drunken Santa Claus, attempted suicide and more...and still making everything turn out right in the end. In between everything sparkles as not a line of dialog is wasted. Hey, that's because Wilder has done up his characters humanity-wise. Not a line or piece of music or grain of furniture is wasted in this film. Everything is made to be useful in moving the plot forward-wise. Fred MacMurray sheds his good guy image to play a two-timing heel, not above corrupting his own employees to make whoopee. Joyce Jameson does her Marilyn bit that clues us in nostalgia-wise. Edie Adams, another Monroe mimic, this time playing it cold and calculating and a snitch.Then there's the apartment itself, where a tennis racket is used to strain spaghetti and keys are left under the doormat in case the unexpected happens company-wise. The exterior featured a grand entrance, befitting an address near to Central Park. Let's see...51 W. 67th St...and bay front windows. Quite a pad for a lonely schmuck like Lemmon's character, inexpensive, too. Enter Shirley MacLaine who was just emerging from her Hal Wallis cocoon of playing sweet and nice on screen and partying with the Rat Pack off the screen, to play a kept woman to a married executive. But Shirley is worshiped from afar by Jack who thinks she's really a nice girl living at home with an older sister. So that's the plot until one Christmas Eve when all the loose ends come together and this comedy of an office workaholic trying to please all of his bosses by seeing to their libidinous needs turns itself inside out as comedy morphs into drama.All this and music to hum to theme-wise in the form of Love Theme from The Apartment. It's played on the piano at a Chinese restaurant (and what would a movie about New Yorkers be without one of these?). A pair of twin piano players named Ferrante &amp; Teicher had the hit recording of this tune and it was their biggest smash, second only to their Theme from EXODUS. Usually you remember the theme song long after you've forgotten the movie. But not with this movie. Maybe because it's so unique memory-wise, comedy-wise, and Wilder-wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Optimal Situation-Love Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The star of this movie is the apartment. An apartment that is so nice and cozy, and an apartment that is so close to a big executive office building, that every two-timing executive and philandering old bat wants the keys "just for a couple of hours, you know the situation ..." Jack Lemmon is the sleazy young employee trying to sleep his way to the top. Except in this world, he doesn't sleep himself, he just loans out the keys to his sleeping quarters.Shirley MacLaine is the sweetest most appealing young women that there could ever be. I didn't even recognize her, given her later career roles as a scold or a shrew. She is the love interest for both Lemmon and Fred MacMurray.Fred MacMurry ("My Three Sons") plays the biggest sleaze in the history of the universe. This is not a role you've ever seen him play before, but he does a job that would make Darth Vader break into a cold sweat ..The situation comedy is carried by some very clever writing and classic misinterpretations by the minor characters.This movie gives a view of executive class and career privilege that should not be forgotten by today's aspiring young investors and would-be business success stories. I'd wager that this version is closer to the truth than what you'd find in "INC" magazine, "FORBES", or "FORTUNE".10/10. see it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all a comedy, but still a fine picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, I have heard that THE APARTMENT was a comedy, however I really saw nothing particularly funny about the film. Instead, it's a drama about human nature and its darker instincts. A good film, yes, but I really can't see this as a comedy.Jack Lemmon plays a guy who is determined to get ahead at the huge insurance company where he works. His plan is to ingratiate himself to the supervisors so they'll notice him and owe him a promotion. The problem is that to do this, he lowers himself to the level of a pimp, of sorts. You see, the bosses all want to have a secret place to take their mistresses. Often this means that Lemmon is stuck outside waiting for these "men" to finish up their sexual escapades instead of sleeping or otherwise enjoying his own little apartment. However, with his eyes on the prize, no matter how thoughtless these cads are, Lemmon is always obliging.Eventually, however, the big boss (Fred MacMurray) finds out and Lemmon is happy--maybe the shenanigans can stop and he can finally have his apartment back each night. However, MacMurray, too, wants in on the love shack and his fling involves a nice lady that Lemmon has admired for some time. However, being basically a coward and power-hungry, Lemmon says nothing and goes along with MacMurray's sleazy plan.Eventually, Lemmon gets the advancements he wanted but also has a hard time living with what he's become. His neighbor's words--"do you want to be a mensch (Yiddish for 'man' or 'person')" come to haunt him. Will he continue to do just about anything for a raise? Or, will he stand up, for once, and be a man? The movie has a lot going for it. In particular, Jack Lemmon's performance is exceptional as are the other performances. In a role that is rather against type, MacMurray plays a low down dog--a character even more unlikable than the one he played in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Otherwise, excellent direction, a gritty and amazing script and some haunting music all contribute to make this an exceptional picture--though I do think it's a tiny bit overrated (given that it received so much notice at the Oscars). Still, you can't do wrong with this surprisingly adult drama from 1960--though younger kids won't enjoy it and the sexual innuendo is a reason not to let them watch it as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are more important things in life than who gets the key to the executive washroom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C.C. Baxter is a junior clerk with a giant New York insurance corporation who has found an unusual way to get on. He is the tenant of a small apartment which he allows senior executives of the firm to use for sexual assignments with their mistresses. He does this not in exchange for money but on the understanding that the managers involved will use their influence to advance his career. As a result Baxter quickly finds himself promoted from his lowly position to that of a junior executive with his own office and a key to the executive washroom. Complications arise, however, when Baxter falls in love with Fran Kubelik, the elevator girl who just happens to be the mistress of Jeff Sheldrake, the head of the company's personnel department, who has often taken Fran and his other mistresses back to Baxter's apartment. This film is in the tradition of the "sophisticated" comedies centred upon adultery and divorce which were considered very daring and risqué in the forties and fifties. Director Billy Wilder had made another film of this type, "The Seven Year Itch", several years earlier. The difference between that film and "The Apartment" perhaps reflects the growth in permissiveness which took place between the mid-fifties and the early sixties, "The Apartment" being considerably bolder in its treatment of sexual themes. In "The Seven Year Itch", Marilyn Monroe's character is the object of the fantasies of the married man who lives below her, but nothing ever takes place between them. In "The Apartment", however, although there are no bedroom scenes, we are given to understand that adulterous sex takes place in Baxter's apartment on a regular basis (to the horror of his neighbour, a Jewish doctor, who mistakenly believes that Baxter himself is the lover of all these different women). Moreover, the film is a romantic comedy which has as its heroine a woman who is conducting an affair with a married man, something that would have been unthinkable a few years previously. In this respect "The Apartment" can be seen as looking forward to the fully-fledged sex comedies of the late sixties and seventies and to modern rom-coms in which it is no longer necessary that the characters be chaste and virginal. It was also one of the first films to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace, something that has become a staple theme of modern office-based films. In other respects, however, it is rather old-fashioned. In a seventies sex comedy Baxter would probably have been presented as an attractive jack-the-lad whose pursuit of self-interest is wholly admirable, Fran as a go-getter happy to sleep with her boss all the time she thinks she is in with a chance of becoming the second Mrs Sheldrake but equally happy to throw him over when she realises he is not serious about her, and Sheldrake himself as a groovy swinger. "The Apartment" takes a more moralistic line. Baxter may not be the drunken womaniser that Dr Dreyfuss imagines him to be, but the film condemns his conniving at the sexual immorality of others for the sake of his own self-advancement. Fran is hopelessly in love with Sheldrake, even after she discovers how insincere and selfish he is. At times the comedy becomes much blacker than the average romantic comedy; Fran's suicide attempt shows how dangerous and destructive the casual philandering of a man like Sheldrake can be. Another difference between this film and the more traditional romantic comedy is that the humour is often very satirical in nature. Most of the satire is at the expense of American big business- the impersonality of big corporations (Baxter proudly announces that his firm employs more people than the total population of Natchez, Mississippi), the culture of corporate philandering, the bullying of junior staff by senior management, the snobbery of the top brass. Combined with the satire is a more serious study in character development, of how Fran overcomes her hopeless infatuation with Sheldrake and how Baxter becomes (in Dreyfuss's words) a "Mensch" by learning that his love for Fran is of more import than his selfish pursuit of success by dubious means and that there are more important things in life than who gets the key to the executive washroom. (The word "Mensch" is German for "human being"; its use in this film, and the character of Dreyfuss himself, possibly reflect Billy Wilder's own German-Jewish roots). The script is often witty and Jack Lemmon as Baxter shows just why he was regarded as being among the best comedy actors of the period. (At times, as in "Days of Wine and Roses", he got the chance to show that he could be a very good actor in serious dramas as well). Nevertheless, I am surprised that the film won the "best picture" Oscar ahead of not only "Elmer Gantry" but also "Spartacus" and "Psycho", neither of which were even nominated. It is overlong, and the character of Fran seems problematic for a modern audience. Shirley MacLaine does her best to portray her as a feisty, independent woman, but this portrayal sometimes seems at odds with the way the character is written. The fact that she remains hopelessly devoted to Sheldrake even after it becomes clear to her what a scoundrel he is can make her seem weak and passive. Perhaps the audiences of the early sixties would only accept as a romantic heroine a woman involved in an adulterous affair if it was made clear that she was truly in love with him. This is an entertaining film, which has dated better than "The Seven Year Itch", but I would not rate it as highly as Wilder's other great comedy from this period, "Some Like It Hot". 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder produced some of the best movies of all times. This one is definitely one of the best movies ever made. It's funny and it's romantic. It's tragic and it's sarcastic. It'fantastic. It swings from one genre to another, but so well balanced that you never ever mention it. The dialogs and the construction of the story are perfectly crafted. This is Billy Wilder. The way C.C. Baxter finds out, that his boss takes the very same girl in his apartment, he himself is secretly in love with. Just perfect. Jack Lemmon gives his best performance ever, among a long career of excellent acting, and so does Shirley Mc.Lane. Each role, even the smallest is perfectly casted. Just think about the girl, that tries to impersonate Marilyn Monroe or the landlady, or doctor Dreyfuss and his wife... But you should watch it the original version, because otherwise you miss a lot of the best points. If necessary try the subtitles. I recently showed it to the teenage children of a friend. Although they belong to the MTV Generation, they loved it. That finally convinced me, that quality movies are timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Delightful Movies of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On 01 November 1959, in New York, C.C. "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemon) is a popular clerk of "Consolidate Life", an insurance company with 31,259 employees. The secret of his success is a well located apartment where he lives that he sublets for his superiors, making him climb to the executive position of 2nd Administrative Assistant very early. He likes the elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), a reserved woman considered a "jackpot" among the executives. Fran is the secret lover of the director Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), a married man that seduced her convincing that he will divorce his wife to stay with her. When Fran tries to commit suicide in Baxter's apartment after a meeting with Jeff, she stays with Baxter while recovering, and he falls in love for her. Later he has to come up to a decision between his excellent position in the company and his love."The Apartment" is one of the most delightful movies of Hollywood ever and fairly ranked # 95 in IMDb. In my opinion, Billy Wilder is the best director Hollywood has ever had, and this dramatic comedy is one of his many masterpieces. The screenplay is simply perfect, developing very well each character with great lines. Shirley MacLaine is very sweet and it is impossible not falling in love for her character, who has the talent of falling in love for the wrong guy, in the wrong place and at the wrong time. Jack Lemon has another amazing performance in the role of a man that sells his soul to climb positions in his company, and redeems himself with pure love. Fred MacMurray is also excellent in the role of a seductive scum. The soundtrack presents a wonderful very well known musical theme. The list of awards, with five Oscars, another seventeen wins and eight nominations is enough to show how perfect this movie is. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Se Meu Apartamento Falasse" ("If My Apartment Speaks")Note: On 06 June 2009, I watched this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Old Apartment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment is a movie I'm not 100% sure I like or not. I just LOVE the cast mind you.. Jack Lemmon! Shirley Maclaine! Fred Macmurray! I guess it must be how sad everyone is during this movie. Oh sure, there seems to be some sort of resolvement in the end, but aside from that, everyone seems to just go through life's rituals in the most routine way possible. The ironic thing is that for the very few people that are NOT sad sacks, are the ones who are somewhat immoral, and cheating on their wives and what not. Or, when you're drunk, or both. Take a look at the Christmas party at C.C. Baxter's company during Christmas time. Compare it with any other time, where it's deadly serious and quiet. So why is it that the sadder ones have the more worries and the more happy ones seem to fly by without a care in the world? I'm not sure, and I think this is one of the problems leaves up to the viewer, which I think is quite brilliant. Jack Lemmon is, what he always seems to be, and that's brilliant. Shirley Maclaine is quite good here as well, playing with a certain edge I haven't seen her portray before. And Fred Macmurray seems to be having a ball again playing someone with absolutely no scruples whatsoever (aka Double Indemnity).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's lost a step over time, but still satisfies even if it does not surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was groundbreaking in the sense that it dealt with sexual harassment in the workplace in a way that was quite realistic for 1960. All the women are in menial jobs at the insurance company where Jack Lemmon's character works, and all of the executives are men. The executives look at their female workforce as one big harem and won't let a little thing like the fact that they are married and intend to stay that way interfere with their stepping out from time to time. This is where C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) comes in. He trades the use of his apartment to these executives in return for promotions and perks. However, Baxter has an attack of conscience when he comes face-to-face with the collateral damage that one of these executives is doing in the person of Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Fran, the elevator operator, has just found out she is one of many affairs for big boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred McMurray), whom she genuinely loves, and when she and Sheldrake quarrel in Baxter's apartment and Sheldrake leaves her some money for her troubles, unintentionally making her feel even cheaper than she already feels she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills hoping not to wake up, slipping into a coma on Baxter's bed.Things I noticed - this film has lost something with the passage of time in the shock value that was, I think, part of the original appeal. But it still has some outstanding acting, some personal redemption and transformation that people just love to see on film, and kudos to Mr. McMurray for portraying an authentic heel, leading women on and leading a double life without a tinge of conscience, phoning to inquire about his mistress' health on Christmas Day as he is busy playing with his children at home. Without this entry under his belt I would have always doubted his range as he was the perennial nice guy in almost every other role he ever had.Did you also notice a business world and a New York that is gone forever? Nobody adds numbers by hand - or by computer for that matter - any more, elevators have long been run by machines, and the entire floor of people that Baxter worked on would today be replaced by computers. Also notice that Baxter has a very middling job - at least at first - and yet lives comfortably sans roommate to share expenses in an apartment IN Manhattan. Those were the days.</fullReview>

How does he make a film that's so funny, heart-warming, heart-breaking, dark, goofy, satirical, cozy, uncomfortable and more, and make it all work? Having Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine heading up the cast certainly helps. Both actors deliver smart, charming, sweet, heartbreaking performances that add real depth in a film (by design) otherwise filled with cartoon characters (though Fred MacMurray's performance is not to be sniffed at - smiling at you like some sort of shark... Evil.)One of those films I could watch every day and never tire of it. Contains film critic Mark Cousin's favourite ever scene, incidentally (though I won't say what it is).

		<fullReview>I was genuinely surprised with this. It at first started off like any typical romance film and yet it covered many important topics that still exist in today's society. At the time this was made the understanding of it was not full comprehended, but I think it's important to consider the time it was made and what was going on in mental health at the time.Also, the photography and its filming was superb, and a clear indication of the time and effort put into making it visually interesting. I also appreciate how they don't distinctly show the self-damaging scenes that the female lead does to herself as a guessing game to what she's thinking. And even if it may not be portrayed in a light that is not understood fully, I appreciate that they interpreted it as a way for the victim to get help and to be taken care of rather than be shipped off to a psychiatrist's hospital to be drowned in pills and medication. That is so, so important to the audience so that they can understand the characters' plight.This was a worthy winner in my book. The 2 hours were well put together and appropriate for the topic at hand, and overall is stellar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Apartment" is a comedy movie which also is being combined with drama in some moments. In this movie we have a man who works in an insurance company and he wants to move up and distinguish himself from all the other lowly people. To succeed this he borrows his apartment key to his supervisors but everything changes when a romance comes in front.I liked this movie because of the plot and the whole storyline. But because I watched it now in 2015 and I have seen plenty of movies with such a plot I did not like it as much as I wanted to. I believe this happens because in some moments in the movie you understand what is going to happen. But if we think that this movie was filmed in 1960 and we "judge" it with that year's criteria then I have to say that for these times was a masterpiece. We have also a really good interpretation made by Jack Lemmon who played as C.C. Baxter, and of course we have to mention also the beautiful Shirley MacLaine's interpretation who played as Fran Kubelik.Finally I believe that "The Apartment" is a really good movie to spend your time because it combines very good comedy with drama and in some moments romance. In addition to this I have to say that from this movie we learn many things and we can think a little different after we watch it.</fullReview>

It starts as a comedy with witty setup and turns into a sensitive romantic drama leaving you smiling at the end.Jack Lemmon playing the lead who lets his apartment be used by his bosses for fun is electric. He makes you laugh on himself and feel sad for him with full conviction. From the scene where he finds out that his own crush is part of the games happening at his apartment, his transition from a funny to sensitive guy is smooth and moving. Other actors also play their part honestly. But key winners here are the delicious screenplay, witty dialogues, funny characters and master execution of Billy Wilder.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Apartment.

Baxter who tries to climb the corporate ladder by letting the company executives use his apartment for their various liaisons. The plot covers the complications that arises when the company's director also asks Baxter to add him to the list.Gleefully directed by Billy Wilder &amp; deftly scripted too, the film approaches its subject matter in a very light-hearted manner and is crisply photographed, tightly edited, splendidly scored, cleverly witted throughout the course of its runtime &amp; fabulously performed by its cast amongst which Jack Lemmon ends up impressing the most.On an overall scale, The Apartment is an elegantly crafted, endlessly entertaining &amp; exquisitely witted picture that promises loads of fun, laughter &amp; a good time and effortlessly delivers it. Movie-wise, there has never been anything like it - love-wise, laugh-wise or otherwise-wise! Delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to get ahead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The work-home boundary endures constant revision in this deceptively tough romance that asks the question, "To what degree would you allow yourself to be used, manipulated, and mistreated in the fulfillment of a goal?" In the case of Lemmon's earnest accountant, the threshold is very high. After all, how else to get ahead at a company of thirty-five-thousand employees? It's a simple transaction: executives use his apartment to entertain their mistresses while he's strung along with promises of a big promotion. He permits this arrangement because, like so many ladder-climbers, he clings to the illusion that work will provide the happiness that he lacks in his personal life. Shirley MacLaine's elevator girl desires love and hopes to find it through an office romance with the suave, double-talking Director of Personnel played by Fred MacMurray. What follows is a near-perfectly written joining together of two used people discovering, respectively, self-respect and self-worth through a relationship built on open communication and blunt honesty. Wilder depicts the corporate office as a nexus of numbing sameness, the precise square rows of desks mirrored exactly by the quadrilateral, equally spaced fluorescent lights?exactly the sort of environment that fosters Lemmon's emotional stasis and inability to break from routine. Brilliantly acted, deftly directed, and briskly edited, The Apartment points up the mercenary nature of corporate life, presenting a uniquely unsentimental romance that is honest about the difficulty of connecting with another person in a mechanized age of impersonal transactions. Charles Williams composed the memorable orchestral theme, "The Jealous Lover."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously doubt that anyone would consider a movie, which shows the story about a man, who lends his own apartment to his married, high-positioned co-workers as a secret place for their romance affair to be precisely appealing or considerably interesting. However, because of a masterful touch of the great Billy Wilder The Apartment comes as a thoroughly witty, enormously funny, plainly entertaining and deeply heartwarming film that truly deserves all of the Oscar statues that it received in 1961.In one of his most memorable roles (just after the jolly comedy Some Like It Hot), Jack Lemmon plays a sympathetic, innocent and a bit light-hearted fellow named C. C. Baxter. In order to even think about advancing in his job he starts a considerably risky 'business', and passes around the key to his peaceful and cozy apartment to all the insatiable cheating wolves working at the office. They take advantage of the situation very quickly. When one of the executives demands the key, Baxter has to leave his cozy couch right away, naturally taking into account the attractive possibilities of a promotion. To add yet another element of ridiculousness, all of the neighbors (especially the doctor living next door) see him as an emotionless womanizer, who spends each night with another (un)lucky girl. And very soon, he starts thinking about a love affair of his own. The object of Baxter's interest is an elevator girl, who, as he quickly finds out, is using THE apartment with the head of the firm. More trouble arises, when this pretty woman named Fran (Shirley MacLaine) stays there after an unsuccessful meeting with Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), takes too much sleeping pills and tries to commit suicide on Christmas Eve. This strictly ironic sequence adds an amusing twist to one controversial topic - the inhumane treatment of hard-working girls by their male employers. As for the worrying attempts at waking the girl up - Billy Wilder delivers those tense scenes in the most clever, delicate and purposely funny manner. With the help of the doctor, Baxter finally manages to rescue Fran and keeps her at the apartment until she is able to fully recover. In the process, he realizes that true love and righteousness should always stay in front of work-related problems and money.With that seemingly trivial message, it's probably not hard to see how the movie will go. But it serves its purpose, offering one of the most precious happy endings in the history of movies.All of the given performances are splendid, lively and truly convincing. Especially Shirley MacLaine shines as this naive, yet warm and hearty girl, who up until the end isn't sure what she really wants out of life. I must say that her smile made me smile every time. Jack Lemmon shows his genius comedic skills. Fred MacMurray is perfect as the home-wrecking boss, and Jack Kruschen is a nice addition as the amusing and helpful doctor.There are so many parts that account for the greatness of this production: the ingenious and scrupulous directing, a hypnotizing storyline, authentic characters, joyful music, and a numerous amount of situational gags among other things. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everlasting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder turns a limpid eye upon the swinging sixties (right there at the beginning) in New York -- cheating husbands and hard-bitten good-time girls ('the takers'); hopeful lovers and buddy boys ('those who get took') -- and from out of this mire lifts up two memorable, redeeming characters, played to perfection by Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon, at the height of their powers. As you would expect with something written for the screen by Wilder and his associate I.A.L.Diamond, the story moves through a perfect arc of comic situation, misunderstandings, misdirected desires, thwarted hopes, and on to a believable resolution that draws these elements along with it but trumps them all. The dialogue is witty, and the comedy is as broad as the satire is cutting -- one never dominates or displaces the other; we laugh and we sigh at once. There are one or two lacunae in the action -- coffee that should scald; old cooked spaghetti that should no longer be limp -- but to focus on these, and ignore the much that is real and effective, would be a terrible mistake. The scenes of Miss Kubelik and Mr Baxter alone together are quite wonderful. 'I was Robinson Crusoe,' Baxter tells her at one point, 'shipwrecked among eight million people, till I saw a footprint in the sand and looked up to find you.' Among a million films, I would suggest, this one will leave a lasting imprint on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Story and More Shut Up And Deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has so many good things that it is hard to list them all. Besides having Writer/Director Billy Wilder behind this, the cast is about as good as it gets. Jack Lemmon &amp; Shirley MacLaine are at the top of their careers in this one. Billy Wilder is still on top though Some Like It Hot is better. The supporting cast is a who's who of supporting cast. Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian), David Tate (Bewitched's Larry Tate), Fred MacMurray (My Three Sons), Jack Kruschen (many great supporting roles, Edie Adams (sort of an add on) populate it.It does work out to be a love story as MacLaine attempts suicide at one point because she is in love with a married man (MacMurray). MacMurray is Lemmons boss.The central plot is Lemmon owns a well located apartment and is willing to share it with other men in the office to use as a sort of Brothel in exchange for promotions at the office. The more he passes around the apartment key, the more involved he gets in their lives. MacClaine is an elevator operator he is interested in. Then so is his boss and he is trying to walk a fine line between wanting her and wanting his job and promotions.Lemmon pulls off this role very well and the movie is so well done it won Best Picture the year it was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really great, but not quite perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to begin with saying that this film was very well-done. I'm not going to elaborate on that -- I'm no film expert, and anyway, that's what professional critics are for. What I really want to talk about is something else, something more about the film's overall narrative structure than about the cinematography or directing or acting.The movie starts out looking like some kind of light satire, having a laugh or two about those womanizing executives or what-have-you. But the story soon begins to take on more dimensions -- romance appears, the satire begins get more serious, dramatic elements are introduced... These new aspects of the story absolutely make the movie what it is and give it the depth it needs to be fully satisfying. That the writers were able to bring all these pieces together while still bringing plenty of comedy to the mix is a true testament to their talent and craftsmanship.But around the middle of the movie, I began worrying about where it was all heading. Basically, my concern was that the writers were going to sacrifice the integrity of the story for the sake of the audience. Baxter is such a sympathetic, likable character that I couldn't help but wanting things to turn out all right for him, and I suspect that many viewers would feel the same way. In a lesser movie, Fran would surely "fall in love" with Baxter by the end of the film, maybe as soon as when she is recovering from her suicide attempt. Baxter would then be inspired to stand up to his mean old boss, and... you get the picture. Yet aesthetically, that sort of ending would just feel too tidy and predictable for a story as broad as this one. So even though emotionally I wanted Baxter to get the girl, intellectually I began praying that he wouldn't.So, as it turned out, the film ended somewhere in between. The ending to the film was well-handled, but still I found it a little too compact for my liking. If it had ended just one scene earlier, with Fran leaving Sheldrake at the New Year's Eve party, I would've been fine with it. But the last scene in Baxter's apartment felt unnecessary and forced, as though the writers just couldn't stand to end the story without some romantic payoff. This was probably intended to provide narrative closure, but ironically it left me less satisfied than a more ambiguous ending would have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing and charming movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not an exaggerated or over-the-top screwball comedy but more one that amuses with its cute story and characters. This all is also where the movie is getting its charm from. This movie is some good old fashioned entertainment, that is maintaining to watch throughout. It has a simple concept but likable story, that also works out due to its characters and actors portraying them.Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine were a great screen-couple. They were cute together, more than anything else. Next to that, they are obviously two more than capable actors, who help to carry the movie and its story along. Their characters are both also well written ones and not some typical perfect Hollywood type of characters. They feel more real and very natural. It helps to make the movie a warm one, with a charming feel and atmosphere to it.The movie is mostly being amusing for its first half. After that the movie starts to become more serious and somewhat more dramatic. It's a bit of a shame, since it seemed to me that the film-makers were having difficulties trying to find the right balance between its comedy and drama during its second half. The movie its second half was definitely being less entertaining and also less interesting to watch, also because you of course already know half way through were this movie is heading to and how it is going to end.But other than that, it's still a movie that I liked watching throughout and is one that I can recommend whole heartily to everybody. But what else did you expect from a movie directed by the great Billy Wilder.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I used to live like Robinson Crusoe; I mean, shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand, and there you were.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great number of Wilders' films revel in the dichotomy between those who are capable of manipulating the system and those who the system manipulates. As Shirley MacClaine notes in her heartbreaking role as Fran Kubilek, "Some people take, some people get took. And they know they're getting took and there's nothing they can do about it". The Apartment is perhaps the first time Wilder gives us a protagonist who belongs in this second group. C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a man whose will to succeed in the workplace casts a dark shadow upon his private life. But rather than manipulate the system in order to meet his own ends in the manner of the central figures from Wilder's Stalag 17, Double Indemnity and Ace in the Hole, Baxter allows himself to be manipulated in the hope that it will eventually lead to happiness. However, given the vein of cynicism which runs through even Wilder's most optimistic films it is clear from the offset that such a way of living will not end well.Desperate to 'get ahead' in the New York office in which he works, Baxter grants the use of his apartment for extra-marital trysts to his superiors. In doing so he gives up any chance of a happy private life. Baxter's loneliness pervades through every frame of this film. We see him alone in the cold outside his apartment waiting for its occupants to vacate. We see how he spends the majority of his evenings ? working late or companionless in front of the television. This empty private life leads him to focus on his work, where he is just another office drone lost in a sea of desks. Work does afford Baxter some degree of happiness; it is his opportunity to flirt with the pretty elevator operator Miss Kubilek, with whom he is madly in love. This happiness is short-lived as he soon discovers that his boss Mr Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) has reignited an old love affair with Miss Kubilek -- that he himself has sanctioned by allowing them to use his apartment.This film has many great scenes and moments, but one which stands out is the well crafted way that Baxter makes this discovery. Its genius lies in the organic way in which the audience is kept one step ahead of Baxter ? we know that the pocket mirror Baxter finds in his apartment and returns to Mr Sheldrake belongs to Miss Kubilek. Furthermore, we know that in a later scene when Miss Kubilek loans the mirror to Baxter he will put two and two together. This clever piece of scripting is well matched by Lemmon who is reduced from clowning about in his new hat, to subtle sense of disappointment.There's no doubt that Lemmon brings it in every scene. Yes, his comedic timing is perfect - but it is his canny ability to communicate Baxter's isolation and loneliness that gives the film its heart. In many ways Baxter is an unlikeable character. He values his job over everything else, he gives his consent to many acts of infidelity (despite never having the opportunity for infidelity himself) and as shown by his desire for an office and his new hat, he is clearly a materialist; but Lemmon's performance kept me routing for Baxter. His joy at having Miss Kubilek to stay later in the film (even under such drab circumstances) is a glimpse at the kind of man he could be if only he could get his priorities in order. Perhaps the reason this film is such an enduring classic is that Wilder seems more concerned not with the central romance of the story, but of Baxter's journey from a contemptible careerist to a 'mensch' ? a good human-being. Lemmon's performance is a wonderful document of this process. Only in his late career role as Shelley Levene in Glengarry Glen Ross does Lemmon come close to transferring such pathos onto the screen.This is to say nothing of Shirley MacClaine, who offers a complex multi-layered performance moving from quick witted and amiable to naive and emotionally and psychologically distraught. She is aided by Wilder's typically brilliant dialogue (in a script co-written by I. A. L. Diamond) which keeps the audience guessing what her feelings towards Baxter really are. There is no doubt she is carelessly and hopelessly in love with the loathsome Mr Sheldrake, but the audience is left guessing what her feelings towards Baxter really are. This ambiguity is held right until the fantastic final line of dialogue in the film. Ultimately, one is left with a somewhat bittersweet taste in one's mouth, which perhaps contributes to the fact that this is not a popular Christmas film ? that and all the infidelity on the screen; but there's no doubt it should be. This charming, smart film is Wilder's best and there can scarcely be a better recommendation than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a classic and as sad and as funny today as it was in 1960</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no hesitation in voting this film ten out of ten. I have seen this film numerous times but not in the last ten years but for me, my view will not have changed and it will not seem dated. I know this because this is a classic and its beauty is in its simplicity. This does not mean that it was rushed or thrown together but exactly the opposite. You can see and feel the care and attention to detail that went into its creation. The result is more than a total of its constituent parts which for me is a sign of a very good film and it really has a magical quality. So many so called comedies whenever they were made just don't measure up in comparison but that is good because if comedies were all bad or all excellent this would not stand out as it rightly does. All of the numerous people who were responsible for this beautiful creation should be justly proud because fifty years after it was made it will still be delighting new viewers. The story is quite rightly based around the title but really it is a character study of virtually all of the main characters who include the good and the bad and a lot of people in between. I could not envisage the film being improved whether it was at the time or 2010 when this review was written. To anybody watching this film for the first time just relax, tune in to the humour and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Hail Billy Wilder...and watch this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this ties with Sunset Boulevard as King Wilder's greatest movies. I cannot explain the feeling of anticipation that I feel as those views of Manhattan come into view, and Jack Lemmon's dry voice-over talks to me.If you've never seen a Billy Wilder movie, see this. You will see why he has influenced Kevin Spacey, Alan Ball, and countless others whose films we experience today. For example, Kevin Spacey's voice-over in American Beauty ('This is my street...This is my life. In one year, I'll be dead') was inspired by Sunset Boulevard, and of course, in The Apartment, Jack Lemmon as the narrator also organises events and plot. He introduces us to him and his life - we see his home, his work, his life - just like Alan Ball's AB screenplay.The Apartment is filled with great set-pieces, great acting (Shirley Maclaine is amazing), great lines - what more could you want from a movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong Best Picture Winner to Start Off the 1960s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder earned writing and directing Oscars in this creative film that is as dark as it is illuminating. Jack Lemmon (Oscar-nominated) tries to make his way up the corporate ladder in a most unusual way---by letting high-class executives use his apartment for extra-marital affairs. Lemmon looks at the situation as an inconvenience, but accepts it until he learns that his boss (Fred MacMurray in a cold supporting turn) is having an affair with the elevator attendant (Shirley MacLaine in an Oscar-nominated role). This hurts Lemmon as he has always had a school-boy-type crush on the beautiful young woman. When MacLaine learns that MacMurray's antics were lustful instead of loving, sparks fly as the film twists into a dark place. Jack Kruschen also received a curious Oscar nod as Lemmon's neighbor. Wilder was the master of films that seem comical on first glance, but were really biting dramas that are thought-provoking and sometimes deal with very strong subject matter. "The Apartment" is one of his truly best films and it simply out-classed lesser competition in 1960 as it took home five Oscars in all. Not a film without flaws, but still a very emotional and deep cinematic experience. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent satire from Wilder....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Apartment' plays out as a satire of ethics and big business. At least thats what I got out of it. It has razor sharp dialogue and well defined characters. Honestly, the first half is quite funny. What surprised me is how the movie takes a serious turn and becomes more dramatic in the second half. What makes the film brilliant, however, is how smoothly it makes the transition. The credit goes to the writing and directing of Wilder(who hopefully won't be forgotten by later generations). It wouldn't be fair to talk about this movie without talking about the great performances, most notably by Jack Lemmon(who also did 'Some Like it Hot' with Wilder) and Shirley MacLaine. MacLaine's performance really delighted me. It delighted me because she was able to gain my sympathy by giving an always honest performance. She never plays the melodrama, and I am thankful for that. Her relationship with Lemmon is what propels the movie the best. The Christmas Eve scene is absolutely fantastic. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic comedy with a dark core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just bought 'The Apartment' on DVD and what a treat it is. There are just so many reasons to like this movie, but there are two aspects which make this a classic in my opinion. For starters, there are the performances of the two leads - Jack Lemmon crackles with nervous energy, and Shirley Maclaine positively glows. The latter gives one of the most beautifully understated performances ever filmed in the $100 bill scene. That look!Secondly, there's a very dark streak that runs through this film. The themes of loneliness, infatuation, misogyny and suicide are wrapped up in a sparkling romantic comedy, and yet somehow it never loses balance or pace for the whole of its two hours. No film better illustrates the genius of Billy Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty years later, this film is as much a breath of fresh air as the day it was released. The social ills and seedy underside of office politics wear different disguises these days, but underneath they are still the same. Briefly, Jack Lemmon is an aspiring clerk who lends the 'use' of his apartment to corporate executives in exchange for career advancement. Simulataneously, he has fallen in love with an elevator operator, Shirley MacLaine, who while on the surface appears sweet and innocent is in fact having an affair herself with the biggest exec of them all, Fred MacMurray. They too of course, make use of The Apartment. From there, the plot turnarounds and discoveries are quite simply perfectly written, acted and directed. A great musical score and quirky memorable supporting characters make a good thing better. What particulalry makes this film so timeless is the uncredited main character, New York City, looking very much as it does today. Enjoy, this is the class of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing and inspirational piece of cinema...Pure butter!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any male or female actor, director, or screenwriter should sit down and take notes on this movie. It is brilliant in innumerable ways. The acting takes the impeccable screenplay to so many levels. Just watch Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine's eyes in so many scenes. There is a magic subtlety that keeps the movie honest and free of cheese. CC Baxter (Jack Lemmon)is not a perfect, harmless romantic lead. His kindness goes almost so far that he confuses his morals with his ambition. His loneliness is real, as well as his good intent gone frequently wrong. The real romance doesn't even occur until the end, and when it happens, it is restrained in the most compelling way. It leaves you hopeful, and not overwrought with gooy emotion. When Baxter makes the selfless sacrifices he does, you are left with that wonderous feeling of someone having done a genuinely good thing. You really watch him become "a mensch." It always makes me smile. And just think, a classic movie that deals with adultery, suicide, loneliness, and corporate america achieves it with no swearing, violence, or sex scenes. I am not someone who dissaproves of any of those things in movies, it's just nice to know that it can be done. Anyway, I personally can watch this repeatedly and get something new out of it every time. Kudos to Lemmon, Wilder, McMurray, McLaine, and everyone else involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>41 years later, 'fooling around' hasn't changed all that much (... or so they tell me. Ahem!) The ambiance and liabilities have been reengineered over the years, but the lines and the lies are pretty much the same. I missed The Apartment during its original run in the theaters due to being 9. . . well that plus the Catholic Church had it on the condemned list by their legion of decency back then due to adulterous themes. I was sneaking out to see certain films despite age and authority prohibitions of the times. Anyway: I figured I was old enough now.MacLaine, Lemmon and MacMurray earned every award they ever won. Click on their name on the IMDB site and scan the resume of each. These are talented character actors. Frances Weintraub Lax (the landlady) was excellent as well, but I sense she may have been born for that particular role. For a couple of hours - they ARE the people they portray. So often today, casting directors find material for today's superstars that complement their real life personalities so they can shine in the role. That'd be "pretending" rather than acting. Big difference. and therein lies the beauty of films that endure through the ages.This is one of those. 9 / 10. Mi gusto.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Apartment" was made over 40 years ago, but I think it is the best romantic comedy that I have ever seen. Anyone writing a romantic comedy screenplay should watch this movie for inspiration. Jack Lemmon plays C.C. `Bud' Baxter, an accountant at an insurance company who lends his apartment out to executives for their extra marital activities, in order to get a promotion. Shirley MacLaine plays Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator at Bud's workplace who has a relationship with the insurance company's personnel director, but also gets involved with Jack Lemmon's character. Both lead actors were excellent. This is a great Christmas season movie as well. I rated this movie 9 out of 10. If I were a bigger romantic comedy fan, I'd give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw "The Apartment", I felt pretty disappointed as I was expecting a hilarious romp in the mode of "Some Like It Hot". After repeated viewings, however, I've began to appreciate it.This is basically a very melancholy story, but it's ever so beautifully told and filled with memorable details that lighten the film irresistibly, such as the straining of spaghetti with a tennis racket. Lemmon is great--as usual--and MacLaine, who I found annoying in "The Trouble with Harry", is simply adorable here. The exquisite performances and Wilder's smooth direction make this an enjoyable experience. (The dialogue is constantly lively, too.)

I hadn't seen it for many years until recently, and I'm glad to report that it has remained as charming as always, and the social satire about corporate manipulation is as fresh as ever. Billy Wilder is a genius, and this is one of his best! Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine were never better. Jack Lemmon has just enough naiveté that he can make pimping for his bosses seem innocent, and the audience can understand how a decent hardworking Everyman could get involved in the corporate sleaze. Shirley MacLaine is brilliant, realizing that "she's getting took, and there's nothing she can do about it." The screenplay is caustic, yet charmingly warmhearted, and extremely wise. Nearly fifty years have not diminished The Apartment's luster. Rather, it makes most modern satirical comedy-dramas suffer in comparison. It is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST romantic/comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have yet to see a romantic comedy of its scope and appeal. Though "The Apartment" was made many years ago, it can still carry its weight entertainment-wise. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine were at their all-time best. Not a moment lags; each is filled with wit and/or pathos. A must see for any film student studying romantic genre. So many of the romantic/comedies of today lack the peak into real lives the way this film does. Even in black and white, the sensitivity and beauty shine through. A must see for the Christmas season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This deserving winner of the Best Picture Oscar is by far the best depiction of the average Joe, working his way up the ladder of success.Unlike other Wilder comedies, like Some Like It Hot or The Seven Year Itch, The Apartment is not meant to be funny. The film is such a precise dissection of the bourgeois that it models the shreds of humor that enter our lives no matter no matter how grim or rose-colored the situation is; and that humor becomes evident through the eye of the camera. The perfect example is the ideosyncratic phrase "Be a mensch", sounds silly but presented in a serious context.The Apartment features an impressive triumvirate of stars: Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray; all giving some of their best acting.Best supporting actor recipient Jack Kruschen, playing the annoyed neighbor, steals all of his scenes. Put aside the film's archaic view of women and enjoy this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and well structured expose of office work in the fifties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie for three reasons. First, it is a not-so-simple love story that is both entertaining and dramatic and therefore well scripted. Second, it is well cast - the players are suited to the parts and bring them off very well. Though I do cringe a little at Jack Lemon in his many roles, like this one, in which he "gets took". Third, it is a wonderful expose of commercial office life in the 1950s. Those massive floors full of clerical workers have disappeared today, replaced by computers, and gone with them is the hierarchical office culture of the period. My only reservation is that the male figures in senior management are completely nasty - straw men against whom to contrast the Lemmon character. Perhaps such people did tend to rise to the top of that populous corporate jungle. In all, though, one of the great films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such elementary concepts as a creative plot, appealing characters and good acting seem to be lost on modern cinema, who throw out totally cliche and uninspired romantic comedies. But those of you who are in the mood for that and something good should check out the Apartment. The plot is creative and at the end leaves you with a surprise ending. Jack Lemmon, who we all know from the Odd Couple, is the everyday Joe, but he is a funny and cool Joe. Shirley MacLaine is the girl next door, but she is a funny and cool girl next door. Fred MacMurray is the no good manipulative corporate executive, but his character manages to fool us in the process and isn't the evil incarnate that modern day bad guys are. The plot is filled with many twists and is just the right mix of drama and comedy. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a delightful movie! It has all the right ingredients for a modern-day tale of an insurance clerk's big-city life. His big career ambitions are earning him an undeserved reputation of a rake by his neighbors. But in reality, he is really a very decent fellow whose only flaw is an unrestrained romantic heart. Jack Lemmon plays J.J. Baxter (a.k.a. "buddy boy')just perfectly. Shirley MacLaine is the love interest, and Fred MacMurray is surprisingly good in one of those rare roles for him. There is bittersweet romance, and there is plenty of humor and satire. The social setting may seem outdated now, especially in the area of men's predatory attitudes towards women in the work place. But maybe it is only a matter of degree of sophistication. At any rate, like the doctor in this movie says, "Be a human being!"... and see The Apartment. I guarantee you will be well rewarded!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bud: "Your mirror ... it's broken".Fran: "I know. It shows me as I'm feeling".So what else is there to say about this best film of all times? Yet 40 years after its filming it is still the saddest, most sentimental and melancholy comedy / the funniest, most romantic and ironic tragedy ever banned on the screen; perfectly bittersweet. Even now, after seeing "The Apartment" a dozen of times, I'm still amazed about the ingenious screenplay, the fine elaborated characters, brilliant acting and the beguiling music of Adolf Deutsch (don't care about his name!). Remember these unforgettable scenes: Baxter cooking spaghetti with his tennis-racket, Sheldrake giving Fran a hundred dollar note as a Xmas present, Baxter sitting in pyjamas at night in Central Park, the Champagne scene in the end (the first time I saw it I was really shocked!). Shirley MacLaine never again has been so tempting and vulnerable, Jack Lemmon was the only Hollywood actor that time who could play the whole range of this role (Laugh, Bajazzo, laugh!), and Fred MacMurray is the worst, most unscrupulous guy of film history. Of course - as it is often said - the happy end is very unlikely, but makes the night of New Years Eve shine bright ... a film with the buoyancy of a bird and - please! - never filmed as a remake with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.10; Film of the Millenium.

The movie speaks to all who contemplate the inner heroics involved in dealing with the humdrum--and somewhat lonely--life of an average man. I loved Jack Lemmon's character as much as any character I've encountered in movies. In thinking about him, I am reminded of Ernest Borgnine's character in the movie "Marty," another good man dealing with a less than desirable life. Shirley MacLaine is excellent in this movie as the vulnerable young woman dealing with a secret life.</fullReview>

The fact that it is in black and white only helps to add poignancy to the final scenes. Oh! And what is that carol being sung as Lemmon decides what is really important to him in life?

		<shortDescription>A story about abuse, mostly, with an ending that could just be happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie, this one. It shows one of those big American companies with lots of floors, each one a symbol of corporate success, with employees trying their best to please their employers, where women are employed only as secretaries, phone operators or elevator girls (because they can type, but can't spell) and their only true chance for success is to attract the attention of a man with money. There is even a scene with a really black man shining the shoes of a company director and thanking for a tossed coin.It is interesting to see how 50 years ago people were basically doing the same thing we do, only marginally less civilized. They had TV, obnoxious landlords, oven dinners (already packaged to be thrown in and prepared), electric blankets and computing machines. Of course, they needed a man to operate the machine and they all worked with paper, but still, no change there.The story itself is a romance between employees, and what I really enjoyed about the movie was that up until the end, things could have gone either way. Actually, I have a feeling the original story would have a different ending, one that would preclude the one in the movie, because then it would feel more real, add more meaning.Bottom line: great acting, great script, a very interesting look into a past that someone like me did never know except from movies, one that feels so frighteningly similar to the present, yet looks completely different. I recommend this to just about everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy? Drama? Sublime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment is not terribly funny. While some of the banter is sufficiently witty , some of the jokes and gags feel forced and awkward, especially in the second half of the movie.And that's exactly what gives the movie its power. For much of the second half takes place after a near suicide. As many people who've witnessed such a situation know, one way people deal with this is through awkward attempts at humor to lift the spirits of the person affected. Such mild and playful comedy in The Apartment, such as straining spaghetti through a tennis racket and a story of being shot in the knee, may not make for side-splitting laughs. But it does resonate with anyone who's had to cope with this sort of emergency.The crisis is thrust upon meek, agreeable C.C. "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemmon), an ordinary premium accountant working at Consolidated Life insurance company (a not-too-subtle jab at Met Life). He is eager to leave his mind-numbing job amid a sea of desks and move up the ranks of the company. To this end, he lends out his flat to married executives who want a little on the side but don't wish to sign a hotel register.This eventually includes Baxter's boss, Mr. Sheldrake. This part is played by Fred MacMurray, who was at that time known for playing smiling suburban fathers. That's how the character might seem in the beginning, but over the course of the movie Mr. Sheldrake reveals himself to be a breathtakingly manipulative, domineering villain.Baxter also wants very much to win the heart of Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), a pixie-like elevator operator who is friendly, cheeky, but ultimately vulnerable. She likes Baxter in passing, but is focused on getting over a relationship that she tries in vain to keep in the past.After the crisis, Baxter has to face his own complicity in the situation and must make a difficult decision. One choice is to continue to appease his superiors, which he knows would cement his position as a doormat and make him give up the woman he loves. The other is to stand up for himself and lose everything he's worked for.The atmosphere, the writing, the soundtrack and the acting all fit together to make The Apartment near ecstasy on celluloid. The parts are all played well, but the standout has to be Shirley MacLaine. Those who were unimpressed by her somewhat over-the-top performances in "Sweet Charity" and "Terms of Endearment" would be amazed. She plays Fran Kubelik with such subtlety and authenticity that it makes her plight enormously compelling.Several critics, looking back at classic films, have labeled The Apartment dated. I find it hard to agree with them. Yes, the ideas of elevator girls, punch card IBM machines and house calls from doctors are all dated. But the story is about trying to succeed without losing your humanity. And that's timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Apartment" endures as a classic film due to its great acting and writing. Jack Lemmon, as usual, is a master of comic delivery, and this is no exception ("...the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.") Shirley MacLaine is superb here, delivering a very real and believable performance as the unlucky-in-love girl, and to think she didn't win an Oscar is a crime. The interactions between her and Lemmon on the screen are the single best elements of this film, in my opinion. With great dialogue like this, there's no doubt in my mind why the film won Oscars for its original screenplay and Best Picture. Nearly everything about the film is believable, and many of us could picture these events happening in our own lives, like it or not. I do not necessarily agree with the underlying theme of adultery and the affairs people are having in this apartment, but I still managed to enjoy many aspects of this film. It's never dull for a minute, and the dialogue and events keep me fascinated the entire time. Little nuggets, such as Lemmon's famous use of a tennis racket to strain spaghetti, make this a classic. Not absolutely perfect, since some scenes can be more intense and difficult to watch, but still enjoyable. I love the romantic comedy feel this film acquires by the end. Well-written and acted, and recommended to just about any movie lover.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dramedy Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Billy Wilder scored a gem with this smooth, highly entertaining dramedy. Jack Lemmon is a mild-mannered company man trying to get ahead by lending his apartment to executives bitten by the extramarital love bug. Things take an unexpected turn when boss Fred MacMurray borrows the place one night and leaves behind his suicidal mistress, the lovely Shirley MacLaine. After she unsuccessfully tries to take her life with a dozen sleeping pills, Lemmon must nurse her back to full health. This leads to a few sparks, and soon MacLaine must choose between the good guy Lemmon and the powerful but seemingly non-committal MacMurray.Not many films can pull off the blend of comedy and drama merged in THE APARTMENT. Full credit must go to the masterful performers, particularly MacLaine and the perky Lemmon, who easily draw our empathy with their diverse performances. High marks also go to the writers, who deliver original, clever dialog and three-dimensional characters who could have easily been much less comprehensive. And Wilder, best known for bringing us SOME LIKE IT HOT, provides solid direction while getting the most out of everyone involved. Those who don't often watch older movies will be surprised at how well this one holds up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE APARTMENT ***** Billy Wilder had been on a winning streak with such films as "Witness For The Prosecution," "Some Like It Hot," and then this comedy gem that is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The story is this: In order to get his way up the work chain, a hard-working, hapless New Yorker (Jack Lemmon) finds himself "renting" out his apartment to married men (aka his work superiors) for them to have illicit love affairs during the week. Indeed, he gets the job title he dreamed of getting - working alongside Big Boss Fred MacMurray - but the fact that MacMurray insists on using his apartment to engage in his own affair as well makes Lemmon's outside-of-working hours continually interfered with. 25-year-old Shirley MacLaine, who plays MacMurray's emotionally distraught girlfriend, is whom Lemmon falls in love with, making the situation even thicker. Lemmon is fantastic; MacLaine is irresistible; MacMurray is fine too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Could Easily Take Place Today!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched THE APARTMENT many times and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine. What strikes me is that although this movie came out in 1960, it could easily have taken place today. That is because of the events shown in the film such as nepotism and people trying to get ahead in life via immoral means as well as general misunderstandings. While the setting in the movie mainly takes place in an insurance company (as well as someone's apartment), I find that the setting could very well be any large organization.The basic movie premise is this: Jack Lemmon plays an insurance clerk in a big insurance building in New York. He wants to get promoted and finds that the way to be noticed is to lend the key for his apartment to his "superiors" so they can have a place for their extra marital affairs. In exchange for that, the bosses give glowing reviews about him (Jack Lemmon). Fred MacMurray, who plays the corporate head honcho in the building, hears about what Jack Lemmon is doing and promotes him so HE can have a key for Jack Lemmon's apartment. This is because Fred MacMurray is having an extra marital affair with an elevator girl played by Shirley MacLaine. This creates problems because Jack Lemmon has eyes for her too. Without giving away too much more of the plot, I just want to say that the rest of the film deals with Jack Lemmon realizing what he has gotten himself into as well as the fact that he has to deal with all the complaints from the next door neighbors and the landlady.Now I want to make some comments about THE APARTMENT itself. While it is labeled as a comedy, it is really more of a drama. Actually, none of the incidents themselves are funny. What IS funny (or perhaps ironic would be a better term) is that the characters think they know exactly what is going on when in fact, they don't but the viewer does. For instance, Jack Lemmon's next door neighbor, who is a Jewish doctor, and his wife think that Jack Lemmon is having affairs every night when in fact, we know that he is not having the affairs at all but it is all of his bosses who are. Another example involving the doctor next door is when Jack Lemmon notices Shirley MacLaine in his bed after she had overdosed on sleeping pills. The Doctor assumes that Jack Lemmon dumped her and got "another dame" when we know that he was not home and that it was Fred MacMurray who left her there. There are many more examples of this very thing I am mentioning. For instance, there is a scene where the landlady assumes that Jack Lemmon had "army maneuvers" one night because of all the racket she heard from his apartment and he replies "I'll never invite those people again." She accuses him of waking the doctor up. What is ironic is that we as the viewer KNOW that "those people" were Jack Lemmon and the Doctor as they try to wake Shirley MacLaine up after her overdose by pacing around the apartment.Some of the other scenes I love in this movie are when Jack Lemmon is going crazy at work trying to accommodate the schedule for all his bosses while he is sick with the fever and when he is cooking an Italian dinner while singing music by the composer Tchaikowsky. What is especially funny in this scene is how he drains the spaghetti; he does so with a tennis racket.One of the things I find about THE APARTMENT is that there are many things I have caught on repeated viewings. For instance, there is a scene towards the end of the movie where Jack Lemmon is packing up and we see his tennis racket. That in itself is not significant. What is though is that we see a strand of spaghetti in it, which undoubtedly relates to the scene earlier on when he was using the racket to drain the spaghetti.The acting in this movie is terrific. I especially want to point out Fred MacMurray because this is one of the few movies where he played a heel. He did it so well that apparently, shortly after the release of THE APARTMENT, he took his daughters on a trip to Disney Land. While there, a fan said "I went with my daughter to see THE APARTMENT. How could you do that? You ruined the Disney image." Apparently, Fred MacMurray was very affected by it because he never played a heavy after that. It is also worth noting that Ray Walston, who later on became known for "My Favorite Martian," played one of the adulterous executives in THE APARTMENT. This movie was a big hit for Billy Wilder, who directed the movie. It is worth noting that this movie came out a year after SOME LIKE IT HOT, which was also a big hit for Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder. In conclusion, I would like to say that I never tire of THE APARTMENT and like to watch it every chance I can.</fullReview>

So to climb the corporate ladder, he decides to lend his apartment to his superiors as a place for them to take their "women on the side."

Jack Lemmon, in the lead, is absolutely brilliant and wonderfully entertaining and sympathetic to watch, it was a shame when I decided to look him up and found out he died a few years back.

Amazing memorable lines in this movie is what makes it so special. It isn't just hearts and flowers romantic, it's deeper. It's about two people finding each other in a chaotic, unromantic, unaccepted atmosphere. Fran (Maclaine) just wants to be desperately loved and has been willing to accept an affair with a married man who doesn't care about her, just to have the warmth of another(we can all relate to that we all want to be needed and fulfilled). C.C. (lemmon) just wants to find someone who will accept his idiosyncratic personality not with a spoonful of sugar, but straight, the bad with the good. This is a movie that hides pain behind laughter. Billy wilder is amazing. It makes me wonder if these are somewhat occurrences that happened in his life? You feel for these hapless loners and when they get together, it makes the world feel right. It's just a hysterical, touching, heartwarming experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many of the jokes and quirks are a bit contrived and obvious. Sometimes the payoffs can be spotted minutes ahead of when they're used, but I find it difficult to name any other movie that makes the audience feel so good by the end. This was the first movie I saw Jack Lemmon in, and his performance as the ambitious but love-struck C.C. Baxter hits the perfect tone of uncertainty. The difficulty that his character goes through in trying to balance his morals with career success always teeters back and forth and makes it so easy to empathize with his character not matter what his decision.Unlike many of the 'boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy get girl back' formulaic plots that are so common today, 'The Apartment' sparkles with originality. Shirley MacLaine's Miss Kubelik doesn't fall for Baxter at first sight but actually never considers him a prospect. They're both so concerned with getting what they think they want, they don't realize that they love each other. That tension is always in their scenes, which makes the movie so much more compelling than traditional love stories. I won't reveal the ending, but Baxter's final decision is ennobling and speaks toward our better-halves. I have yet to meet a person who doesn't love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For as many times as I've sat through this film, it never ceases to always cheer me up. To think that a film made close to forty years ago can still do that is simply amazing. Billy Wilder made this film coming hot off the heels of a another smash hit, the immortal Some Like It Hot. For its day, The Apartment took plenty of risks with its storyline: marital infidelity, chauvanism, attempted suicide and the like. Jack Lemmon plays the first of what would ultimately become the comic "everyman" role that he'd be so pigeonholed in later, the role of a overworked and underpaid corporate businessman who lends his bachelor pad out to the fellows in the office so they can "score" with their "dates" and he can "score" with a promotion. Even though this film is classified as a comedy, I still come to see it as a "black" one at that. I don't want to give too much away, but if you can make it past the dated-ness and the somewhat drabness of the sets and color, you will surely enjoy it! After all, when Sam Mendes was filming American Beauty in 1999 he cited The Apartment and Billy Wilder as one of his inspirations for that film, so you know that this just has to be good!The Apartment was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning five including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Jack Lemmon lost the Oscar to Burt Lancaster's portrayal as fiery evangelist Elmer Gantry and Shirley MacLaine lost the Oscar to Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal as wanton sex kitten Gloria Wandrous in Butterfield 8.All in all, this is a wonderful example of a film from an America that was just poised to come into the Kennedy era, an era that we can now look back on and see the mirror (and our illusions of that great and magical time) as shattered in itself.My rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

In "The Apartment", they have created a funny, yet poignantfilm that truly deserved its Oscar for best picture of 1960. C.C.Baxter (Lemmon), works for a huge insurance company. He's obsessed with minutia - it's Baxter's voice we hear in the opening sequences that gleefully informs us of some of the more impressive statistics about where he works. However, he feels trapped in his job. He's eager for promotion. He is a bachelor and lives alone in anapartment block. As a favour to a select number of office managers, he 'loans' out his apartment to them for' trysts' There's Joe Dobisch and Vanderhoff,wonderfully played by Ray Walston and Willard Waterman respectively. For this, they promise to recommend him to Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), forpromotion. This happens - but at a price. Sheldrake wants his own 'key' toBaxter's apartment. What transpires from there on in is hilarious. As usual in a Wilder/Diamond script, there are some very funny lines - for me, it's whenLemmon says: "...that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise that is". Specialmention too, to Jack Kruschen who plays Baxter's next door neighbour, Dr.Dreyfuss. As funny as it is, it's also a razor-sharp observation of corporate life in mid fifties America. I've seen this film many times, and it never fails to crack me up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely TERRIFIC MOVIE!!!! I have always loved Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine... and together under the direction of Billy Wilder, it's absolute MAGIC! This movie had me laughing hysterically ("I'm Mrs. MacDougal! Margie to you...") and crying tears of sadness and joy. Fred MacMurray is positively evil in this movie... I threw a couple pairs of shoes at the TV screen when he went to Baxter and made the comment about taking a girl out for laughs and right away thinking you're going to marry her. It definitely went against type-casting, but he was wonderful! Also, Ray Walston as Joe Dobish... Ray's one of my favorite actors, not simply because of things like "My Favorite Martian", but because of his devilishly delightful role as Satan in "Damn Yankees" (my favorite all-time film). Ray always brings something special to his roles. And now onto Shirley MacLaine... one of the finest actresses this world has ever seen. She does such a wonderful job playing Fran Kubelik. You just want to cry right along with her whenever Sheldrake's being such a pain... and then when she's running to C.C.'s apartment... the look on her face is priceless!!!! And Jack Lemmon... the world has lost one of it's finest actors, I will tell you that. He's absolutely perfect in the role of C.C. Baxter... his mannerisms... his execution... he's so delightfully wonderful! You could love a guy like that. The near-ending scared the heck out of me... but the 'very ending' was absolutely terrific. A must-see... movie-wise. :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good first part, long and boring second part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment starts off in a very catchy way by an original, dynamic, finely directed plot that arouses curiosity and impatience as to the following developments.Unfortunately, the movie turns, after an hour, into a behind closed doors love story, where the rhythm drops significantly simultaneously with the interest for this conventional and schmaltzy romance. The film then struggles to find a second wind and this second part turns out to be very long, so much so that the viewer is almost relieved when it comes to an end.It's a bit of a shame because, besides the cast and direction both accurate, the script suggests a cynical critic of the unmerciful world of business, the race for profit and individual success, foreshadowing, relatively speaking, other works on the dehumanization of work such as Brazil ? think of the shot of the lined up desks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>- Wise Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is as close as makes no difference to the very best of Billy Wilder and that is, essentially, the Best of the Best. We'd be here all day if I were to list EVERY great Wilder film but the majority are great on one level - Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Ace In The Hole, Sunset Boulevard, great Drams all; Some Like It Hot, The Major And The Minor, A Foreign Affair, One, Two, Three, great comedies, but with The Apartment Wilder moves effortlessly from satire (the four wise guys who monopolise the apartment and see everything as corporate-wise, situation-wise, promotion-wise, Kubelik-wise etc). through comedy to drama without missing a beat. The writing is breathtaking and coupled brilliantly to visuals that move the story along like the cracked compact mirror and Wilder isn't afraid to give the most minor character a good line - witness the Santa in the bar who walks into the scene and says 'my sleigh is double-parked' and later, when the bartender is waiting to close and asks if the drunk realizes what night it is he replies 'I work for the outfit'. In the same scene, of course, is another fully realized character, Margie, whose jockey husband is in gaol in Havana for doping horses. Virtually everyone puts in top-of-the-line performances (even Shirley MacLaine is not as hard to take as usual) from the four horsemen of Baxter's apocalypse to Edie Adams, to Fred McMurray, Jack Kruschen but towering head and shoulders above everyone is the brilliant Jack Lemon running the gamut from A to BEYOND Z. Coming up to half a century old and STILL better than most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood today. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evidently a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Lemmon in most of his films that I can remember usually had me turning it off; this is not the case with `Missing' (qv) in which he plays a surprisingly good rôle, and in `The Apartment' in which he is superb. He carries the film ? practically by himself. Shirley MacLaine is just about OK, ditto Fred MacMurray and the rest of the cast. But that is precisely the magic of this classic almost in form of stage-theatre: the sum of the parts do not add up to the whole. The end result is a fine example of classic comedy in best 60's style.The film was shown here on TV last night coinciding with the death of Billy Wilder, but programmed and recorded (presentation, discussion etc.) before he died: a fitting tribute to this European-born man.The film, in black and white, is slightly dated only due to the music, as it is definitely in the style of 40's and 50's melodramas and the like. However: don't miss this one. The IMDb voting average is just about right ? and that is very high on my scale, especially for a `comedy'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut up and deal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The women of The Apartment are lonely, slightly over-the-hill, scrunched up types. They are either cheating or being cheated on, but somehow find themselves facing the more severe emotional consequences in the end. What could ever be done to avoid that next heartbreak? Fran Kubelik is a lowly elevator operator, which makes her fair game for the numerous executives of Insurance and Co. She has fooled herself into thinking that eventually Jeff Sheldrake will leave his wife for her. This belief wavers in strength; Shirley MacLaine can provide wit when it is needed, and she seems aloof enough to not bite again at the line that Sheldrake dangles in front of her every few months. She brushes her newly cut hair, shortened to spite him, and openly acknowledges her awareness of just how cruel he is being by stringing her along. This is the great paradox within Fran, in how absolutely aware she is of Sheldrake's motives (I don't believe he ever gets to actually sleep with her once in the film) and yet so helpless in attempting to free herself. MacLaine plays her character with sad eyes that are resigned to her place as a lower class girl. There is a great vulnerability in her, crafted from experience, and she knows that although she could stop answering Sheldrake's calls and stand up for herself, the loneliness that beckons is too much to bear. So her boss is the bad guy, but she cannot be labelled an entirely innocent bystander. The Apartment shines so strongly because both our leads are complicit in the ways of their superior, and they know it so well, but brush these thoughts aside because the alternative comes with a much greater cost. Jack Lemmon plays what seems like a good-natured man, who has somehow tripped and fallen into an arrangement with his supervisors that leaves him no option but to play along. There is a brilliant scene early on, in which Sheldrake calls him into his office, and using his natural air of authority, makes us believe that he is about to be caught in the act. Baxter is almost relieved; at least now he will have his own apartment to himself. And then Sheldrake switches tack, and lets him figure it out for himself. Lemmon is disappointed morally only for a split second, and then hurriedly rifles through his pockets for the key. Floor 27 awaits him.Lemmon is perpetually flustered and sweating, a man with the busy and impossible task of juggling four executive affairs in the one room. Wilder ever so gently throws a cold into the mix (as organically as you would like) and the effect is hilarious; now we can see his mind fretting, his brow furrowed and hear every sniff of his nose. But nothing will stop him from his goal. When he finally ascends to the level of executive, he foolishly tries to brute force his way into Fran's affections, flaunting his position and ego. He doesn't fit the bill one bit; in fact it seems ridiculous his neighbours would ever think him a smooth-talking Casanova. Lemmon plays it masterfully by tip-toeing that line as close as he can. It's hard to play a character; it's harder yet to have that character unsuccessfully pretend to be something they are not (watch how he masters the art of making a bowler hat look goofy).The film was shot in black and white, so that when Fran and Baxter step out from the Insurance Co. skyscraper after a day of hard work for some solace, they are almost swallowed by the gloomy, lonely streets. The inside of the building is structured like a prison; long, endless rows of desks attended by anonymous, soul-less white-collar employees, and when Baxter finally gets that executive office he pines for, it only seems to box him in and confine him further. Scenes are constructed simply from long takes, none more breathtaking than when Baxter strides over to his so-called 'date', and just as they cross paths she is whisked off by her actual man. So effortlessly gut-wrenching. The screenplay is something of an exquisite thing, so deftly poised to strike right into the hearts of our lead pair. Moments like Baxter brandishing Sheldrake's happy family Christmas card would feel manufactured in other films, but hurts deeply here because of how obnoxiously and ignorantly he flaunts it in Fran's face, yet still unknowing of the extra pain it carries. At the beginning of the film, like with most scenarios of this type, we expect the two's romance to eventually blossom. The Apartment stands tall above the rest of the pack because the characters are not made to service the plot. It is crucial for us to understand that Baxter quits not because he is in love with Fran, but on behalf of his own integrity. He does not sweep in to rescue her like a fair maiden, for she must do that for herself. And so she does. Billy Wilder makes us feel for these two, but not too much, because they have to blame themselves a little for where they are. He makes something magical of the inevitable, so that even when it does happen, we can't help but hug ourselves and smile for them.</fullReview>

In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers, who reinforce their position over him by regularly calling him "Buddy Boy," to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that he is a playboy bringing home different women every night.The four managers (Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, and David White) write glowing reports about Bud, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Sheldrake calls Baxter to his office but says that he has found out why they were so enthusiastic. Then he goes on to promote him in return for exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment. He insists on using it that same night and, as compensation for such short notice, gives Baxter two company- sponsored tickets to the hit Broadway musical The Music Man.</fullReview>

This is a smart, lovely, plausible, funny and highly involving romantic comedy, drama. Performances by all involved were great, especially of course by the three leads. What surprised me the most was how involving this movie, which is set mostly indoor, is. At running time 2 hours it wasn't boring or badly paced for a second, and although you kinda can see where is this movie going, the most important is now how it will end, but how it arrives to that ending.Overall, "The Apartment" is a must see for all who loves great, classical movies. It's plausible romance, amazing script, superb directing and great performances makes this a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two key words here: Excellent Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy is either an experience in very funny footage that makes you laugh out loud, and not that there is anything wrong with this first category, but a comedy can also be a more classically written, film-oriented experience. This is the latter. And it utterly excels at it, being in nature a comedy but displaying very fine attention to detail in crafting drama themes and preciously knitted principles, the chief one as the morality of the whole story being the old 'being a mensch' concept. This is a beautiful film. It's subtle, excellently crafted, the dialog is interesting and relevant to the plot, and the film-makers make sure they develop each scene's concept, and elements are laid out early in the film to come back later and give the film more depth and coherence. Acting is just excellent. Just an excellent comedy, with everything that entails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder does Wilder does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilder is known to be able to deliver the laughs as well the dramatic tones. The proof of this Sunset Blvd. and Some Like it Hot. In The Apartment he tries to mix the two but he never truly lands the dismount as it were and the character of Baxter has every drop of comedy stolen from him as we watch him be abused by everyone around him including his love interest. The piece would have been a great character study, but it is never allowed to be. The acting is on point, Lemmon does what he can with a character that is penned in by a script that does not know how to portray him. He breathes life into a man so morally drained and emotionally inept that one would loathe him if there were not that ray of sunshine peaking through. The script bleeds Hollywood which is fine as this is a romantic movie and they tend to not need a heady dose of gritty reality. Ultimately it is a lighthearted romantic movie with the sexism of Madmen thrown in. So if you wish to know where the mould for modern romance was created look no further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic comedy with some edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this romantic comedy from 1960 is that an office worker (Jack Lemmon) lets married men and their mistresses have their trysts in his apartment while he stays late at work. As the men are more senior to him in his company, he does it in part to curry favor and advance, but also simply because he's a soft touch and nice guy. His neighbors think he's a wild man and philanderer since they hear noises and see women coming and going, but he never disabuses them of this misperception. Throughout the movie he consistently protects others, even the 'bad guy' (Fred MacMurray), who is manipulating a woman (Shirley MacLaine) by leading her on about leaving his wife, when it's clear he has no real feelings for her.It was great to see the little snippets of life in this time period and the cultural references, and the office space shown by director Billy Wilder is on its own fantastic (wow, talk about an 'open office' plan). It's interesting to see several actors you'll know from later works: MacMurray (the father in 'My Three Sons', though he had also been in Wilder's 'Double Indemnity' and other films earlier), David White (who depending on your 60's TV knowledge you may recognize as Darrin's boss in 'Bewitched'), and Ray Walston (who was the hardest to connect for me, but when I finally got it I was quite happy with myself ? he was the actor who, 22 years later, would so brilliantly play Mr. Hand opposite Jeff Spicoli, played by Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High).But I digress. MacLaine is the real star here, with several great moments. While you can see the ending coming from a mile away, there are elements of real melancholy in this movie, including a scene with Lemmon and a woman in a bar, both down on their luck, which is priceless. There is also some edge to the movie with all that playing around, and a wild company holiday party, so that the movie doesn't feel sugary-sweet. I don't think it should have gotten five Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), particularly in the year Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece 'Psycho' was released ? this was a huge miss by the Academy ? but it's certainly a good movie, and enjoyable to watch 55 years later. As a last bit of movie trivia ? this was the last black and white film to win the Best Picture award, that is, until 'Schindler's List' won in 1993.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humorously Sly Look at Corporate America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the movie again after 50-some years, I'm astonished at how young the two leads appear. Seriously though, I'm impressed with just how appealing the Lemmon-MacLaine twosome is. Neither is glamorous in traditional Hollywood style, yet their appeal almost bounces off the screen. And it's a good thing too since the plot is pretty meager for a two-hour runtime. We know from the outset they're made for each other. The only question is how long it will take for Fran (MacLaine) to see through the exploitive Sheldrake (MacMurray) and Baxter (Lemmon) to quit the corporate ladder he's shackled to. In short, each has to divorce from Consolidated Life Insurance in order to realize what each actually desires. In that sense, the movie's a rather subtle portrayal of 1950's corporate America and its seductive opportunities.As I recall, the movie created a popular buzz over the undisguised serial couplings unusual for the period. Baxter's accommodating apartment focuses that attention in mainly humorous fashion as his bosses and their honeys shuttle in and out. The humor may not rise to knee-slapper level, but the chuckles keep coming thanks to Lemmon and company. Except, of course, for Fran's frustrated sleeping pill over-dose. No humor there, while taking up about twenty-minutes of poignant runtime. I expect that was the screenwriters' attempt to insert a moral lesson to balance the liberties that had been taken.Anyway, much of the hip lingo of the time has since passed on, especially tacking "-wise" onto favored phrases like " That's how it crumbles cookie-wise". It was also a time when corporate America was emerging on everyone's radar, and in a mostly positive sense for the benefits it could afford. Anyway, despite the loss of the period's edge, the movie generally holds up thanks to Lemmon &amp; MacLaine, along with a slyly suggestive human-interest story. It's also the last b&amp;w movie to win Best Picture Oscar, for whatever that's worth. So catch up with it if you can, even if you're not a geezer like me and it hasn't been 50-years..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Executive Washrooms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I used to live like Robinson Crusoe; I mean, shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand, and there you were." - Calvin Baxter"The Apartment" stars Jack Lemmon as Calvin Baxter, a worker at Consolidated Life, a New York insurance film. Desperate to ascend the corporate ladder, Baxter begins prostituting himself by becoming a kind of pimp; to his superiors he passes around the key to his bachelor apartment so that they may slip into their busy schedules casual sex with women other than their wives. Directed by Billy Wilder, "The Apartment" contrasts the likability and good naturedness of Baxter with the depravity "necessary" for him to get ahead. In "The Apartment", competency and ambition account for very little. What matters, rather, is one's willingness to degrade and torture oneself, Baxter forced to give up his bed to his superiors, who dangle before him promises of promotion and keys to executive washrooms. Baxter consents to this sexual harassment by proxy. It is, he believes, a good career move.Wilder introduces us to Fran Kubelik (the delightful Shirley MacLaine), an elevator operator at Consolidated Life. Baxter's madly in love with Fran, but she's having an affair with the head of personnel, Jeff D. Sheldrake (the inimitable Fred MacMurray), who keeps promising to leave his wife and marry Fran. Of course Jeff has no intention of doing this. Fran's situation thus parallels Baxter's, though Wilder never treats them as simple victims; for disrupting marriages, both Fran and Baxter are burdened by guilt, and both are always complicit in the behaviour of their bosses."The Apartment's" second half finds Baxter becoming preoccupied with becoming a "mensch" - a good man - rather than a financially successful one. One cannot be both, the film implies. It ends with Baxter and Fran eventually turning their backs on Consolidated Life. Futures uncertain, they huddle together on Christmas Eve.Though overlong, "The Apartment" is elevated by some exquisite production design. Wilder's shots of oppressive corporations, workers dutifully arranged in elongated rows, recall Chaplin's "Modern Times", Lang's "Metropolis" and Vidor's "The Crowd". Elsewhere he sketches a New York awash with gorgeous clubs, theatre-houses and lonely bars. But it's in its titular apartment - designed by Austro-Hungaria-born Alexandre Trauner - that the film spends most of its time. Here Baxter seems to exist in a permanent state of agitation, his home repeatedly violated by his employers, both psychically and literally. When bosses aren't coming and going, all Baxter's free time seems to be spent fretting about promotions, duties and tomorrow's work. Insideously, Consolidated Life has intruded into every aspect of Baxter's life. This inseparability begins to annoy Baxter - when will his real life begin? - an exhaustive state of mind which Wilder alludes to with annoying television advertisements (Baxter never gets to watch the programmes he wishes) and frustrating knocks at doors.Wilder's known for two of cinema's greatest film noirs. In "The Apartment" he uses a similar aesthetic, voluminous patches of black bleeding their way into beautiful panels of grey and white. The film's subtext and sets - sinister, looming - counterpoint its surface activities, which are comedic, farcical and filled with volleys of wisecracks. Beautifully scored by Adolph Deutsch.8.5/10 ? See "Glengarry Glen Ross".</fullReview>

They take advantage of him dangling good recommendations. He gets called into head of personnel Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) thinking he's getting a promotion. Instead Sheldrake wants the apartment only for himself and the elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Fran is flirtatious with Baxter but she doesn't tell him about Sheldrake. Baxter first sees Fran in his apartment when she tries to kill herself.Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are just great together with terrific chemistry. It's a dark compelling rom-com from Billy Wilder. It's not as funny as his usual comedies but the couple really sells the passion. There is a darkness hanging over everybody in this movie that is lifted by the couple getting together. That darkness isn't simply the shocking thing that Fran does but it permeates throughout in the ugliness of the situations. Even her hand mirror is broken to make her look the way she feels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Winner, Best Picture, 1961.The movie that fetched Billy Wilder half the number of statuettes in his tally of 6. The movie is one of the few romantic comedies that entertains you and lets you wait till the end of the movie, thus preventing the viewer from jumping into conclusions(which might prove right) by twisting the storyline.I love the way the movie begins with everyone deeply absorbed in their work. A hundred men and women on their typewriters typing rhythmically and with same tempo. Billy Wilder excels in introducing humor at the opportune moment in his films and the man has to be lauded for penning the script as well. No one could have been a better C.C.Baxter than Jack Lemmon. He is forced to gift his spacious apartment to his executives for rising up the ranks and floors and he succeeds until things get complicated one day with Fran, a lift operator, tries to commit suicide after being betrayed by one of the senior executives. While Baxter has the hots for the woman, he doesn't confess it fearing that he might lose his job. The other executives somehow get to know of this and Baxter decides it's time to put in his papers and leave the town. In the meanwhile, Jeff ends it with his wife and decides to marry Fran. Fran realizes what Baxter has done to her, how he saved her life, revamped and rejuvenated her mundane life, and leaves Jeff to join Baxter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hammond, like so many of his colleagues at 'Time Out' put more emphasis on appearing cool rather than giving real thought to any art form. There's something worryingly fascist about them at London's premier magazine. But they're delusion is that they are the voice of London. The sales of the magazine speak for them as do the viewing figures for Eastenders speak for TV. 'The Apartment' is not worthy of only 3 stars. This it not only my opinion, but the opinion of most (prob incl 'The Wally') cinema goers who have any knowledge of film history.Giving every film 3 stars may indeed make your publication look coolly apathetic, but when you start giving it to classics too it just begins to seem you don't know what you're talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can you say about one of the best films, best scripts and best male lead performances ever? The great Billy Wilder co-writes (along with I.A.L. Diamond, whose contribution should not be forgotten) and directs with precision, without a false note, in a style he perfected, this gem of a satire on the corporate world, sex and human values. Lemmon is simply amazing, ideally cast for the role, with one of the greatest physical comedy performances of all time. The change from satirical comedy - which is hilarious, comedywise - to drama is still striking. This, along with its pervasive view on sex, makes this 50's looking film more of a 60's film and a prime example of the changing of the times. There are as many funny one-liners and sight gags as you will find in any comedy ("We don't want this to leak out", "How many times? Three", "How's your knee?" "Stay with it, buddy boy"), and the photography - which amazingly captures in widescreen the claustrophobic feeling of the apartment - and music are memorable. The supporting cast is sensational with all actors delivering fantastic performances. But this is Wilder's film all the way. This is not only in the IMDb 250 list (currently ranked 94) and highly ranked by the AFI: it was ranked 14 by directors in the prestigious Sight &amp; Sound 2002 survey of the top films of all-time (right there among such masterpieces as 2001, La dolce vita and Tokyo Story!) attesting to how high Wilder's peers think of his work in this film. It is simply a masterpiece to be watched over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Wilder...follows his general formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a different view of this film than most. Admittedly, it's a classic, and was a commercial success at the time of its release. But, I often find Billy Wilder's films cynical, depressing, and sort of "off-color 2 hour jokes". Even when I watched one of my favorite entertainers, Dean Martin in "Kiss Me, Stupid", I felt that way. Almost always emphasizing and, in my view, glorifying infidelity and adultery.Having said all that, it is a pleasure watching the 3 stars of this film -- Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and the before "My Three Sons" Fred MacMurray. This film displays so well the diverse talents of Jack Lemmon. A flair for comedy...it's there early in the film. A flair for drama...even more evident, though later in the film. And that's what made Lemmon so good...he could do drama or comedy equally well...sort of like Cary Grant. And then there's Shirley MacLaine. Who could fault her performance here? And, though his role here is not at all sympathetic, Fred MacMurray plays his role as "the philanderer" extremely well, though this film was a bit after his prime in movies.And, other than being a very cynical story, the plot is very good. A man who works in the bowels of an insurance company is sap enough to allow his superiors at work to use his apartment for trysts...although why the rich president of the company wouldn't choose to go to a hotel with his bimbo, rather than a dingy apartment (and it is dingy), escapes me. Then he meets his "Miss Right", only to find out she is the executive's (MacMurray) mistress. She discovers MacMurray is stringing her along, attempts suicide, and Lemmon saves her...and eventually wins her. There are moments that are touching, sad, pathetic, humorous, and although they presumably live happily ever after, it just seems like one very long (over 2 hours) slightly cynical and off-color joke. Was Wilder ahead of his time? Definitely. Was that always so good? Maybe not.Worth a watch, but I don't rate it as highly as many others do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scathing looking at corporate politics, pre-"Mad Men".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never been a fan of Jack Lemmon (biased by The Out of Towners, The Odd Couple, Under the Yum Yum Tree, Grumpy Old Men) or Shirley MacLaine (for the usual reasons, but mostly for creating the flaky Earth Mother stereotype). However, 'The Apartment' transcends both of their characters to present a story of pawns caught up in a management manipulation game. Many people seem conflicted as to whether to classify this as a 'comedy' or a 'drama'. This is a meaningless distinction. The film draws upon both elements to show the human situation in all its variety. Why waste time on trying to define it?Wilder brings the two together in an indictment of how corporate politics can make otherwise honest people turn their heads at corruption. This is the 'Mad Men' era, with much less glamour attached to it, because it spends much less time in executive offices and nightclub binges, and much more time in the off-premises life of the manipulated drones. MacLaine does a fine job of portraying a character who is more world-wise yet more vulnerable than Lemmon's. Lemmon, meanwhile, does a fine job of portraying someone who understands the moral degradation he's assisting in yet can't bring himself to say no to anyone who asks for favors -- even when it costs him his self-respect and his reputation. Edie Adams and Hope Holiday both deliver excellent performances, the first as the secretary who has seen it (and been it) all before, the second as the barfly wife trying to get some attention. Fred MacMurray is a little too cool about his philandering, although perhaps not how he excuses it. The other execs (Ray Walston, David White, etc.) come off as guys just trying to get theirs.The contrast between the cold, sterile environment of the office (where the workers -- including the menials -- are just meat) and the homey environment of the apartment is stunning in portraying the contrasts of the protagonists' situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable film that touches on some moral issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film and probably because it uses a simple plot of a man who aims high for his career only to be used constantly by the people who help him. I can't really be bothered explaining the plot since most people will just wikipedia or go to the plot page on IMDb but all I can say is that this film is charming and witty.But I will keep it short: CC Baxter lets a lot of his fellow male colleagues to borrow his apartment on nights so they can take their mistresses and other girls to a place for some fun. He gets a promotion from his boss in exchange that he can use Baxter's apartment too, only to find out that the girl he has is also the girl he unexpectedly falls for who works as an elevator operator.So it gets into some predictable areas of complicating the situations for the characters but that's the case with most comedies anyway. As a comedy however, I wouldn't say it is very funny, though I did chuckle sometimes, but it is sometimes a bit dark in terms of its explorations - suicide, broken hearts, no where to go etc.But the performances and chemistry of Jack Lemmon and Shirley Mclaine really makes it worth the watch and you can sympathize with both of them because they are simply two souls who are lonely in their own ways and find something in each other that they can't seem to find anywhere else.And it was really interesting to look at the offices, some of the levels having tons of employees - one particular scene in where some people get up dancing to a tune of Jingle Bells while everyone is almost dancing as though it were a jazz club.It is also the age old classic theme of ; A high paying career that puts your morals in question or Following your heart? Looks like things like this never really change over time and the Apartment is no exception to its time and era.I only give it a 9 out of 10 because it wasn't funny all the time and perhaps the ending could have been developed a bit more but it's minor.A pleasant movie that is a pleasure to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance in the Elevator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) lends his apartment to insurance executives for extramarital romps, but complications and a romance of his own ensue.Also featured is Shirley MacLaine, who I would so be in love with if I was 50 years older. And this is produced, directed and written by Billy Wilder, who never made a bad film.I love the early shot featuring the hundreds of insurance desks... that was a lot of extras and a beautiful shot, though the quality of the video is not on par with Wilder's earlier works. Not sure this is him or the way the video was touched up since.I hate when I am trying to watch a Lionel Barrymore and Greta Garbo movie and I am bombarded with advertisements for filtered cigarettes and denture cream. But now I know that Castro is the guy in Cuba with the "crazy beard". I appreciate that this film takes place between the revolution and the Bay of Pigs.The film takes a dark and serious turn in the second half, though this is not a bad thing. While I think Billy Wilder excels at comedy, he has never made a bad film of any genre and this is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder and the human disguise issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder carries on with his obsession about the disguises we wear. Every one here wears a certain disguise, some are skin deep some don't even realize they have a mask on. The two heroes of this masterpiece are of the latter, thing is they'll have to shed their disguises to really find each other. It's written, directed and acted to perfection. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLain were never better. And I have to admit, I love Billy wilder more for his obsession. - Never saw a film he made where it wasn't an issue. Some times you get the actual disguise to play a part in the plot, sometimes it's a metaphorical disguise, but it's always there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Apartment (1960)Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder team up again for brilliance. I don't like The Apartment quite as much as I do Some Like it Hot but it still is one of the greatest films of all time. It is very clever, sweet and funny, and has fantastic performances by both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. The supporting cast all does good as well. Along with the great acting, The Apartment has outstanding writing and directing by legend Billy Wilder. As I said it isn't my favorite Billy Wilder film but it is one of the best, which automatically means its one of the best films ever made. Billy Wilder is a genius. I first heard of the film while watching the films from the American Film Institute's 100 greatest films of all time. Since then I have suggested it to many people and watched it a few more times. It's a great way to get into classic films and a great way to stay into classic films. It's a great and original story, a great mix of comedy and drama. Sometimes sad, sometimes hilarious, but always amazing. I suggest this film to everyone. I think if you give it a chance there is almost no way you wont like it. The Apartment is one more film that proves Billy Wilder is one of the best directors in history. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotionally-driven romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Apartment for the first time after seeing Some Like it Hot in the same theatre the previous night. The Apartment is a good deal less fun and much darker than Some Like it Hot, but it is still a sweet film with a few good laughs. Jack Lemmon plays an officious office worker who regularly allows his higher-ups and their mistresses to use his apartment as their love nest. He has two people he is desperate to impress ? a friendly elevator girl, played by Shirley MacLaine, and his suave, unscrupulously boss, played by Fred MacMurray. What starts out as a cute film takes a dark turn, with some moments involving suicide that made me genuinely uncomfortable. Shop Around the Corner came to mind as I watched it, only instead of a handful of kind characters, we're left with Jack Lemmon as the one decent person in the film. Any pleasure derived from this film will largely depend on the viewers' opinion of him. I found him appealing, but I could also understand someone finding his jittery style too annoying to tolerate. This is a well-written romantic comedy that is at once sweet and cynical in tone, one that does not skip over the darker human emotions and tendencies. As I watched it I found myself unable to keep from smiling at some points and ready to cry at others. It isn't a romance between two gorgeous people who in the real world could have anyone they wanted. The romantic leads are two cheerful nobodies who are used to struggling while watching others succeed. Their vulnerability makes for a less fun romantic comedy, but a touching one nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look over the Best Picture Oscar winners of the late 50s and early 60s, you will see wall-to-wall grandiose epics and lavish musicals. But there, sandwiched in the middle of them all is The Apartment, the odd-one-out success from a time when you would have thought a picture had to BE big to make it big. This picture's secret is of course that there is more than one way to be sensational.Yes, it's another production from Billy Wilder, a real master when it came to crafting small-scale pictures that were real non-stop joyrides of dramatic comedy. This was Wilder's second screenplay collaboration with I.A.L. Diamond, the first being Some Like it Hot. While The Apartment is nowhere near as uproarious as that cross-dressing caper, it features the same kind of subtle by-the-way kind of humour ? jokes that don't leap out at you but are woven realistically into the narrative in a way that seems almost accidental. There are also romantic overtones to The Apartment that are far more sincere, emotional and humane than had previously been seen in a Wilder picture. A motif like Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine both realising something about each other when looking in the other's mirror (Lemmon seeing the crack in MacLaine's makeup mirror, and MacLaine spotting the sleeping tablets in Lemmon's shaving mirror) might seem pretentious in another picture. Here, in the context of such a tender and honest romance, it becomes a rather endearing little touch.Wilder was of course good value for money, directing as well writing and producing. He was never one to hop into bed with the latest fads (he held out on colour for as long as was feasible, and never really got into zooms or hand-held camera-work), but he was always one to grab a new piece of technology with both hands if it suited him ? widescreen in particular. Wilder pushed the 'scope aspect ratio in new directions, showing how it could be beneficial to the little picture as well as the big. Look at how he uses it to exaggerate Jack Lemmon's sense of isolation and meaninglessness in the office jungle ? one man among a sea of desks and clerks, just like in the famous shot from The Crowd (1928) but a little less surreal and far more claustrophobic, with that bright ceiling stretching into infinity (honourable mentions here to set designers Alexandre Trauner and Edward G. Boyle). Wilder also uses the wider frame to keep a larger area on the screen at a time, particularly in the titular apartment, minimising the need for distracting cuts and camera moves.But it's not all about Mr Wilder, or even his behind-the-camera collaborators. Let's have a few words for those in front ? the cast. Lead man Jack Lemmon is just perfect for this sort of thing ? perpetually animated, almost cartoonish, and clearly injecting much of his own humour into the role, but still remaining a believable person, and not just losing himself in the exaggeration. Shirley MacLaine carries much of the picture's serious dramatic weight, and emotes with great subtlety in contrast to Lemmon's antics. It's also nice to see a leading lady with some tomboyish sass, still very charming but something you just never saw in prior generations. The once-dull lead man MacFred makes a very fine and credible supporting player as corporate toad Sheldrake. Finally Jack Kruschen is creates an intensely warm and memorable moral heart for the story, making a substantial impact in a relatively small amount of screen time.The Apartment could, I suppose, be described as a clever movie. But it is not like small pictures of today, many of which are only clever, and show off their cleverness with a twist in the ending or some "original" narrative device, and really have very little else going for them. The Apartment is clever in that it is crafted and calculated from start to finish to be a sweeping, engrossing, funny, moving experience. The overall care that has gone into creating something that is above all enjoyable make it fully deserving of every accolade it received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that we've had our little sexual revolution, this look at 'sex in the large corporation' in my Puritan 50s was quite shocking!!!! Didn't they all know they would burn in Hell eternally? Come to think of it, they did....except of course, for those who got right with God, repented and became monogamous AND faithful.The setup with the key was all so cut and dried. Of course, insofar as the secretaries were concerned, going to bed with the boss was seen as their chance for a grab at the gold ring, literally. I very much appreciated the wit in the writing of this movie...Billie Wilder was writing from life as he had observed it in Hollywood, I'm sure. Edie Adams even gives you a glimpse into the hurt suffered by a secretary who had LOVED the boss, who had NOt simply jumped into the sack for an opportunity to better her economic position. Fred McMurray, what a great heel he played!!!!The Apartment won quite a few Academy awards and with good reason. Pick it up and show it to your teen-agers, especially those about to join us in Corporate World. To a lesser and more subtle extent, these charades still continue....it's human nature, and the Alpha male, still playing his games but to a thankfully shrinking audience. Knowing that Lemmon is now playing the wonderful dying Morrie, prof at Brandeis University, will give you a greater appreciation of the master actor this man was and is!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful romantic comedy ( with a cynical edge ) from the great Billy Wilder, of 'Some Like It Hot' fame.The irreplaceable Jack Lemmon is 'C.C. Baxter' ( known to his friends as 'Bud' ) who works for the New York insurance firm of Consolidated Life. The ambitious Bud is working his way to the top by loaning out his apartment to his tight-fisted superiors for sexual 'assignations'. They get what they want, and in returns he gets promotion. It sounds like a neat arrangement - until Baxter discovers that his boss Jeff Sheldrake ( brilliant performance here from Fred MacMurray ) plans on using the apartment for a tryst with sexy elevator girl Fran Kubelik ( Shirley Maclaine ), whom Baxter is secretly struck on. Baxter is prepared to throw in the towel, until he finds Fran in his bed, a bottle of empty sleeping pills at her side...'The Apartment' is pitch-perfect in almost every respect, wittily scripted by Wilder and I.A.L. ( Izzy ) Diamond, and impeccably acted throughout, even down to Joyce Jameson's unnamed floozy. Adolph Deutch's score perfectly compliments the film. As Baxter, Lemmon gives one of his finest performances, simultaneously amusing and sympathetic - his loneliness is simply heartbreaking. I love the bit in Sheldrake's office when Bud accidentally squirts nasal spray into the air. And what about him straining boiled spaghetti through a tennis racket? Comedy gold. Balancing this out is Fran's suicide attempt which must have been quite harrowing for its time.Things work out more or less as you want, and the ending is guaranteed to put a soppy grin on the face of even the most hardened cynic. Lemmon and Maclaine were reunited four years later in another Wilder production - Irma La Douce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An insurance company clerk learns that one way to climb the corporate ladder is to let company executives use his apartment for trysts with their mistresses. Lemmon gives perhaps the best performance of his career as the clerk while MacLaine matches him as the sweetly vulnerable company elevator operator that he falls for. MacMurray is appropriately slimy as Lemmon's boss. The film perfectly captures an era before the term "political correctness" was coined. The script by Wilder and Diamond is full of keen insights and smart dialog. With this brilliant comedy-drama, Wilder capped an incredible decade of ten notable films that started with "Sunset Blvd." in 1950.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could THE APARTMENT be an even more modern MODERN TIMES? Ah, Billy Wilder and Charlie Chaplin; what a Famous Twosome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LONG remembered for being 1960's best film and multi Oscar winner for that year, THE APARTMENT (The Mirisch Corporation/United Artists, 1960) remains a phenomenon of a movie even now, nearly 50 years later. (That's 5 Decades Schultz!) No matter one's familiarity with it, you can view it over and over again; still enjoying it as if seeing it for the first time.OVERFLOWING with human emotion, the story so draws us into it as to function as a sort of life extension; a magnet and mirror of what was and is our life in America, the Beautiful. Near perfection is the blending of the story with the casting, B &amp; W Photography, realistic NYC sets, roller coaster emotional ride and outstanding musical score is achieved in the creation one of those, oh so rare, one of a kind Works of Art.IN attempting to analyze the hows and whys behind the rising to such a lofty position in the Film World, we may find this both obvious and yet surprising in so many ways. With the great range of emotional situations connected to the viewing audience, the classification of the film is more difficult a job than any presented to any reviewer. OUR STORY: C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a mid-level employee in a mega-sized insurance company. In an attempt to cull some clout and behind the scenes help in climbing the corporate ladder, Baxter has taken to the practice of lending out his apartment to various department big wigs; for purpose of their using it as meeting place for some extra-marital trysting. Meanwhile, Baxter has taken quite a liking to building elevator operator, Fran Kubilik (Shirley MacLaine).BAXTER is summoned to the big boss' office, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray); expecting to receive a promotion. Sheldrake surprises him with a critical evaluation of just why four department heads would be so kind and generous with giving such glowing description of employee performance; and why he, Baxter, was the one to receive such accolades.SHELDRAKE spills the beans about his knowledge of the Baxter Apartment and the passing around of the Baxter door key; not so subtly "hinting" that Baxter's successful rise up through the ranks would inextricably tied to Baxter's lending his apartment and the front door key to Mr. Big, Sheldrake, on an exclusive basis.BEING a 'happily' married man, with that All-American family in suburban NYC (or perhaps Connecticut?), Sheldrake has plans to rekindle a romance with a lower level female employee; unknowingly being one in a long and seemingly endless string of side nookie purveyors. The current victim is Miss Fran Kubilik.INTERVENTION and the knowledge of Sheldrake's serial philandering comes to Miss Kubilik at the office party on Christmas Eve by way of Miss Mary Olsen (Edie Adams), Sheldrake's secretary. It seems that Miss Olsen could speak with some authority about the succession of women in Sheldrake's past; inasmuch as she too had been one.AFTER finding about the Sheldrake/Kubilik affair and an unsuccessful suicide attempt by Fran at the Apartment; Baxter resigns, turning in his copy of the Executive Washroom Key to Sheldrake, rather than his front door key.AT film's conclusion we find Sheldrake, who's been kicked out of his house pending divorce proceedings, and Fran out on New Year's Eve; when Miss Kubilik suddenly realizes the truth about Baxter and hurries back to the Apartment to play some cards. (We'll not say any more. See it if you haven't.) ONE peculiar observation has slowly been distilled in my little, harshly overworked brain over a period of about the last 30 years. That assertion is that what Messers. Billy Wilder, I.A.L. Diamond and this tremendous cast has given us is essentially a latter-day Chaplin Film! WHAT, I hear you say, has this Ryan truly gone all the way out of his head? Please, read on and evaluate my argument.JACK LEMMON'S C.C. Baxter character is a sort of symbol of the little man; impossibly pitted against the overwhelming power of our society in general and the world of corporate business in particular. This is very close to Sir Charles Chaplin's Little Tramp in MODERN TIMES (Chaplin Company/United Artists, 1936). They both are very much their own men and are forced to do what they could to succeed or even survive in the midst of the production line; albeit industrial for the Tramp and economics for Baxter. (What's the big bleepin' to do about the differences? After all, pressure and tension are just as real in both circumstances!) BAXTER is in a position far inferior to his protagonist, Sheldrake; just as the Little Tramp is unable to communicate with the big boss, who speaks via a sort of closed circuit television system. The Tramp becomes romantically involved with " A Gamin" (Paulette Goddard), just as Baxter does to Fran Kubilik.THE fade out is a typically Billy Wilder sort of a gag, not unlike his final gags in SOME LIKE IT HOT ( Ashton Prod./Mirisch Corp./United Artists, 1959) or ONE, TWO, THREE (Pyramid Prod./Mirisch Corp./United Artists, 1961). The implication of this final scene is strictly Chaplinesque; in meaning, if not in strict execution. .FURTHERMORE, we have the irrefutable evidence of Baxter's Wardrobe. Does he not after all make a purchase (For $15.00, he laments!). It is a new hat, which he unveils to Fran in his new executive office on Christmas Eve. And just what type of hat is this? Would it be a Fedora, a Hamburg or a Panama? Hell no, silly; it's a Bowler, which is also known as a Derby. It is the hat of choice for so many a comedians; such as Laurel &amp; Hardy and The Little Tramp, Chaplin, himself. Now, what evidence could be so compelling? LADIES and Gentlemen of the Jury, I rest my case! POODLE SCHNITZ!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After making the gender-bender comedy Some Like It Hot, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond gave us a cynical, bittersweet, and ultimately satisfying film that is certainly one of the best comedies ever made. It is a simple story of a corporate suck-up who allows his many bosses to use his apartment for extra-marital affairs in order to get promoted. Indeed he does get promoted, but a certain woman comes into his life and begins to complicate things... Jack Lemmon is wonderful and so lovable as C.C. Baxter, and Shirley MacLaine is absolutely captivating. Fred MacMurray is very good as being very unlikeable, which is quite against type for him. Overall, this is a fantastic film. The directing is superb and the screenplay is filled with wonderful and snappy dialogue as well as marvelous insight on universal human themes: love, jealousy, guilt, and the need to be happy. A lot of questions can be raised here, but The Apartment is not for answering questions as much as it is for bringing the facts to light. It is a dark, funny, and touching piece of work; one of the best Wilder films and one of the best films ever.</fullReview>

The story is simple enough but it holds you until the final moment (good point about a 40 yr gap is that you forget the ending!)when you exhale. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are beyond any comments I could dare to make - they would be impertinent - and the rest of the cast supports ably, may I say brilliantly.

We all have been in this situation kind of where we love one girl but she's in love with someone else who is a complete ass and doesn't see you for what you are until you spend some quality time together and get to know the person you have overlooked for quite sometime, which in my opinion adds realism to the picture.If you have not seen Billy Wilder's The Apartment please give it a chance it is in black and white which I think is great, I highly recommend this picture.</fullReview>

He really gives the touch of comedy and tragedy at a time to an original story.This is another point, the story is fascinating, with some spins that make it amazing. But for me the best of all is how the couple made by Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine combine on screen as if they had been working together forever.

		<shortDescription>Lemmon &amp; Wilder Make It Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film filled with largely unpleasant characters and a rather predictable plot, "The Apartment" still succeeds in being an entertaining movie that works better than it had any apparent right to work. That it does come out all right is thanks first of all to Jack Lemmon's fine performance, and second, to Billy Wilder's finely tuned story-telling abilities. While it has too many flaws to be called a truly great movie, it also has more than enough strong points to make it worth seeing.Lemmon could play the hapless yet likable character as well as or better than anyone else could, and he makes C.C. Baxter a three-dimensional character who becomes a lot more interesting than he looks on paper. Lemmon has a way of being slightly unpredictable while never making it seemed forced or unnatural, and it works well here. The young Shirley MacLaine is also engaging, although her role is less difficult and less crucial. Fred MacMurray works surprisingly well as the oily, manipulative Sheldrake, yet he and most of the remaining characters are a lot less interesting than Baxter is.Besides Lemmon's admirable performance, Wilder keeps it on track by telling a rather slight story with skill and good pacing. The story does have a little more depth than do a lot of romantic comedies, but it is still the kind of shaky premise that in the wrong hands can easily become either numbingly dreary or offensively crass. The script by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is very good dialogue-wise, though sometimes too predictable plot-wise.While it really should not be compared with the likes of Wilder gems like "Sunset Boulevard", "Stalag 17", and the like, "The Apartment" is still worth seeing. Lemmon was rarely in better form, and the movie overall also has its share of good moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One man's take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched a movie that surprisingly, I'd never heard of. I enjoyed it immensely. When you think Jack Lemmon, you think light comedy and this movie delivers along those lines. What was very unexpected was the emotional depth. This movie is very rare in the way it can play humor and add poignancy without appearing cheesy.The chemistry of Jack Lemmon and Shirley McClaine was also very delightful. She was strong and whimsical and very sincere in her pain. He was the good-natured foil to her character . . . a sort of kindly, spineless soul.I enjoyed the historical side of the movie, but found the spirit of the work to be very current . . . perhaps even bold by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool crisp cruelty, Billy Wilder's specialty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Apartment" is NOT one of those "one-of-a-kind" films youhear so much about but then are disappointed in because they'rereally derivative repetitive claptrap. Sharp dialog, a swiftly movingstory, characters you care about even as they do what are reallyhorrible things to themselves and each other, all told with a smileand some genuine affection -- who could not be enamored of thismovie? When Billy Wilder and I.A.L.Diamond are on target (whichis not 100% of the time), they can send daggers straight to theheart of any subject and make you laugh as it bleeds...then weepat its death. In "The Apartment," their aim is dead on every step ofthe way.Jack Lemmon plays C.C.Baxter with such easy aplomb andsympathy, you forget he's basically a brown-nosing pimp and windup rooting for the guy. And Shirley MacLaine as Fran Kubelik issharp and real and just self-aware enough to make you believeshe'd fall for a snake who offered her the right poison while stillbeing vulnerable enough to make you want to hold her and protecther from the scum of the earth, even though she's little more thana whore. And Fred MacMurray...now we know why he wound upwith three sons and no wife, and so realistically, too.This movie is Corporate America presented as liars, thieves.cowards and back-stabbers but without the solemn self-importance of "The Godfather" series. Sort of like a HollywoodStudio done up Manhattan-style...with many of its points even moretrue, today (witness "In The Company Of Men").A brilliant film well deserving of all accolades. If you miss it, you'llregret it, culture-wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with some flaws (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies mostly because I relate to the Lemmon character (had a very similar experience and the cad's name was Geoff too!). To my tastes everything about the movie was well above average; script, acting, and directing. The only major flaw in my overall enjoyment is the over-extended pathos in the last third of the movie (the post suicide attempt apartment scenes). When Kubilek weakly sags into the living room chair, one more ode to despair, I very nearly give up caring about the character (those elven good looks keep me involved). But that is about it (the only other flaw may be the indictment of corporate culture, but I view it broader terms of the unfortunate side effect of any group culture, so it washes off).Otherwise the movie has tremendous charm, likable characters (the one flaw above aside), laughs and drama (without being uneven and choppy like many dramadies can be), good pace (it doesn't seem like a two plus hour movie). Lemmon is great, albeit in that Lemmonesque roll he's known for, and MacLaine is very good too (she is also in one my other favorites, Being There). Fred MacMurray (against type) is wonderful (Absent Minded Professor it ain't). Anyone who likes older movies won't be disappointed with The Apartment.</fullReview>

Shirley McLaine was just fantastic...i can't recall seeing one of her films before; and Jack Lemmon was great. His manner is somewhat similar to that off Woody Allen; albeit not a woman like Allen can seem like at times. I just finished watching this one, and am still riding that emotional high that only the great films can inspire. So if this paragraph seems a little disjointed ( i think i used the word 'just' more than ever before in the preceding 8 lines...whoops, there's another ), that's JUST all the more reason to watch this one. They don't get much better than this. I gave this one a 10, and it's now on my list of 10 ten movies ever.JUST watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Billy Wilder's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legendary director Billy Wilder scores his greatest triumph with this 1960 United Artists release. Jack Lemmon is at his all time pre Walter Matthau partnership best with his excellent portrayal of a rather lowly but kind office boy who just happens to have a really fancy apartment. It's so fancy in fact that he's frequently thrown out of it by friends who want to use it rather than their own apartments for their raucous parties and affairs. His boss (Fred MacMurray) finds out about the fancy apartment and promises to give Lemmon a huge promotion if Lemmon will agree to give him the spare key so he can come and go as he pleases for his affairs. Desperate to move up in the corporate world, Lemmon reluctantly agrees to MacMurray's terms. Things get even more complicated when Lemmon falls for an elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) who just happens to be one of MacMurray's many affairs. Some scenes are hilarious and others can be rather touching. A rare successful blend of comedy and drama that is strongly aided by the top notch performances of its three starring leads and by its director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some of us movie fans who say "They don't make them like they use to"...they may try but they just fall flat on their faces. If someone were to try and re-make "The Apartment", it would be full of gushing sentimentality and have the most sugary endings of all time. Which is why "The Apartment" is the perfect example of how to make a truly great rom-com. You have to start with two characters you can really like, and CC Baxter and Miss Kurbrick are extremely likeable. From the moment we first see them in the lift, you know you want them to be together. And although Baxter is as manipulative as his boss, it's in the "nice guys finish last" way. I adore this film. It has some of the best performances around, particularly from Jack Lemmon, who has never been better. Billy Wilder manages to capture the heart-felt emotions of the piece, as well as making you smile at it's upbeat ending. And what a great last line! Teriffic stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Concierge and "The Secret Of My Success" were two of my favourites in the Romantic Comedy genre however I now realise how much of them was lifted straight from this one.I still can't just like the girl, she is fully and consciously dating a married man, her character does not come across very sympathetically but the sheer way the guys talk about dating like a sport had me in stitches, I was long ago sick of hating the "boyfriend your meant to hate", like Baldwin from 'Working Girl' and Zane from 'Titanic' but the casual way this actor brings it across helps to an extent. The way Lemmon describes how the arrangement began is believable but you have to take a step back and realise what he is actually helping. It takes a real deviation from the formula to like this sickeningly nice guy who is tossing up between career and principals, and it's even harder to hate the clumsily hatable colleagues of his. This was probably the earliest of it's type but that does not make it the best. Certainly it is a pleasurable viewing though, it's pretty creative and never boring, it must have been one of few descent movies in the year to have taken out the top honour, and to think they called last year a barren crop. 8/10</fullReview>

Of course, they probably didn't have the charm of a Jack Lemmon. This movie would not have been made in 1940, but in 1960 it marked the beginning of the new hero and heroine. A sleaze and a woman sleeping with the married boss are lovingly and adroitly portrayed as sympathetic figures.</fullReview>

For me, what makes this a standout production is a first-rate bunch of second bananas. Edie Adams gave her greatest performance [a low ceiling I acknowledge]. Larry White, Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen (sp?), and MacLaine's brother were wonders.I almost always enjoy Billy Wilder, but never more than in this film.</fullReview>

Because of the exceptional acting; perfect tragi-comic script by the Wilder &amp; Diamond duo; great supporting actors; tight direction; and zany-ness of it allIn the late 50s, Tony Curtis was a horny young man about Hollywood, and according to his autobiography was the model for The Apartment. He was married but having an affair, and using a friend's apartment for his assignations.It is worth watching for Shirley MacLaine's performance alone. It is one of her first adult roles, and she is funny, cute &amp; beguiling.Rated out of ten, I'd give it 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Wilder with Exceptional Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apartment, The (1960) **** (out of 4)A good-hearted and lonely man (Jack Lemmon) lowers himself to the level of some of his supervisors when he allows them to bring their mistresses back to his apartment. He finally works his way up the corporate ladder when the big man (Fred MacMurray) asks for the key to the apartment so he can use it for a lady (Shirley MacLaine) who he just happens to like as well. THE APARTMENT picked up five Oscar wins including Best Picture and Billy Wilder picked up awards for his direction and screenplay (with I.A.L Diamond) and over the years it's reputation has grown as today it's considered one of the greatest pictures ever made. I personally don't hold the film up that high but there's still no question that this is a perfect little gem that manages to have a few good laughs mixed in with all the human drama. I was always surprised to hear some people call this a comedy because the subject matter is certainly a lot darker. Yes, Wilder's story mixes in some very funny moments but I think these here are the exception with the drama being the rule. One of the truly funny moments happens during a long suicide sequence when Lemmon must try and kick out a woman who has no idea what's really going on in the apartment. Even the various subplots about Lemmon's neighbors thinking he's a ladies man aren't really used for laughs but instead to show how totally different his character is. I think what I enjoyed most about the picture is the actual screenplay because all three characters are so well-written that you really can't help but feel as if you're watching real people doing real things that the majority of humans do. I'm sure most people can relate to the loneliness of the Lemmon character and the way MacLaine's character feels used. I'm sure most people will recognize a snake like MacMurray who simply uses people for his own pleasure. All three characters are so perfectly drawn out and the dialogue so fresh that you have no reason not to make a connection with them. All three of the actors are also extremely good in their roles with Lemmon being the real stand out. I thought he did a rather remarkable job because the role really isn't a very easy one as he's got to play various emotions and I really thought the actor was great when he had to hold back his feelings even when they were killing him. MacLaine is also terrific in her part as she's so believable as this woman who just keeps getting dragged through the mud. Wilder's direction, as one would expect, is top-notch as he has no issues getting the story to play out, although I'm sure some might have an issue with the exact ending. Either way, this is a very good little drama that hits on some pretty dark notes but the performances, story and direction are so great that it easily deserves its reputation as an American classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, it's basically perfect, so what else is there to say? This film runs a close race with SUNSET BOULEVARD to being my favourite Wilder film. The script is just amazing (so many witty lines and so perfect in construction and small details), and Lemmon and MacLaine make a charming pair. I think this is Lemmon's best screen performance- at once he is both loony and love-struck and light-hearted yet serious. He pulls off the trick of making Baxter look like a completely ordinary guy off the street (working in an office with a zillion other people), yet the most individual person you would ever meet, with his tennis racquet as sieve and humming. MacLaine is wonderful and has an unusual appeal. I love the gamine look (in fact, her hair in this film is almost exactly like mine), and she's so quirky that she makes the "dumb" aspects of her character (Please! Why should she go back to a skunk like MacMurray when she has Lemmon waiting in his apartment for her to cook her spaghetti and make her laugh??) believable and lovable. Top marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's worth watching what Billy Wilder did, no matter what it is, or under which circumstances he did it. That's because he always tried to contour the adversities, even if, in the end, that shows shaped with irony and criticism to his patrons, using the possibilities they give. That's what he does here. The results aren't so much impressive, maybe because he mixes different worlds. He basically has a romance to tell, that's why he was hired, in order to produce the romantic comedy the way he was expected, beginning of the 60' but done in the 50's fashion. But in fact, he is anguished because he feels attached and dependent of a system of film production that doesn't allow him to express freely his concerns, his themes, his own ways. He would have the last refusal late in his life, when Spielberg wouldn't let him direct Schindler's list. That's why i feel his Stalag 17 must probably be a quite personal project for Wilder, one i'll look forward to see, soon. In this process of fighting for his own expression, he created a masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard, and the less interesting Ace in the Hole. The noir served perfectly his intentions to fold his inner feelings without shouting them, and still allowing him to make the film he'd been asked to do.Here, this didn't work that much. Since he was working with the romance, he replaced the noir environment for sex. So we have a character immersed in a modern world of exploitation, where he is told what to do, has his life sabotaged by the interests of (many) superiors. This is a world Chaplin had created in Modern Times, but here he replaces the fantastically choreographed machinery of the factory for sex. The apartment is a meeting point, sex drives what happens here, all of it. So, a man caught up by a system who has to work his ways to gain his freedom of decision. Get it?Jack Lemmon is a bliss, i really enjoy his non explosive, yet intense, comedy style. He has a way to move, to walk, that strenghtens his character, and in this particular case, makes him likable and easy to believe to be a pawn in the oppressive corrupt world. He's something of a tramp here. This is not innocent. The tramp may be one the more metaphorical characters in cinema, and he always portrays things we don't get on screen. Shirley MacLaine fits well, her face isn't as enigmatic and intense as that of the Hepburns, but she moves more enthusiastically.After so many years, i think what holds this film watchable are the performances. By now i don't have Wilder's context, and i'm way too far from the audiences who praised this in its time. And the whole machinery of sex seems like a line totally apart from the romance we get to follow, it's not merged properly, i think. Nevertheless there is a tenderness in the interpretations, and a nostalgia i take to the film as i start to watch it, not because i lived those days, but because i got to see what was made of these performers, Lemmon and MacLaine. Nostalgia is a powerful ingredient.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

The ending isn't your typical romantic ending with Jack Lemmon winning the girl as he holds her in his arms and kisses her. Although he does say he loves her, the two fall together as they begin to deal the cards and start their game. This black and white comedy is one of the last to be shot out of color. Adding to the timeless feel to it, the Apartment is a great date movie. I promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic "nice guy" "bad boy" dichotomy including the obligatory naive and low self esteem female lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for sexual tension, passion and complex characters, like I was when I started seeing this - you have come to the wrong place. If however, you are entertained by the prototypical stereotype of the "romantic" films of the modern times, with a nice guy courting the girl of the bad boy story, go for! We enter a cubicle type work place with a hierarchy. There is the protagonist, who is a spineless, reactive and wussy nice guy, manipulated by everyone. He falls in "love" with the naive, "goodhearted" girl living in the la-la land and working in the elevator - the female lead.Tolerating everything, submitting to every demand and being used by his co-workers for his apartment, he stumbles upon two musical tickets his boss "gifts" to him... in exchange for the keys to the apartment, where he plans to bring the elevator girl, who the boss himself is in lust with and who he happens to be screwing for a while. So the male protagonist hands his balls over to the elevator girl, while convinces her to see the musical. Naturally, she flakes and while he patiently waits outside for her, she is with his boss at his place.While still in lust with the bad boy, the nice guy keeps chasing and chasing while the boss continues to manipulates both of them. "Naturally", by being very very very nice (as in having weak personal boundaries, low self esteem and the disease to please) he keeps convincing the girl to like him. The female lead gets emotional, neurotic and suicidal after realizing that the bad boy has no intention to leave his wife. After saving her, the obligatory "Why can't I fall in love with a nice guy like you" follows. After showing some character and hesitantly standing up for his "values" or lack thereof the boy gets the girl, because "she deserves better".While it is a very nice (emphasis on nice) story on the so repeated male dichotomy, it does provide a few occasional but unintended laughs. Unfortunately it offers very little besides that because the characters are too immature and archetypical to relate to.This irony is that this is the kind of plot I got bored of in the modern movies after being blown away by classics like "Gone with the wind", "Streetcar named desire" and "It happened one night".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Wilder's comedy The Apartment is every bit as acerbic as his noir work with the exception that no one (there is a failed suicide) dies. Hypocrisy and deception (self and otherwise) are lynch pins to nearly all of his scenarios and with the Apartment he adds these elements in different amounts for his desired effect.Insurance man C.C. "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) makes his way from the 16th to the 27th floor of the company by loaning his apartment out to company execs and their current paramours. The evening interruptions can be slightly irritating but it's a small price to pay for advancement. Things become complicated however when serial adulterer and CEO Jeff Sheldrake's latest, elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley Mac Laine) is also pursued by Baxter.Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script is more sullen than funny and despite the sweet interplay between Lemmon and Mac Laine the film plods along in a rather lugubrious mood with ugly undertones.Lemmon's Baxter is a non stop display of nervous energy and facial ticks as if he were still in his Some Like it Hot, Daphne role. It worked in drag, here it annoys. As Fran, Mac Laine holds up Lemmon and has both the right look and mood of the exploited female in despair. Her muted pain speaks volumes to women of that (and this as well) era. They don't come more surly and unctuous than Fred Mac Murray's Sheldrake. Cold, callous and arrogant it ranks with his Indemnity performance. It's a shame he avoided these character roles in his career, even if Flubber and My Three Sons offered bigger pay days. The supporting cast of arch characters (Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, Edie Adams et all ) are ridiculously over the top stereotypes that lend the film a mawkish overkill.The set design and Joseph LeShelle's cinematography utilizes interior sets of home and office as pertinent metaphors for the actions and situations of its characters with succinct harmony. There is little need for exterior work with these expansive stages conveying an entire world of it's characters.A sophisticated adult comedy for its day, The Apartment does not date as well as other films (Room at the Top, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning) tackling the taboo subject of adultery in 1960. As in most of his comedies Wilder's direction can be pedestrian and broad at times and in the case of The Apartment one has to look no further than his leading man to find this problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment is an undervalued masterwork, not only because of the quality of the acting, but because Wilder exploration of the the possibilities of cinematographic language in ways that have escaped on many critics. The love story is only a motive to explore the nature of power relations in the corporate world, and Wilder's film dwell into gender issues before the topic was fashionable. More importantly, The Apartment is a classic because its cinematographic languages explores the possibility's of irony in ways that rarely we have witnessed in the history of cinematography. If you are eager for a clue, next time you watch the film focus on Dr. Dreyfuss's appearance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds but is uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree somewhat with the praise for Billy Wilder's "The Apartment" so far. Sure, it is enjoyable. However, it is never in the class of Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho", also released during the same year (1960). The Academy Awards "The Apartment" received all should have been awarded to Hitchcock.I have issues with Jack Lemmon/s portrayal of CC Baxter. Some other user-reviews on this subject are written by evanston_dad (evanston_dad, "A Dark Romantic Comedy", 5 October 2006) and Johnathan Birks (Johnathan Birks, "Overcooked plot, underdone characters", 28 November 2012). Birks nails it: Lemmon is cloying. He's also too nervy and manic, particularly early on. Lemmon and Wilder have made CC Baxter too painful to warm up to.Beyond the slight to Hitchcock and beyond Lemmon's performance, there is still a lot to enjoy. Fred MacMurray was a real pro to step in at the last minute and play the cad (Jeffrey Sheldrake). MacMurray is convincing up to a point, but sometimes seems too nice.Visually, there's not much of interest. I can't think of a single shot that is memorable, unlike in "Double Indemnity." However, there is some memorably romantic dialog from Wilder.Shirley Maclaine's superb performance saves "The Apartment," and makes it all worthwhile. Her comic and tragic Fran Kubelik is great to watch. The naturalness and range displayed by MacLaine is exquisite. Acting came easy to her."The Apartment" wins some points for depicting the horror of corporate workplaces, and for depicting the female side of abusive relationships with workplace superiors. It pulls you in and finishes very nicely. The last scene is very memorable. It has a lot to like. Just don't expect a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Office Romance Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Apartment is a comedy-drama film produced and directed by Billy Wilder, which stars Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Fred MacMurray. It was Wilder's follow-up to Some Like It Hot and, like its predecessor, was a commercial and critical hit.Director/co-writer Billy Wilder claimed that the idea for The Apartment stemmed from a short scene in the 1945 romantic drama Brief Encounter in which the illicit lovers arrange a rendezvous in a third person's apartment. Wilder was intrigued about what sort of person would willingly vacate his residence to allow virtual strangers a playing field for hanky panky.Widely regarded as a comedy in 1960, The Apartment seems more melancholy with each passing year. Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a go-getting office worker who loans his tiny apartment to his philandering superiors for their romantic trysts. He runs into trouble when he finds himself sharing a girlfriend with his callous boss. Wilder's customary cynicism is leavened here by tender humor, romance, and genuine pathos.A comedy of men's-room humors and water-cooler politics that now and then among the belly laughs says something serious and sad about the struggle for success, about what it often does to a man, and about the horribly small world of big business.Also,Most of the time, it's up to director Wilder to sustain a two-hour-plus film on treatment alone, a feat he manages to accomplish more often than not, and sometimes the results are amazing.Most of all,the movie elevates the workplace romance into a sublime erotics of officious addresses and economic conundrum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives Of Quiet Desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historically significant because it implicitly defied the unctuous Production Code relative to the topic of adultery, "The Apartment" nevertheless reeks of dreary 1950s melodrama. None of the characters invoke empathy. They all lead lives of quiet desperation, imprisoned in a cold corporate culture, here defined as a large insurance company in a Manhattan skyscraper.One of the company's junior execs, a little man named C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon), loans out his apartment to some of the company's big shots who use the four room flat to engage in a little hanky-panky with cheap floozies. The plot lacks believability.Baxter, an overly cooperative yes-man, ingratiates himself with higher-ups as a way to climb the corporate ladder. Toady that he is, he's also lonely. He sees prospects in the elevator operator, young, naive, ambivalent Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who drops him off at the nineteenth floor, one huge office filled with stick-figure characters who sit at desks and stare at antiquated desk calculators.In contrast to the brightly lit, straight-lined geometry of the ice-cold, corporate office, Baxter's dingy little apartment is dark, cozy, and personal. A lot of the melodrama occurs here and immediately outside. Execs with their babes come and go, much to the chagrin of the doctor who lives in the apartment next door.Even though it's billed as a comedy, I find nothing funny in this film. What passes for comedy merely amplifies a sense of loneliness in the dreary lives these people live. The tone trends melancholy and gloomy whenever Baxter is by himself, accompanied by lonely-guy background music.Jack Lemmon gives his usual jumpy, fidgety, frenetic performance, irritatingly nervous and hyper. Shirley MacLaine fares better, with a more naturalistic interpretation of her character.I acknowledge that Billy Wilder's "The Apartment" bravely portrays infidelity as a story theme in a sexually repressive era. But the film's slavishly conforming characters, contrived plot, and dreary tone leave me yearning for something a bit brighter, a bit more inventive, and funny, like "How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying" (1967).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much to laugh about, but the fruitcake made it very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersI recall when I first watched this movie a prominent scene where they (Jack Lemon as CC Baxter and his doctor/neighbor) walk Fran Cubulic (Shirley McClain) around after she purposely overdosed her sleeping pills. I recall wondering why anyone thought this sad story was a comedy. Obviously, it was very serious at that point. All of that said, it was well put together romantic/movie that kind of hits a nitch between comedy and drama. The tremendous upbeat ending made all of the super-sad melodrama that takes place prior to it, well worth it. You dwelve into the life of CC Baxter, who looks to succeed in his job, and therefore, has continuously lent his apartment out to his superiors (One of whom a Mr Dobish is played by Ray Walston of "My Favorite Martian" and "Fast Time at Ridgemont High" fame). His superiors use his apartment as an inexpensive hotel to take their dates. His superiors in turn help Baxter, and he gets a job working under Mr Sheldrake (Fred Mc Murray) in Personnel. Sheldrake is aware of the shenanigans at Baxter's apartment. We find out Mr. Sheldrake is also an kind of an operator, using secretaries like a Mrs. Olsen and others for his fun. He wants to use Baxter's apartment with still another girl. Baxter who is eager to please Sheldrake, agrees. The woman Sheldrake brings to Baxter's apartment leaves something there by accident. Baxter has his eyes on an perky elevator operator, who is cold to Dobish and others who encounter her, named Fran Cubilick. He begins to make his move on her and invites her to a Christmas Party. During the party, Baxter finds out accidentally that Cubilick is the woman having the affair with his supervisor Mr Sheldrake in his apartment. Now he knows why she is so cold to everyone else. He also realizes he should not keep moving on her. He leaves. Baxter goes out to a bar and picks up another woman. Mrs Olsen, Sheldrakes, former fling, has a long talk with Fran Cubilick about Mr. Sheldrake and breaks Fran's heart, letting her know she is just the most recent woman, in a string of Sheldrake's extra-marital affairs. Cubulick says nothing to Sheldrake. When Sheldrake takes Cubilick to Baxter's apartment (she does not know it is Baxter's apartment), Fran believes she is being used and feels like a whore, especially, when Sheldrake gives her 100 dollars for a Christmas present. As a result, when Sheldrake goes home, to his wife, Fran stays in Baxter's apartment and attempts suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.As super-sad as all of this sound, this movie's upbeat ending fell just short of making this movie a full fledged romantic comedy. If you want to stop here, this is a good place to stop and go out and get the movie and FEEL the ending for yourself.For those of you who might want to read on:When he takes home a woman he met in a bar, Baxter finds Cubilick out cold in his bed and can not wake her. He dumps the other woman while waking a neighbor, who happens to be a doctor. They get Fran out of it after a night of coffee and walking around. Baxter takes the blame for Fran's condition himself, making his neighbor question his morality. This keeps his Supervisor, Sheldrake out of any trouble and free to enjoy Christmas with his wife and family. Over the next few days, Fran and CC Baxter talk about their lives, their problems and their mistakes. We find out, that CC Baxter also had a love affair go bad, and attempted suicide, over a woman that now sends him a fruitcake every Christmas. CC Baxter will not talk down his supervisor, Mr Sheldrake and keeps Fran thinking there is good in Sheldrake, because Baxter likes him. As a result, in-spite of all that took place, Fran continues her affair with Sheldrake. Sheldrake as a result of the suicide attempt, fires Mrs. Olsen. Mrs Olsen then talks to Sheldrake's wife and forces the Sheldrakes to divorce. Baxter talks to Sheldrake and Sheldrake indicates he has no intention of marrying Fran, despite the fact he is now divorced and Single. He wants to "enjoy life as a bachelor again". Sheldrake also gives Baxter an additional promotion to become his personal assistant. Sheldrake then wants to take Fran to Baxter's Apartment for New Years. Baxter won't allow it and refuses to give Sheldrake the key. Baxter quits his job and begins packing to move. Just before mid night on New Years, Sheldrake mentions to Fran, that he needed to get a room in Atlantic City, because Baxter would not let him use the apartment. Sheldrake tells Fran that Baxter quit his job and even quotes Baxter, when he said, he especially can not take Miss Cubilick to the apartment. This clues Fran in to something Sheldrake missed, entirely. Baxter cares for Fran Cubilick and he is standing up and not being walked on for the sake of getting ahead in the job. Right at the stroke of midnight, Fran disappears and runs through the streets to Baxter's apartment, leaving Sheldrake alone. When Baxter asks about Mr. Sheldrake, Fran lets Baxter know they will send Sheldrake a fruitcake, every Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creativity and Jack Lemmon make this Wilder classic easy to love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acclaimed writer/director Billy Wilder strikes again with another humorous and romantic comedy in "The Apartment." But more important than another triangular love story from the "Some Like It Hot" creator is the actor he brought along with him: Jack Lemmon. Though "Hot" was his breaking out party, "The Apartment" really boasts the range of the funny, neurotic and charismatic Lemmon.In this film, Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a lowly insurance worker hoping to climb the corporate ladder by "leasing" his primely located Manhattan apartment to four different company executives so they can entertain their mistresses. Baxter himself claims to be a humble bachelor, but his eye for the attractive elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine) in his building tells us otherwise. Problem is, Fran's still in love with another man and that other man happens to be Baxter's boss, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).Lemmon defines lovable protagonist as Baxter. From his goofy nasal voice early in the film as he tries to satisfy all his "clients" whilst carrying a cold to his fast-talking enthusiasm as he courageously asks out Fran. It's almost too much when we see him alone in his apartment dancing from excitement or cleverly taking a hit to his reputation by letting his neighbors assume he's a playboy. Watching play second fiddle to Fran and Sheldrake's unsettled affair through much of the film is almost difficult because we want him to be the one finding love.MacLaine is marvelous as the down-on-herself, lovestruck Fran, the very beginning of what of course became a long and fruitful career. MacMurray is excellent too, playing a strong lead for being so late in his career.But it's Lemmon's performance and Wilder's lovable story that make "The Apartment" such a classic. By 1960, no one could keep audiences from knowing that the two leads would fall in love, but the key was finding a different way to get them there. Wilder also pokes fun at a what was a touchy subject in the era of the "perfect American family" in rich married men going on dates with younger women. It's that creative and light sense of humor hovering over all the drama that makes Wilder comedies so good.~Steven C Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the fifth time is the charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE APARTMENT won five Oscars in 1961 (for best picture of 1960, as well as for directing, writing, editing, and art direction). Additionally, it garnered five other nominations (for actors Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, and Jack Kruschen, as well as for best cinematography and sound). In the story, Consolidated Life Insurance Company "big boss" Jeff "J.D." Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) is the fifth company executive named to be using C.C. "Bud" Baxter's (Lemmon's) well-situated apartment for extra-curricular affairs. Meanwhile, Bud's one romantic crush, Consolidated elevator girl Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), turns out to be Sheldrake's FIFTH office romance partner among the 31,259 employees laboring within the CLI Manhattan skyscraper. THE APARTMENT is 125 minutes long (mathematically, that's 5 to the third power), and Fran has the movie's last line (after running out on the now involuntarily-separated Jeff's belated sort-of marriage proposal, to Bud's nearby digs during the early minutes of Jan. 1, 1960): "Shut up, and deal." And, of course, in gin rummy Bud is to deal each player 10 cards--the exact number of THE APARTMENT's Oscar nominations! So, it is clear this movie must earn a 2 X 5 ranking (which equals 10)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Apartment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about THE APARTMENT that hasn't already been said? In my opinion, it is Billy Wilder's masterpiece and one of the top 50, maybe even top 40 movies of all time. It's in a whole different league amongst the majority of the films, classics or indies, that they show on Reel 13 (BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is the only one that comes close). It is an almost amazingly perfect blend of comedy and drama, equally hilarious and heart-wrenching. This is a film that contains a suicide attempt, discusses another, features depression, significant infidelity and suggested promiscuity and yet manages to be perennially charming.Cameron Crowe suggested that THE APARTMENT was a major inspiration for his film Jerry Maguire. At one point, he went to visit Billy Wilder to ask him to play a cameo in the film (the old-time agent in the opening). Though Wilder would eventually turn him down, Crowe did get to ask him about THE APARTMENT and all Wilder had to say was "Good actors. It worked". A simple analysis, granted, but it wisely gets at the heart of what elevates The Apartment to a whole different level. I mean, all the elements are strong ? the production design of the titular apartment and also the interior of the office are wonderfully detailed and the screenplay, of course, is brilliantly tight and well-crafted, but that's true of a great many Billy Wilder films. For THE APARTMENT, it is the inspired pairing of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine and their abilities to be charismatic while exuding pathos that puts THE APARTMENT over the top.I think of the scene in which Lemmon's Bud Baxter is trying to cheer up the broken-hearted Fran (MacLaine) who is embarrassed by her attempted suicide. Baxter reveals to her that he had tried it once himself years ago and relates to her the circumstances behind it in a monologue that in spite of its seriousness is delivered to be a lark of a story, almost as if a joke. In many other actor's hands, the monologue would have been morose and would have felt awkward tonally. However, Baxter's ability to laugh at his pain is not only charming, it's uplifting and due to Lemmon's conviction in his performance, it still feels honest.MacLaine also has a great deal of strong moments and in a way, her character is the more challenging one. Her pain and heartbreak over her affair with Baxter's boss (an awesomely sleazy Fred MacMurray) is palpable and she still manages to throw in a quip or two from rock bottom. Instead of this feeling off-tone, MacLaine makes it work and it only adds dimensions to her character and rounds her out more. MacLaine craftfully navigates her character's journey from in confused love with a married man to suicidal and broken-hearted to a suddenly adult woman who comes to terms with both herself and the important things in life.I could go on for days praising the individual qualities of THE APARTMENT ? the pitch- perfect framing, the uber-clever dialogue ("That's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise".), the surprisingly effective bluesy score, the precise blocking of scenes, but I don't have time for all that. Instead, I'll let the maestro himself, Billy Wilder, sum things up the way he does best: simply and to the point ? "Good actors. It worked".(For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best 100 Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliantly made film. With a legendary cast list and one of the greatest directors of all time, Billy Wilder, at the helm this movie goes the gamut of emotions. This is truly a film that grabs hold of you and you hold back. There is a lot going on through various levels of the film which enable one to see it over and over and always find a little something you didn't see before. Jack Lemmon has so many memorable roles that his role in The Apartment is sometimes over looked. Lemmon was nominated for an Oscar for lead actor in 1961 for this film and did win several awards including a Golden Globe. Lemmon is funny, handles a little slapstick, he awkward and even suave. He pulls them all off with ease. He plays an everyman character stuck in a strange situation, a type of character that he absolutely perfected through his career.The Apartment takes place in Manhattan. C.C. Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, is a clerk working at a large company and working for many bosses. In fact, he comments that his company has 31,259 employees at the home office alone. He's single and lends his one bedroom apartment to one of the executives for an evening. Word gets around and before you know it Baxter is lending his key to more than a few executives. The borrowed evenings are for rendezvous with mistresses and suddenly he is caught between company, bosses, landlord and neighbors. His evenings without his apartment get strained when Bud catches a cold. Shirley MacLaine is the lovely Fran Kubelik, the elevator girl that Bud has a crush on. A triangle of trouble develops when Bud discovers his boss Mr Sheldrake, played by an equally brilliant Fred MacMurray, has a thing with the lovely Fran Kubelik. This movie is in black and white. The art direction is amazing. The scenes of Baxter's office and the Orwellian space of people with adding machines as well as the apartment itself are spot on. When you see the apartment for the first time, you know you're in New York and you know just who lives there and if there is any doubt Baxter's character mentions that he pays $94 per month for the apartment. Wilder's story and direction are compelling and hysterical at the same time. There is no doubt this is best picture material. I think MacLaine was probably overlooked for a supporting actress award, her performance is that good.For me this film falls in the top 100 films ever made. I love that you can watch it many times and continue to walk away with something new. The black and while filming gives the movie a time reference and set of values frozen in that moment. The cast of Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray are amazing with the supporting cast playing an A game in their own roles. This film is a film-making lesson for anyone that studies film. 10/10*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great-great- Tragic-Comedy -- FILM-WISE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote this in response to an awful review of this film. In quotes are criticisms followed by my responses. I am such a fan of this film that I could not let these comments go unchecked, as it were...critique-wise. I hope you all find this engaging and informing."The main characters are absurd and their motivations make little sense." You'll have to be more specific and give examples of this if you want anyone to understand or respect this statement."The supporting cast plays characters right out of a comic-book." I'd like to know what comic books you are reading! First of all, have you ever heard of the concept of the "stock character?" It's only as old as theater itself. That's what these characters are and as such are not well-drawn out but predictable and flat. They serve to inform on the main characters and plot, and are to be well recognized and familiar to the audience immediately upon entrance, a la, "commedia dell'Arte," Moliere, Goldoni, Shakespeare, Plautus, etc, etc, whose stock characters, I assume, you have similar misgivings, "All this superficiality and absurdity wouldn't matter at all if only this were a proper comedy." Now this is a truly mystifying statement. In a "proper" comedy these "absurdities" would be, I would think, impossible, unless I misunderstand, in which case you need to provide examples from other films, plays, etc...The film plays up the near-perfection and integrity of its two main leads, but it simply doesn't wash in MacLaine's case. If she is such an angel why is she a home-wrecker who goes out with a married man with kids? "Near perfection." ??? Now I feel as though we are viewing two different films. All the characters, ALL OF THEM, are severely flawed. Hence, they have depth, causing us to have sympathy with them. (Which might go a long way in explaining the popularity and high regard the film has experienced, which has escaped you for some reason.) "An angel"??? Of course she's no angel. She is, now hold on, a HUMAN BEING, full of flaws, and beauty, kindness, and love, cruelty and indifference."And does it have to be one of the company's top executives as well?" This is simply childish. How old are you? I would guess that you did not live at the time this film was released and may be a product of the post-1960 revolution. I mean, what does this have to do with anything? You think it mattered to her who she fell for? Have you ever been in love? Would it have been more genuine if she had fallen for the janitor??? Jeez."And what's with Lemmon's character? This guy is so self-sacrificing and noble that Wilder should have had him nailed to the cross in the last scene. Example's, please, of his "self-sacrifice"? None that I can think of. If you're thinking of his protecting Sheldrake as "self-sacrificing," well think again, my friend. As above, you do not see the flaw in Lemmon's character, very well and clearly delineated by his desire to climb up the ladder by pimping his apartment. And what of his picking up a married woman at the bar on Christmas eve. Nice? Again, were we watching different films? The basic plot outline of the film is good and there was real potential there for a terrific situation comedy, but Wilder took the easy route and turned this into a schmaltzy romance film with the Hollywood violins accompanying every schmaltzy scene. Quite the contrary: the easy was would have been to create a straight comedy. Among the many reasons this film is held is such high regard (again this escapes you for some reason) is that it straddles high tragedy and low comedy, a virtually impossible feat and I defy to name another film that does so with any degree of success.FINAL NOTES: I can recall seeing this film during it's initial run (yes, I'm that old). (I hate all this discussion of great films that have never been seen by the critic on the big screen--the experience is amazing and the manner in which the film improves is immeasurable). You cannot imagine the audience's reaction. Wilder had them in the palm of his hand. As the film went up, the audience went up, down, they went down. And, there was much laughter. Much more than can be achieved on a screen in one's living room...alone, which is, let's face it, how most of us watch films now.Most egregiously, you have not mentioned the performances. I cannot think of a film, let alone comedy, that contains this degree of superior acting achieved by as many actors! Here we see Lemmon at his comedic/tragic best, McClaine, no doubt at her finest, MacMurray, cast against type, is perfect, Kruschen, (an Oscar) his (the doctor's) wife, Ray Walston, and "the guys," all perfect, along with the fabulous Joan Shawlee.This film, is, in total, a masterpiece of the film-maker's craft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart Dramedy That Keeps Viewers in the Dark, With Sparks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the interest of space and preventing redundancy, I will not provide a full review of The Apartment. A great many commenters before me already have written such excellent critiques of magic man Billy Wilder's remarkably timeless farce. First, let me say out loud that not since Wall Street have I viewed a smarter corporate fable with such ingenious dialogue. My two cents here, then, will zoom in tightly on the movie's portrayal of working women and its exploration of their inner lives.While we women have made great advancements in the workplace -- even smashing through the glass ceiling now and then like underpaid stuntwomen -- when it comes to matters of the heart, some things never change. Every time I watch the scenes between actors Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray, I get a lump in my throat that sits there until funny man Jack Lemmon's lightens the scene with one of his brilliant facial mannerisms. Now, I have viewed The Apartment more than 15 times -- since first catching it on cable's TCM channel three years ago and since receiving the video two years ago as a gift from the unrequited-love-of-my-life. So those are a lot of lumps in my throat. Such is the power of a great script and masterful direction, both of which allowing the viewers to study the contours of a heart that has been broken, mended and broken again. And such is the endurance of The Apartment, a Billy Wilder satire dealing with the lack of ethics in corporate America and the resulting alienation and sexual pathos.What is amazing, and thrilling, is that The Apartment feels as contemporary now as it must have been in 1960. As attached as I am to my apartment, I feel the misery of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter character every time he must (well, of his own volition) forsake his. What wild circumstances The Apartment presents for viewers' critique and voyeuristic pleasure.Speaking of pleasure, the adulterous fantasies played out in The Apartment are darkly Wilder. Back in 1960, I wasn't even a sparkle in my father's eye. Hmmmm ... come to think of it, with all the illicit fun folks were having back then, too, perhaps I wasn't meant to be a sparkle in my mother's eye, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Apartment (1960) | Directed by: Billy Wilder | Starring: Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray | Score: 10/10 AUntil recently, I had declared most classic films, with the exception of a few, to be overrated. The Apartment is the film that reopened my eyes to the glory that classic films can bring. Not only was the story and dialog excellent, the film is timeless: I could easily see someone remaking this soon, and not much would have to be changed. Sure, they'd be using computers instead of typewriters and cell phones instead of pay phones, but human nature remains the same today as it did in the sixties.The story is pretty simple: a man named C.C. Baxter (played by the always great Jack Lemmon) is desperately seeking a promotion in his job. His job consumes him, probably because he has nothing else to fill his life with. Baxter lives alone in a rather nice apartment. He has no life, no wife, and, on most nights, not even a bed to sleep in. This is because, in order to climb the corporate ladder, Baxter has agreed to let his various bosses use his apartment as a place to take their mistresses. Baxter is about to call it quits, when the big boss calls him in for a favor. He agrees to promote Baxter if gives him the use of his apartment. Meanwhile, Baxter is continually flirting with the elevator girl (a good performance by a young Shirley MacLaine), who does not return his affection. When he finds out that his boss's mistress IS the elevator girl, drama ensues. The question is whether or not she will see past the man who will never leave his wife and see Baxter for the guy that he is.It's a simple drama with a lot of clever dialog. The characters are very real. You can almost feel for Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine's characters; you can almost hate Fred MacMurray. It's easy to get tied into these people's lives. The film runs over two hours, but it does not seem long or tedious. Every performance is on key and everything is believable. It's not all serious, though. There are many comedic moments in the film. Word play is important and situations take on a humorous tone due to the clever Shirley MacClaine and the good natured Jack Lemmon.The Apartment is a gem of a movie if I've ever seen one. It's yet another reason to declare Billy Wilder a genius of a filmmaker. Even to those who do not appreciate the classics: try this one. You won't regret it. And if you do.. well, that's the way it crumbles, cookie wise.10/10 A, Eleven Dollars Reviews 2008</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever had any doubts that Billy Wilder was one of Hollywood's all-time greatest directors, you may now consider me totally convinced. My ninth film from Wilder is among his very best, a sophisticated, sensitive and cynical comedy/drama/romance that satirises and critiques corporate big business and America's fading moral standards. Jack Lemmon, following the success of the director's previous film ?the hilarious cross-dressing farce 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' ? here proves his worth as a dramatic actor, bringing to the character of C. C. Baxter the charm and sincerity of an average, working-class American employee, trying to making an honest living from his powerless position as an office clerk at a large, impersonal insurance firm. In a society where power leads to corruption, Baxter finds his own steadfast morals beginning to slide, having agreed to loan out his apartment to higher-ranked business executives for the purposes of their underhanded extra-martial affairs. It is an act through which Baxter hopes to climb the corporate ladder, though he is simultaneously disgusted by the moral implications of his actions; lending out his apartment is the business equivalent of prostitution, and he recognises that he is merely being exploited in a manner than harms his moral integrity.'The Apartment (1960)' was written by Billy Wilder and regular-collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, and is every bit as intelligent, witty and classy as the likes of 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' and 'Double Indemnity (1944).' Though certainly not as laugh-out-loud hilarious as 'Some Like It Hot,' the film dispenses comedy, romance and drama in such perfectly-portioned satchels that only a master could have helmed the production. Cinematographer Joseph LaShelle shot the film in crisp black-and-white, subduing the otherwise festive atmosphere of the Christmas-time setting and creating an air of bittersweet melancholy, the sort of sensation one feels when left alone with a joyful celebration ? its sounds muffled by the adjoining walls ? taking place in the next room. 'The Apartment' is also a meditation on loneliness. Though Baxter has developed an unearned reputation as something of a "party animal" {allowing for some amusing confrontations with his neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen)}, he is very much a solitary figure, disheartened by the general slackening of society's moral standards and left wondering why nice guys always finish last.Of course, I couldn't review 'The Apartment' without also mentioning the performances of Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray, who help form the film's pivotal romantic triangle. MacLaine's Fran Kubelik, one of the building's elevator operators, is bright and independent in most respects, but has found herself romantically exploited by the insurance firm's director, Jeff D. Sheldrake (MacMurray), who has promised her a steady future but refuses to divorce his current wife. MacLaine brings a beautifully-balanced combination of intelligence and vulnerability to the role, at first appearing to be a carefree, upright young lady before slowly revealing vital flaws in her character. MacMurray, who I'd previously enjoyed as Walter Neff in Wilder's definitive film-noir, brings just the right amount of smug condescension to his interactions with Baxter, and his character's attempts at earnestness are immediately transparent as acts of unashamed manipulation. At the 1961 Academy Awards, voters were obviously impressed with the film's ability to tell a great story without the usual syrupy hijinks, and 'The Apartment' took away a deserved five Oscars, including Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture ? the final black-and-white film to do so before Steven Spielberg's Holocaust epic, 'Schindler's List (1993).'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Movie wise there has never been anything like 'The Apartment' love wise, laugh wise or otherwise"- is how the promoters describe this film, and that description is surely accurate.Superb romance/comedy which deservedly won a load of awards including Oscars and rightly so in my view.Why is it modern film makers cannot give us quality like this?Everything about this film is right: the script, locations, direction etc are all 'spot on' and quite apart from the super star displays from the 3 main leads all the actors give first class performances.In brief the story line: An employee in a big company seeking to get promotion lets out his apartment to company executive for trysts but complications arise as well as a romance of his own.The film is over two hours long yet had me engrossed throughout.Well done to MGM for making this and putting it on the MGM TV channel.Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking back on this film,as with any film from the early 1960's,it is clearly evident that Hollywood's decency board was all but dissolving very slowly.Sexuality and profanity were slowly starting to work their way into our cinematic entertainment.In this film,the issue is sex,although you rarely,if at all,even hear the word mentioned.I liked the story,and I liked the performances here,particularly those of Jack Lemmon,who was at his comedic best here,and the lovely Shirley MacLaine as the quirky and lovable Fran Kubelik.This was a fun film to watch,because it is a reminder that romantic comedies were once not as run of the mill and repetitive as they are in the current day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Censorship and questionable taste didn't seem to matter in the '60s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE APARTMENT is one of the more successful American comedies of that era that illustrates my point, liberated by lack of strict censorship.It staggers the imagination to wonder how this kind of tale would have been accepted in the more prudish '40s or '50s when Ozzie and Harriet still reigned supreme as the prime example of American mores.Evidently, by 1961, censorship was out and the anything goes morality was in--because the tale of a man who climbs the executive ladder by giving the key to his apartment away to a flock of office higher-ups, is the core of this Billy Wilder comedy. The theme is unsavory but the manner of delivering it is full of witty and sardonic humor.Director Wilder takes this raw material and turns it into high class sentimental comedy that gives the talented JACK LEMMON one of the best roles of his career and showcases SHIRLEY MacLAINE in one of her best ditzy dame roles. Furthermore, it provides FRED MacMURRAY with one of the last "bad guy" roles he had before becoming the clean-cut hero of "Father Knows Best" on TV.It's all given a nice B&amp;W sheen by cinematographer Joseph LaShelle and a perky background score by Adolph Deutsch. The sharp dialog gives a lot of memorable quotes to a number of supporting players, including Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen and Edie Adams. Everyone benefits from a superior script by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond.Tasteful? Well, it hardly matters any more. It's funny.</fullReview>

What a change of character for MacMurrayBilly Wilder hit it big, winning 3 Oscars, in this memorable film.There's plenty of relish added by neighbor, Jack Kruschen, as the doctor. Ray Walston shines as another boss asking buddy Boy for the keys to the apartment. Then there's Edie Adams, MacMurray's secretary and one-time lover, who turns the tables on her boss, when he fires her.We always knew there was a housing shortage in N.Y. but we never really knew the ramifications resulting.

		<shortDescription>The corporate life on and on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder finally won an Oscar with this charmingly funny look into the effects of corporate life on people's relationships. Calvin Clifford "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) works for an advertising company in New York. While most people leave work at a certain time, he continues working for some time afterwards and lets his co-workers use his apartment for parties. Thus, he always arrives home and finds the place trashed. But, in his desire to rise to the top of the corporate ladder, he allows this.But things are about to change. You see, elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine) is injecting some joy into Baxter's life...and then some. The whole world as both of them know it may be about to get turned upside down.Wilder once again shows his talent on every front. With a top notch cast, and a no-holds-barred look at life and the corporate world, "The Apartment" is a 10/10 in every way.Oh, and one more thing. The man playing Mr. Eichelberger is David White, who a few years later got famous in another corporate drudgery-related role: Larry Tate on "Bewitched".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 5 Things Wrong with "The Apartment"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>5. Corporate executives have never needed to borrow shabby apartments for an office affair. That's what hotels and cash are for.4. Nor do executives openly expose themselves as cads and philanderers to their underlings.3. Far from being a hero, the tenant (Jack Lemmon) is a blindly ambitious and contemptible toady for vacating his apartment whenever his bedroom is needed by his boss-- correction, bosses, plural, because five(!) executives use his apartment. If he charged them for it, he'd still be contemptible, but at least he wouldn't be a schnook.2. The girl (Shirley MacLaine) is simultaneously tough-talking and so vulnerable that she becomes suicidal when her obviously predatory boss (Fred Macmurray) treats her like a whore. She's no victim. She has an affair with a married man. He doesn't respect her. Big surprise.1. All these things add up to Billy Wilder and screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond trying to have it both ways-- comic and tragic. They convinced most of the audience (and the Academy) that Lemmon and Maclaine's characters are basically good and decent in an amoral world, but I'm not buying it. However much Wilder/Diamond try to manipulate the plot, the actions of those two characters are as amoral and selfish as any people in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and highly entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Billy Wilder's films, and The Apartment is no exception. In fact, it is my favourite Billy Wilder film after Sunset Blvd and Some Like it Hot. The film looks lovely, with beautiful cinematography and production values, and Adolph Deutsch's music is a fine touch. The story is constructed wonderfully, it is always entertaining yet has a somewhat dark edge to it too, while the pace is solid and Wilder's direction superb. Where The Apartment soars, other than its beautifully crafted characters, is in the performances and writing. The writing is brilliant, always witty, funny and clever, while the acting is very skilled making the characters even more likable than they are. Jack Lemmon's performance is very skilled, and Shirley McLaine's is what gives The Apartment its charm, while Fred MacMurray is dashing. The supporting cast are equally terrific especially Ray Walston. In conclusion, highly entertaining and one of Wilder's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Apartment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), this was a highly rated classic comedy that I knew very little about, and I was most looking forward. Basically, in New York City, lives insurance statistician C.C. 'Bud'/'Buddy Boy' Baxter (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Jack Lemmon) trying to climb the corporate ladder. There is only one thing he can't control properly in his life, his apartment, it started as lending his key to one person at work for a woman, and then two others, and it has continued hundreds of times. Word spreads about this "service" Bud is providing, and like he predicted, boss Jeff D. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) does promote him, on the condition that he lets him borrow the apartment too. Bud swallows his anger at the situation, and he plans to try a date with the female elevator operator, Fran Kubelik (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Shirley MacLaine), but he is devastated when he finds out she is Sheldrake's flame. One night, in the borrowed apartment, Fran realises Sheldrake is wrong for her, he has no plans to divorce his wife any time soon, and when he is gone she attempts suicide on an overdose of sleeping pills. Luckilly, Bud finds her, and neighbour Dr. Dreyfuss (Oscar nominated Jack Kruschen), who has been questioning Bud's "activities", helps revive her, and Bud promises to look after her while recovering. The recovery lasts over Christmas, Bud does call Sheldrake who doesn't act on it, and he tries to entertain Fran with games of gin rummy, and seeing her in the bad state makes him think about other people using his apartment. Fran is fully recovered, and leaves, kissing Bud on the cheek which confirms his love for her, but she goes back to Sheldrake, who fires his secretary for sharing truths with Fran. The secretary goes to tell Sheldrake's wife the truth, but Sheldrake enjoys his newfound bachelorhood and keep the fling with Fran going, Bud meanwhile stands up for himself and doesn't allow his boos (or anyone else I'm guessing) to borrow the key to his apartment, and he is prepared to quit his job. It comes to New Year's Eve, Fran is with Sheldrake who tells her about Bud quitting, she realises he is her true love, she catches him at the apartment packing to move out, and she insists they finish their game of gin rummy, in the end, he wants to confirm she loves him like he does her, she just says "shut up and deal". Also starring Ray Walston as Joe Dobisch, David Lewis as Al Kirkeby, Joan Shawlee as Sylvia, Edie Adams as Miss Olsen, Hope Holiday as Mrs. Margie MacDougall, Johnny Seven as Karl Matuschka, Naomi Stevens as Mrs. Mildred Dreyfuss and Frances Weintraub Lax as Mrs. Lieberman. Lemmon is always reliable in any film he is in, and MacLaine is a great female co-star for him, while Wilder directs with style, this film features in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it certainly deserves that place being a great comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy. Jack Lemmon was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 93 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 80 on 100 Years, 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition), it was number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 2 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die.

		<shortDescription>Wilder does it twice in a row</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Wilder, the director of the cult comedy movie "Some Like It Hot" created this movie just one year after the classic. "Some Like it Hot" was an extravagant masterpiece with elements of crime, thriller, action, music, drama and offcourse mind boggling comedy. The Apartment on the other hand is a simple story about a person (Lemmon) who does a clerical job in an insurance company and gains popularity and promotion by making his seniors happy. He makes his seniors happy by lending his apartment to them for their extra-marital affairs.The story takes a sudden turn when Lemmon's love interest(Maclaine) and his insurance company boss (MacMurray) visit his apartment . What follows is a topsy-turvy ride which includes Lemmon trying his best to keep his boss as well as his love interest happy while trying his best to hide his inner feelings for her.The story is simple and the ending predictable. But what makes this movie enjoyable is the handling of the story by the director and the treatment by the actors . Lemmon plays his role to the tee where sometimes the viewer sympathies with his character. The dialogues of this movie are smartly written with intelligent humorous punches in between . The other cast also play their part perfectly. Some scenes may make you feel that the lead actors are overacting but I guess such acting was the style back then especially for light-hearted movies.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a man will do for sex.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie. This movie shows what a nobody, just another anonymous worker in a huge corporation, has to do to get ahead and shows that belief in hard work as the path to success is just a bunch of baloney. It's who you know and how well you pedal favors that get you promoted. If you behave like a doormat, then someday you may get your own office - as long as you continue sucking up to those who dole out the goodies. This movie also shows how hypocritical people can be and how the people who seem most innocent are the ones who are actually the most perverted and corrupted. For instance, in this movie, the elevator operator girl seems so nice and wholesome, yet she is in fact the biggest and most conniving whore in the company. And what about all the executives? How did they get their jobs? What kind of favors did they have to do to get in good with the boss? And how did the boss get HIS job? Who did he blackmail or suck up to to get the big office with the sexy secretary and the big salary? For the message of this movie is clear - it's not talent or hard work or even luck that gets you ahead, it's how much of a pushover you're willing to become to get an extra crumb from those in power. And this movie also shows what happens when you tire of playing the game. Simply, you're ruined. When Jack Lemmon's character "C.C." decides that he doesn't want to play along anymore, he loses his job, has to move, and gets the elevator operator, who by now has been banged so often by the boss and by probably every other Tom, Dick and Harry in the company that only a fool like C.C. would actually want to have anything seriously to do with her. This is a weak ending to an otherwise interesting story. Then again, maybe not - maybe this is the way the movie should end, with a putz like C.C. making a fool of himself again. Gee ... what a guy willing to put up with to get some "you-know-what."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I would have expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being that "The Apartment" won the "Best Picture" Oscar (in a year where "Spartacus" wasn't even nominated), I was really expecting something exceptional. I bought the DVD on Amazon after watching a documentary on Billy Wilder. I wanted to see Wilder's work and figured I'd start out with one of his Oscar winners.Honestly, after spending over two hours watching the movie... I was left relatively unsatisfied. The only aspect of the film that really kept me going was Jack Lemmon. In my eyes, Lemmon is one of the greatest actors Hollywood has ever seen.It's a decent film, and perhaps I was expecting too much- but it certainly doesn't seem to warrant the accolades attributed to it. I believe that in the year "The Apartment" was made (1959-60) it broke certain cinematic mores with it's relatively open perspective on sexuality. I get the sense this novelty had something to do with it's appeal at the time. In today's world (except for Jack Lemmon's great performance), IMHO this movie comes off more like a mediocre made for TV movie.</fullReview>

However, every once and a while, it seems like the movie should be over, and it's not. That is a problem. It bored me at some points. About an office man who falls in love with the elevator girl, is giving up his apartment for a promotion, and with a suicide attempt involved, this is a fun film. Jack Lemmon and Shirley McClaine are a perfect match in a movie. Jack Lemmon is a hilarious lover, and Shirley is the loved one.

		<fullReview>... as for films by Wilder, I like e.g. Some Like It Hot much more. Lemmon and McLaine are brilliant, of course, but there is not so much comedy within, you feel often sadness and compassion. Black-and-white background does not provide something extra, on the contrary - and it is still 1960 when several color films had already been made.Generally the idea of the script is nice, providing an opportunity to create a lot of crazy confusions and puttering around. Wilder has grabbed this opportunity in full, being undoubtedly a great director and producer. But somehow I feel that The Apartment would not have received so many Academy Awards decades later, it has become timeworn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old movie with modern themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Billy Wilder makes an interesting statement about the ethics of dating, corporate corruption and the psychology of suicide in this 1960 film. It struck me as being a bit ahead of its time. No wonder it won an Oscar for best picture.Shirley MacLain plays Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in an enormous, Manhattan insurance company. She's romantically involved with the company's married CEO, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurry).Kubelik eventually realizes her big shot boyfriend is misleading her just so he can get some sex on the side. She becomes depressed and attempts suicide alone by overdosing on sleeping pills in the apartment where they've been meeting secretly. A doctor in the neighboring apartment saves her life by pumping her stomach and by reviving her with smelling salts, black coffee, slaps to the face and forced walking.The apartment, it turns out, belongs to one of the company's entry-level accountants, C.C. Bud Baxter (Jack Lemon) who has been loaning it out to the company's executives for their extramarital trysts in exchange for quick advancement up the corporate ladder. Also, Baxter has a serious crush on Kubelik, adding further interesting twists to the plot.Despite the apparent serious nature of these themes Wilder manages to keeps the tone light - even comical at times.I enjoyed this movie. My only real complaint about it is that the DVD cover displays a color pic of the two stars suggesting that the movie is in color when in reality it's in black and white.I don't feel comfortable giving away any more. Rent this movie on a rainy day if you don't mind black and white films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Apartment' like many B&amp;W movies of the 1950s and 1960s is cute, with cute actors, but somewhat overrated by today's standards. And, while there are a few humorous points to it, doesn't really come across as a comedy. Set in NY, it is about a meek insurance employee (Lemmon as Bud Baxter) who allows older, more powerful married men use his apartment after work for their affairs with young, single women from their workplace. Not really ambitious, Bud ends up working late most evenings because he has no apartment to go home to, until 8 or 9PM, when the men leave with their girls. As a result of both effects, he gets recommended for a promotion.About 17 minutes into the movie Bud and the elevator girl (MacLaine as Fran) talk about colds (Fran says, 'I feel bad then. Since I never get colds, someone has to have 5 a year to make the 2 1/2 average.') and we, the audience, know that they are destined to get together, we just don't know how and when. Things get complicated when Bud finds out that Fran has been having an affair with the married big boss (MacMurray as Jeff) and now Jeff wants to use Bud's apartment also, in return he will get a big promotion to become Jeff's assistant in a fancy office next door and on the 27th floor!!Some SPOILERS follow, you may not want to read further. Fran isn't really attracted to Bud at first, and she visits his apartment with Jeff right before Christmas, and what Jeff tells her about not being able to leave his wife upsets her, she finds sleeping pills, overdoses, Bud comes home to find her in his bed, has to get the neighbor doctor, who brings her back to consciousness, Fran realizes where she is, Bud takes good care of her, he uses a tennis racket to drain spaghetti, she begins to realize that a nice, honest man may be better for her. Jeff wants to try again a week later, Bud will not give him the key, Jeff threatens to fire him, Bud quits, Fran and Jeff are sitting in a nightclub just before midnight New Years Eve, he tells her they have to go to Atlantic City for a hotel because Bud wouldn't let him have the key, she realizes what a nice guy Bud is, she leaves the table and runs to Bud's apartment, where he is packing to move, he pours an extra glass of champagne, they embrace, the closing credits roll.The DVD has a very nice B&amp;W print, probably better than the original theater print. Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray are all good in their roles. I especially like watching the young McLaine, she had such a natural innocence about her, she comes across very believably. Good movie, but does not stand up to the good romantic comedy/dramas of recent years.</fullReview>

Flawed underdog gets the girl we know he's going to get...I think that's part of this genre, us knowing the two belong together before they do, and feeling some sense of completion, if not order in the universe, when they do hook up.Um as for "order in the universe," this film is older than me for what it's worth, so as part of the younger degeneration I feel I must reply to the few moralizing reviews here...pull-llease! Sure "The Apartment" houses a hint of ethics, and Lemmon eventually develops his backbone along with his backhand Bolognese. But this is a comedy first and foremost, albeit one with plenty of extramarital sex, a suicide attempt, a lovable doctor ignoring his code of conduct...Ah the good ol' days...before I tell my grandkids how their films are shlock while defending "Grosse Point Blank" please tattoo this review on my withering flesh and sense of perspective. The same goes if I champion the artistic superiority of 2D films.Okay, off my high-horse and back to corralling the lowdown: here the dialog is quick and clever...key phrases are brought back, but not in a heavy-handed SNL-skit style. Lemmon's sweet, but Shirley Maclaine is sweeter. Who knew that in a previous life she actually was a sparkly-eyed cutie-pie...her power to make me use such a dorky phrase, and her power over the former yes-man C.C. (Si Si?) Baxter is what drives this film.Yep the film's almost as sexist as the world today, if that troubles you...then you and *only* you are allowed to film the remake from a woman's point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Apartment is a Serious Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Apartment" is an overrated movie. It is not funny and it did not deserve an Academy Award for best picture. If you take out the silly dialogue and most of the movie score, you get a light drama with some humor. The main story should have been between the elevator girl, (Shirley MacLaine) and the glamorous high-powered married boss (Fred MacMurray). Mr. MacMurray is one of the best heels in cinema. The secondary part should have been the clerk who schemes to get ahead at work (Jack Lemmon). The director (Billy Wilder) should have told his perfect cast to play it straight as a drama not as a comedy. It is interesting to watch the scenes between Ms. MacLaine and Mr. MacMurray. However, the movie does look great in black and white.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't recommend this as an important movie -- it did not appear to be conceived as a movie, merely as characters bumping into each other on the stage of life. Yes, Lemmon and MacLaine are a delightful presence, but there's nothing deeper here.The missed opportunities for greatness are manifest. Williams' "Jealous Lover" brackets the movie, but fails to importantly figure in the dramatic happenings. MacMurray is basically given the role of Ward Cleaver's evil twin, but he plays it completely ramrod straight. We're put to sleep by halfway through.But the images you might want to note are the opening exterior shot of the Consolidated Life building, and the perspective used in the scenes involving the 19th floor: desks and overhead lights receding to an infinite vanishing point. And story-wise some of this definitely rubbed off on such modern examples as "Swimming with Sharks", "American Beauty" and "Office Space".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not Stand up to Scrutiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the idea. I liked the story. The acting of the three central characters - Lemmon, MacLaine, MacMurray - was excellent.However, the whole plot hangs together badly. First of all, we have a key to an apartment going around the office, but if someone has vacated the apartment, they have to leave the key under the mat. Jack Lemmon has a key to the front door of the building, but not to the apartment. Strange. Couldn't he have had another key to the apartment duplicated? And if he is stuck out on a winter's night and has a key to the front door, why can't he lurk around the building until the apartment is vacant? Why does he have to spend the evening on a park bench? And if MacMurray is so well loaded, why doesn't he rent his own apartment? Lemmon's head cold also developed pretty quickly. Pity these holes in the plot ruined the film.I didn't know this film was a comedy. It didn't make me laugh. None of it did. When I was told that it was supposed to be a comedy, I couldn't believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I have just had quite an argument with a well known film critic. He maintains that films are either good or bad and any good film is just simply good. I maintained that films are little worlds. Some are created more successfully than others. Some are more novel or clever or valuable than others. Navigating your way through film is part of building a life worth living.This film is a good example of what I mean. It is pleasant enough. It is well enough brought into being. But it is damaged goods.The situation is supposed to sharply display a late fifties environment of a man trapped in a mechanical organization, having to cater to the norms of that organization with wit and grace. The situation centers on sex. Now, after a few decades, it becomes clear that Wilder himself was in the same situation. Early, he could make intelligent, edgy films. "Sunset" is a masterpiece. But by this time, he was a chef in someone else's kitchen, turning out perfect pastries. Lemmon and MacLaine do cute as well as anyone from that period.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charm overshadowed by meanness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is some charm to be found in this movie, but it's overshadowed by the unctuous meanness of the philandering executives, the spazziness of Lemmon's C.C. Baxter, and the frustration of watching the latter be walked all over by the former. I've never been a fan of the humor of avoidable embarrassment, and this movie is full of it. Many of the scenes of Baxter's interactions with other characters are unwatchably painful. Or painfully unwatchable. Maybe both. And many of the jokes just haven't aged well -- maybe at one time the appending of "-wise" to all sorts of words was a funny comment on how businessmen butchered the language, but today it's stale and repetitive.Shirley MacLaine is great. Her presence, combined with Lemmon's performance in the few scenes where he's allowed to stop spazzing, is the only thing that makes this movie minimally worthwhile. Overall, balancing the bad against the good, this is movie is just plain unpleasant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overcooked plot, underdone characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one of those people who demands that all movies adhere to some sort of realism, especially comedies, or that all characters behave as people do in the real world. But I do expect a movie to give me at least one character who isn't a complete jerk, or a complete moron, or both. Alas, "The Apartment" offers plenty of morons, many of whom are also jerks.Baxter, played by Jack Lemmon, may be the biggest moron in the film. He is a bit of a jerk as well, in that his motives consist primarily of career advancement. His doctor neighbor tells him as much (even if his impression of Baxter is distorted, which Baxter does nothing to correct). Baxter's superiors at the company are likewise flawed; they are using him to gain access to his apartment, as if there aren't other arrangements they could make in the entire borough of Manhattan.Of course the humble elevator girl, Fran, is the smartest of the bunch. But she isn't the brightest bulb on the circuit either. The weakest section of the film concerns her suicide attempt, enabled by a bottle of Seconal which is inexplicably left lying around the bathroom. Suddenly a light romantic comedy is thrust into noirish bathos, from which it never really emerges until the final scene.I've never been a fan of Lemmon's, and this film is a great example why. His acting style is so broad, so cloying, that it's impossible to take him seriously later on when he finally stands up to his boss over rights to the apartment. Shirley MacLaine, on the other hand, is outstanding. Just 25 when shooting started, she is acting rings around the rest of the cast. Too bad the Beattys didn't have more children -- acting clearly runs in the family."The Apartment" tries to be two movies -- rom com and noir -- and in the end succeeds at neither. Billy Wilder, a very fine director, would've done better sticking to one genre and developing the characters (maybe dumping a few extraneous ones in the process).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A naive 60s drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ridiculously overrated film. I liked it when I saw it as a kid. But now, many years later - and (hopefully) with a few more functioning brain cells than before - I find the film to be very disappointing. The main characters are absurd and their motivations make little sense. The supporting cast plays characters right out of a comic-book. All this superficiality and absurdity wouldn't matter at all if only this were a proper comedy. Unfortunately, it isn't one. In fact, it isn't even a half-comedy (the consensus seems to be that it is a comedy drama). This is a romantic drama; the laughs are as scarce and dispersed as bushes in a North African desert. The film plays up the near-perfection and integrity of its two main leads, but it simply doesn't wash in MacLaine's case. If she is such an angel why is she a home-wrecker who goes out with a married man with kids? And does it have to be one of the company's top executives as well? Women with this kind of behaviour are never (not rarely - never) seeking "love". I don't see how Wilder expected the adult audience to swallow this. (But apparently they did, the cretins.) Her suicide attempt is too far-fetched and overly dramatic. And what's with Lemmon's character? This guy is so self-sacrificing and noble that Wilder should have had him nailed to the cross in the last scene. The basic plot outline of the film is good and there was real potential there for a terrific situation comedy, but Wilder took the easy route and turned this into a schmaltzy romance film with the Hollywood violins accompanying every schmaltzy scene. The charisma of the two leads simply isn't enough to drag this movie out of the mud. The jokes and gags that there are, are mostly primitive - outdated at best; for example, the scene with the racket and something (unfunny) Lemmon says about the backhand. Why is this pap in IMDb's top 250 movies? Are people really that nostalgic about old movies and their schmaltz? If you'd like to read my "biographies" of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood people, contact me by e-mail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched "The Apartment," and I was so disappointed by it. What a pedigree it had: Billy Wilder, Jack Lemmon, Shirley Maclaine, Fred MacMurray, and a build-up as one of the all-time great romantic comedies. Indeed, it did have the romantic comedy structure, it did have fine cinematography, it did showcase sometimes adorable chemistry between Jack Lemmon and Shirley Maclaine, and it did have a few clever moments. Still, I found the movie unforgivably offensive in certain parts.Remember the trick employed for laughs in almost every "Three's Company" episode, where miscommunication or lack of understanding lead to trouble for the characters but laughs for the better-informed viewers? Imagine if, instead of Mr. Furley making a bad assumption about what Jack Tripper was doing in the kitchen, the situation involved Janet being unaware that Chrissy had just attempted suicide and would soon die if Janet doesn't catch a clue. Would you laugh? Would you resent the writers and director trying to play that for laughs? I found the answer to that question in "The Apartment": yes, I resented it, and was offended by it.I was also put off by the fact that every character in the movie was either despicable or at least very difficult to like. The protagonist is an insurance company drone who desires to climb the corporate ladder. He lets the executives who could help him in that quest use his apartment for their adulterous affairs, and in return, they recommend him for promotion. The female lead is involved in one of those affairs (her great line: "Women in love with married men shouldn't wear mascara."), and she is willing to forgive that louse even when she discovers she's but one in a series of his conquests. Those two, the protagonist and female lead, are the characters we're supposed to root for. The other characters are mainly wicked, and we're doubtful they will ever actually get what they have coming to them.This film is the work of exceptionally talented people. It's a shame the story was so repulsive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Billy Wilder's amazingly successful run of genre-hopping movies is peppered with things I like, and other crowd-pleasing movies that I really don't. Often, within a single Wilder movie I find pleasure and annoyance (Stalag 17, Breakfast at Tiffany's). And I've never made it through any attempt to watch "Some like it Hot." I find "The Apartment" similarly annoying. This may be the only comedy from the 60s that attempts to wring laughs from an attempted suicide. But if it's a comedy it's not black enough. The suicide is treated like a perfectly typical subplot and a terrific way to poach a girlfriend. After the first ten minutes, every development gets a lazier and lazier set-up, making the characters seem like real idiots. I just didn't buy a minute of it.MacMurray is a complete unrelenting heel in this. There isn't a single frame where he isn't completely unlikeable. And some dingbat "nice girl" feels unrequited love for him? Why is someone like Fran pursuing this giant a-hole? Why should I care about a woman this stupid? This movie made me pine for the 'noir' era, where viewers were never asked to identify with characters this sappy.When Fran's brother-in-law finally comes to retrieve her under the misunderstanding that Lemmon has been having his way with her, no one even bothers to set him straight. The script foists a neighbor into the moment so there's a pretext for Lemmon not explaining, but nothing prevents stupid MacClaine from doing so (and she lets Lemmon get decked). In this era C.C. and Fran would both know their reputations were at stake and they'd need to address the brother's concerns immediately. The film fumbles just a couple times, but it's in all the major places, making the characters look like idiots. The Lemmon/MacClaine love story is so poorly set up that it's barely perceptible. The whole thing is off for me. This is really unfunny stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't really care for this one. A guy letting all these big shots have his apartment while he stands outside and smokes Chesterfields just grated on my nerves instead of amusing me. This was just another in a long line of droll romantic comedies which gave neither romance nor humor.</fullReview>
