		<shortDescription>Ratchet &amp; Clank is indeed an excellent movie for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a 2016 American-Canadian 3D computer-animated science fiction action comedy film based on the first game of the platforming video game series of the same name. The film stars the voices of Paul Giamatti, John Goodman, Bella Thorne, Rosario Dawson, James Arnold Taylor, David Kaye and Sylvester Stallone.Series creators Insomniac Games helped with the film's production, screenplay, character development, and animation. The film was directed by Jericca Cleland and Kevin Munroe, featuring an original story written by Munroe and former Insomniac Games Senior Writer T.J. Fixman, who started writing for the series with the Future saga. Several cast members from the games reprised their respective voice roles, and assets from the video games were utilized in the film.The film is an origin story that retells the events of the original Ratchet &amp; Clank, depicting how Ratchet and Clank met each other as they attempt to save the Solana Galaxy from being destroyed by Chairman Drek and the Blarg. However, the film expands on various plot points in greater detail, and incorporates some elements from later series entries, such as the introduction of Doctor Nefarious and the Galactic Rangers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, ignore the critics, trust yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand on why critics are responding so negatively to the movie. In my opinion, it was a really great movie. It was my childhood game, I loved the game, I loved the movie. Great humour, great characters. I think the critics just need to cool off a bit and take it a little lighter. I don't know what they have against video game movies but the critic to it is way too much. Ratchet and clank movie was made for the fans! Those who already know and love these characters and this style of humour will find a lot to love about the movie, but the uninitiated will likely write it off as just another animated movie. It's a shame, because of the fans who get it. Critics who have no idea about the game should keep their opinions to themselves. Who are they to judge if they don't know anything? Fans know better than you so shut the **** up. Ignore the critics! If the game was your childhood, it's gonna be a memorable movie, taking you back to the past to relive those great memories. Go watch it, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ratchet and Clank fans will love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many years, we've had nothing but awful video game films ( excluding the first Mortal Kombat ). But it has finally happened! We have a Video game based movie that's actually faithful to the games! This film was lots of fun, I wouldn't say it's perfect ( since some of the jokes fell flat ) it's by far the best video game movie out there. The animation was beautiful, the cast did a wonderful job, the writing was pretty good, and action scenes were great. I'm glad they got the original cast to play their characters for the film ( except for Drek ) they all did a great job in this film as they did in the games. There's also a great scene at the end that I won't spoil, but I'll just say this, it will make fans excited. If you love the Ratchet and Clank games then you're sure to get a kick out of this movie. Let's hope we get more video game movies like this one, cause it would be great to have animated films based on Mario, Pikmin, Jak and Daxter, and Team Fortress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ratchet &amp; Clank Superbly Adapts a Great Franchise to a New Medium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a really superb adaptation of the games, and a good movie to boot. It has a solid, albeit less than original message: You don't have to be big or impressive to be good, you just have to do what's right and have heart. This is, as Ratchet says, actually pretty good. It encourages humility and just being a decent person, and the movie highlighted giving more intellectual, less physical people respect and praise. It has characters that feel very genuine. Ratchet is a geek, through and through, and they embrace that without making it cringey. The movie has vibrant action with plenty of the awesome, zany weapons the series is known for. It has clever, self-aware humor that appeals both to long-time fans via inside jokes and easter eggs as well as movie-goers in general via quality wit and homages. This was a properly quality movie, and as both a fan of Ratchet &amp; Clank and a fan of animated films, I was very pleased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, fun and entertaining video game adaptation, don't listen to the unfairly harsh critics and watch for yourself !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*TLDR summary* This is a solid, fun and entertaining Video Game adaptation, do yourself a favour, don't listen to the totally overly harsh and unfair critics and go see it for yourself, you won't be disappointed ! As the audience score proves._________________________________ Well I have just come out from the film. In general, it was AWESOME, but I CAN see why it may have got some bad reviews. (No spoilers below) I do think some things could have been better, I personally felt the start was a bit rushed (but then again what do you expect trying to fit a 15 hour game into a 90 minute movie !), and if I hadn't played the games first or knew the series like I do then I may have got a little lost. I felt the chemistry between Ratchet and Clank was a pretty low-key until towards the end, but again technically they had only just met so you couldn't expect them to have the bond they have got by the later games in the series.For fans the film is a total dream full of references and little Easter eggs. The first end credit scene made the film for me personally, so make sure you stay a while once the movie's over ! Sadly I didn't see as many planets as I'd hoped for which I was sad about, and the weapons didn't make much of an appearance until toward the end either.I personally felt the second half was superior to the first, but I'm not sure if that was because unfortunately by watching all the previously released clips beforehand, I had kinda ruined it for myself and seen all the main parts, which is my fault entirely.Anyway final verdict, it was great and guaranteed that if you're a fan (OR a newcomer) then you will love it, I thoroughly enjoyed it, had plenty of laughs and would definitely see it again. The humour was good, the references were great and the characters were awesome as per usual, as was the stellar voice acting by the series usual stars. We saw much more out of Cora and Elaris than in the newest game too and they're really decent characters. However there IS room for improvement and I can see how some people may not enjoy it as much as others.I feel critics have been completely unfair and overly harsh on this film, in terms of video game adaptations it's fantastic. They talk about it as if they were expecting something from Pixar, bearing in min Rainmaker had about a quarter of the budget for this movie than studios such as Pixar and Dreamworks have, They did a bloody great job and still produced a fantastic fun, colourful film and that's saying something. Do yourself a massive favour and go see for yourself and don't listen to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a baby, my dad woke me up at 11:00 P.M. playing the original 2002 Ratchet &amp; Clank. You might expect me to totally bawl, but instead, I sat there in awe. Every night, I would stay up late to watch him play the game. Then came Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal, but he quit after Deadlocked. Then, in 2008, I started to play the games. I asked for a PSP and PS3 for Christmas (So I could play the Future games, Size Matters, and Secret Agent Clank), and I got my wish. I collected Ratchet &amp; Clank games so I could play them (Including PS Move Heroes and the Collection(PS3 and PS Vita)). I sobbed when I learned that the series ended. But I grew happy when the movie was announced, and even more when the PS4 version was announced. I bought the PS4 version, and while I haven't beat it yet, it's awesome! So today, I decided to see the movie with dad. It's just what Captain Quark says about the movie in the PS4 game (play it to learn). Positives: Almost everything: Awesome story, awesome casting, awesome animation, awesome music, etc.Negatives: 1 jump scare that's too surprising, that's it.Overall, if you like PlayStation, CGI, and of course, Ratchet &amp; Clank, you'll love this movie.Note: Cover your ears during the jump scare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on the popular Play Station video game, it's adventurous, funny, heartwarming and witty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the animated movie Ratchet &amp; Clank which is based on the popular Play Station video game. From the beginning to the end, the film kept me on the edge of my seat, as it is an adventurous, funny, heartwarming and witty story. One of the funniest scenes is when Dr. Nefarious shoots Chairman Drek with a laser gun and turns him into a sheep.The story follows the main character, Ratchet who wants to be a member of the famously respected Galactic Rangers team but unfortunately, is told he doesn't have the right "stuff." According to Captian Qwark, Ratchet may have heart but physically just doesn't measure up as he is too small. However, Ratchet meets and names a robot Clank who is similarly small and both human and robot not only become the best of friends but a powerful duo. Together they make it their mission to try to save the Solana Galaxy from the evil Chairman Drek. My favorite part of the story is when we learn the robot doesn't measure up to his own kind. In fact, he is considered a "defect" to be terminated because he's small, thinks for himself and doesn't want to hurt humans but wants to help them. I particularly enjoyed all the various voices talent for the animated characters. My favorite is that of Ratchet's and I was fortunate enough to personally meet and interview both James Arnold Taylor and Bella Thorne (the voices of Ratchet and Cora) immediately following the movie screening. I loved seeing how their actual facial characteristics and physical mannerisms are incorporated into their animated on-screen film characters. There's not just one moral to this movie but three stand out in my mind. First, is to always believe in yourself and never give up. Second, as told to Ratchet, "To be a hero you don't have to do big things just right things." Third, if the right thing requires you to do the wrong thing then probably the right thing is the wrong thing to do. I love these golden nuggets that make the characters seem very real as cleverly penned by the director, Kevin Munroe.All ages will like Ratchet &amp;Clank and it's particularly well suited for ages 5 to 12. There's no bad language that make it appropriate for young audiences. The sophisticated storyline, fun adventure, basic struggle of good vs. evil and plenty of twists and turns will appeal to more mature audience, as well. It's also a story about two underdogs who together try to rise to the challenge. Do they succeed? Well, you'll have to see the movie to find out!Finally and on a personal note, I just love the relationship between Ratchet and Clank - two orphans in the universe finding each other and creating a lasting bond. Together the dynamic human and robot duo try to do the right thing in the right way. Reviewed by Abigail Zoe L., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film for the Whole Family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ratchet and Clank was a fantastic and adventurous film which is must see if you are a long time Ratchet and Clank fan. Now the movie may not be for everyone, the movie is aimed for fans and children. The Animation, Voice Acting, and Story will keep you glued to the screen. A few things however such as the pacing of the story are too fast and a little repetitive, but nothing to make you feel to mad about the movie. If you're seeing the critic reviews, don't be influenced by them and be influenced by the reviews of actual fans. Now remember, before expecting the type of humor featured in the old games, it's a kids movie. This movie can be adored by any family, it's charming, action packed, and just beautiful. The new elements added such as Nefarious and more, it's just a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Ratchet and Clank Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I was sceptical about watching this film as I read the critic reviews from other sites but decided to go to watch it. After watching this film I'm so glad I did. This film is truly a film for the fans but is also a great film for everyone. Even if you have never played the video games, this film will still be easy to watch. Don't listen to the stupid critic reviewers who don't know how to have fun as this film is certainly fun. Even though there were many jokes, the only main bad side to this film was that it was lacking the innuendos which made it so famous in its original trilogy. Apart from that though, well written film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody Including me has spoken. It's the Best Video Game Movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back at Sony's E3 Conference in 2014 (I think) Insomniac Games released a trailer for a Ratchet and Clank Movie. I had never played the games so I did not know whether to be excited or untrustworthy of it. I like some video game movies. The First Tomb Raider and The First Resident Evil I thought were good films, Hit-man Agent 47 is a guilty pleasure. But things like Resident Evil Afterlife and other films can lead to annoyance. I was actually excited to see the movie after it came out. So Today I went with my sister to see the movie as my introduction to the universe. This is easily the best video game movie ever made and audiences (the fans and children) have spoken. Is it the best in animation or story? No. But it's easily more attractable than the new Angry Birds movie coming in a few weeks. The story follows our titular characters as they and the Galactic Rangers are on a mission to stop Chairman Drek from destroying planets to make a new one. It's basically a save the world plot.The characters have colorful personality to them. Captain Qwark is easily the best character in the entire movie because of how stupid funny he is. Ratchet and Clank are great heroes and I'm glad they got the original voice cast for them because it would feel way to unnatural to have someone else do the voices for them.The comedy is even clever. A Wilhelm Scream joke appears in the movie that took me a second to get, Captain Qwark being useless is funny, the texting jokes, Ratchet and Clank has a lot of things that are funny in it and the movie even has Easter Eggs from Jak and Dexter and Sly Cooper. The animation looks a little more expensive then it does. With 20 million dollars put into this movie, the film stumbles upon the fact that it could have done more if the movie was more well advertised. Making 5.5 million worldwide on this Sunday, I can't help but feel that there is a lack of an audience for this film. The kids may want to see it but the fans of the games will really want to see it. But will there be anyone else who would want to see a movie based on a early 2000's video game? Ratchet and Clank is probably what many people will consider to be the first good video game movie. An audience lacks for it, but I feel there will be enough appeal for a home video and digital market. If you have the time, support the film and give it a chance. It's not as bad as most people will think it is.79/100 B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For what it is - it's AWESOME!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with this - I never played any Ratchet &amp; Clank games, however I played the Sly Cooper games and I have an idea of what Ratchet &amp; Clank games are all about. Point is I went to see the movie completely without any expectations, except the trailer gave me the idea it is gonna be a sci-fi adventure cartoon. So I came out of the cinema, just few hours ago.Indeed, it is a sci-fi adventure cartoon and for what it is, it is truly awesome!! Graphics are great, music is great, sound is great, the plot for what it was intended to be is great! Now, speaking of the plot, this is not a serious sci-fi cartoon. This is intended to be a funny movie, to make you relax and just have some fun, that's why I am still saying "for what it is". I have no idea of the game plot, so I am judging the movie only here. And honestly I really had some fun watching it.Also, despite the warnings of cartoon violence and so on, I personally find it absolutely kids-friendly - no real scary moments, no sudden scary sounds, no real scary characters, in fact I intend to grab the blu-ray disk when it comes out and show it to my 3-year- old son, but if you doubt my judgement - go and give the movie a try, before bringing your kids there. Fun is guaranteed anyway.I am not going to reveal much of the movie, except to mention that they intend to release a sequel, because there are two animation sequences in the end of the movie and the first one is clearly talking of a sequel.The other thing to mention is they make reference to Sly Cooper, which movie is intended to be released a bit later this year and which I am awaiting so much, because there is one scene in the movie where they show picture of Sly Cooper (they show more pictures too, but I just did not paid attention to the others).So to finish - for what it is, it's awesome! For me, as a parent, it's totally kids-friendly. It is also family-geared, because the duration is set to 1h 34mins if I remember correctly, which is the usual family format. It is fun and it is really making you relax and enjoy your time, so just give it a try.As I said, I've never played any of the Ratchet &amp; Clank games, but now think I am definitely going to give them a try.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ratchet &amp; Clank" is a better-than-average video game turned-film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trend of turning computer-based video games into movies (and vice versa) started in the 1980s and became a popular trend in the 90s, but Sony Entertainment figured out a new dynamic for the 2016 release of the computer-animated sci-fi action-adventure "Ratchet &amp; Clank" (PG, 1:34). Pong, the first commercially successful video game, came out in 1972 and became the inspiration for "Tron", the 1982 film in which a human being gets trapped inside a game (although one much more complex than Pong). The Tron movie spawned several video games, other entertainment products and a 2010 sequel. In the meantime, video games which became feature films (some live-action, some animated and some a combination of both) included "Super Mario Brothers" (1993), the "Mortal Combat" movies ('95 and '97), the "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" films (2001 and 2003), the "Resident Evil" series (2002-2017) and "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time" (2010). More recent examples include the nostalgia-fueled films "Wreck-It Ralph" (2012) and "Pixels" (2015), not to mention 2016's animated fantasy epic "Warcraft".With a "Lara Croft" reboot planned (starring Alicia Vikander), the cross-pollination between game consoles and movie theaters doesn't look to end any time soon, especially when you consider the new "Ratchet &amp; Clank" template. Croft's video game franchise got a reboot in 2013, followed by the reboot of her film franchise, both of which serve as prequels to the earlier versions of the game and the Angelina Jolie movies. Likewise, 2016's "Ratchet &amp; Clank" film is an origin story for the characters (whose first video game appeared in 2002), but this film was actually developed in conjunction with the video game reboot, which is based partially on the film, which had its original 2015 release date delayed, leading to a matching (coordinated) postponement in the release of the new game. Of course, all that is just background to a movie which, as a feature film, needs to stand on its own and entertain audiences whether they're gamers or think that "Ratchet &amp; Clank" is just a bad name for an auto repair shop.Ratchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is a Lombax, a cat-like creature with especially large ears and thick eyebrows. He's an earnest mechanic who works for Grimroth Razz (John Goodman) repairing and maintaining spaceships. Ratchet's a relatively small creature, but he has big dreams. He wants to join his heroes, the Galactic Rangers, fellow anthropomorphic animals who travel around the Solona Galaxy battling evildoers (kind of like an animated "Guardians of the Galaxy"). The Rangers' leader is Captain Qwark (Jim Ward) a large attention-seeking humanoid with a larger-than-life personality (think Buzz Lightyear on steroids) and ego to match. Ratchet is crushed when he responds to a Galaxy Rangers open try-out, only for his hero to tell him face-to-face that he doesn't have what it takes to be one of them.Ratchet gets the opportunity to prove himself when he meets up with an undersized but sentient factory-rejected robot whom he calls Clank (David Kaye). Clank carries information about the evil Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the Blarg, and his involvement in the recent destruction of several uninhabited planets. Working together, Ratchet and Clank are able to throw Drek's plans off track and prove themselves worthy of joining the Galactic Rangers. The adorable title characters work with Qwark, Cora (Bella Thorne), Brax (Vincent Tong), Elaris (Rosario Dawson) and others to keep Drek from meeting his increasingly dangerous goals. Meanwhile, Drek works with his robot henchman, Victor Von Ion (Sylvester Stallone), and his head scientist, Doctor Nefarious (Armin Shimerman) to infiltrate the Galactic Rangers and move forward with his plans, but Drek's not this story's only villain with a plan."Ratchet &amp; Clank" is an entertaining and smart blending of various elements and characters from the video game series with a new origin story. Screenwriters T.J. Fixman, Gerry Swallow and Kevin Munroe (who also directs, along with Jericca Cleland) give us plenty of action and some good life lessons which parents will appreciate and will (hopefully) inspire kids, but the script is a short on laughs (including mature humor that pops up in the games). The voice work of the stars in the cast is predictably reliable, but can't outshine the relative unknowns (some of whom voiced the video game characters), proving that it's not necessary to stock every animated movie with big-name voice talent to create an entertaining product. This film's biggest strength is its creative and state-of-the-art animation. Even without viewing the film in 3D, we see remarkable detail and depth in its characters and backgrounds, giving the audience the impression that they already know what the objects and textures would feel like. This is one of those rare video game adaptations that's not only visually stunning, but entertaining AND family friendly. "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as the games!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of critics reviews bashing the movie saying its too kiddy and unfunny. Well let me give my 2 cents- I'm 36 years old and went with two of my friends. We all grew up with R&amp;C and all of us enjoyed the movie very much. We all played the games as kids and the new movie pretty much follows the 1st one. I enjoyed just about everything- the story, jokes, pacing were all done really well. Yes a few of the jokes were tired but overall the writing was spot on and all the voice actors did just a good of a job as the games. I also liked the movie teaches a lesson about betrayal- something that a lot of animated movies nowadays don't really do but instead resort to silly comedy with no real meaning. Overall definitely worth seeing in the theater. I didn't watch it in 3D but i imagine the effect would look stunning since its a CGI movie. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not good, not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ratchet and Clank is based on a PlayStation video game of the same name. According to my kids, some of the characters and weapons appear in the movie. To sum the movie up, it's a 90 minute trailer for the game.The story is fairly tight. It introduces the characters quickly. It was wonderful to see John Goodman (the father from the Rosanne TV show). Most of the characters behave logically, although they are highly stereotyped.Ultimately, the story is fairly superficial. It has a few superb gags (eg. Wilhelm falls off the bridge and screams. This is a reference to the famous Wilhelm Scream). However, other than the occasional witty gag, the story was very average, not bad, just average.Unlike Star Trek, I didn't need to bite my fist to dull the pain with this movie. It was pleasant. The kids were kept entertained. The animation was good.For those that are interested, there are two reasonable female characters. One plays the quiet but intelligent type, the other a gun-toting Clint Eastwood type. Both of the characters added some character to the story. Unfortunately, like all other characters in the movie, none of them contributed to moving the plot forward. That's because nothing moved the plot forward.Best character: Clank (David Kaye). The character's personality was most probably modelled on Big Hero 6's Baymax (Scott Adsit)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Take that, culture!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there were ever a pitch to be greeted by a nearly universal pleasantly bemused "...oh! Why...?", it's Ratchet &amp; Clank: The Movie. Let's be real. The Playstation games by Insomniac are stupendous, gleefully destructive fun, but already cinematic enough between gameplay and cut-scenes. Plus, it's roughly a decade too late for the series' peak cultural relevance anyway. Could it be that Sony is further suckling on the Marvel teat, and endeavouring to start their own interconnected PlayStation movie universe (please no)? We do get nods to Sly Cooper and Jak and Daxter here. And if you remember them since you've been knee-high to a sand-mouse (as I evidently do), you're probably in the fairly limited demographic who will genuinely enjoy Ratchet &amp; Clank above the age of 10. Yes, 10 - no 'Rated T for Teen' here. The big screen debut of everyone's favourite Lombax/diminutive robot tag-team skews much younger than the firearms-heavy games, likely to entice a new generation of audience/gamers. Unfortunately, the film suffers heavily for it. In lieu of the games' creatively and cathartically destructive combat and cheeky humour, we're confronted with a slew of sanitized space laser tag, with only some inventive nostalgia punching it up. Even worse: the screenwriters resort to barfing, aliens texting, or repeated use of the word "really ?" as a punchline. There's the occasional sturdy gag that steps it up ("Wilhelm!!" and hat tips to Conan the Barbarian and Ferris Bueller) that speak to the games' wacky irreverence, but even these are generally chortle-worthy at best. Qwarktastic this ain't. Sure, Ratchet's joys never lay in plot. Still, they've certainly (clumsily) punched up the Star Wars similarities in adapting the first game here, while trimming its sociopolitical critique of corporatism and pollution in Chairman Drek's planetary bricolage (no smarmy PSAs, for one). The pace may be zippy and the animation colourful, but the execution is drearily lazy. Just when the action starts to kindle embers of fun, it's quickly snuffed whenever the film stops to meditate on an overlong double-cross sequence, or 'the true meaning of heroism' (yawn). More irritatingly, while the PS4 calibre animation still looks great on the big screen, the universe itself feels distressingly claustrophobic. For a game series initially applauded for its Pixar level of commitment to surreal, inventive imagery, the action is largely crammed into Ratchet's planet, Veldin (including one canyon jaunt that uncomfortably recalls The Phantom Menace's podracing of all things yikes) and Drek's ship, leaving out the series' flair for world-hopping wonder. So: is there redemption to be had, or just death by Blargian Snagglebeast? Not so fast, cadets. The movie still retains a huge amount of the games' amiable charm, which hits the nostalgia buttons hard for fans (Yoo-hoo, Mr. Zurkon!), and skirts by as just endearing enough for kids and drowsy parents alike. The action sequences are still tons of fun, even finding a credible basis for the games' weapon switching, which allows for cameos from a gaggle of classic gameplay arsenal (highlights include the Sheepinator, and - yes, it had to be said - the Pyrocitor). This, along with Ratchet's swingshot 'web-slinging', keep the combat inventive and exuberant. It all gets a bit unfocused by the end, with the final space battle drifting into a clanging CGI blur, but the proceedings retain enough discerning silliness to keep the vibe pleasant rather than discordant. For a film that clearly invested serious money into saddling a stupendous A-list supporting cast into thankless stock supporting roles (you can just make out John Goodman and Sylvester Stallone grunting in the background as 'mentor' and 'thug' respectively), the primary joy still lies in hearing the original voice cast enthusiastically reprise their defining characters. James Arnold Taylor and David Kaye are still delightfully droll as the titular duo, and their camaraderie, comedic timing and banter are still enough to sell even the most tired gags. Jim Ward's posturing buffoon Captain Quark may flit clumsily from plot point to plot point, but he's still bombastically hilarious enough to remain as lovable a doofus as ever, while Armin Shimerman's Dr. Nefarious infuses the film with the energy that only an exquisitely hammy pantomime villain can. The other star inclusions don't fare as well: Paul Giamatti's preening as Chairman Drek is instantly forgettable, while Rosario Dawson mugs desperately for laughs that just aren't there, teetering between 'Generic Strong Female Background Character 101' and 'high-strung nerd'. The film's insertion of too many instantly forgettable 'Galactic Rangers' side characters also feels imbalanced, and steals too much focus from the infinitely more entertaining leads. "It's about as thrilling as watching someone else play a video game" is normally a movie epitaph. Here, though Ratchet &amp; Clank is lively and charming enough to keep seasoned fans and younger kids entertained, newcomers might start to prefer peeking over the shoulder of a gaming roommate instead. The final irony: the most recent Ratchet &amp; Clank PS4 video game based on the movie based on the video game is apparently fantastic. Play that instead.-6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going to have to play the original games again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie for those who played the game as kids and a decent family film too. I'll have to emulate the first three games (I've a PS2 downstairs and bought each game as it was released though over about 13 or so years the games have either been lost or scratched up. I still miss upgrading the chicken gun in the first game to turn enemies into giant clucking chickens. Always loved the games and the movie doesn't disappoint either, though they naturally had to squeeze hours upon hours of game (I think I completed the first one twice to get the RYNO since it was the most expensive thing in the game, though with it the last boss became a 5 minute ordeal compared to a 20 minute whittle down his health) it's rather depressing that they can't make video-games like this anymore and have to make movies to immortalise them though the movie has everything from the game (even the hover taxis), just squeezed into an hour and a half. I can understand why critics mightn't like it, they may not have played the games; the movie is a great source of nostalgia for me back to a time where children's video- games were enjoyable either by children or adults and had serious replay value, it's sad to realise that game developers will now just make what they think makes money, or make 'casual games', there's very little out of the box thinking) if you're a fan of the game or have kids the movie is great (though somewhat rushed in areas since they tried to stick to the original game's narrative while giving it an almost complete (spoiler alert) ratchet was never in the galactic rangers ever in the video-games, but quark usually popped up here and there IIRC (end spoiler), a great daytime movie and even my cat hopped up on my lap to avidly watch it. It'd get a 9 out of 10 if they'd made a 2 hour movie that wasn't as rushed, but it's not a Disney-Pixar unlimited time and money animation so I'm sure the studio went as far as their budget would allow and even left it open for a sequel while not leaving things on a cliffhanger.Personally I'd like to see the three original games made into movie form, even if it's direct to DVD, old fans of the game; I can remember sharing secrets locations of golden bolts how best to get through levels and such, which, sadly nobody does anymore (hence game developers jumping to procedural generation to make things more interesting, hopefully given five years or so they'll have procedural generation designed so no play-through is the same but the whole whispering of secret areas, things to backtrack to and game-play tips will be a schoolyard thing again, I wouldn't want children of mine growing up in such an artificially sterile world) I would assume because all they need is an internet walk-through or let's play videos on YouTube.All in all, budget considered; it's an excellent adaption of video game to movie. I know I've rambled on about games, though it's a movie adaption of a of mind-blowing game, hopefully there will be more movies to come, it's just a pity that the critics gave the movie such a low score, for what it is it's worth eight stars; easily.I look forward to hooking up my PS3 controller to my PC and playing the sequels to the original (I know the original back to front), hopefully this movie will inspire game designers to turn away from total realism and think outside the box a bit more, the Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank game series' made my childhood, along with games like Abe's odyssey and Exodus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic movie! If you have kids, take them to see it. If you don't, see it anyway.The movie itself is a very nice adaptation--one of the best I've ever seen. If you're a fan of the games you'll probably love the movie. The humor is the same as in the games, the characterization remains true to the games, and the designs are accurate. (You'll also probably appreciate all the weapons that make an appearance).If you aren't a fan of the games, you can still enjoy the movie! It's bright and colorful, with nice animation. Very pretty to look at. The soundtrack is good, and works very well. The voice acting is well done. It's also not too hard to follow along if you don't know the source material, though as with any adaptation you'll obviously get more out of it if you know where it came from.As for the story, it's true that it's a little on the simple side. But it's perfect for what it was meant to be--it was never supposed to be a super deep story that you need to hyper-analyze to truly understand. Sometimes it's nice to have a simple story with fun characters in a colorful world. And that's something this movie delivers wonderfully.Even with the simpler story, it was good. A good message, too. Several, actually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the game series I was very excited about this film. Unfortunately it was really average in my opinion. The film at many points captured the spirit of the game well and there are absolutely some great moments in the movie. As a big fan of the games, just seeing those beloved characters in their own movie is really cool. However, my problem is I feel like it should have been better. There are some funny moments in the movie for sure, but it just isn't as funny as the games are. I think the mistake that was made is that the movie was aimed more at kids, most of whom at this point probably have not played the original game (seeing as it came out almost 15 years ago). For that reason I felt like a lot of the humor was much more tame than it is in the games and so therefore a lot of times the jokes just were not funny in the movie. Also I thought the cool weapons from the games were not really showcased enough, not to mention there was hardly any appearances of the famous wrench that Ratchet uses. However, the main issue is that the movie feels more for kids than it is for the fans which is unfortunate. However, if you are a big fan of the games like I am, I still encourage you to see the movie because there definitely are some enjoyable moments and some funny moments. It is not a bad movie at all, it just should have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is what it is, but an exceptionally good one of what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, within the intrinsic limitations of its scope, "Ratchet and Clank" is a very good movie.Reviewing and rating animated movies, as opposed to the more typical live-action movies, is a bit problematic for two reasons.Firstly, live-action movies have the advantage that they break down into a collection of individual genres and, as somewhat of a general rule, movies are usually evaluated from within the context of their own genre. So "Das Boot", "Operation Petticoat", and "The Hunt for Red October", while they may all be movies about submarines, they're such different movies from different genres that they don't lend themselves to being compared with each other or rated relative to each other. And so they aren't. Imagine if you had to compare and contrast "Alien" and "Schindler's List". You might be able to make a reasonable comparison on some individual aspects of these movies, such as Best Actor or some other technical facet, but I can't imagine how you'd successfully review these movies side-by-side.Animated movies, on the other hand, even at this late date, are all simply lumped together in one giant basket, "animated feature". My best guess is that this is an artefact of the history of animated movies: early on in the evolution of movies, the only kinds of animated movies that were in common circulation were, for example, Disney animated features. By definition therefore, anything animated was a "cartoon" and, as everybody knew, cartoons were exclusively aimed at kids. Obviously all animated features were part of a single genre.As animated features grew and expanded to encompass more sophisticated themes and story lines, the larger worldview of them has not evolved to keep up. The devoted fans of animation see the distinctions, but serious "cinema professionals" still see animation, for all the billions of dollars it rakes in, as the redheaded, freckled little brother of "serious cinema" that isn't taken seriously.Secondly, and as a sort of second wallop of a one-two punch of disadvantages, some of Pixar's movies (the pair of Nemo movies, "Up") have set the bar of audience expectation so impossibly high that other animated movies, artificially forced to compete within a single, "animated feature" global genre, suffer at the hands of reviewers promulgating the single-genre colloquial perspective."Ratchet and Clank" simply doesn't fall into the same category of animated film as, for example, "Up". It's an animated film adaptation of a popular series of video games, and is largely targeted at the same audience as that of the games and perhaps adults nostalgic for those games. It doesn't pretend to explore sophisticated themes of death, loneliness, coping with mental challenges and so on. As such, it should be reviewed and rated relative to its own class and the type of movie it tries to be.As mentioned previously, "Ratchet and Clank" is a very good movie. The nature of its video game origins does naturally limit the characters and plot lines available for the movie to explore. Character definitions were established years ago by the video games. The movie cannot depart significantly from those definitions or the knowledgeable fans of the games will balk and object. At the same time, the movie has to subtly establish the character's personalities within the movie or people unfamiliar with the games will be confused. It's a difficult balancing act when you think about it, and the movie pulls it off pretty well.The animation is a very high quality, facial animation is expressive and very accurately synchronized with the dialogue, and the music is satisfactorily interesting and varied.The characters are somewhat shallow and play close to their stereotypes, which you sort of have to expect from a fan-oriented kid's movie, but the adults that have to accompany the kids to the movie will get more than a few chuckles from the dialogue that is as witty as allowable.In short, the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be and a bit more because it's an exceptionally well done version of what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jesus Christ, is this movie really this underrated? I saw it theaters in 3D a few days ago and I did not get bored, it was such a great movie. I'd call it 2nd best movie of this year (1st is Zootopia with great stuff). But I do not understand, why is it so god damn underrated? It has got likable characters, great story, decent voice acting, it's pretty much what a good movie needs. Lame that people underrate and hate on this movie, it's a great movie with a good message, that you should trust your friends and not enemies. I give this movie a total vote of: 10/10 Would recommend for families to watch this movie, they should like it. But remember, don't underrate the movie without watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A slight deviation from the original story line in the original PS2 game, it still lives up to expectations. Madness and mayhem ensue as Ratchet and Clank attempt to stop Chairman Drek from destroying the planet Veldin, and the themselves. Gone is the hover-board race in Blackwater City, but now you have a heroic rescue of the Galactic Rangers, their washed up leader, Quark, by the title characters.This movie is the type of zany fun that fans of the games series have known for decades, and it is the movie they have been waiting for. Kids will enjoy the lively animation, adults will enjoy the simple but engaging story of the most unlikely heroes in any galaxy. Possibly the best movie of 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks Bolt Bashing and Gizmos but still a good portrayal for the game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, there's a danger I might be slightly biased as I am fan of the game series, especially Ratchet &amp; Clank 3: Up Your Arsenal. The games were great fun, like a cross between MDK and Crash Bandicoot but with awesome and some silly weaponry. Now the question is, does the film reflect the game and actually succeed in being a good film unlike all of the game to film predecessors which I covered in greater detail in a previous blog 'Games On The Screen'. Let's look at what makes a Ratchet &amp; Clank game and see what's missing from the Ratchet &amp; Clank film. Firstly it's based on the first release with a few tweaks and extra characters to beef out the story. It's good to hear the familiar voices from the game instead of replacements of big Hollywood names. Instead the Hollywood names go to the additional roster with Paul Giamatti, John Goodman and Sly Stallone. Ratchet regulars James Arnold Taylor, David Kaye and Jim Ward all return as their respected roles. Massive bolt bonus there!It's give us the back story of the haphazardly heroes and how they meet, Ratchet being the foxy, gremlin looking Lombax mechanic and Clank being the ever-polite, mini defected robot. We join their quest in trying to save the Galaxy with the help of the additional Galactic Rangers. (Brax reminded me of Raphael the ninja turtle.) Drek returns but I suppose for planned sequel purposes Dr. Nefarious has a key role unlike the first game. Ratchet's arsenal and Clank's gadgetry was a massive element of the games, if not the key to the successful gameplay. Now there's a lack of omniwrench bashing and only makes a brief appearance; in fact, there's a lack of use of cool guns, gadgets and overall action. I expect more from an animated action film, especially from this title where the heroes specialise in destruction and bolt collecting. I wanted to see more of the sheepinator (one of my fave guns.)The game's sarcastic humour is there and Cpt. Quark's idiocy provides plenty of comedy. Non- players might find this unnecessary or silly but it's all part of the game. I don't think it's going to get the recognition it deserves like all other game films but It is a great adaption, even though it misses all the bolts and action which might make it boring especially for non-gamers. Kids might find the colourful characters and silly antics fun but I'm assuming the new game will be much more fun to play. The new game mirrors this film in a paradox kinda way, sharing cutscenes from the movie and I'm tempted to buy it. Probably only for fans of the game, which is meant to be but we need more bolt bashing and some awesome action. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 9 Performance: 7 Direction: 6 Story: 7 Script: 7 Creativity: 4 Soundtrack: 4 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for keeping the original voice cast. 61% 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After several planets have mysteriously disappeared, idiot hero boss Captain Qwark puts out a call for new recruits. Mechanic Ratchet fails his audition yet, with the assistance of robot sidekick Clank, he finds himself in the middle of solving the mystery.Based on a series of computer games with which I am not familiar, Ratchet &amp; Clank is a colourful and action-filled CGI feature aimed at kids. The plot ? a real-estate scam ? might not be the most obvious plot for kids, but it works well enough as something to hang the action and visuals on. A good voice cast comprises a mix of A-listers and (I am told) voices from the games, and they perform adequately. The CGI is less slick than one has come to expect from cinema features, although I imagine it is better than the game on which the film is based.There is the occasional bone throne to the adults who accompany kids, but this is mainly pitched at youngsters ? where I would imagine it is perfectly satisfactory ? and fans of the game. I'm afraid it didn't keep me interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was not that bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought. I had mixed feelings about the movie. I was excited and skeptical at the same time since most video game movies are just plain awful, *coughs* Super Mario Bros Movie *coughs*. I was excited after waiting 3 years for this movie to come out. I love the game series so this review may come off as slightly biased. I was literally the only person at the cinema thinking "Oh God. It's bad isn't it?" but it was surprisingly witty. I said before that most video game movie adaptations are awful, but for me at least, this is an exception. For a video game movie it's not that bad. In fact, I thought it was pretty good. Ratchet &amp; Clank were done right. It felt just like the games and the story was true to the original with a few twists in it. I will not say as this review is spoiler free, but if it was exactly the same as the original, than there won't be a point in seeing it.Overall, the movie was surprisingly funny, the characters were true to the source material and they kept the feeling of the game in the movie. If you have kids, or are a fan of the game, go see it. If you are an adult unaware of the source material, don't bother.I give this movie an 8/10. It was formulaic, but nearly every movie is these days regardless of whether they're good or bad, and some scenes felt rushed, but it was really enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a video game, I was interested in watching this film because I remembered playing it as a kid. I didn't really know that there was a story behind the game, but it felt a bit nostalgic to watch. However, I don't remember much of the game, and so thought the story itself to be very average and not that interesting. A typical narrative of boy admires hero, who then doesn't turn out to be what he expects.The characters aren't that well developed either. We only get a bit of background into Ratchet and Dr. Nefarious' characters, but other than them, we know nothing of the others. We know how Clank came to be, but it isn't explained why a malfunctioned robot would act the way he does. As well, Ratchet always seem to be a little unmotivated and the reasoning for this isn't clear.The animation is cute though, and the weird creatures do provide some comedic relief. There are quite a few funny scenes as well, but not enough to keep you fully engaged in the narrative. In addition, action scenes are brief, and could have been longer to create more suspense. On the whole, I think the film speaks more towards the fans of the video game. As I can't remember much of the game, I found this film fun for little kids perhaps, but not for me. It isn't such a bore to watch, but I would not recommend others watch this unless they have small children or are fans of the game.</fullReview>

As soon as I mentioned RATCHET &amp; CLANK the excuses began flying. "I think my dentist can squeeze me in for a couple preventative root canals," one formerly reliable animation fan copped out. "I have to binge-watch the MR. ED marathon they're having," observed another. "We just scored tickets for a Ted Cruz Rally," stated my final prospects. So I entered the Multiplex alone. To my horror, no one else was in the theater as the first preview began for KUBO. TMNT, ANGRY BIRDS, STORKS, and THE WILD LIFE all came and went, and the place was still empty--except for me. As soon as I read, "This is a Sony Playstation Cartoon," I knew I was doomed. As predictable characters mouthed the usual clichs with their pedestrian voices, I felt myself drifting away. A mad scientist seemed to blow up another planet with his Death Star every five minutes or so, but this was no STAR WARS, no matter how much GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY Sony crammed in. I could not stop worrying that an Usherette would be shaking me awake soon--what if I drooled in my sleep?! Fortunately, Sony anticipated that RATCHET &amp; CLANK would place many folks in my exact predicament, so they had a random new cartoon character come onto the screen after all the credits had rolled, yelling "Wakey, Wakey, you can go now!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as video-game adaptations go it's better than most, but while it is not that bad it could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Video games have had a dubious track record when adapted for film, a vast majority of them being mediocre to terrible. This reviewer and her siblings much enjoyed the 'Ratchet &amp; Clank' video games when we were younger, they were funny and diverting with memorable characters, great voice acting and thrilling gameplay.When hearing that there was to be a film based on the 'Ratchet &amp; Clank' games, I wasn't sure what to think. There was the worry as to whether the games would adapt well to film, one couldn't help feeling sceptical due to how badly most video game film adaptations have fared and the trailer looked pretty dreadful. However, being a lifelong fan of animation and having fond memories of the games (plus films like 'Galaxy Quest', 'Lilo and Stitch', 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and 'Tangled', for examples, were very badly marketed, but were very good to great films, so one shouldn't judge a film by its trailer or marketing), it deserved a fair chance.'Ratchet &amp; Clank', as far as video game adaptations go, fares better than most. Despite having too many flaws still to recommend, it is one of the better video game adaptations out there. As an adaptation, it seems to have divided fans, some liked that it was faithful compared to most video game adaptations while others found it bland compared to the games. As a film on its own merits, it is not that bad but the criticisms from the critics are understandable and valid and it could have been better.On a side note, there is some serious growing up to be done by those who liked the film (and actually in general on this site, critic bashing here had rapidly grown worse over the past two years especially). It is fine if you liked the film and it is agreed that there is a good deal to like but please show some respect for those who didn't like it. The critic bashing comes across as immature and condescending and makes one think that it is illegal to like a well-regarded film or dislike a panned one. Can't count the number of reviews that somehow were approved by IMDb, but should never have been approved in the first place (a lot of them coming dangerously close to violating the terms and conditions of IMDb, some of the negative reviews for the new 'Star Wars' film, panned Adam Sandler films, Marvel films and 'Gone Girl' for examples in fact do so) let alone have so many useful votes while the reviews of the general consensus are heavily marked down.Starting with the positives, 'Ratchet &amp; Clank' excels in the voice acting, which with the exception of one disappointment is very good, mixing some of the original voice actors with A-list talent. The original voice actors don't disappoint and the new voice actors match them in enthusiasm, are worthy replacements mostly and there is much pleasure in recognising them. James Arnold Taylor, David Kaye, John Goodman and Armin Shimermann are particularly strong.There are some witty lines and fun gags here and there, there are some well-done references that are fun to spot and the characters' original personalities are maintained and they're likable. 'Ratchet &amp; Clank' does better than most video game adaptations in trying to be faithful in spirit to the original source material. The soundtrack has some catchy and energetic moments though not all of it fits and there is a tendency for it to be over-scored.For all these good things, 'Ratchet &amp; Clank' doesn't come over entirely successfully. The animation is not awful, there are some lovely bright colours and there is some nice visual invention but there is too much of a video game look often, the character designs are stiff especially Qwark and there is a general lack of finesse and nuance. While the voice cast do a great job on the most part, Paul Giamatti doesn't really fit Derek's character. The original voice actor, Kevin Michael Richardson would have been a much better choice. Giamatti is a fine actor as evident in 'Sideways' and 'Barney's Version' but sounds bored and fails to convey much menace.Despite some fun moments in the script and gags, 'Ratchet &amp; Clank' is another case of the humour's execution not coming across consistently, the effectiveness too sporadic, a serious problem when the film is so full of humour (and in a way somewhat over-crowded with it that it comes at the expense of emotional attachment and depth). Too many of the gags are rushed through or limp, some of the one-liners are groan-worthy and the satire and sarcastic humour lacks bite, sharpness and depth while also not being delivered with that much subtlety. It is nice that the film is fast-paced, but too often the pacing is erratic, sometimes too hectic and other places could have gotten a move on. The story does try to be faithful to the spirit of the games, which is admirable, but there is a sense that it's somewhat too faithful that it comes at the expense of having its own style and of originality. The lack of originality may have been forgivable if the film's story didn't feel like it was recycled and despite trying to be faithful it lacks some of the ingredients (like the sharpness of the humour and emotional attachment) that made the games such a joy which makes it feel rather bland. Characters are in character and are quite likable, but misses an opportunity to expand on their personalities, instead they feel a little stock and depth-less. Never found myself disliking any of them, just wished there was more to them.In conclusion, not that bad, especially considering the dubious track record of video game adaptations, but it could have been better. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is as a perfect adaption of the video games, but still prefer the game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who are large fans of the Ratchet &amp; Clank games than you will be in love with this fan perfect movie. it takes the game premise and lays it down near perfect on the silver screen. Ratchet is a wreck loose mechanic who wants to be a hero like the Galaxy Rangers, but is too small for the heart inside him. He teams up with a defective product of the enemy's robot army to save the galaxy from Derk industries evil plan. Not filled with all the side missions that make up the game, Ratchet and Clank focus on this main story. Watching all the trivial scenes of parts in the game were cool (look for a small cameo from the main character of that other game franchise that looks just like Ratchet and Clank), and the animation design smartly resembles the game.However, as a movie fan, the story is not that strong. The humor that litters the game is mimicked in the film but it only makes it feel like they are trying too hard for the laugh. The film had a few chuckles, but not enough to keep my interest going. It's funny how the movie is called Ratchet and Clank, yet the two do not spend a lot of screen time together to justify the title. A lot of the humor should have come from these two trying to connect on the level of friendship they develop suggested in the film, but I did not feel that. Is that too much to ask for in an animated movie? No, cause, that's face it, Disney does this all the time (Timon and Pumba in the Lion King comes to mind). The voice acting was not all that good. They had some good voice talent. John Goodman voices Grimorth in a small but very memorable role, while the rest of the cast were too interchangeable for me to connect with. I think they were trying to keep it too video game here when they should have been thinking narrative movie. One exception was Captain Quirk, who did get a few chuckles out of me. So overall, as a fan of the game this was a perfect adaption, but as a movie fan, it may have been too perfect to fully appeal to anyone who has never herd of the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The source has amazing content, but the movie is held back by the lack of talent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie, it was disappointing. Very little variety in background species, animation that seems like the guy who worked on Jimmy Neutron the TV series had a hand in this and the story that seems to be more interested at trying to be funny rather than being invested in a coherent and fluent plot. Also the music...whoever worked on the audio didn't know what the hell they were doing and didn't know how the music of the games complimented the themes.I do not blame the characters, they are great and I know all about their games, the way this movie was presented pales in comparison to the presentation of A Crack in Time. I could have forgiven a lot, like the low quality animation, background characters with low variety, bad music and everything, if the director wasn't so bad.The guy was too busy making the movie describe the weapons, try to make pop culture jokes about texting, texting! and try to make stupid scenes where characters screaming and getting their heads bonked look funny.I get it, Ratchet and Clank is loved for the weapons, comedy and etc. but that is not what the characters are about. The story should have been invested in itself, not stupidity! The movie could have been professional and still be funny if it wasn't for the bad director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable, but not worth seeking out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the popular video game series of the same name, revolving around a 'somewhat fox like creature' and his partnership with a robot. Ratchet and Clank is brought to the big screen by Rainmaker Entertainment, responsible for a lot of the straight to DVD/on demand Barbie films of the last decade. Having made the jump to cinematic releases in 2013's Escape to Planet Earth, with reasonable financial success, their follow up is an attempt to adapt one of gaming's most successful pairings of the 21st Century.Ratchet (James Arnold Taylor), a Lombax, is a mechanic with dreams of achieving big things by joining the Galactic Rangers, led by his hero Captain Qwark (Jim Ward). However Chairmen Drek (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the Blarg, is destroying planets whilst building an unstoppable robot army led by his henchman Victor Von Ion (Slyvester Stallone), but due to a system error one of the robots created is Clank (David Kaye) a diminutive being who wishes to seek out and warn the Galactic Rangers of what is about to happen.Immediately it becomes apparent that, despite some great efforts on the part of the design team, the budget impacts on the overall quality of the films aesthetic. Rather than feeling like a big screen adaptation of a video game it feels like a high cost cut- scene, impressive on an XBOX one but not in a cinema. The film's eponymous pair are likable with the enthusiastic Ratchet contrasting charmingly with the robotic Clank, but they feel less like individualistic characters and come across as poor imitations of what we have seen before. As "cute" as Clank is he is not as funny or well designed as Baymax, or as emotive and endearing as Wall-e and he holds nothing like the depth and complexity of a character like The Iron Giant. With some marquee names in the cast, combined with veteran voice actors from the video game series, the performances are large, enthusiastic and energetic, doing the maximum amount possible with the limited quality of the script and story. Co-written by Kevin Munroe, T.J Fixman and Gerry Swallow they attempt to draw humour through breaking the fourth wall but Sadly despite a few admittedly well written gags, the best of which younger children won't enjoy anyway, Ratchet and Clank is a rather drab replay of better films.In the age of animated brilliance we currently find ourselves within you can't simply turn up with a few decent gags and an unoriginal plot and expect to get a return. The excuse of being "Just for Kids" doesn't apply anymore when you consider how successful animation has been at appealing to all ages, something it should always aim to do. As proof the fantastic Zootropolis is currently the highest grossing film of 2016, sitting just shy of $1,000,000,000 worldwide gross. Should we expect an inexperienced studio, with a limited budget, to match the work of Disney? No, But is it wrong to want Ratchet and Clank to not take the easy options with its storytelling, to try and reach a little higher? The movie doesn't completely lack humour; it's got a colourful design, an inoffensive tone and charming lead characters to make it a passable experience. But in a world of Disney, Laika, Pixar, Dreamworks, Ghibli, Aardman, Illumination and countless other talented animation studios passable just isn't enough.Review by Alexander Halsall.

		<shortDescription>Slow paced and confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I didn't know the main character was from a video game, I came with high hopes. Unfortunately, the movie was quite boring, slow paced, and the actions - scenes were so poorly knit together I was confused most of the time.I would compare the viewing experience as similar to reading a comic book with half of the dialogue bubbles removed and a few pages missing.Granted the art work was very well done and the voice actors did their best, but the story was an unrelated string of actions out of context and jokes that were bland and often totally out of place: absurd one-liners that took me out of the story (what little there was of one) and made me want to get up and leave.I have a feeling this movie will fail miserably at the box office as word gets out because there was only one other person in the theater with me.If you grew up with this game then there is every chance it will have more meaning and the story might make sense, but if you are unfamiliar with the premise I wouldn't go unless you are taking your 10 year old (or younger) who will be entranced by the cartoon like themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - nothing fresh, but a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never played the Ratchet and Clank games - this is effectively my first experience, and having seen many critics' reviews I was pleasantly surprised! There are far more laughs than I expected, coming from both the child and adult audiences - the screenplay is (mostly) well written with decent plot twists and dialogue - and the characterisation of the leads are well developed; you're actually interested in both Ratchet and Clank from the beginning!The movie starts at a romping pace, no scene feels too short or too long, and there's plenty of movement to keep the attention of restless young kids and the slightly bored parents. However this begins to slip towards the end of the movie, in which some scenes drag and feel padded out. I think it could've lost ten minutes without losing any character or plot.The main issue, for me, is financial. The animation is chunky and thorough, good for a low budget picture ($20m as opposed to Inside Out's $175m), but the detail on the main characters (especially Qwark) pales in comparison to other big animation features. If this had the backing of bigger animation companies, like Pixar, Disney or DreamWorks, the visuals could have been spotless and the pacing flaws ironed out.That said, although it doesn't push the boundaries of the animated film industry, it was still an enjoyable 90 minutes for all ages, and certainly worth a watch.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just stay home and play one of the games....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have played and completed most of the Rachet &amp; Clank games, so it's not surprising I would go to see this movie. However, after seeing it I saw a few problems which will very likely result in the film coming and going very quickly to local theaters. First, if you love the games, the film is not nearly as clever or funny...and that's one of the biggest reasons to play the game--for the brilliant cut scenes. Second, if you aren't a fan there aren't a lot of laughs or things to make the game stand out. Third, it just isn't very fun and Ratchet and Clank don't really get to DO that much. My advice is to skip the film and spend your money instead on ANY of the games (available for PS2, 3 and 4)...they are immersive, smart and enjoyable. This film really wasn't any of these and it's never a surprise to fans because they already know all about Quark and his back story. A huge disappointment.By the way, there was ONE thing I did like about the film. Armin Shimerman was very good as Dr. Nefarious...with some nice lines and his delivery was also terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Given how formulaic and inoffensive Ratchet &amp; Clank is, this space adventure will only entertain kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What inspires a studio to take interest in a movie based off a video game? Last years Hit-man: Agent 47 only proved that the people hired behind these projects have a hard time with adaptation. I've said before that the problem lies within not the side characters, but with the main character. In a video game, there isn't supposed to be much of a personality to people like Super Mario and those from Mortal Kombat because you are supposed to be that person. In a movie, the main character not only needs to have a personality, but it's the film's job to keep it's audience invested enough to make us want to follow them for an hour and a half. Because there are so many video games (not to mention more adaptations this year with the upcoming The Angry Birds Movie and Assassins Creed), Hollywood will keep trying to find a way to properly adapt the difficult medium. Today's subject marks it the first time a Playstation series has been given the film treatment. I've never played it before, but when the Ratchet &amp; Clank games become big sellers, it's no wonder a film would eventually happen. Going all in as an animated movie, let's see if Ratchet &amp; Clank has the right tools to work.On the planet Veldin, a cat-like creature humanoid Ratchet (played by James Arnold Taylor) is a mechanic who is often trying out over-the-top designs on spacecrafts while desiring more in life. Though his boss/mentor Grimroth (played by John Goodman) tells him to get back to work, Ratchet sees on TV that due to the recent planets being blown up by aliens lead by Chairman Drek (played by Paul Giamatti) and Doctor Nefarious (played by Armin Shimerman), the Glalactic Rangers are now looking for a fifth member to join up. Ratchet goes to try out, but is turned away by Ranger leader Captain Qwark for being too short and unpredictable. Meanwhile, Chairman Drek is working on a robot army to assist, but a defect-bot named Clank (played by David Kaye) manages to escape and crash-lands a ship to where Ratchet is. Ratchet pulls Clank out in time and repairs him. Both agree to go where the Rangers are to warm them of more impending attacks. The two fight off Drek's army and are hired into the Rangers where they plan their next move to defeat the villains.Does Ratchet &amp; Clank make for a proper movie adaptation? Well?at the best, I can say that Ratchet &amp; Clank is a movie. Too bad it isn't a good one. In fact for the first twenty minutes, I was starting to get a feel for this far out space adventure. Once Ratchet and Clank meet and pair up, it become what has to be an auto-piloted formula to qualify as a movie. Everything in Ratchet &amp; Clank feels so safe and inoffensive that I question why this even needs a major theatrical release. I can see more this as a Nickelodeon TV movie that's pilot for a series.I can't completely say that nothing went into this. The script given here tries to have fun with it's concept and throws a ton of jokes. I even laughed a few times. The animation can be colorful and nice too (though some design can look inconsistent). But it's everything else, especially the main character Ratchet, which feels like something that we've seen in a ton of movies already. Just how many more times can you hear the "I'm tired of this boring life and I want more" speech that seems only be found in bad children's films?I'll give this four Ratchet &amp; Clank PlayStation games out of ten. At best, it's a kids movie that'll likely be entertaining for parents that simply want something in the background. At worse, it's an unoriginal and rarely funny space opera that adds nothing to the genre. I'll guess that the movie follows the game well, but all it does for me is to make me rather play the game then anything. Unless you have little ones or are fans of the series, I'd say Ratchet &amp; Clank is a skip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst written films I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible to describe just how bad this movie is. It is a Frankenscript stitched together from waste products any one else would have been too embarrassed to deploy. It is not the far fetched sci fi cartoon villainy I object to but the sheer senselessness. At one point it is so sloppy and cynical that a character describes her plan as a hypothetical and we are led (too strong a term) to believe it actually happened. Imagine if you will a kind of story jump cut. Truly appalling. The final shootout has the two opponents quibbling about the structure of a joke - it is that feeble. At no point would one believe that Rachet and Clank have any relationship whatsoever. At another a subtitle appears to apologetically claim we are going to have a fancy montage. It was most shameless attempt to throw together used up ideas I have ever witnessed in my life. I will never forgive the hour and a half that I sat watching this. Now, that said, my 7 year old loved but I will do my best to warn any and all away from this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a R@C fan this really hits me in the heart. I was really hopping this movie would be the one. The one to break the streak of horrible movie adaption of video games. You had one job, one job and you messed it up. The film feels so stereotypical and like a carbon copy of every other B budget animated film out there. The jokes fell flat and the dialogue didn't really have any meaning. I might have laughed like twice or something but that's IT, no more no less. OH, and the pop culture references! STOP IT! They're not funny and they never were! And don't say "Oh! This movie was made for younger audiences!" BS, that's such a lame excuse and you know it. This film just felt like it was tacked on at the last moment (even though it has been delayed like twice or something) to flow along with the new video game that was recently released. I think the only good parts of this movie was in maybe the last 20 minutes or so which is when it got somewhat better. Maybe I'm just looking at the movie at a wrong angle or something. Now this movie wasn't total garbage but it isn't anywhere near amazing. I just hope that this is a lesson learned for the people who made this film. Maybe in the near future they'll make something better out of their mistakes.</fullReview>
