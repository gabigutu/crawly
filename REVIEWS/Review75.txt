		<shortDescription>Coyote Ugly Was A "Feel Good" Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not disappointed with "Coyote Ugly". It made me feel good and we need this kind of film these days with all that's going-on.It was no worse than "Flashdance" or "Footloose" which also had little storyline and average acting. I enjoyed it and it was what I had expected.Many of you gave it negative criticisms; what did they expect from a film about a young girl coming to the city? This was a simple story about a young shy girl with dreams trying to make it in show business; which is hard if you don't have the right connections.The dance numbers and bar scene were very realistic. As a New Yorker, I was happy to see that she wasn't mugged or worse as many films about New York portray.I'd like a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming story overcomes sappy bits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true story about the crazy female run bar in New York City, Coyote Ugly becomes surprisingly believable despite the usual Hollywood bits. The story follows Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) as she moves from small town New Jersey to the city to become a songwriter. Through her misfortunes she meets boyfriend Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) and the Coyotes and learns from each of them to overcome the stage fright that threatens to ruin her dreams.Many moments are sappy or overly dramatic but the majority is enthralling as all the characters are solidly built. The girls all have their own character but aren't so strictly chained to it that they become merely symbols instead of people. While the females may be on the screen the most, the two supporting males Kevin and William Sanford (John Goodman) provide the most heartwarming scenes. Goodman's performance provides subtle humor while his character struggles through the conflict of his daughter leaving and his desire to see her succeed. For an actor who has put in so many great performances, this one still manages to be one of his best.Coyote Ugly offers something enjoyable to everyone. Guys obviously will enjoy the attractive girls and the provocative dancing while girls can enjoy the strong female characters, each of which won't take crap from any of the men that surround them. Parents can enjoy the side story of the conflict between Violet and her father. Another feature to enjoy is the fabulous music with four songs performed by LeAnn Rimes with some smaller groups as well.Coyote Ugly crosses the unusual boundary of being both an exciting, fast-paced movie that gets the adrenaline flowing and a sensitive story with strong characters and brilliant acting to get the mind working. The result is a thoroughly rewarding movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insubstantial but highly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema. He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer. He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance. In that regard, `Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch. The story is "Flashdance" lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous `Cocktail' with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in. Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered. When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below. Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director. Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes. This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find. She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role. Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius). Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential. It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career. Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest. His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial. John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film. It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1. The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment. It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch. I rated it a 7/10. Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film. He knows how to push our buttons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting, excellent surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that when I saw the trailer I thought this was going to be a film about some half naked women and some people drinking a lot. But, when the film ended I have to say I was really surprised. A good surprise. Some people will probably disagree with me but this is not a film about nudity or something like that, it is a film about following your dreams, about leaving home searching for something real. I think Piper Perabo is excellent in her role as Violet, who actually sings some of the songs in the film. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar story still has great energy, and works for me!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad, not bad. I read reviews that criticized the cliche-ness of this movie, and I can see their point. At times the plot made the characters a little bit annoying. But hey-- story cliches often become that way because they speak to universal "truths," or at least things that interest bunches of people over of time.This movie is interesting-- it is engaging, and even touching at times. I DID care about the characters throughout the story. I wanted to see how things would work out for them, and I wanted them to win. Sure, the plot is kind of predictable-- but the energy kept the theme in the forefront, and I AM interested in the theme presented here-- love, taking risks, courage, and all of that. The women actors were wonderful-- hot, sure, but also outrageous in an innocent kind of way. I had the sense that none of the characters in the movie, even the raunchy extras in the bar scenes, was belittled. I suspected the writers, director, cast, etc., had a basic affection for their subjects and topic.The dancing was great-- I noted "dancing doubles" in the credits for all of the girls-- and the bar tricks and stunts were fun. I enjoyed pretending that those stunts were even possible, and that they wouldn't have killed 7 people the first night they were tried in a real bar in real life. I gave this one an "8" out of 10. Go see it-- you'll like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coyote Ugly is the best bar-flick since Cocktail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love "Coyote Ugly", even though it seems critics/reviewers had mixed opinions. I thought it was the best bar-flick since "Cocktail". If you haven't seen "Cocktail", it's a movie where Tom Cruise stars as a bartender, and he swirls bottles around and other cool tricks of the trade. In Coyote Ugly, you have Violet (Piper Perabo) who comes to NYC to become a singer/songwriter. While Violet's there she finds that nobody will accept her demos, so she goes looking for work and she finds a job in a local bar called, "Coyote Ugly". The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello), Lil is a hardcore chick who treats her bar like it's her home. While Violet is there she also learns the tricks of the trade, and she also dances on top of the bar. I'm not going to tell you if Violet becomes a singer/songwriter or not, because that would wreck the movie, but I am going to tell you that this is a great movie. Personally, I would have to recommend this to anybody that has hopes and dreams of making it big. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10, because it has an amazing story, memorable characters and a lot of great lines, but I have to tell you one of the best parts is the theme song, "Can't Fight The Moonlight". So, if you love bar-flicks like "Cocktail" you'll love "Coyote Ugly".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Cocktail" for women minus Tom Cruise - 56%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bartending movies are pretty rare things though judging by most bars seen in Hollywood, that's probably a good thing. Excessively noisy, always packed with people and there will be a fight breaking out at some point during the evening. You wouldn't see that in the UK. You'd get a couple of jocks hogging the pool table, bad music from the jukebox and maybe one or two "singers" who have had too much to drink - far more civilised that the bar seen in stuff like "Coyote Ugly", anyway. Despite its raucous nature, this is actually a fairly inoffensive and deeply predictable rags-to-riches story that is aimed squarely at the teenage girl market that I'm clearly not a part of. Oh dear.Piper Perabo plays Violet, a shy wannabe songwriter growing up in New Jersey but with dreams of moving to New York in order to pursue her dreams. Against the wishes of her father (John Goodman), she moves out and finds herself struggling to make it. As her money dwindles, she takes a bar job at a frankly seedy establishment called Coyote Ugly and is woefully out of her depth. Staffed by sassy women who tease and tantalize their largely male customers, Violet fights the reluctance of the manager Lil (Mario Bello) and her stage fright in order to fit in. Can she overcome her nerves to secure her dreams and succeed in love with the impossibly cute Kevin (Adam Garcia)? There is a lot not to like about "Coyote Ugly". The plot is insultingly basic and all too ready to turn on itself for the sake on convenience. Take the moment when Violet auctions off Kevin in order to raise some cash. Up to that point, the bar is full of shouting drunk guys but as soon as the auction starts, it suddenly fills with sex-starved women with money to burn - where did they come from? I personally felt that this was a female fantasy movie - a film where women are the shouty ballsy ones partying hard and living dangerously - and this may be why it didn't ring particularly true to me. The evolution of Violet's character doesn't seem organic at all, as she switches from shy to confident at a moment's notice. However, Perabo rightly leads to cast as she is good as Violet. Goodman also performs well as her father but Garcia does less well, being little more than eye-candy. But the real star is the soundtrack - like "Dirty Dancing", the film's score is filled with great songs from start to finish although the heavy repetition of the film's climatic song "Can't Fight The Moonlight" after the film's release means that the all-important feel-good factor at the end with replaced with a sense of resignation.I suppose that as romantic fairy-tales go, this is a little unconventional but does the job well enough. In fact, that's symptomatic of the movie as a whole. Everything is enough but never excessive. The music is good but never stunning. The romantic element is OK but not as plausible as I'd like. The humour is gentle but never biting, the acting is decent enough but doesn't feel realistic and the bar-work (all the bottle spinning and juggling) looks the business but needs a whooshy sound-effect. So "Coyote Ugly" is good enough entertainment but nothing award-winning. Me? I'd rather have a quiet night in, thanks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer. And after initial frustration of having no luck, overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night. She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! The place is completely full of "two year old toddlers" bursting at the sight of babes dancing.The story is not bad and some characters are likeable, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" part was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning. Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie. And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!For the first time I could think of, how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, "You were warned!" Instead, it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world. Advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin "pursue your dream" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!And finally, the music. There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. But the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about. Whether you watched or made it, it looked like nothing but time killing. Or wasting depending on how you look at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are something like 3 years since I watched ''Coyote Ugly'', but I remembered it of being a very nice movie! It was the first movie I watched with Piper Perabo and Bridget Moynahan.(who, by the way, is the same lady who works in ''I,Robot'' and I couldn't remember since she is so different!)We also have the famous John Goodman playing Violet's dad and Adam Garcia, who I already have watched in ''Riding in Cars with Boys ''. The story of this movie is very simple, and it's about a girl called Violet from New Jersey,who wants to be a singer and go to New York to try her luck. Once in the Apple City, she has many problems finding someone to be interested in her music, and goes to work in a bar called ''Coyote Ugly'', where the girls (bar maids) besides giving the clients drinks also do sensual dances. She also meets the charming Australian Kevin, who she falls in love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure I've seen worse movies, but can't think of one I've seen in a theatre. This film has the writing quality of SHOWGIRLS and the originality of a Casper The Friendly Ghost cartoon.I don't blame the actors (they are all attractive and don't overact). I blame the writers and the director. When "Jersey" finally kisses her love interest, he says "Have a nice day." Then he apologizes for not having anything else to say. I laughed out loud, and wondered if that line was ad-libbed.If you want to know what this movie is like -- think of every movie cliche you've ever seen cramped into a plotline taken from that terrible J Love Hewitt TV show that failed last Fall.There was one other thing about the movie -- the music. I don't believe in capital punishment -- but might be willing to make an exception for the songwriters.This movie belongs on MST3K!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violet Sanford(Piper Perabo)wants to avoid a dead end life and decides to leave New Jersey for the big city. In NYC, she is determined to be a hit song writer. In order to make ends meet, she takes a job slinging beer and dancing on the bar with the other "Coyotes" at the popular watering hole Coyote Ugly. This is very titilating and an eye full to watch. The trailers don't give you any hint of substance. Perabo is so easy to like. I could watch her for hours. Maria Bello, who plays the bar owner is impressive as well. Also in the cast: Adam Garcia, John Goodman, Melanie Lynskey, Izabella Miko, Bridget Moyhnahan and a cameo by LeAnn Rimes, who actually is the singing voice of Perabo's character. Besides the four songs by Rimes, the soundtrack is full of music by the likes of The Charlie Daniels Band, Lenny Kravitz, Def Leppard, Blondie and Elvis Presley. Order another round and enjoy. This is actually worth seeing more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Product Placement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Coyote Ugly" is a real bar in New York; the name is presumably an ironic allusion to the fact that its female staff are all very attractive. I wonder how many other real bars in America have been able to benefit from the ultimate product placement of having an entire Hollywood movie dedicated to their activities. Violet Sanford is a young woman from South Amboy, New Jersey who moves to New York to follow her dream of becoming a songwriter. The film is clearly based on the dubious theory that songwriters need to live in big cities because no songs worth listening to have ever been written in small towns. (It is also based upon the assumption that "Violet" was a plausible Christian name for girls of Piper Perabo's generation. Well, perhaps it was in New Jersey, but in the seventies the only Violets in Britain were those queuing up for their old age pension). Violet quickly discovers that, in the songwriting trade, success does not always come quickly and realises that she will need another source of income to tide her over until her genius is recognised by the music industry. She therefore gets a job at the Coyote Ugly Saloon."Coyote Ugly" reminded me of a slightly later film, "Burlesque". In that film Christina Aguilera also plays a rather naive young girl who leaves her small-town home to settle in the big city and who ends up working in a rather risqué establishment. Lil, the bar owner, also bears certain similarities to the character played by Cher in "Burlesque". The main difference is that the Coyote Ugly Saloon is not actually a strip club; taking their clothes off is not something the Coyote Girls are expected to do. If, however, they are not strippers, neither are they barmaids as that term is more generally understood. They are encouraged to flirt with male customers, to dance on the bar, to take part in wet T-shirt contests and to behave in a generally raunchy way. The film charts Violet's rise to fame not only as a bartender but also as a singer-songwriter, and there is a subplot chronicling her romance with a handsome young Australian named Kevin. Actually, "handsome" seems an inadequate adjective to describe Adam Garcia. He achieves the rare feat for a Hollywood leading man of being even prettier than his leading lady. The film-makers seem to have had the cynical idea of making a romantic comedy (normally regarded as a genre which appeals more to women than to men) which would be equally popular with both sexes. Garcia would provide eye-candy for the ladies, while for the men there would be the sight of various sexy girls parading their charms in tight- fitting T-shirts and jeans. Among Violet's co-workers is the gorgeous supermodel Tyra Banks, at this period trying to carve out a cinema career for herself. (Tyra's bid for screen stardom did not prove a great success, but at least she was no worse than some of her fellow supers, such as Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Elle Macpherson, who also tried their hand at acting around the same time). Good looks, whether of the masculine or feminine variety, are not always enough to ensure the success of a film, but "Coyote Ugly" did relatively well at the box-office. The critics, however, were less impressed, and I must say that my sympathies are with them. The plot is weak and clichéd, and the acting is undistinguished. Both Perabo and Garcia are forgettable; about the only one of the cast to make anything of an impression is John Goodman as Violet's father Bill, like most Goodman characters an amiable slob. Even the sight of Tyra Banks in a T-shirt cannot make "Coyote Ugly" anything more than a below-average rom-com. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is an aspiring songwriter from small town New Jersey. She leaves her pizza joint waitress job, her father, and her best friend to pursue her dreams in NYC. Only the big bad city is getting the best of her. Down to her last few dollars, she tries out for a surprising job at a bar called Coyote Ugly.First, I don't know why she has to move to NYC to pursue her dreams as a songwriter. I would think New Jersey is close enough to get rejected by the music industry, and she could do a week or two. But as a songwriter, why does she have to stay there? I think it would be better if she's an actress.Then the rejections are so silly and ham fisted. It had me rolling my eyes, and hating the first act. By the time she gets to the bar, I couldn't really stand the movie. Maria Bello plays the bar owner. Izabella Miko, Tyra Banks, and Bridget Moynahan play the dancers. Other than watching some hot actresses dancing suggestively, there isn't much in this movie.</fullReview>

And who believes the music world should be sympathetic to someone that keeps on blowing off her open mic gigs, there are plenty of talented (and not so talented) people out there who will get up on stage and try. it's hard to believe someone that has the guts to move out of a small town to a crappy apt. in NYC seeking fame and fortune couldn't at least get over a mild case of stage fright.If this movie comes on in your presence go ride a bike, take a walk, something, just get out of the house.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was, in a word crap. I am kind of depressed to know that I live in a world where millions of dollars are used to make movies like this and Kazam. Can't Hollywood think of a better way to spend money? Like, I don't know, burn it?Anyway, pretty much every aspect of this film was poorly executed. The plot was less believable than Weekend at Bernie's II. The editing was confusing at best and the acting...well, John Goodman was as usual, a solid performance, but aside from him it was a slew of WB rejects(mind you this is the network that allowed the Wayans brothers their own show.) Well...I take that back, there was one other glimmer of light in the otherwise foul smelling mire of Coyote Ugly...TYRA BANKS! Just kidding She made me yearn for the master thespians of Cleopatra 2525.Being the sad fanboy that I am I was reading an interview with the stars(I really don't think that word is appropriate, a much better term would be "people who the camera was on the most") they went on and on about how this movie was a celebration of womens sexuality and their newfound freedom to be whatever they(all women) want to be. Well I guess that makes sense, after leaving the theater I realized that most women in this sexually and culturally open minded world, do in fact have the right to work in any Hooters restaurant they want. Seriously though, Maybe I'm just hyper sensitive but the movie seemed slightly demeaning to women. I found it in the same vein as Pretty Woman; using your body to make money will make all your dreams come true. What a great message for a PG-13 movie.Well, in a nutshell, this movie really sucked on every level. It is a sad reflection on the intelligence of the American consumer(as I glance across the room at my ticket stub).</fullReview>

But uh oh! Girls dance on the bar and pour drinks listening "You're Unbelievable". How intimidating! Eventually though, she sheds her dignity and decides to mix drinks and light the bar on fire like the best of us. Not even the semi-attractive cast could make this film with plot holes and terrible acting and dialouge more than very very rarely entertaining, if at all. I enjoy the occasional chick flick, but this was just too unbearable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great soundtrack. The film? Not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, actually, 'Coyote Ugly' from personal opinion didn't even come close to good.Feel-good films when done right are very entertaining and heart-warming. However 'Coyote Ugly', while with its moments, has too many faults that are at worst ineptly done to succeed as a feel-good film.Starting with 'Coyote Ugly's' good things, the best asset by far is the soundtrack, which is quite brilliant and deserved a far better film. The LeAnn Rimes numbers "The Right Kind of Wrong", "Please Remember" and "Can't Fight the Moonlight" particularly stand out of the songs, as does the classic Elvis Presley standard "Can't Help Falling in Love", one of the most beautiful all-time great romantic songs. The score is very nice too.While the acting wasn't great at all, there is one good performance and it is that of John Goodman, who is an entertaining and amiably likable father figure. Some of the camera work is quite smart too.On the other hand, while the music itself is of really high-quality it does feel too constant with little break and like there could have been less, there were definitely scenes that would have benefited much more without it or at least from music with a less intrusive approach. Too many scenes feel like amateurishly edited and lazily choreographed, with a lot of gloss and either being overblown or lacking energy, music videos, which is a huge problem in a film full of them and with a wafer-thin story that feels like an excuse to string these scenes together.Also hugely problematic is how cliché-ridden and stereotypical it is. Not just the story, which has every done to death cliché in the book that everything feels forced and predictable with ridiculous and laughable dramatic elements with little chemistry and no substance or emotional connection whatsoever. We are also talking about the characters in a film loaded with every possible stereotype, another problem being that apart from Cammie and Bill very few of them are likable, with a difficult to relate to protagonist, and some add nothing to the film, Maria Bello's character is particularly useless and only there because the film "needed" the obligatory boss stereotype.Goodman aside, the performances are not great, or even good, at all. Adam Garcia is particularly bad, with an acting ability so limited it's almost non-existent and he feels out of place too. He doesn't even work as eye candy that well. Piper Perabo tries hard but too often lacks charisma and doesn't display a wide range of emotions with sudden shifts in character that undermine the character's growth. Everybody else is bland or annoying though Izabella Miko has moments of charm. Dialogue is painfully trite and thin throughout, while the direction lacks panache and flash. The film looks alright, especially in the colours, locations and the camera work, which show a lot of style, but cheapened by too much gloss and amateurish editing.Overall, there is a great soundtrack but 'Coyote Ugly' falls far short. 3/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly (2000): Dir: David McNally / Cast: Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, Adam Garcia, John Goodman, Tyra Banks: A reworking of the Cocktail formula (as if we need more of that) with a young woman leaving home to pursue a song writing career. After numerous attempts to get her songs heard she accepts a job at a bar baring the title name. The owner explains the rules then she is off tap dancing on bar tops. She eventually meets someone who is interested in helping her get established with song writing but intelligent viewers will realize that it is just an excuse for a dull romance. Dreary setup with predictable circumstances and behavior that is applauded that shouldn't be. David McNally does his best as director but even the locations spark little enthusiasm. Piper Perabo is the one casting that elevates above the low level material. She dreams big and works the bar to get there financially but much of this is predictable. Maria Bello as her boss is a total stereotype. Adam Garcia as her love interest is a useless prop for predictable romantic drivel. John Goodman as her father never rises above the humour level. A pre-talk show Tyra Banks even gets cast in this film. While the film is popular, it doesn't divert the horrible clichés and lazy writing. Any message to be found is lost within a parade of juvenile acts. Fire streams down the bar top to further celebrate the idiocy and ugliness. Score: 1 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Adventures of Piper Perabo in Manhattan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film because I admire the work of the young actress Piper Perabo, who has been so brilliant and charming as the lead character in the ongoing series COVERT AFFAIRS. The reason why she is called 'Piper' is not because she is a tropical bird who makes strange sounds in the jungle, but because she was named after the fifties movie actress Piper Laurie, remember her? But the reason why she looks so unusual is that she is half Norwegian and half Portuguese, a mixture so rare that we have never seen one before and may never see one again. She attended high school in Toms River, New Jersey, one of the small New Jersey towns I have actually been to long ago, strange that. (How many people have been to Toms River? If you have six fingers on one hand that's too many.) I first encountered her on screen in SLAP HER SHE'S FRENCH (2002, see my review), in which she and the whole film were equally hilarious. She was also in the wonderfully funny BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA (2008, see my review). So I thought I would jump from chihuahuas to coyotes and see what that was all about. Well, what a shock. All those girls dancing on the top of a bar in a Manhattan bar called Coyote Ugly, the girls themselves being called 'coyotes'! I got a DVD of what is called the extended cut, whatever was extended. This is in some ways what is called a chick flic, but not really. Perabo plays a good little girl from the tiny South Amboy, New Jersey (is that an in joke of some kind?), who gets the nickname 'Jersey'. She loves her dad who is a widower, excellently played by John Goodman, who has just the right sentimental sad sack tone for the part. Perfect casting there. She falls for the quirky Australian actor Adam Garcia, who has just the right amount of whimsy and works at a grill, so that is the love story part of it. She moves into the most terrible filthy and collapsing apartment in China Town, but seems to love it. But it's the bar that makes your jaw drop far below floor level. The girls cavort on the bar from where they throw buckets of water and buckets of ice cubes all over the patrons, and the patrons just love it. Everybody drinks bottles of whiskey and it gets poured all over the counter and the people too. Perabo wants to be a song-writer, like her deceased mother, but is too shy to sing her own songs in public. She takes a job as a coyote to pay the rent. The girls are all dressed in as little as possible and, as the woman owner puts it, 'must give the impression of being available while not really being available'. Perabo slowly warms up to this, which is not exactly her thing. There are numerous ups and downs, not to mention sideways wriggles, and Perabo is forced to sing to the patrons of the bar to stop a violent fight, which means she has sung in public for the first time by accident. Eventually after endless rebuffs she gets someone to listen to one of her own songs. There is a lot of very good satire of the music business in the film. Perabo's father comes to the bar unexpectedly one night and is shocked, and this makes for problems, as he says he never thought he could be ashamed of her but he is. She gets fired but then gets rehired. She realizes she is not a natural coyote. The pure unrestrained anarchy of the bar is really something to see and behold, though pardon me if I don't go searching for such a place, for as much as I can cope with anarchy, I really don't want to be soaked with buckets of water all evening and forced to drink that much whiskey. I'll give it a miss. Nor do I necessarily think girls should be demeaning themselves by wriggling on bar tops. It goes against my male feminist principles. But still! It's a movie! And there she is, Piper Perabo with her girlish smile, surviving it all somehow, for after all she has a big future ahead of her as the world's cutest super-spy in COVERT AFFAIRS (to be reviewed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not ugly and definitively not a bar movie as well (DVD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cover with all the girls having fun in a bar isn't accurate because the bar intrigue and the friends are really a subplot. The story focuses really of the life of Violet and as a "dreams come true" movie, this one is really superior to "Honey". The reason is that even as a newcomer, Piper Parabo is definitely a better actress than Jessica Alba! She is really moving with her feelings and i like the way she manages her relationship with her father and her boyfriend. The final moments are maybe a bit rushed but i have enjoyed the journey. And what about the coyotes then? Well, they are in the back: the dance and drinks aren't so many and it's a good thing because getting drunk in a bar while peeping girls isn't my habit. Now i understand why it's a Disney production because it focuses on dreams and not booze and if the girls get loose, there is nothing scandalous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>piper perabo is one hot babe or a slut that is the line you will utter when you see any movie of her coyote ugly 2000 displays her few talents .it serves a decent time pass nothing else as i said above coyote ugly was a bar &amp; this movie was based on that so they have tried their best but fails at many levels,let me just say this there is no movie in the world that is almost perfect the plot is about a struggling singer Violet goes to NYC to look for a job and lands at a coolest club called coyote ugly owned by LIL(maria bellow) there she has to prove herself for the job.this film is mostly shot in the club &amp; one of the things i love to see in any film is the production quality the makers did there best here but again no focus on the script makes it rather dull.now there are some fun scenes like bottle juggling,singing &amp; spilling wine all over the place.if it wasn't for the good cast &amp; sexy scenes this film would be an epic fail.i liked maria bellow she reminds me of Sharon stone.anyway the DVD comes with deleted scenes &amp; trailers &amp; stuff but there was a lot of missing scenes including the famous Piper perabo sex scene.my rating is 5/10 watch coyote ugly only for piper pirabo, Bridget moynahan &amp; time pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife had been nagging me for months about renting this movie and I kept putting it off. The critics reviews had totally turned me off to the story.I finally picked up the DVD tonight and just thought I would read a book while my wife watched it. About 15 minutes after it started, I realized I was enjoying it...and it wasn't all due to the eye candy dancing on the bar.I found it amusing and fun, and my wife enjoyed it too. I agree that the plot was predictable, but it is the rare movie that isn't. It certainly was no more schmaltzy and predictable than "Dirty Dancing" which made a mint when it came out. There are a hundred stories like this, but the dialogue is fresh enough to make the story entertaining. I look forward to seeing Piper Perabo in other roles. I gave it a 7.</fullReview>

It´s utterly boring and dumb. And on top of that, the fine young ladies don´t even drop their apparel!This movie is gonna frustrate all your hopes for a potential remake of, say, "Flashdance" (which was produced by Bruckheimer as well, way back in the 80s, when he still knew how to make a movie work!).I can´t even say why I find this film so utterly stupid. It´s more like a bad feeling that accompanies the watching of it.It´s like: "why am I wasting my time with this?"Anyway, he/she who likes absolutely carefree entertainment, will probably find "Coyote Ugly" appealing...

		<shortDescription>Formulaic story with dancing girls ? like a titillating music video but 30 times longer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aspiring song writer Violet leaves her New Jersey home and moves into New York, full of hope that a record company will pick up her tape and start selling her songs. When she realises the reality of the situation she has run out of money and luck. When she overhears three girls talking about how much money they made in one night, she learns of the bar Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids are so lively and fun that they draw the crowds. She gets a job there ? but will it hinder her chances of getting her big break?I, like almost all men, enjoy the odd music video here and there ? it's not hard to watch MTV for longer than 20 minutes and realise that all the videos know that sexy girls shaking their asses will get the viewers watching their songs. This is fine because a) the song may be good so that it's not all visuals and b) it only lasts 3 minutes. The problem with Coyote Ugly is that it is basically a long music video and has the disadvantage that neither a) or b) are true in it's case. The plot is very formulaic and everyone and his dog knows where it is going from the outset. For large chunks of the film nothing of merit happens ? even a love interest is thrown in to try and fill the running time out. This leaves plenty of scenes of girls in tight/skimpy clothes dancing on a bar, covering themselves with water etc which is all well and good if that's all you want. However for me, and this brings us to b), I want more from a 90 min+ film ? I can get that in a music video.The running time just drags at times and few of the scenes do anything to help. Scenes of Violet writing on her roof are just uninspiring and it's only the ass-shaking that ever woke me up out of the stupor that the film had put me in. The film is just another slick little meaningless product from the usual stable ? it has no substance but has plenty of enjoyable visual images for men to watch. I just needed more than girls to enjoy this.The cast are average at best. Perabo is dippy in the lead but is likeable enough to do the job. Garcia is a poor love interest and always feels like an afterthought ? no matter how hard the film works to crowbar him into the narrative. Of the Coyote girls, none really manage to have any meaningful character and are really just there to sex the film up. Of the three, Banks is treated the worst ? her character leaves the bar but then keeps just randomly turning up with explanation. I'm not complaining because I found her the cutest, but it was further proof of the film's focus on image over everything else. Goodman doesn't manage to come out with any dignity either and I'm sure the only thing he'll remember about his part in this film will be how much he got paid.Overall ? wanna see girls dance and be sexy? Then either go to a club in the real world or sit at home and fast forward to the bar scenes in this film. If you want anything more than that (plot, interesting characters, good story, substance) then you'd best avoid this as it basically has none of those qualities in anything other than very meagre amounts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not more than just a movie for teens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering that "Coyote Ugly" is a teen-movie, it isn't even bad. In fact, it is quite better than most of those nasty teen-movies (such as the "American Pie" movies, "There's Something About Mary", "Cross Roads", etc...), but nothing extraordinary. Nevertheless, it is still entertaining enough and has its fun, as well as its moments.The best things about this movie are the good pop soundtrack and the beautiful Piper Perabo as a very seductive girl. The plot is predictable but okay. The dialogs/lines are okay. The romantic atmosphere combined with humor is good in my personal opinion. There is some language in this movie, but fortunately it has no disgusting dialogs or profanity. There is also some drama, without being very intense, however.Piper Perabo portrays Violet Sanford, a very sexy and sensual character, but also a very friendly and lovable character. Adam Garcia portrays Kevin O'Donnell, a likable, funny and cool dude.While not necessarily a great movie, "Coyote Ugly" is however underrated. It deserves a little higher rating than this, if you ask me.For teenagers, it's very easy to enjoy this movie. As for adults, I won't say they will dislike, but most of them will certainly not be as pleased with it as teens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 10 only because it shocked me when I saw it. I went in with low expectations because of the reviews I had read in the past. I was surprised to see that it kept my attention throughout and had a few interesting side stories to keep the main plot fresh (girl moves to big city).Many parts you knew were coming, the break-in to her apartment, her thinking of moving home, her getting fired and given a second chance, etc. What saves this film are the bar scenes that the trailers have killed for the past 2 months. You can't get enough of them and everyone knows there should have been more. I've heard stories that the real "Coyote Ugly" in NYC is close to being as wild as the joint in the movie which makes me want to visit it sometime. :) The biggest disappointment was the fact that Tyra Banks had basically NO part in the movie. A quick 5 minute cameo in the beginning and that was it. It's like Carmen Electra in the beginning of "Scary Movie." You want more but it's never there :)If you're still planning on seeing this movie go into knowing that you have seen this plot before and know that there won't be nearly enough bar scenes. Try to focus on the relationship with the main character's father and the movie seems much more interesting.Piper Parabo really grew on me. She's very sweet and innocent but her acting has some minor flaws which need to be worked out. Great date movie, the women will like it as well as the men. Remember.....open minded!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly stars Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia together with Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks and John Goodman.It is romantic dramedy about an aspiring musician from New Jersey who tries her luck in New York becomes a bartender.Violet Sanford dreams of making a name for herself as a singer and songwriter.She move to New York to make a name for herself but she found out that it won't be an easy journey towards it as her music is constantly rejected by music producers.This temporarily led her to becoming a one of the attractive female bartenders at Coyote Ugly that flaunt their skin while dancing and serving drinks to the male customers.She also finds a new boyfriend in Kevin O'Donnell.As the story goes on,we see Violet get into many problems and conflicts with bar owner Lil,Kevin,her father,her fellow barmaids and having stage fright when performing.But in the end,she manages to overcome these obstacles and her dreams ultimately come true.As always,there is nothing refreshing and groundbreaking in it as we have seen the plot elements in it in previous movies.The story was definitely clichéd and predictable as the viewer can see how everything will come out for Violet in the end.The only thing I could say is that it definitely will provide enjoyment to the male viewers especially when the attractive barmaids show parts of their skin while dancing and it also would be a form of a stress reliever for people looking to relax while watching it.Added to that,it can also be form of an escapism as well as feeling good which it does effectively.But viewers looking for an intelligent film should stay away from it for they will feel disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly think of only one reason to watch this movie that I have just suffered through: John Goodman. I found John Goodman's performance affective and moving, however, his role generally had little effect on the rest of the picture. Beyond Goodman's moments we are left to drudge through a female-lead rehash of "Cocktail", which was one of the worst movies of the last twenty years, so that's not a good thing. Viewers beware: bartenders don't make interesting lead characters. Then there's a fair amount of "Flashdance" tossed in there, except instead of an aspiring dancer, we have aspiring songwriter. There's also the fact that this was such a tame movie that was trying to be sexy and scandalous and according to the DVD, it was also trying to be a comedy. Where did I miss that? The only thing funny about it was the overacting and the possible Kevin Smith inclusion (uncredited writer on this) of the "special edition" comic book, which was cute but quite out of place. What a mess!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with a female and male friend. Both were very excited, one because of the girls and one because of Adam Garcia. I watched this movie mainly in expectation of some good music video style dancing scenes and pretty girls. Well, one can't deny that they look good, but they don't blow you off the couch. I was mainly disappointed by the bring use of light and camera. I think most of the scenes could have been great ones, but they stuck into a switch from camera A to camera B and flash a little bit of light. I didn't have the feeling of being in a big party, but in a dirty, loud bar.The girls were so obviously superficial, I can't believe anyone older than sixteen finds those women attractive.About the plot: There is none and the bit of plot that can be found is so predictable, you don't even need to watch until the end.The most disappointing fact is this happy end and the fulfilling of the `American Dream' that makes everybody happy ad everybody smiles and says: America, Land of freedom were all you're dreams come true. I realized just later that there is a quite big amount of American flags which is quite annoying, since this film isn't a patriotic one in the first place.If you want to see nice girls dancing, watch some R'NB Music clips or buy a magazine. But don't watch this film. It is not worth it.</fullReview>

Very poor acting though and very lame plot; it's about a girl from New Jersey(REPRESENTING) who wants to leave the small town and go to New York City to be a singer. But in the meanwhile she gets a full time job as a "coyote", a slang name for a woman that works at a popular bar called Coyote Ugly. The bar brings beer, hot chicks, and great music, and another situation she has to deal with is a new boyfriend. The movie is horrible but I prefer seeing this movie than seeing BattleField Earth, in which you didn't know......it's probably one of the worst movies made in film. I give this Coyote Ugly a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

No one could have hatched up a storyline better than this if it wasn't real, and it's still hard to beleive it was. "Coyote Ugly" demonstrates so much in just an hour and a half and teaches a lesson in life. Funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 2 minutes of starting to watch this film on my own I decided to save it and watch it with my wife, who likes light comedies. After a couple of minutes I could see the whole film laid out before me and knew what the end was going to be. But little did I know just how cringeworthy the script would be, so that even my wife admitted to cheesyness overload by the end. John Goodman is a small light shining in the darkness, but other than that if you don't mind an extremely cheesy script and quite like Leann Rimes it might not be necessary to avoid it. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It ain't "The Wizard of Oz," but I still like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Jerry Bruckheimer committed to produce "Coyote Ugly," I don't think he was intending to remake "The Wizard of Oz" or "Gone With the Wind," widely regarded at two of the greatest movies of all time. And while I don't think "Coyote Ugly" is one of even the fifty greatest movies of all time, I did like it for what it was; a cute little movie that can lift your spirits when you're down.Violet Sanford, played by the heartbreakingly sexy Piper Perabo, decides to pick up and leave her smalltown New Jersey existence - much to the chagrin of her toll-booth operator father, played by John Goodman in a show-stealing performance - for the Big Apple for a shot at success in the music business. Once there, she finds out there's a lot more to it than simply having great songs. One night, she happens upon one "Mr." O'Donnell (or Kevin, played by Adam Garcia) and gives him her demo tape thinking he's in the biz. When it turns out that he's nothing more than a guy who works odd jobs, she gets disgusted when he won't leave her alone (she's so cute when she say "So, I'm going to say 'good night...'").After more meetings, a rather embarrassing, um, performance at an open-mike night (which we get to see her legendary stage fright) and being robbed, she happens upon three women, one of them who is saying goodbye to the other two, at an all-night eatery. "Are they hookers?" she asks excitedly. "No," says the dive owner as he hands her a matchbox with the name of a bar, the infamous "Coyote Ugly;" "They're coyotes!" She then decides to "audition" for the empty slot.Somehow, over time, she impresses the hard-as-nails owner Lil, played with /chutzpah/ by Maria Bello, formerly of "ER," with her way with rowdy New Yorkers ready to get into a fight over a girl, her ability to raise $250 in two minutes by auctioning off an intimate night with Kevin as a means of payback and saving her fellow waitresses from impending trouble by singing along to "One Way or Another" by Blondie on the jukebox. And while she falls in love with Kevin (who helps her get over her stage fright), she disappoints her father when he finds out that she's working at what he must believe is a strip bar, having seen his buddies at work putting her picture up in their toll-booth windows. I think that the screenplay could be written a little better (Gina Wendkos does a better job with "The Princess Diaries" in my opinion). But the directing here is adequate; and I feel that, all things considered, the movie is well-acted; Melanie Lynskey was cute as Violet's long-time, always loyal friend. It's quite interesting to see Bridget Moynihan and Tyra Banks, two models, cast in the movie, Moynihan as the sexy "New York b****" and Tyra Banks as the sexy law student (who I would have liked to have seen more of). I feel that both of them held their own. And Izabella Miko was hot as Cammie, "The Russian Tease!" I love the use of music throughout the film, including Violet's songs, which were actually written by Diane Warren, as well as the music played at the bar. Being of the male persuasion, I can't help but love the dance numbers with the Coyotes - love those outfits especially (even if it's really stunt dancers). And I can tolerate the sappy love story. Overall, this is a fun movie for anybody who needs to be cheered up (and who /doesn't/ these days!?).9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is a enjoyable movie. Piper Perabo plays Violet, a small town girl who moves to New York to become a song writer but ends up working in a bar. John Goodman plays her father and even though his role is small he is wonderful like he always is in his roles as is Melanie Lynskey who plays Violet's best friend Gloria. Those two are really what makes this movie work. Aussie Adam Garcia is also terrific as Kevin as is Maria Bello as Lil.This movie appeals to both males and females - males obviously for the coyotes and women for Adam Garcia. The sound track is brilliant as well with 4 songs performed by LeAnn Rimes and other artists and a definite must have as well. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yah, you betcha. These women are smart and strong; and that's why they're obsessed with self-serving slut fantasies. They like sensitive men; and that's why they pander to the puerile lust of drooling alcoholics. And the story, yeah buddy, is about as plausible and original as ... aww ta heck with it. It's really pretty pointless to try and criticize a movie with ambitions low enough to irritate a high school sophomore. So instead, I heartily recommend to the film's primary audience (14 year-old boys), that they order instead the "Girls Gone Wild" series. You get real sex and the plot and dialogue are at about the same level as in Coyote Ugly (and the girls are almost as hot). Why waste time on weak and sentimental drivel when for about the same price you can have three times the action and less than half the bs? I mean really. And if you still need any more convincing that Coyote Ugly is the cinematic equivalent of a Walmart Britney Spears poster, then consider that during it's initial video release, it was the top seller in Kansas. Case closed. Disclaimer: I am not suggesting that 14 year-old boys attempt to violate any laws regarding the illegal possession of restricted materials. If they don't already know their parent's hiding places, that's their problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is just another version of the old story: ?Interior girl dreams to be a singer, travels to New York to fulfill her dream. Things go wrong, and she ends up doing a completely different thing: a dancer in a night bar. The difference here is that we haven't seen a story like this lately, that's why it might seem new. Well, it isn't, but not totally avoidable, actually Coyote Ugly is quite enjoyable and entertaining: gorgeous women, sensually dancing, boys flirting, music, drama, comedy... it's like a funfair ? pretty much of everything. By the way: take a close look, at the end, at the clumsy handsome girl behind the bar (the one that takes the place of Jersey). Although she is not credited, her name is Melody Perkins, she is really cute, and will surely rock in the next project she'll be in! Take a close look! 6 out of 10Pros: The sexy dances, some music, the girls and the new coyote at the end: Melody PerkinsCons: The small role of Melody Perkins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I loved this movie! It was funny, entertaining, uplifting and had a great soundtrack. However others I talked to didn't think it was nearly as great, and maybe it's no great masterpiece but it is a really fun film. The story revolves around Violent Stanford (perfectly played by newcomer Piper Perabo), a small town girl who moves to New York to be a songwriter, but finds out its not as easy as it sounds. In New York, Violet gets a job at Coyote Ugly, a wild bar where the women dance around in skin tight clothes and pour water on them selves. As dirty as that sounds its actually not. There is no nudity and the dancing isn't that sexual, something that probably disappointed all the drooling men who went to see it in the theatres expecting another Showgirls. In fact the advertising for this film is quite misleading, there are only 4 main scenes that take place in the bar, the rest of the film focuses on Violet's struggling career, her romance with a dish washing Australian, and her father's disapproval with her job.Coyote Ugly was produced by that maker of masterpieces, Jerry Bruckheimer, and has drawn many comparisons to his 80's hit Flashdance. If you ask me though, this one is much better. The direction is slick, the stars are hot and the story is entertaining. See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfunctory entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder why many serious film critics go to the trouble of explaining in lengthy and clever reviews why "Coyote Ugly" is not a good film. What did they expect? What do they expect in general of mass-produced teen-targeted entertainment? To challenge, illuminate and move? To elevate the audience to a new esthetic climax? Are them critics familiar with with teens' tastes? I find such criticism superfluous, even self-indulgent. "Coyote Ugly" is simply an instance, undistinguished, of a vast and serious cultural issue. One can address the issue itself and use this movie as an illustration, but taking it at face value and analyzing it out of context is inappropriate. Movies like "Coyote Ugly" do not set out to deliver artistic or original or educational content; so it is unfair to reproach them the fact that they do not deliver such values."Coyote Ugly" is a successful movie both commercially and in that it seems to hit all the targets it aims at. This is the standard we should judge it by. Teen-targeted "dramas" could be judged, I propose, by technical merit alone: is the tempo of the movie high enough so that not to bore but low enough so that not to exhaust? are the actors beautiful and charismatic? are the characters simple enough not to create moral ambiguity but complex enough to be believable? is the story predictable enough so that not to challenge but reassure? Smashing soundtrack? Criteria such as these are more suitable. And I think "Coyote Ugly" delivers from this point of view. If there was, and I wonder why it isn't, an Academy Award category for perfunctory entertainment this movie would be a contender.</fullReview>

Please. I drive farther than that to work every day. Why can't she live at home and write songs and take the train into the city to peddle her songs. Oh, sorry. It was in the script. That's why. Even a hick that lives in Mississippi knows you don't just walk into Sony Music Publishing and say "Please please listen to my tape". And I know my girlfriends always sit around in greasy spoon diners in the middle of the night in NYC betting on fav movies of this month's centerfold. Of course, when you have robbers that know to look in the freezer for money but don't bother to steal "big-time-songwriter equipment" (or does she leave it on the roof of her apartment building rain OR shine?), I guess you don't worry about those things. Bottom line: If you don't have a penis or aren't a lesbian, there's not much reason to recommend this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, badly pulled off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer and reading a little about the film, I liked the premise of Coyote Ugly a lot - small town girl goes to work at some kind of hardcore bar. However, writer Gina Wendkos has simply delivered a sappy love story, with a slightly darker edge, characterised by the Coyote Ugly bar, and probably the influence of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, better known for his work on action films such as Con Air and Enemy Of The State.Now, this would have been my misunderstanding and me simply going to see the wrong movie if it were a good love story. However, the characters are hideously one dimensional (i.e. the audience knows nothing about the other two barmaids, Cammie and Rachel, both of whom seem to have leading roles, apart from their bar personalities). Even the protagonist's main development, the overcoming of her stage fright, doesn't really make any sense and seems to be a rushed conclusion rather than a gradual development.However, after criticising it, Coyote Ugly is moderately entertaining. The bar scenes in particular, not just because of the acres of female flesh on display, but also because of the excitement of these scenes and the whole concept of the bar itself. With this in mind, the scenes shot in the actual bar are the best of the whole film, coming off like a music video. This does work against the film in the conclusion however, with the last 5-10 minutes seeming to be more of a promo for the film's music single rather than actually concluding the film satisfactorily.Make no mistake about it, Coyote Ugly is entertaining, and even exciting in parts, but it's really just a cardboard story filled with one dimensional stock characters. 6/10</fullReview>

It could have with something with a bit more edge, considering the subject matter and setting of the film. It needed more a Boogie Nights kind of ending. Call me cynic, but that is what I think. The film at times resorts to lazy writing. The father (John Goodman) and Daughter (Piper Perabo) have fight after he finds out what she does. Goodman gets into some sort accident and winds up in the hospital. Through that things are patched up and all better. Too many films resort to that sort of thing to the characters back together. It is not very imaginative. The film could have found a different way to patch things up or have the less happy where everything all happy and gooey. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood at its worst (big, big spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer partnership, which had spawned such corkers as Crimson Tide and The Rock and such crap as Top Gun and Days of Thunder, was disrupted somewhat by the untimely death of Simpson in 1996. But aside from the company logo, nothing has changed on-screen since then. If proof of their soulless, mass-production technique was needed, this is surely it; with one half of the team dead, the artistic content hasn't changed in the slightest!Coyote Ugly, though a Bruckheimer solo project, has the worst features of the brainless 80s fantasies that were the team's trademark. It is a film so banal, so puerile and so immature, that it could have been written by its teenage target audience. Only a 13-year-old could be convinced by its glossy tale of hardship, only a 13-year-old could be surprised by its ending, or interested in anything that comes before it.The constantly pouting Piper Perabo plays Violet Sanford, a small-town gal who wants to make it in New York as a musician. Her dad doesn't want her to go because it's a scary place, but she moves anyway and finds success isn't as easy to come by as she'd imagined. It's genius, isn't it? You can imagine the writer suddenly being hit by inspiration, jumping for joy as the idea forms in her mind, realising this is a story that has never been seen before and simply has to be brought to life on the big screen, then waiting six hundred years for cinema to be invented.I've honestly never seen a movie so wholly dependent on cliché. There is literally nothing original in this film. That's not sarcasm, it's not petty sniping or an exaggeration; literally, actually, undeniably, nothing. Every last moment is predictable. Anyone surprised to find Perabo's apartment small and badly decorated has never seen a film before. Anyone amazed by the burglary or disappointed by her lack of success in the first few minutes is as stupid as people who think `Baby on Board' stickers actually prevent car accidents.For the pre-pubescent girls in the audience there is a love story shallow enough for them to relate to. The supposedly-charming Adam Garcia is the love interest, and the will-they won't-they tension that surrounds the fledgling couple is diminished slightly by him being the only man in the city she actually talks to! We should probably assume the script said there was chemistry between the two leads, but it never made it past the page - they are both gorgeous, and that seems to be enough to convince us they're a good couple that we should be rooting for. But this is a romance so infantile that when Perabo first meets Garcia, he follows her through the dark streets of New York at night, says he's staring at her ass, and she finds it charming!There are attempts at gritty realism and at showing the hardship and heartbreak of having your ambitions frustrated, but these don't last beyond the second reel. This is Bruckheimer, and realism was never on the agenda. The few scenes that show us the bad breaks in the big city are followed by a cheesy ending and a happily-ever-after for the lead characters that render them insincere. It follows the three-act structure precisely, giving us first the ambition, then the hard times, then the triumph. I yawned my way through all three.This movie should be held up as the example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. It's cynically unoriginal, painfully infantile, constantly banal, and so vacuous it could suck the audience out of their seats and into the screen. There are so many reasons to hate this stodgy turd. Seeing Garcia buy rare Spiderman comics in a diner is one of them; seeing the character whose soul purpose is to ask what Coyote Ugly means is another; and suffering the shameless cameo of LeAnn Rimes singing the crappy theme song is the most irritating. I hate this movie, I resent it wasting a hundred minutes of my life, and the only thing more annoying than a film so ruthlessly efficient, so pointless and so banal, are the preteen idiots who actually like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This long awaited picture had trailers that really pulled at the heartstrings of women and men everywhere. I am sure that staring at the trailers for this movie, most of your average moron teenagers thought this movie was a wonderful idea and couldn't wait to attend the first screening of this movie. However, I sat riveted in my seat staring at an unbelievably frightening preview of what Jerry Bruckheimer had to throw at the American public. I built up an immediate bias against the movie and vowed never to see it.Enter the girlfriend....It is impossible to tell your girlfriend that a movie is bad without ever having seen it because she will always come back with the "how do you know if you've never seen it?" No amount of rational explanation would make sense (go figure - they're women). So, I swallowed every last bit of loathing I had for this movie and its peak (the just-as-frightening cameo of LeAnn Rimes) and chased it with a few glasses of Myers's Rum.And, without further duress, I can without fail tell my girlfriend that she owns the most horrid piece of video known to man or woman. The sappiness and overstated plot was not to be outdone by the flaunting of women on a bar in tight, unimaginative clothing. Whether this movie was marketed towards men or women is hard to say, but the fact that neither sex could possibly enjoy this useless drivel is clear fact.1) The idea that some girl is going to head to NY to make it as a songwriter is as bland and flavorless as Cream of Wheat. Thousands of artists head to the Apple daily to watch their dreams shattered and take to the pipe or something. While this movie was supposed to be based around this girl's success and hardship, all I found was that the writer and director knew very little about the music business and built a ridiculous fantasy for millions of idiot children to belive in. Watch out NY, more "musicians" headed your way. To the plethora reviewers that said that this movie was an awakening to the works of the music business: try walking outside your front door. NO business accepts the kind of ideas this movie is trying to push and the music industry is no different.2) The over-produced storyline is apparent from the beginning. If you can't see past the formula used to put this movie together you're either deaf and watching an uncaptioned version of the movie (if you were lucky) or this is the first time you've been introduced to "moving pictures."3) The acting in this movie... wow - since it seems that we are limited to 1,000 words in this review, I'll just leave this to one word: whorendous. yes, i misspelled that...Well, it seems that I must depart and pick up my girlfriend and take her to the mall. Maybe we can find some more amazingly absurd pieces of entertainment... Pokemon is still "in", right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my kind of bar...but it has its moments!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David McNally's directorial debut, Coyote Ugly, is basically a story about Violet (Piper Perabo) trying to establish her singing career in New York. She soon finds that the Big Apple is harder than she imagined, and finds herself broke and desperate for a job. She acquires one at the hottest, raunchiest bar in town, aptly titled the 'Coyote Ugly', where she has to dance, spin bottles and basically keep the customers happy. Throw in a love interest, Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who encourages Violet to overcome her stage fright and pursue her singing career. Then add her father's (John Goodman) disapproval of her job at Coyote Ugly, and you've basically got the plot.Coyote Ugly is a film that is targeted mainly at teens and is extremely predictable in most areas. The subject is far-fetched, for I doubt I'd attend a bar and risk getting my hair cut off or being doused in water, and I also doubt that four girls and one bouncer could control a massive crowd or serve them well- especially when the staff constantly break into dance on the actual bar itself! That aside, there is some bad dialogue and awkward moments, but the film isn't as trashy as the trailers imply. The film attempts to have substance with it's romantic angle, John Goodman is entertaining as Violet's protective but kind father and the rest of the cast provide adequate performances. Coyote Ugly is far from a spectacular film, the climax is extremely weary and predictable, and the last scene is fairly stupid. But in general, Coyote Ugly is a fairly decent teen popcorn flick, and can be entertaining if you don't take it too seriously! **1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Jerry Bruckenheimer also helped produced Flashdance, I suppose it's okay to rip off yourself - but it's not exactly like ripping off Hitchcock.This is an excellent 30-minute movie - unfortunately, the actual running time is much longer. However, if you've seen more than 10 movies, you can tell exactly when to fast forward and the movie is like a pleasant music video with one cliche after another.And in some aspects, it's so ludicrous that you do have to stop and watch it unfold - in a bar where the bartenders: dance on the bar; perform pole dances; girl-on-girl dances; hose either other off and; practically strip ? Piper's character is apparently so captivating that she is able to stop a Navy tailhook-like gang-molestation and a full scale bar riot by singing along to a jukebox.Maybe it's the water-downed drinks at Coyote Ugly but for us, the viewer, her "captivation" eludes us. We're just left to ponder all the scenes they threw out so they could have this grand turning point.On the bright side - I'm glad Piper got the gap between her front teeth fixed - her acting is less distracting. She's pleasant enough and so is everyone else but this is a story we can all come up after being yanked out of our beds in the middle of the night.Quick - her dad is a blue collar worker who hears his daughter wants to move to New York to become a songwriter - how does he react?Quick - what happens when she tried to submit her songs to record companies &amp; publishers?Quick - what role will she fill in a bar where the bartenders are just adjectives: hostile biker chick, slut, black girl and acting-tough boss?Humm, I wonder. Well, that's about as much thought as Jerry Bruckenheimer put into the plot of this movie. In theory, this movie was directed by somebody but it not very apparent.Oh, and Michael Bay shows up as a photographer and proves he's as good an actor as he is a director. But I guess he gets his SAG card and he can certain use the $600 dollars (or whatever the minmum is now) to offset his 2 years on Pearl the Harbor.See it on cable after you TIVO or tape it - do not spend more than 30 minutes of your life on your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than you would think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is definitely a movie that you wouldn't expect much from, but surprises you along the way.I must say this was my first time seeing Piper Perabo, and she completely amazed me for a little known and little experienced actress. Only unfortunate thing is that she didn't sing in the movie. Jerry Bruckheimer thought that her voice "was too low". But what the hell? Didn't effect the movie at all because, you really believed it was her singing. I couldn't tell. Anyway, she was perfect for this role, gracing it with the sincerity and innocence it needed, to become believable as the small-town girl, trying to make it in the big city as a song writer. Definitely expect great performances from her in the future.Maria Bello was great and believable in her "strong-woman" role as the owner of the Coyote Ugly bar. Andy Garcia also surprised me, with a decent performance as Violet Sanford's love interest in the film. John Goodman stood out with a surprisingly decent comedic role as Violet's overweight father. And as for Tyra Banks ... well, she was OK, i guess. Didn't mind her that much, although the only reason she's in this movie is for a little star power to grace the movie posters and trailers.All in all, the movie was decent. For me, the highlights were Piper Perabo "singing" and her scenes with Andy Garcia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it - even if only to drool over Adam Garcia!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Myself and my friend had wanted to see this movie for ages!! We had tried to hire it from the video shop (unfortunately never got the chance to see it at the cinema!) numerous times in which we had no luck but we have finally seen it and I can't wait to buy it on video!!!My friend and I both agreed it was a very 'cheesy' and predictable movie but still so enjoyable! It kept me interested the whole way through and had a brilliant soundtrack (I suppose it had to have considering the storyline!!!)I thought it was very funny too!! I thought 'Kevin' was gorgeous and so lovely!! All the things he did for 'Violet' and all the patience he had with her was heroic!!! I only wish I could find someone exactly like him!! This is one of those films where you wish you were the main character, in this case 'Violet', who is so pretty and skinny, gets the 'perfect' man, has such talent in her writing and singing, has what seems like a brilliant job and has such wonderful family and friends!! It's just not fair!!!I really really enjoyed it and I watched twice in the same day (once with my friend and once with my brother - who is very hard to please as he loves action films with lots of blood and guts! but even he enjoyed this one!) I am even going to rent it out again so my other friend can watch it with me and so I can show her how gorgeous 'Mr O'Donnell' is!!! There is something just so cute about him! I saw Adam Garcia perform in the stage show 'Saturday night fever' and I thought he looked stupid with his quiff and tight silver tights!! but this film showed that he is a stud muffin (once you minus the quiff and tights!!!) I can't wait for it to come out on video so I can rush out and buy it!I recommend it to everyone who likes a bit of 'cheese' in their films!! Adam Garcia was gorgeous and is now added to my list of favourite actors along with Ben Affleck and David Boreanaz!!! As I said in the summary - 'Go and watch it even if it is just to drool over Adam Garcia! It's worth it!!!!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw adds for this movie I thought it was going to be like a border line porn flick but then a friend of mine rented it and he said I would really like and to watch it. So after some debate I did. He was so right! This was a fantastic film.Violet Sanford is a small town New Jersey girl who moves to New York City to pursue her dream of being a song writer. When she gets there she finds out it's not as easy as it seems. After approaching all the music studios with her tape she finds that no one will even listen. She goes to this club and meet Kevin this cook that she thinks is a big music director. She gives him her tape and learns, after he's already got her tape he's not who she thinks he is. She's completely upset and then comes home to find that her shabby apartment has been broken into and the money her friend gave her is gone. She goes to a diner almost broke and very depressed and that's where she sees them--The Coyotes. The guy behind the counter tell her where they work and she goes there and gets hired. At first she has trouble keeping the job because she's very shy. She almost got fired 2 times then she goes back to get the tape from Kevin and he asks to see her again. He wants to know where she works and all she will tell him is that she's a coyote. Well he finds her and with his help and their blossoming love for each other she finds her way. It an amazing film with wonderful party and dance sequences as well as a good love story. It's a story of finding yourself and finding success in the big city. It's also got that element of love that I so love to watch. It's a great movie, definitely worth the time.</fullReview>

And as for the movie, I hope it wins every Razzie award possible then after Movie Gallery, Blockbuster, and Hollywood Video wont carry it anymore, All of their copies are sold to low rent hole-in-the wall video stores where no one ever goes to.

		<fullReview>This movie is nothing like the trailers would have you believe. A very predictable little tale about a girl who comes to the big city to chase her dreams. There is truly nothing remarkable about this picture. No rough edges, no risky stuff, no violence (unless you want to qualify the "bar-fights" as violence, a few guys pushing each other...please). The conversations between Piper Perapo and Adam Garcia drove me nuts after a while. Stop the charming crap already! This is not how people talk! And Perapo's only talent seems to lie in the fact that she knows how to look really really sad. Boohoo! Don't expect to see any kind of excess here (remember Bruckheimer is behind this), this is a gushy romantic tale without any merit whatsoever. Your grandmother would fall asleep watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a good heart. I'll give it that. The trouble is that said heart is buried under several acres of unpleasant, filthy, sweaty flesh. Adding an empty-headed, unsympathetic heroine was also a mistake.SPOILERSIt starts out as a "little girl hits the big city" story, and indeed the theme from the Mary Tyler Moore show would not be an inappropriate theme song. Violet moves to New York with dreams of becoming a lyricist. The music industry rewards her for her fresh-faced optimism by crushing her like an insect under their collective heel. Her apartment is robbed. Even when she has a chance to perform her song at a "get discovered" nightclub, she balks when one idiot starts heckling her. Finally a waiter gives her a hint that a handsome Australian working at the diner at which she is eating is a mogul and wants to hear her demo tape.Alas, it was all a cruel jest and the fellow is actually a short-order cook. He immidiately sees the setup, and tries to let Violet down lightly, but she gets mad and storms off. How is this his fault?Eventually, Violet sees a bunch of tramps who seem to be pretty well off, and a series of events lead her to Coyote Ugly, where the scantily-clad waitresses dance on the counter to the delight of the inebriated patrons. Of course, this is the perfect springboard for an aspiring songwriter, n'est-ce pas? After accidentally hosing down the fire marshall (long story), Violet must make enough money to pay the fine. How? Our hapless Aussie has returned with the demo tape that he forgot to return, and Violet gets revenge for his kindness by auctioning him off (prostituting him, really) to the highest bidder. (Maybe Coyote Ugly would have a bit more money on their hands if they would stop wasting alcohol by using it to set the bar on fire and pouring it all over the waitresses.) To whom do our sympathies go?In any event, Violet retains her job as a Coyote while her "boyfriend" tirelessly and without a complaint tries to get Violet a leg up in the music industry. When a scuffle breaks out, Violet calms them with a song, which is pretty high on the Big List of Stuff that Only Happens In the Movies and learns to conquer her stage fright.But why make Violet so hard to sympathise with? When her boyfriend sets up an artificial audience to rehearse in front of, all Violet wants to do is take off her clothes and seduce him. Finally she performs her song practically in the nude, save a curtain-like drapery.In the end, once again at the "get discovered" nightclub, Violet balks yet again, merely because the same idiot is back. Only after one of her coyote friends decks him and her boyfriend turns out the lights (she performs best in the dark) does she continue. Why is she so inhibited all of a sudden? Maybe she could do it if she took her shirt of and poured booze all over herself.Violet's poor Aussie friend is tireless and devoted, and hardly gets a scrap of thanks. Instead, he gets auctioned off, insulted, and stood up, even when he puts his prized possession on the line and almost loses it. Violet even auctions off her FATHER at the very end for no logical reason at all. How sweet!Perhaps the moviemakers realized how featherweight this all is, for they plastered the adds with nothing but dance footage. Indeed, this movie sinks pretty low to keep the audience's attention. When Violet is shopping for clothes, the camera lingers on her silhouette, just in case you were planning on going to the bathroom or the refund booth. A completely pointless scene shows a baseball game. Why? So we can see just a little more cleavage in a place where people may have realized how pithy this movie truly is.But still, the saving grace is John Goodman as Violet's father. (Is it me, or is Goodman getting better as he gets older?) He can be funny and heartful at just the right times, and his character is a good one. Otherwise it's all fluff.There are some parts of the movie that are stupid, illogical, and smutty, and there are parts the are cute, touching and funny. When this movie is good, it is very, very good, and when it is bad it is horrid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie when it first came out in America. Why? Coz it looked different, no matter what others say.Unfortunately I live in a British island where the cinema only accepts the biggest blockbusters, and this didn't mean Coyote Ugly - so I had to wait until the rental date to see it. Thankfully, the movie was well worth the wait as . it's entertainment value is totally 10/10.I was expecting a lot, but what I received was more than I had hoped for which is rare in a majority of films today. It is perfect Saturday night entertainment that is filled with plenty of fresh faces to keep the audience guessing. Since participating as an audience member of this particular picture, I have become a die hard fan of Adam Garcia/Izabella Miko.However, the movie's only downfall is the lack of history of the 'Coyotes'. A little more screen time for Lil, Cammie and Rachel wouldn't have hurt but the movie still rocked.The script was smooth and travelled at a leisurely pace that enabled the audience (or any Coyote Ugly Movie fan) to become absorbed within the film's plot.Over all, a fantastic movie that can make you cuddle up to your loved one or get up and pull out the moves for the wicked soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie was VERY derivative of Cocktail. I don't mind movies borrowing plot elements from other films but Coyote Ugly went a bit far. Also, I found the characters and situations totally implausible. You have this guy who works these odd jobs and yet somehow manages to afford a really cool convertible. Yeah, sure. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Piper Perapo and Adam Garcia and none of the characters were really developed enough so that the viewer could care about them. In summary, except for a few laughs, I really didn't care much for this movie.</fullReview>

But it seemed like a lot of fun. Anyways, my wife and I just rented the DVD the other night, and we both thought it was a superb movie.It is not just a bunch of totally hot women dancing and grinding on a bar (which that would have been fine), but there is a very well developed, "coming into your own" story followind Violet, the movies lead. She moves to NYC to fulfill her dreams of becoming a songwriter. She meets a handsome Aussie, whom she is under the impression is a big music mogel. However, she finds out he is only a cooks in a restaurant, plus about 3 other jobs. (the man doesn't sleep). Anyway, the plot moves along nicely, a few areas that you can tell the editor left out. Which is always a shame.Anyway, this is something to watch and own. I was very impressed with the outcome of the movie, though very typical for this type of film.

		<shortDescription>A guilty pleasure, I guess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I wasn't stuck for 30 hours without food, I wouldn't have watched Coyote Ugly. I probably wouldn't have missed much, but it was an okay movie, I guess.Piper Perabo plays a young woman who lives with her her father in a small town in Jersey. Violet (that's her name) wants to move to New York to become a songwriter. She arrives there, and she has a idyllic view of New York. She goes around trying to give her tape. Finally she gives it to "Mr. O'Donnell" who is supposedly the manager of a club. He isn't. He's a lowly cook who wants to do something good, but Violet finds out and gets pissed at him. He gets a date with her, but she won't tell him where she works (because she doesn't have a job). Violet then gets robbed and has only a few bucks left. She goes to a restaurant and sees some women, dressed in sexy clothes and literally rolling in money. Turns out they're Coyotes, waitresses in a popular bar called Coyote Ugly. Violet goes for an audition and subsequently becomes a Coyote.I dismissed this at first as a movie that would be about 3/4 filled with half-naked women dancing (not a bad thing) but since the very beginning, it took on the forms of a chick flick! I sat patiently, waiting for the aforementioned scenes. Then something weird happened. I got drawn into the story. No, the plot isn't original. It's generic, cliched and you can pretty much know what'll happen.It wasn't really the acting, either. Perabo does an above-average job, but she's not "good" good. She's just good. The other actors try the best, but the result is minimal except for one person. John Goodman, the world's most famous big man, has a small but important role as Violet's father. He's not really doing anything much different than what he did on Roseanne, or in previous movies, but that's the way we like him, uh-huh uh-huh we like him.Another good part was the music. Yes, LeAnn Rimes is here a lot and once or twice Perabo breaks out into an inexplicable musical number (once while seeing a guy exercising in the apartment next door). While not long and generally painless, these are unnecessary. However, the music that plays helps achieve the vigorous feeling of the movie.The movie tries to mix comedy, drama, chick-flick and musical. It doesn't really succeed perfectly but the comedy sequences are mostly worthwhile. As mentioned above John Goodman is very good and Perabo has her moments, too.It's obvious that Coyote Ugly is no masterpiece. The acting isn't very good. The plot, while servicable, does nothing different. The "romantic" scenes are heavy-handed and awkward. And yet, this movie isn't too bad. It's watchable in the same way that you watch a Saturday morning cartoon. I feel sort of strange giving this relatively high ranking to a movie of such doubtful quality, but I sort of liked it. Maybe you will, too. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ah the irony of it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that unintentionally, I think, describes itself. During one of the big "soul searching" scenes, the male lead tells the female lead that she thinks she's pursuing her dream, but all she's really doing is shaking her body on a bar.Well...the main attraction of this movie seems to be half a dozen beautiful women, in various scanty outfits, getting doused on a bar for a crowd of cheering men. It makes a valiant effort at being about something and the characters are engaging and enthusiastically portrayed, but ultimately there is too much focus on bouncing breasts and bared midsections.One thing I will definitely give credit for, though...it would have been VERY easy to fill the movie with gratuitous nudity and, as near as I recall, there isn't any at all. I think it's admirable that the filmmakers resisted the urge to go for the cheap thrills and let the film degenerate into "Porkys 7" or "Showgirls". This is a film that tries hard to be more than Tyra Banks' cleavage but ultimately that's what the fans are there to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ughh-ly. But, unexpected pluses from Goodman and Bello.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected nothing from Coyote Ugly, and it would be tempting to say that's what it delivered, but I suppose that's not strictly true. The script was intended as a "small-town-girl goes to big city and tries to make it big" story, but was heavily side-tracked by a sappy teen-style romance, not to mention the girl's commitment to her big old clinging but lovable father, and every little friendship she makes along the way. Throw in a supposedly congenital case of stage-fright, and I'm afraid it came off less like "A Star is Born" and more like a really mediocre tv movie. Except... John Goodman, as big old softie Dad, was as good or better than ever. Ask the man to play a caricature, give him a third-rate director, and he still comes across as not only believable, but consistently FUNNY. It's not a big enough part that he could rescue this muddle, but it is enough to make it almost worth watching just for him.Reviewing the IMDB ratings by demographic group, it's clear that the romance was quite effective, the highlight of the movie, for young female viewers, and it's easy to see why. Piper Perabo is bright and pretty and very good in the part of the nervous hopeful, and you can't help but root for her smart and occasionally spunky character. Adam Garcia, the young Australian actor who plays her young Australian emigree suitor, gets to take his shirt off and dance on the bar, but it's the character's dedication and loyalty which probably hits the buttons of those who enjoyed this movie. Guys weren't as impressed, likely because the direction was so inept and shallow that we couldn't feel any kinship with him, and the character comes across as too much of a wise-ass to us. The women dancing on the bar, and bottle-jockeying sequences were quite enjoyable, but they have only a tenuous connection to the rest of the story. They don't seem to be directed by the same director as the rest of the movie. The idea, of course, is that we're supposed to see Perabo's character grow and mature during her tenure there, but I'm not so sure the sequences work as well as intended.The strongest female character in the movie is Lil, the owner of the bar, played by Maria Bello, who looks more than a little like Sharon Stone, and plays a part worthy of her. In a way, this is another problem for the movie, because she distracted from the sex-appeal of Perabo. While it wasn't much of a movie, the part that Goodman didn't steal pretty much belonged to Bello, in my book. I definitely want to see more of her, uhhh, work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is the main purpose of a movie? To entertain a group of people in a pitch-dark room for a couple of hours or so. Now, Coyote Ugly has been one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while, mostly due to the fact that it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, whose movies always seem to entertain. Forget about the critics reviews, forget about the unoriginality, and forget about the predictability. This movie has great actors (including the beautiful Piper Perabo, the cool Adam Garcia, and the funny John Goodman) and its all-out fun and entertainment. In my opinion, the movies aren't for so-called movie critics or intellects to bash and say a movie sucked because it was unoriginal.

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about something you don't even see in the trailers and will appeal to both women who like REALLY good looking men and the many dreamers who love to dream. It is about an aspiring songwriter who takes a job in one of New York's hottest bars to pay the bills and falls for an INCREDIBLY good looking guy (Mr. O'Donnell or something, who's paying attention to the name when their watching? ;-)). Anyway, anyone who likes movie musicals as much as I do will LOVE this movie. Give it a shot, you might just like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't want to watch this movie but they made me and now I am glad they did, because it was really really good, not stupid at all, like everyone says. No it was a really super, terrific movie with a good plot and good acting and good directing and it kept me interested through out. I think it deserves a nine out of ten and the only reason I don't give it ten out of ten is because Julia Roberts isn't in it. It was so good that I watched it ten times in a row, and I would have watched it even if they hadn't tied me to the chair. Go out and rent it right away. Better yet, buy a copy. Then you will have it forever. Maybe buy an extra copy for your friends to borrow or in case yours melts or something.Seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a surprise little movie!! My husband rented this and I must admit, I wasn't too excited to sit down and watch it with him! Am I ever glad I did. This certainly isn't my typical type of movie, but it was very well acted, had a good plot and was all around very entertaining! It's light hearted while still showing a glimpse into the harsh reality of trying to break into show business. The bar scenes were fun without being raunchy, no nudity, no bad language - just wild and crazy and fun! The love story line was nice and the hunk from down under makes this movie fun for women to watch while your man is watching all the bartop dancing. It's not Oscar caliber but it is definitely worth the rental!! I'd give it a solid 7 or 8!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previews for this movie didn't leave much of an impression on me. I remember thinking that this might be an ok movie to see, but I didn't put very high on my list of movies to see. Even after a co-worker said that he and his wife had gone to one of the first screenings in our area and both had really enjoyed it, I didn't make any special effort to see it in the theater. But last night at Blockbuster, I said "What the heck..." In the end, I was mildly surprised, and enjoyed the movie. There isn't anything special about the plot...girl moves to big city to pursue her dreams, reality sets in, girl meets boy, girl falls in love, girl faces some adversity, girl overcomes adversity and things start to fall into place. Yet, the plot works well for this movie. I found myself being drawn into the story. The casting was well done, I felt all the actors did a good job of filling their parts. The cinematography was visually stimulating without being over the top or relying on any nudity...yes there is a fair amount of skin flashed but not enough to push the rating over PG-13. Add to all this a well rounded soundtrack, and you get a movie that is fun and energetic.All in all, I enjoyed this movie. I may even watch it again before it is due.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People, It's a MOVIE...it's not meant to change the world or your point of view. It's called Entertainment. Does anyone remember what that is? Not every movie or book has to have "Deeper Meaning." And just because it doesn't have any hidden meanings or deep moral dilemmas (or an original plot) doesn't mean it's a waste of your time. Just because you're a grown up doesn't mean you have to stop hanging upside down from the monkey bars. The people in this movie are having a Good Time (at least they do a really good imitation of it and isn't that an actor's main objective?) and if you just quit being serious for a minute, you can have a good time watching it. Personally, I want to leave a movie in a good mood....I can stay home and clean my bathroom on a Saturday night if I want to get depressed. So if you liked it, don't hang your head, you're not shallow and unsophisticated, you just remember what it's like to play on the swings and stay up past your bedtime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a story we've all heard before - girl from Hicksville moves to New York to make it big in songwriting. Girl finds New York hard to break, girl meets boy, boy falls in love with girl, girl gets a couple of breaks (not the songwriting ones that she was hoping for thought), girl eventually falls in love with boy, songwriting career falls to the back burner. Girl realises dreams are not being realised, girl gets ticked off with boy, boy gets the flick, both are miserable. While girl is miserable she does something to realise dream. Dream is realised, credits roll. End of movie.There is no serious thought needed to see this film. Plenty of beautiful people to look at - which satisfies both the men (all the dancing chicks at the bar) and ladies (Adam Garcia ... phwor!!!) alike. A marked departure from the action flicks that Bruckheimer normally produces and it works reasonably well, albeit in a sugar sweet way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie was terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote ugly is a recent installment of a series of movies by Jerry Bruckheimer that lacks originality and, worse yet, is just plain predictable. In short, it's a bad version of Flashdance.Anyone who has any sense of plot sees from the start of the movie that the star--Violet--is going to make it to big time after undergoing a growth process where she learns to kick her stage fright and be the star she was allegedly born to be.This movie is just bad. For one thing, Bruckheimer, who has made a few decent movies in his career, would have you think that a star is born when Violet karyokes to Blondie's "One Way or Another" song. Bruckheimer wants you to think that Violet's moment is special, once in a lifetime--watching a girl katyoke to a song should be retired to the dustbins of overplayed top 40 hits.Violet's boyfiend, played by Adam Garcia, is a bizarre character. His presence in the movie is awkward. Perhaps he was aiming too low in appearing in this movie. Judged by his natural feel for acting, Garcia has a promising future and, as such, should avoid duds like Coyote Ugly.Why John Goodman? What possessed him to be in this movie? Goodman really was the shining star in this movie, nothwithstanding a respectable performance by Garcia. One would almost assume that Bruckheimer used Goodman to lend some credibility to this wannabe Flashdance disaster.Do NOT see Coyote Ugly. It's dull, predictable, and downright stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie. Not because it had a believable plot, rich characters, witty dialogue or standout performances. It didn't. But what this movie did have was energy, a catchy soundtrack and a large dose of fun. From the trailers, the movie didn't appear to have a plot. I was surprised to find that it did, albeit a very weak one. Had this plot been handled by a more experienced screenwriter or a producer other than Bruckheimer, this movie may have been better received by the movie going population and may have elevated itself above the "Pathetically Cheesy" category. Taking all this into consideration, the movie is still an enjoyable watch....one of those "Bad but Fun" movies. The catchy soundtrack, rowdy dance scenes and the adorable performance of Adam Garcia (Mr. O'Donnell...comic book collector extraordinaire) are what saved this movie for me. As a kid, I enjoyed the likes of Flashdance, Dirty Dancing and Footloose....all dance movies with great music to keep your feet tapping and will leave you singing the tunes for days afterward. Coyote Ugly, while not as good as the above mentioned films, is still a guilty pleasure.So when the credits rolled and the chorus of "Man, that sucked" resounded throughout the room, I just kept my mouth shut....You won't tell anyone, will you??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Country girl moves to the big city to chases her dreams and meets a boy in the process." Sounds a little cliched doesn't it? I expected this to be a shallow feel-good film that was only worthy of watching on video. How pleasantly surprised I was. Finally a non-sci-fi American movie that's not about life somewhere in L.A.!This is a good solid story. Not that this sort of coming-of-age thing hasn't been done many times before. It was the style with which it was exectued that caught my notice.The all-American Piper Perabo playing the lead role of Violet `Jersey' Stanford was convincing consistently throughout the film. There's a lot of talent there. John Goodman was his usual brilliant self, although this role wasn't one where he could really stretch his wings. He's proven his talents many times before in roles such as `Walter Sobchak' in The Big Lebowsky.The soundtrack is impressively not too focused on all the latest hits which was good. Classic songs by INXS and EMF gave film a real kick. The cameo appearance of Leanne Rimes wasn't overly obtrusive. It had the potential to be extremely corny, but I think they got away with it. Strange how Violet's otherwise beautiful songwriting turned into something a bit more Britney-Spears-ish when it came to the final song performance scene.Unlike most other American films which include an Australian character, it was pleasing to note that at last they didn't write all those cheesy "That's not a knife" lines in. This guy was just playing himself. The Australian-isms were all very natural and true to life. And thank goodness there was no need for him to do any lines in an American accent - there's nothing more embarrasing to watch on the big screen.The sets and shots of New York City were nicley done and not too gratuitous. (i.e. There was no Empire State, Statue of Libery, etc..) Some nice lighting effects in the grimy apartment buildings.All in all a very well executed film. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Right from the start you are bombarded with cliches; and they don't let up either. The moral of the story is literally rammed down your throat - I'm surprised that this movie wasn't made by Disney. By the end of it I was very disappointed - not because of the lack of chick action but the serious lack of originality. I thought it was crap. I've seen it all before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just think, it cost a total of $250,000 to make "Clerks". How the hell did they spend $45 Million to make this glorified music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see... I know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything.Anyway, it wasn't an awful film I guess. The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 Million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For lovers of intelligence, wit, subtlety and originality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A warning: stay light years away from any location showing this piece of cinematic trash. Sure, it's not aiming for originality, realistic (or at least believable) character development or intelligent insight; however, for the amount of money one has to pay for the wonderful privilege of viewing this waste of celluloid, the viewer does not need to add "insult to one's intelligence" to the already huge pile of grievances that can be shoveled onto this festering canker sore of a movie. Not that anyone attached to the film cares: they've already made their money off the poor unwitting persons who were dragged to see it by now-former friends. I object most strongly to this movie because it "teaches," in its mad dash for saps' cash, that being cute and showing your navel is all that's needed to be happy and successful in this world; that and a man, of course.Strangely enough, the movie does have several redeeming qualities, besides the fact that it ends and its dialogue is easy to mock. Maria Bello and John Goodman do quite well at pulling what little good they can find out of their material. As for Jersey's singing subplot, the fact that Piper Perabo's singing voice is dubbed in by LeAnn Rimes, who herself then appears in the diegesis, is just the last insult on the aforementioned pile. It almost seems as though the record deal for this picture was so lucrative that it actually affected the plot line.Of all the warm memories I will have about this film, the heckling will stand out most; the saddest part of it was thinking about all the money and material that was wasted to make this picture. That, and seeing the great Bud Cort being relegated to a throwaway bit part.So go ahead; throw your money, not to mention your brain and your egalitarian sensibilities, away. Watch Coyote Ugly; make Jerry Bruckheimer that much richer. He needs it; you and charities don't.</fullReview>

However, I bet you must of them would be surprised because this movie actually has a story-line, and one that's not too shabby, to say the least.A girl moves from New Jersey to New York to start a music career, not your average fairy tale, but it works. Piper Pueblo, shines through as the young woman who's trying to make it to the big time in a big city that's all new to her. The movie takes you through her struggles and successes as she reaches so hard for her dreams. Supporting actors also raise this movie's potential with Adam Garcia being the handsome man in her life, as well as John Goodman who is cast as her dad, and always gives the audience some good laughs.At about halfway through, I'm sure most guys would have been pulled into the plot and what the characters have to offer instead of the arousing bar scenes which appeared in a very misleading trailer. So, in short, an interesting movie that's definitely worth a watch, and I promise it'll send you out with a smile!!! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard that this movie was not what it appeared to be before I sat down to watch it. So I was not surprised when it turned out to be a drama romance. In critiquing this film I, therefore, will not have to talk about how wonderfully delighted I was to find that it had some substance. Or how nice it is that it was not as bad as I thought it would be. You see, it is after all a bad movie. I think I understand the advertising angle on this one. If it had been touted as a drama romance people would have expected more. Instead they pushed the T&amp;A, and let word get around that it was not as bad as the trailers attest.This movie is a 'girl goes to the big city to make it big' movie with the inevitable charming, city-smart boy along for the ride. Nothing wrong with it at all, for a lowest common denominator, nice little story movie. I rate it at a four out of ten, a four for "not great, not horrible, don't bother."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for Coyote Ugly I couldn't really believe it was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. He usually makes action movies(with strange yellow lighting and a catchy piece of music) and I wouldn't expect him to create romantic movie on how tough life in the big city can be, even if you pursue your dreams. I liked the fact that they picked Piper Perabo as the main character. She has the potential to become a pretty good actress. The problem with the movie is that it's not really heading anywhere. It's just a story about a succesful bar in the "Big City". Of course there is the love story, but I found that fairly predictable. John Goodman is a real cool father by the way, without him the movie wouldn't have been as funny. Despite the lack of storyline it's still a pretty nice feel-good movie!</fullReview>

Rather, there were strength and courage in the Coyotes' endeavours in a rough and tumble world. They were just doing a job like any of us and were they good at it. Above all, I came out of the theatre feeling a sense of empowerment as this was a movie all about realising and celebrating feminism in all its curves and beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly has elements of everything including a likeable, easygoing storyline, amazing visual effects, uplifting soundtrack and a collection of characters within the plot which are hard to not care about. The one factor which does appear obvious is that the film does not appear to go too deeply into anything such as its plot, characters etc etc, but who cares?? I have now seen Coyote twice and enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. Recommended for both sexes alike, the men will particularly enjoy the former models which set the bar alight (and not only with the aid of liquor and matches). Definitely a DVD purchase, when in need of something to lift me out of a bad mood this feelgood film will certainly help. The cast put in strong performances, especially Maria Bello as the ambitious Lil and John Goodman as Violet's comical father. Kevin O'Donnell will now no doubt carve a niche as a new heart-throb and rightly so, he's one fit geezer. All in all Coyote Ugly is no masterpiece of film-making but an excellent all round attempt, which I would recommend finding the time to go and see before it leaves the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok this movie was great. I went in to see it for all the wrong reasons and ended up loving it for the right ones. This movie shows the viewer how tough getting a break in the music business is basically. For those expecting nudity...you'll be disappointed. The soundtrack rules, the direction is fantastic (what else can you expect from bruckheimer) and the girls are beautiful. the cameo by Michael Bay director of Armageddon was cool. Generally the film will leave you in a good mood. I wish there were more films like this. The highlight of the film toward the end (which I will not spoil) is one of those moments that gets the hairs on your back standing upright erected and that moment alone is worth seeing the movie twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your basic struggling artist makes it big (or at least is a success) story, but quite well done.The trailers are not particularly reflective of the movie, so don't expect to see 90 minutes of babes dancing on bar tops, though happily that aspect isn't stinted upon either. Everyone in this movie is easy on the eyes and likeable, especially our heroine Violet (Piper Perabo). John Goodman adds some nice light comedic touches. It would have been nice to include the bar owner, Lil, a bit more.The soundtrack is mostly solid rock music, and Violet's singing is sweet and catchy, I was humming tunes all the way on the cycle home. The soundtrack CD might be worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing ugly about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of how it was marketed, "Coyote Ugly" features a surprisingly deep storyline about a young woman from New Jersey, following her dreams of becoming a songwriter in New York. Along the way, she finds work at a local bar--Coyote Ugly. This experience not only gives her the confidence to work harder towards her goal, but allows her to conquer some of her demons.Piper Perabo stars as Violet, a girl from small town New Jersey. Her mother was a songwriter and she inherited that gift from her. She also inherited her mother's stagefright. One night, she comes home and find her apartment ransacked. Seeking refuge in a local diner, she overhears three women discussing their evening at work, and that one of them is leaving. The owner tosses her a matchbook with the club's name on it, and this starts her on her road to her dreams. Ms. Perabo makes Violet a character with depth, feeling and emotion. Violet could easily be your sister, cousin..ect. Far better job here than what she showed in "Rocky and Bullwinkle"Maria Bello appears as club owner Lil. Lil is a hardnosed city girl, despite her small town upbringing. She runs the bar as if it is her life, and it is. Tough, sexy and no-nonsense, Lil is a well written and brought to life character. It would actually be a joy to work for someone such as her, as you always know where you stand. Ms. Bello is always good at creating characters, her "ER" work being another good example.Adam Garcia plays Kevin O'Donnell, Violet's love interest in the movie. Good Austrailian accent and a penchant for rare comic books are this characters selling points. He's got a great bit at the bar helping out Violet early on. Good job Adam.I'm going to lightly touch on the other club employees for a sec. Another relative newcomer, Isabella Miko plays Cammie. A very very sexy woman with a severe shopping habit, Cammie immediately befriends Violet and helps her through the rough early times at the wild club. Not a whole lot to the character, but she sells what she has. Bridget Moynahan stars as Rachel, the club's enforcer. A tough attitude and actions to match, she weilds her sexiness as almost a weapon and whatever you do, dont make her angry. Funny story about her and an anger management course. I won't ruin it here, but its quite a chuckle. Tyra Banks got a lot of heavy publicity for her role as Zoe, but it's more of a cameo. Zoe leaves her job, and that's what enables Violet to work there. Couple of nice dance numbers but that's about it for her. She didn't detract from the film, however.John Goodman plays William Sanford, Violet's father. A hardworking family first man, he is both proud and torn as his baby girl heads off into the world. He eventually comes to Coyote Ugly and sees Violet dancing on the bar, water being poured over her. Angry and ashamed of the newspaper pictures of his daughter, he is unable to tell her how he really feels. John Goodman is every man, every dad. Probably the best characterization in the movie.Overall, "Coyote Ugly" packs a great story, killer soundtrack and well-thought out characters into a tight little hour and fifty minute movie and dares you not to like it. It's hard to deny that this movie is fun for all audiences. Don't let the gyrating trailers convince you otherwise.4 out of 5</fullReview>

Don't trust the trailers for this one - it is aimed at bringing the men in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just realized that movies are all about marketing. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it was about a bar and the ladies that work there. Boy was I wrong! It seemed like it took an hour just too get to a scene of the bar. Which I was somewhat disappointed because I thought Maria Bello had a bigger role in this movie, and she plays the Bar owner . This is a movie for woman not men . Sure it has a good plot and story too it , but it's not about the bar thats for sure. So guys my advice is too wait until it comes out on cable . This is the kind of movie that they will show on cable all the time .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this movie yesterday night, I had a little flashback to the 1980´s. "Cocktail", "Flashdance" etc. were those nice dreams-will- come-true flicks - not very pretentious, but very entertaining. And so does "Coyote ugly". A sweet young girl called Violet, played by Piper Perabo (sigh...) comes to New York to start a career as a songwriter, but nobody wants to listen to her demo tapes. She gets a job in this bar called "Coyote ugly", she falls in love with a boy etc. Everything is so cute, optimistic and heart-warming. (I´m a hopeless romantic...) A perfect feelgood movie for a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot: This movie, starring beautiful, naive Piper Perabo as struggling songwriter in NYC, is a wonderful insight into the music and entertainment industry in NYC. Violet has always dreamt about making it in New York. Finally she kisses her rural North Amboy, NJ (and her dad, John Goodman) goodbye and leaves to find fame and fortune as a songwriter in New York. The usual cliches follow: unanswered demo tapes, the burglary in her flat, the daily struggle for survival. Things turn better when she is tried as a new Coyote: a barmaid in the underground bar Coyote Ugly (because "Cheers has already been taken"). First she is everything a young girl from the countryside is supposed to be: naive, clumsy, bashful - a contrast to the in-your-face attitude of the other barmaids. After a long and weary fight behind, in front of and on the bar, she is accepted as a Coyote, even putting her boyfriend and some open mic night chances aside. This phase of giving up her dreams for the easy money is really saddening. Finally her dad, boyfriend and girlfriend intervene out of different reasons and get her on her first open mic night, where she is once again confronted with her stagefright, but is overcoming it (for sure we need a happy ending here).The conclusion: an open-hearted, sometimes amusing, sometimes melancholic display of a young woman, her dreams and fears. Peppered by some hot bar scenes (well there has to be something for the guys) and some real hot music (can't wait to lay hands on the soundtrack) this is a wonderful movie. (Don't ask me whether LeAnn Rimes is doing a cameo for the former or latter reason). And - doesn't Piper Perabo sometimes look like Alanis Morrisette (or for the older generation: like a young, up-and-coming Carole King) ??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie that young girls should go see; a really good date movie; one of the best movies of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly. ****. USA, 2000, Directed by David McNally starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, John Goodman. I went to see this movie without my wife. She decided from watching the trailers and see the ads that it was some dumb T&amp;A drunk guy bar movie. I mean that sounded OK to me; but I was really surprised. `Coyote Ugly' is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. `Coyote Ugly' is the best romantic comedy that I've seen since `Notting Hill.' Violet Sanford (Perabo) is a young woman from small town New Jersey and she's moving to the Big Apple to seek fame and fortune as a song writer. Her dad (Goodman) and her friends don't want her to leave. Her best friend reminds her that they have never carried through on any of their dreams (preserving their virginity, going to college, going to beauty school) so why does she want to pursue her dream of being a famous songwriter? But Violet is off to the city, where she na?vely goes from one agency to the other trying to sell her songs. Needing to earn money she ends up working at `Coyote Ugly' serving drinks and dancing on the bar. All the familiar plot points of a romantic comedy follow and you just know everything is going to end up happily ever after. And it does. But there are a number of things that make `Coyote Ugly' a good movie. The acting is good. John Goodman is especially good as Violet's father. All the girls at the bar are good. Garcia is good as the boyfriend and love interest. Another thing I liked about the story is the persistence of the main character. When life was getting her down, she'd have a good cry and go back out and kick some butt. She stuck to her dream and worked hard to achieve it. In the end she has friends, family, the promise of a carrier, and a boyfriend. The more I think about this movie, it's not a movie for oafish guys who want a T&amp;A moment. `Coyote Ugly' is a movie that young girls should go see; a really good date movie; one of the best movies of 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, like most other females, I was not looking forward to seeing Coyote Ugly. From what the previews showed, I was expecting a bunch of girls in tight snake skin pants prancing around on top of a bar with liquor being poured all over them while guys in the bar (and in the audience) oggled. Well, I was completely wrong! The movie actually turned out to have a story...even if it was sometimes cheesy and predictable. The plot is about a young girl who aspires to become a song writer but has a terrible case of stage fright. She eventually seeks out a job and joins a group of girls working at a bar in NYC called Coyote Ugly. Although the story line is rather predictable and even though I wouldn't call the movie oscar worthy (god forbid), it was nevertheless very entertaining and a good choice for a Friday night out with friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first viewed the trailer for this movie back in May in front of Mission Impossible II. And I must admit, my buddies and I were part of the huge public that figured this is going to be a great T &amp; A movie. Well, we were right; however David McNally went and snuck in a great, yes great, story. At first it may sound like just another small town girl moves to big town in hopes of making it big. And you're right, but this isn't just that, it's laced full of great acting by Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, and the great John Goodman. Violet Sanford (Perabo) wants to be a song writer and saves all her money, from working at the local pizza place, to move to New York City. Naturally her dad, William Sanford (Goodman), doesn't want her to go. She inevitably moves out, and into a run down apartment in "The City." There she encounters every problem imaginable trying to get her songs heard by music execs. She meets Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who at first lies to her and says that he can get her tape heard, but finally gets found out. Instead of getting hurt, Violet begins to fall in love with Kevin. When all desperation is coming to an end, Violet meets a manager of a bar, Lil (Bello), and "auditions" to work for her in the bar. As the preview shows, this is not your regular corner bar. Violet, now "Jersey", has a horrible first night, but sticks with it, and by the movies end, is the best one at the bar. The movie does have a few sappy scenes, and I actually did get a little choked up at one particular scene with Violet, and her dad, but all in all this is a "feel good" movie. That's not to say that there is nothing wrong with the movie though. I think, being a mere 91 minutes long, that it is a bit short, and probably could have gone into Violet's childhood a little. And I didn't feel anything for the love interest in Violet's life. I didn't care for the choice of Adam Garcia for this role. This movie definitely has a great deal of T &amp; A, a wet T-shirt scene come to mind, but it's much more then that. Please trust me when I say that this is a MUST SEE movie.</fullReview>

From the looks of it, it was a bunch of underdressed bimbos dancing on a bar. Such a guy movie... but, looks can be deceiving. The movie had a lot of substance with "follow your dreams" part of it. Throw in some fun girl-powered bar dancing (even if they happen to have a mile of flat belly and a set of D cups)and a gorgeous Aussie man, you've got yourself a rockin' flick.

		<fullReview>Seems Jerry Bruckheimer is running out of ideas these days. He's now recycling material from nearly twenty years ago. With Coyote Ugly, we have the story of a young New Jersey girl moving from NJ to the big bad city of Manhattan. There, she learns that life in the city is tough and the only way to write music is up on the top of your roof. Violet, played by Piper Perabo, does have some moments where she has some true defining moments as a character, but those are few and far between. She finds the titular bar and promptly begins work there with the other barmaids. They jump, they dance, the light the place on fire all to the tune of heavy pounding rock music. The one bright spot about this movie is John Goodman. As Violet's father, he brings some humor and life into an otherwise dull story that has all the plot twists of an unwound pretzel. And as for Tyra Banks, I don't know why she was cast. Her character vanishes before the first act is even over. Lets just hope Bruckheimer doesn't mix any other films together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Super producer Jerry Bruckheimer adds fuel and fire to an overdone love story. Girl (Piper Perabo) leaves small town and bitter single parent (John Goodman) to make it big in the city. She gets turned down one after another by everyone and moves into a run down apartment. She then gets robbed but finds a great job where she can makes some cash. She meets a boy (Adam Garcia) and has a fight with her parent. The parent gets injured, she has a fight with her boyfriend and loses her job. Then everything somehow comes together in the end. What Bruckheimer does to this story is turned the level of energy up quite a few notches. He adds in gorgeous women (Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Melanie Lynskey,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks)for some seriously good eye candy, loud thunderous music, Bruckheimer colors, camera shots and flair and a wild bar named Coyote Ugly. This is one love story other than Chasing Amy that guys can enjoy. The eye candy is popin all over and the music makes for big time fun. This is a summer popcorn flick. It just replaces the explosions and FX with beautiful women going buck wild on top of a bar. This is a good date film but if you're a guy make sure you keep your hormones in check or you could be leaving alone. For a high energy, full of eye candy, fun loving Bruckheimer film without explosions, Coyote Ugly is a not that bad of a choice.</fullReview>

OK, OK, she want's to get her songs sung. Then finally, when she does, LeAnne Rimes literally comes out of nowhere and starts belting out yet another cookie cutter teen top 40 song. Let's at least get original. As for the women, sure they are beautiful, but ummmm let's find some depth to them. Keep looking, oh wait there wasn't any. EXCEPT for Maria Bello, I must say she played her part brilliantly. The only bright spot in the movie was her.

		<fullReview>In the tradition of such movies as `Flashdance' and `Footloose', `Coyote Ugly' is surprisingly enlightening. At a glance `Coyote' is simply a down and dirty bar in New York where bartenders are scantly clad and perform as showgirls dancing on tabletops for a muster of drunken lovesick idiots. At least, that is what the trailer would have us believe. With an opening night slogan tainted as `The hottest night of the year!', I would expect nothing less. But unexpectedly I enjoyed the story overall. Newcomer Piper Perabo dazzles us with her sweet charm, good looks and convincing performance. She plays Violet, an aspiring songwriter, who moves from New Jersey to New York to pursue a dream in the music business. Not as a performer, but simply to write songs for other performers to sing. When times are hard, she lands a job as bartender at the hottest club in the fish-packing district. Only in the first half of the film must we endure the essential strippers with their clothes on scenario, and try to accept that Violet can tame the savage beast of a bar that is in total disarray, by simply grabbing a microphone, singing to a song, and have us believe that a star is being born. But as the story moves on, we do enjoy some rather good written music, as well as an endearing story taking place between a daughter and her father. (Played wonderfully by John Goodman) She also has a compassionate relationship with an Aussie played by another newcomer Adam Garcia. Adam is well suited for the roll, and though I felt like I was being a little rushed through there up and down relationship, I think he pulled it off quite nicely. Overall, I left the theatre feeling rather refreshed. Considering all the lame scripts we've had to stomach over the last few years, along with all the special effect mega crap flicks that Hollywood has been spoon-feeding us as of late, this movie has the ability to satisfy a wide audience. From drooling jocks, to trashy girl cosmetic feminists, to dear old dad. And even though we don't get to see nearly enough of my baby Tyra Banks, with a wonderful soundtrack, and a cast with good chemistry, `Coyote Ugly' delivers.</fullReview>

This show is entertainment, pure and simple, from its perky soundtrack to the interesting on-bar dancing and beyond.If you are in the market to be enlightened, see something else. If you're looking for complicated characters, see something else. If you want a deep plot, full of twists and turns, and many provocations of thought... Look elsewhere.But if you want to see a cute movie with your date, check it out! If you want to see something fun, check it out! If you want to hear some cool music, check it out!

		<shortDescription>Flashdance+Cocktail+Breaking Away=trashy, mildly entertaining, $$$ generating, bellybutton ring fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Coyote Ugly, and much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it. That's not to say it's a good movie. But, God help me for saying this, it's still enjoyable.It's basically a remake of the Tom Cruise movie "Cocktail" mixed with "Flashdance", the exploitation flick that put Bruckheimer on the map. There's scenes showing the heroine taking care of her loveable Dad, and their relationship is reminscient of a really good coming-of-age movie from the 70s, "Breaking Away".The movie has a cookie cutter plot. The characters are all pretty cliched, and you've seen them a hundred times before. There's the perky heroine who dreams of following in her mothers' footsteps by making it big. John Goodman plays her loveable concerned father. There's a teary-eyed, supportive best friend who hugs our heroine a lot. There's a worldly older woman mentor/boss, and the ubiquitous cute boyfriend with a "mysterious past".The people and places of New York are squalid, but made palatable and picturesque by the Bruckheimer Dream Factory(tm). There's lots of incidental stereotypical characters (the horny hollering female executives, the bear-like skinhead bouncer, the snooty William Morris Agency male receptionist, etc etc.). And of course, as much beer-soaked T&amp;A (masquerading as feminism) as a PG-13 rating will allow.This definitely ain't Shakespeare folks. It's more like Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey staged at a wet T-shirt contest, with our hero dressed in a shiny tank top and cowboy boots. Our hero's mighty challenges amount to learning how to sing like Leanne Rimes while twirling Jim Beam bottles and line dancing on a bar.So what makes this movie worth a look?1) Energy. It moves along at a good clip. The story arc is pretty standard stuff, with each plot point introduced and tidily resolved in all the ways they suggest in those "How to Write A Screenplay" textbooks. It was done well enough that I didn't mind being manipulated by the movie. It's a well worn formula, but when they do it right, it still works.2) Slick production values. Everything here is very competently put together. It's well directed, well produced, and especially well edited. The sets are full of expensive eye candy that distracts you from how dumb the movie really is. There's lots of cool stuff, toe-tapping music, and pretty colors to look at. And lots of T&amp;A for the guys. Oh yeah, and a cute guy who does a strip tease for the girls (at one point, his "package" is only barely covered by a bedsheet). And middle aged women bid for him, so Mom won't feel left out either. In fact, there's a stock character for everyone at the mall to sympathize with, and enough humor to disguise the fact that this is basically an exploitation movie.3) Decent casting/acting. Piper Perabo is a woman from New Jersey in her early twenties, trying to make it in the entertainment biz. She plays a woman from New Jersey in her early twenties, trying to make it in the entertainment biz. And she's cute and sweet and innocent looking too. It's a perfect casting. Everybody else is well cast, and all the performances are good. You get the feeling watching the movie that they all knew this was dumb material, and just had fun with it on the set. That fun shows on the screen, and I found myself enjoying the movie because the cast was enjoying it. I even found myself sympathizing with poor Piper Perabo, when she freaked out upon entering the rowdy Coyote Ugly bar for the first time. It was just like Mark Hamill entering the Alien Bar in Star Wars. (You know, Piper kind of reminds me of a female Mark Hamill...) The cast and crew overcame the limitations of the material, and made lil' ole' jaded me actually care about the characters. Even though it's just a bunch of predictable and manipulative trickery, it worked for me, and I had fun.4) It was better made than The Patriot. The Patriot stank. At least this movie knew what it was trying to be, and was a well executed production. And there were no stupid Tricorne hats in it. Nary a one. Thank God for small favors.The verdict: it's worth a look. It's a bit of fluff that you shouldn't pay full price for at the theatre. You'll probably like it a little, but feel guilty because you should know better. Rent Breaking Away to make yourself feel better. It's a better movie, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashdance+Cocktail+Breaking Away=trashy, mildly entertaining, $$$ generating, bellybutton ring fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Coyote Ugly, and much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it. That's not to say it's a good movie. But, God help me for saying this, it's still enjoyable.It's basically a remake of the Tom Cruise movie "Cocktail" mixed with "Flashdance", the exploitation flick that put Bruckheimer on the map. There's scenes showing the heroine taking care of her loveable Dad, and their relationship is reminscient of a really good coming-of-age movie from the 70s, "Breaking Away".The movie has a cookie cutter plot. The characters are all pretty cliched, and you've seen them a hundred times before. There's the perky heroine who dreams of following in her mothers' footsteps by making it big. John Goodman plays her loveable concerned father. There's a teary-eyed, supportive best friend who hugs our heroine a lot. There's a worldly older woman mentor/boss, and the ubiquitous cute boyfriend with a "mysterious past".The people and places of New York are squalid, but made palatable and picturesque by the Bruckheimer Dream Factory(tm). There's lots of incidental stereotypical characters (the horny hollering female executives, the bear-like skinhead bouncer, the snooty William Morris Agency male receptionist, etc etc.). And of course, as much beer-soaked T&amp;A (masquerading as feminism) as a PG-13 rating will allow.This definitely ain't Shakespeare folks. It's more like Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey staged at a wet T-shirt contest, with our hero dressed in a shiny tank top and cowboy boots. Our hero's mighty challenges amount to learning how to sing like Leanne Rimes while twirling Jim Beam bottles and line dancing on a bar.So what makes this movie worth a look?1) Energy.

The conflicts that get in the way have a feeling of being contrived as the writing seemed to be a little lazy.This is an OK movie. If you are under 25 years old and haven't already seen this plot a dozen times it will be enjoyable. The girls are attractive and the acting is consistently good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From NJ to NY, what is the diff for Violet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess from the look of the commercials that most women won't have interest in seeing "Coyote Ugly", because it shows women dancing on top of a bar. But it's also a different kind of love story than you would usually see in a movie with a twist of tragedy (but I'm definitely not saying that it's a tear jerker.)Violet leaves New Jersey in hope for a new life, and a career as a song writer. But the New Yorkers aren't going to let her do that easily. As they say, `You've got to start from the bottom and work your way up (or to the top.)She gets an audition at the Coyote Ugly bar by hearing the Coyotes talking about how much they will miss Zoe [played by Tyra Banks] when she leaves. She then goes to talk to the owner of the bar. When she starts working, and sees the bar, she doesn't know how she's going to last there, or ever get over her stage fright.See what happens or don't; you're choice, you know what,(?) just see if you like it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I read a movie review for "Coyote Ugly" in my local newspaper and watched the trailer for this film, I expected it to be a mediocre picture lacking in plot, depth and clothing. Fortunately, a trip to the theatre to see "Coyote Ugly" proved me wrong. This film was an absolute treat. I'll grant it forgiveness for its cliches of the innocent girl in the big city seeking her fortune, the barista babes who befriend her, or the time-honored boy chases girl scenario, or in this case, how the ferociously handsome Mr. O'Donnell chases Violet Sanford.On the subject of the male lead, Adam Garcia gives a sizzling performance as the dashing Mr. O'Donnell. Female fans in the audience will be thrilled to see Adam Garcia in his prime at the bar, but I won't divulge any details here. (Darn!) Although the film does feature some provocative female rug-cutting, some of the numbers are well-choreographed and pay homage to genres of dance like line dancing or "Riverdance"-esque moves. The soundtrack takes pages from The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Kid Rock, Third Eye Blind, and LeAnn Rimes, who performs the film's trademark song "Can't Fight the Moonlight."This film has its share of pitfalls, such as the moment when Violet describes her stage fright to Mr. O'Donnell or Violet's weepy friend (why is she in the film again?) Yet on the whole, it was a solid, humorous, cliched film. I would give it **1/2 to *** stars. Thank you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The would be a film to test my fast-forward button. The lamest of a triple feature (also the last, but that isn't why it was lame), the movie has a see-through plot that everybody has seen before. Country girl goes to big city with dreams, gets robbed, finds job, **Spoiler**, makes it. So why would anybody go see this. Because of great marketing!! This has the best, most deceptive marketing strategy ever. Why? It got guys into the theater, didn't it?The bar scenes were cool, and they are the only good thing about the movie. I wanted to know how many people in the audience actually cared about the plot. The bar scenes were limited, and the plot was overdone. I didn't care about Violet's problems. I wanted to see more T&amp;A. But, emotions overruled, and so we got stuck with a lame movie that tests the fast-forward button. We just want to see stories around the bar. A story centering around the bar owner, by way of Violet would have been better, in my opinion. So, because of the plot getting in the way of my entertainment.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be at the Academies. The most underrated movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is an absolutely fascinating movie. It covers all audiences. Girls want to see Adam Garcia, boys want to see the girls dancing on the bar, children will enjoy all the bright lights and Lee Ann Rhymes, parents enjoy John Goodman's character and can relate to him (a new role for john and a job well done), and movie buffs can critique the very interesting storyline and love story that develops. The script could not be any better. Every plot hole is filled in by the time this movie reaches its much awaited ending. Rather than making a preview focused on the chick flick side of it or the raunchy bar side of it, the preview did both which added interest. This is Piper Perabo's and Adam Garcia's breaking off point. There is something almost magic about the way Piper Perabo performs in front of the camera. She is really something special. There were more songs used in this film than i've ever seen in any other film and they were all placed at just the right time. The director, music producer, writers, and cast all deserve an applause for a job well done. Its the movie of the summer. No Contest</fullReview>

		<fullReview>COYOTE UGLY is a nice romantic/drama/comedy that is uplifting and delightful. It brings hope that no matter where you come from in the U.S. you can always make it in the big bad city. Except that I've already seen almost every John Cusack and John Hughes film, so it becomes routine and cliche. If you haven't seen those films, which chances are you have, since they are in color, then COYOTE UGLY is nothing new. Every movie were a girl from a small town goes to a big city, either New York City or Los Angeles. This time it's New York, but the main star, Violet (Piper Perabo) wants to become a songwriter, but she needs to pay for rent and other necessities (my guess is make-up). So she goes from recording studio to studio dropping off her tapes for recording agents can listen to, but then that crummy copyright law gets in the way, damn lawyers. So what is Violet to do but to work in a evening hot spot bar called Coyote Ugly. The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello) a energetic boss/bartender who is concerned about making money and not breaking the law. There are other bartender's as well, Cammie (Izabella Miko) a sweet and kind bartender who usually melts men's hearts with her dancing. Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) a tough as nails woman who releases her agression on the male customers. And Zoe (Tyra Banks) a bartender who's on her way out to go to law school. And what the women do at the bar is like a mixture of SHOWGIRLS and COCKTAIL. They dance very erotic while pouring drinks, (hey, why can't every city have a bar like these?) And the girls bring in lots of money nightly, mega bucks amount. While Violet is learning the ropes at the bar, and saving her money, she builds up a romance with a man who has multiple jobs, Kevin (Adam Garcia). And Violet communicates with her worried some father (John Goodman) who takes money at a toll booth. One thing that ran through my mind with COYOTE UGLY is that it is the most erotic and sexiest pronography where everyone keeps thier clothes on. The way these women dance, it comes close to a strip club dance than anything else. The other thing that ran through my mind is the plot. I kept guessing on what was going to happen, and I was right. It's a romantic routine film, girl meets boy, they fall in love, they fight, they make-up, etc. What did I like about this movie? Well, first there are the women, they are attractive and very beautiful. Also each girl has a flame of talent that is begging to get out, however director David McNally sticks with the routine and shows too little of the girls at the bar and more with just Violet trying to succeed. Then there's the two charming men, Adam Garcia and John Goodman. Garcia is enjoyable as the romantic male, he is funny and charming at times, but he's also hammy and cheesy. And speaking of food, John Goodman is also funny as the father of Violet who refuses to diet and to watch over his little girl. But it's that darn bloody script that ruins everything. It's a script that could be shown in a screenwriting class, in fact I think they have shown it in my class. The typical rags from riches story, just with five women shaking their stuff while serving alcohol, man's two favorite things. When I talked to producer Jerry Bruckheimer last March about COYOTE UGLY, he told me that, "there are going to be A LOT of hot looking women in it." And guess what? HE'S RIGHT!! There are a lot of hot looking women in this film, sadly they have nowhere to go. This is similar to Bruckheimer's last drama, FLASHDANCE. I think Bruckheimer should stick with action films, he's much better with those. *** (out of five)</fullReview>

What saves this flick from being the same old tired old hash served up a different way is the brilliant editing. There are also some interesting scenes of Manhattan, including the fish market and the apartment and roof top which give a realistic feel to what it's like to live in New York on a tight budget. (A tiny, filthy, unsafe apartment like that one probably costs upwards of a grand a month.) The once scene which garnered a guffaw from the audience was when the significance of the title is revealed -- not only amusing, but also probably the most original concept in this movie.

Really, with a name like Coyote Ugly and all the previews you've seen what the heck did you expect? It certainly is not an epic, nor did it pretend to be.I actually enjoyed the movie. I am not a 20-something like one writer, happy to have a movie for his/her age group, but a 40-something that just likes to be entertained.I didn't expect wonderful writing or acting, but I would have liked more dancing. It was funny to see "dance double" on the credits after the movie - obviously the actresses didn't do all their own dancing as evidenced by the repeated shots of only the boots or their legs on the bar during one dance.It was a fun movie, it entertained, it was nice to see a relationship where the guy wasn't a complete jerk and a girl that didn't play games. It was also delightful to see Melanie Lynskey in this move - she was great as Jacqueline in Ever After, it took a minute to remember who she was and she looked great.So, I don't think it's a waste of time or money, depending on what you're looking for - if you want an epic stay home, if you want to be entertained go see it, just don't expect to be intellectually stimulated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My boyfriend discreetly implied he wanted to see this movie. so I gave in. What a mistake.I'd like to know who thought this would be an even remotely interesting idea for a movie, and then took it one step further by writing it down and eventually putting it on screen so I can beat him/her senseless and take back my $7.Seeing the movie had the predictablity of a Road Runner cartoon, about 20 minutes into the movie I started balancing my checkbook by the light of the movie projector, glancing up to see that everyone BUT the main character was somewhat 3-dimensional, and sometimes, dare I say, likable (such as her father, best friend, and boss at the bar). I also saw that the previews were a big trick. I thought Tyra Banks was supposed to have a part in this... her picture WAS on the poster... But that aside, I think the movie would be mildly entertaining if they had more interaction between the girls at the bar. Like one of them has a herion addiction and feels the need to put herself out of her misery. But then I forgot about the PG-13 rating.So, every time the bar scene (the few that there were, seeing as most of this 120 minutes was dedicated to weak dialouge contributing to the cliche plot) became somewhat interesting, they'd ruin it by singing. Too much singing. Unnecessary singing. At times INTOLERABLE singing (the songwriting dream... aforementioned cliche plot). Then it occurred to me they wanted something to appeal to girls...Ahhh.. how clever. Her songwriting dream. So if you're a boy who still has his nights interrupted by wet dreams and needs a visual fix by girls dancing on bars, or a girl who's all about 'GRRRL Power!' and 'I know she can do it if she just BELIEVES in herself', or even if you're just an average person who's day planner needs rearranging, go for it. The way I see it, this was my punishment for all the things I've done wrong that my parents never found out about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a movie that has a complex plot that makes you think about the wonders of life and what you're doing in it then look elsewhere. If you're looking to watch a movie that will have you smiling the whole time and leave you feeling `frisky' then you've found the right spot. It seems these days that Hollywood has mostly forgotten us 20 somethings as they push out films that are either `Teen Flicks' or epic stories that appeal to those who have mostly forgotten the bar scene. This movie, however, brings back some fun for those of us who know what it's like to search for that perfect bar while still trying to find our futures amid our `normal' lives. I truly didn't expect this movie to actually be that good when I went out to see it, but was thrilled to find myself wrong. They keep the story light and easy to follow which allows you to just sit there and enjoy the party. Throw in some beautiful people and a soundtrack that defines our `generation' and you get a movie that you just may need to see again.</fullReview>

The only saving grace for me personally is that I didn't have to pay to see it. Still, it's two hours of life I will never get back. What saddens me further are the comments about the plot of this movie being "real" and (sigh) "original". I'm certain comments like these are from people who have never had "real" jobs or an "original" thought. Standard girl makes good story with lots of shiny, happy "actors" to round out the wallpaper. Even the target male pre-pube audience won't get much enjoyment from this turkey since the girls only reach "tease". Look for cut-n-paste Tyra Banks movie stills, coming to an internet near you. By the way, I have structured my comments in the same manner the hacks threw together the, uh, script... for this film: haphazardly and pointlessly. Thankfully, this movie will vanish in two weeks, and no one will care. While the Coyote Not-a-Genius formulates another loser, I'll be waiting here, trying to figure out a way to avoid seeing it.

In my opinion, movies this year have been very sad and depressing and the ones that were supposed to be great summer films fell very short.(For example: MI2, Hollow Man, and Gone in 60 Seconds.)This is a girls opinion and i went with 2 of my friends and had a blast. There were actually more girls in the theatre than guys. We were laughing, singing, and cheering through the whole thing everyone actually stood up and clapped at the end. All the acting was great and I think Perabo and Garcia are one to watch for in the future. This is a sweet, fun story that everyone can enjoy. I say, if your looking for the most entertaning, fun movie of the summer then go see this one for sure.</fullReview>

The emotions and acting seems fake. You don't really end up caring about any of the characters and the music really isn't that great either. This is more or less a made-for television movie that really can't justify paying money to see or rent. In fact if I was watching it on television I probably would have just changed the channel. MTV has more pretty faces, better music, better dancing as wall as many other channels. Stay at home and watch TV rather than waste your time and money on this dud. I'd give this around a 4 out of 10 stars. Another recent movie called "Center Stage" is superior to this movie and has a similar story (girl goes to big city to be discovered). Rent or see that movie instead of this one.</fullReview>

Piper Perabo isn't just trying to show off her sweet charm and sexy looks here (though she does do a great job of that), but she proves she really is a talented actress. And even though Tyra Banks had a small part, it was cool how she kept popping up here and there. The choreography is very well done and gives you a feeling of being there. David McNally is shown here as a very talented director who should go on to do more, hopefully he can become a regular Bruckheimer director, like Michael Bay and Tony Scott.Advice for guys: don't go to see COYOTE UGLY with your mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie, and I know that it got bad rating, but screw them, pardon that phrasing. Not only was this by far one of the best movies that I have seen all summer (girls opinion) the movie got a standing applaud at the end. It was fantastic, the plot was a girl wanting to be a song writer, finding that she must first perform the song herself before she could get anywhere in the music world, having stage fright caused a bit of a problem. She needed a job to support herself while she tried to accomplish her dream and it was at Coyote Ugly. Her boyfriend (a hottie I must say) gave her support and security in her dream. It was a wonderful movie, see it. Male or female you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the year of our Lord 2000, the god of adolescent boys gave unto us the film "Coyote Ugly".This movie, I think, it the cherry on top of our Y2K formulaic summer cinema sundae. (By this I mean it is the worst, the pinnacle of mediocrity)If you are a young female who feels she has all kinds of potential locked up inside, but you need a kindly external influence to unleash it, then this movie will serve well to reinforce your neurotic, self-centered view on life. As far as I'm concerned, this sort of pseudo-romantic tripe is exactly what screws up so many young American women.If you are a male (young or old) just ogle the females and you'll make it through.

		<shortDescription>Not wretched, but darn close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's one of those movies that could easily have been an ABC movie of the week, or maybe that would be pushing it. Rather one of those movies they show on a women's network, like Lifetime, in the afternoon. When it comes down to needing a compelling dramatic problem, the heartbreak of stagefright is not usually the one chosen. But there it is, hope that's not a spoiler, but essentially that's it: Girl comes to big city, wants to be songwriter, but darn it, can't sing in front of people. Interesting thing is she doesn't have any trouble getting up on a bar and getting doused with beer and water by other women. And that's the part of the plot that actually makes sense. There are all kinds of slow spots, so deadening, you'll have ample time to get a bucket of popcorn, use the restroom, knit a sweater and get in some golf and still be back in time before anything even remotely interesting happens. The movie is sold as a "get their testosterone and hormones pumping" thing for teenage boys, but it's really a "chick flick" about the dreams and aspirations of a beautiful young woman from small town New Jersey. Seems like the advertising execs knew watching a young woman sit around trying to write a song would not make for great TV commercials.Another problem is the massive plot holes and omissions--seems like the heroine is sending song tape demos to everyone and his brother, but then within the space of about thirty seconds she magically buys a computer, becomes knowledgeable about how to use it and the sequencing software and the disc burner and the mixing technology and boom has a demo disk after she burns a cd and then for some reason we're not clear on, ... well, figure this is not a plot driven cinematic endeavor.That the flick actually got a PG rating is somewhat mystifying since there's not much in the way of nudity, bar dancing and all, and less violence than you'd see on a tv cop show. This one should have been left for TV production where you are not out seven bucks and two hours, since all you need do is turn the dial. Well, who knows, maybe those advertising execs are pretty smart after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coyote Ugly is in my top 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is every boy's dream. If you are a guy between the ages of 15 and 28. you'll love the film for it's very beautiful leads. Even if this was the worst movie of all time it would still be a hit with the guys. If you're a girl you'll love the girls too. Maybe not for their looks but because they show us what it's like for a woman to be in control and in charge. They'll also like violet's journey to become a song writer and make it in the world. Now i'm 15 yrs old and i went to see tihs with some friends from the ages of 15-18. we fall somewhere in between. our favorite parts were the ladies dancing on the bar tables and pouring water on their beautiful bodies. but i also like movies with some hint of a plot and i think this movie's plot was pretty good.The story focusses of Violet Sanford who leaves New jersey and goes to New York City to be a song writer. Now Violet has stage fright and in new york you can't just hand over your demo tape to just anybody you have to present your songs in one way or another and for her that means going to open mic nights and performing them herself. She's too afraid to do that so in the mean time she needs to make some extra money. This is where coyote ugly comes in. This is a bar where sexy ladies entertain their guest by dancing on bar tables, feeling on each other, and showing off their beautiful bodies. the ladies are all beautiful and very strong characters. Girls with attitudes. at first for Violet this is just a job but pretty soon she realizes that Coyote Ugly is the place where she'll break out her shell.The acting is pretty good for this kind of film. The standout is Piper Perabo who is on her way to being a great actress. she has a mixture of charm, sexiness, innocence, and talent. Maria Bello is good as Lil, the boss who runs the bar, she's very demanding in the role and she makes you believe that this bar is her life. Izabella Miko and Bridget Manyahan are also good as the sexiest coyote's in my opinion. Tyra Banks who is only in the movie for about 10 minutes is good as the energeti zoe. she's in the films most memorable scenes.All these critics and people the say this movie is bad or the worst movie of all time need to chill out. movies don't need to have oscar winning plots. they just to need to entertain and this one most definitely entertains.</fullReview>

Plus there is the one scene where a guy dances on the bar, and does a little strip tease. The movie was funny as hell to.

		<shortDescription>The only appeal of this film is the beauty of it's women, who surprisingly don't come out much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance Coyote Ugly is a high energy film featuring the hottest bodies ever to grace the silver screen in a single movie. But you can't judge a book by it's cover. Think hard about the trailer for this film. Do you remember anything about the plot of the movie? It's no accident that the trailer hid what I'm about to tell you: Coyote Ugly is a chick flick, a classic boy-meets-girl.Small town girl Violet Sanford leaves home for the Big apple with the dream of becoming a professional song writer. Her lack of success eventually leads her to a bartending job at the swinging Coyote Ugly. Along the way she meets the persistent `Mr. O'Donnell,' the boy who will win her over. But before the film can end, Violet must confront her stage fright in order to achieve her dream of being a song writer.I apologize if I made the story sound in any way complicated, or interesting. It was probably written from a template. Good acting can usually make up for such un-originality, but every hard body in this film acts exactly as we would expect a model to act-poorly. The trailer would also lead one to believe that Tyra Banks plays a part in this film, but she really has little more than a cameo. And for anybody who hasn't figured it out by the PG-13 rating, there is no nudity.There really isn't much to say about Coyote Ugly. The only appeal this film has is the beauty of it's women. Surprisingly enough, they don't come out much save for the bar scenes. Without anything else to keep this film going, I have to rate it two stars, thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruckheimer's second adolescence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no way around it... it's 'Flashdance' for the millenium. It's almost as sparkly, almost as deep, almost as entertaining, and... even less original, as Bruckheimer's done it before. It is so familiar that my husband, who had no idea that it came from the same director and is well known to be anti-observant, commented that it was nearly exactly the same movie. It isn't as though we needed an updated homage to the older film this year... we had 'Center Stage' for that, if we had yearned for it. It certainly isn't that Bruckheimer had something new to relate through the lens of the wisdom he's theoretically garnered over the past couple decades. He's apparantly struggling with the intersection of a preternaturally extended mid-life crisis and a bad case of director's block. Let's hope that with this regression he's gotten it out of his system and can get on with his life. That said, we hadn't intended to see it (we couldn't find the theater in time to go to our intended viewing of 'The Patriot'), so we weren't the intended audience. And we saw it on the supersaver's Matinee, so we only wasted three measly bucks per ticket. For that price it was relatively inoffensive, and an acceptable excuse to sit in an air-conditioned building and enjoy our popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not good. Not even close to good. The worst part is, I knew it was going to be this bad and I still went to see it. I guess that tells you something about my social life but don't get me started on that right now. I went in to this movie expecting to see a couple of scantly clad women jumping around on a bar and singing songs and dousing themselves with water, beer, whatever. And there was some of that in the movie. Which is a good thing. The problem with the Coyote Ugly is that the plot is so horribly bad that it made watching this movie extremely painful.The acting is average at best. Piper Perabo does an ok job in what is really her debut performance, if you don't count Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle and Single Spaced (where her character is named Giant Squid, really quite funny). Her acting and all-around cute-ness would have been much more noticeable if she didn't have to sing those friggin songs during the movie. The editing was so bad during those scenes that I thought maybe Cheh Chang stepped in for his artistic interpretation. Adam Garcia, Piper's love interest in the movie, actually came across as charming and all that good stuff. Maria Bello, the boss, was a little too forced. She tried to be a real hard ass but seemed to keep changing her mind. John Goodman, Piper's father, was the best in the movie. His character was believable and was the only one that you had any emotion for as the movie progressed.To sum up, this movie was worse than the low, low expectations that I gave it. I guess that that is an achievement. Don't go and see this movie unless you have about 10 people with you and you can make fun of it.Side Note: Keep an eye out for the terrifically bad rooftop jam session scene. Instant Classic</fullReview>

The characters were wishy washy and poorly developed and the acting and dialogue were completely unbelievable. I am saddened to see this coming up as a big summer hit.

		<shortDescription>Flash Dance meets Coal Miners Daughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, my wife dragged me to this film. I think she was expecting more of a Thelma and Louise meets cocktail type film with strong female roles running a bar and not taking crap from anyone. Yeah, they all danced around in skimpy outfits to 20 year old music, but there are sexy and strong willed people in the world. What bothered me about the movie is that it was a long disjointed collection of cliches that we've seen before and done better. Girl goes to New York to be a songwriter (in case you saw the preview rather than hearing about it from friends this is actually what the movie is about). Guess what, no one will buy her songs. Big surprise there. No one will even be nice to her! What a shock! She lives in what looks like the projects, has no job, has a stock dead mother family past. I keep thinking I've given too much away, but this is all the first five minutes of the film. Nothing else develops other than the generic boyfriend with a stock sitcom relationship. Oh yeah, the bar? It could be left out. It has nothing to do with the plot. She doesn't even grow as a person there. All those tough, take no prisoners women who work there? Wimps! They couldn't get together and make one stable person. And they are messed up in a seven dwarfs kind of a way. Oh let's see there's Slutty, and Bitchy, and Bossy. Each one is screwed up in her own endearing way. There is no explanation of why they are like this, and their tag name is the end all and be all of their personality. The characters all march through the plot like dutiful actors hitting the mark because that's where the director told them to go. No matter that it's out of character (Oh but they have none), or that it contradicts what they said 5 minutes ago. The lead character is from 20 miles South in New Jersey. She acts like she's from Nebraska or Iowa or something. Big doe eyed sucker from some farm, or fall out shelter. Doesn't the local library have internet access? There really is no excuse for being that naive in life.Now there were things I did like. The house she moves from looks like a working man's house in New Jersey. The apartment looks like one I rented in Boston. The bar looked like a New York bar. If we could get rid of the actors, and plot we'd have the beginnings of a pretty good Andy Warhol movie. Call it "Apple".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Summer!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure many of you will disagree with me ranking this as the best movie of the summer, but considering the competition its no contest. I have seen MI2, The Perfect Storm, Chicken Run, What Lies Beneath, etc... and none of them left me feeling as satisfied as Coyote Ugly. I have not seen Gladiator yet so I will not comment on it, but the majority of the summer movies I've seen this year made me wish I had stayed home. Yet Coyote Ugly had it all. A beautiful cast (both male and female), a story line you actually believe could happen, and a great soundtrack. The audience laughed, cried, and for the first time this year the audience cheered at the end. This is not Shakespeare by any means and it is not Showgirls either (sorry guys). However, if you just want to have a good time at the movies I highly recommend Coyote Ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, after months and months of endless waiting, a movie is produced that not only Men and Women can thoroughly enjoy together, but also manages to make the audience feel good about paying $8.00 per ticket. Oh, by the way, I said produced didn't I, but I forgot to mention the masters name...Producer extraordinaire Jerry Bruckheimer adds yet another great movie to his resume (including Armageddon, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, American Gigolo, and Top Gun among many others). Bruckheimer also maintains his reputation for producing movies that first and foremost deal with entertaining his audience...such as Coyote Ugly. This movie offers something for everyone, whether it be attractive women controlling men completely, a great sound track, an aussie hunk, a decent love story, comic relief, a great new talent in Piper Perabo, or the time tested lovable antics of John Goodman... Coyote Ugly delivers. What the critics seemed to have forgotten the occasional attraction we simple moviegoers have to a movie that is just fun to watch. When it comes down to it, that is all Coyote Ugly really is, a fun movie that provides a solid two hours of entertainment for an audience weary of pumped up thrillers and human dramas that leave you in a far worse mood that if you had never even heard of the movie. If you want an earth-shattering tale of tragedy I would suggest that you stay away from that rollicking good time that is Coyote Ugly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trailer is deceiving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed in this movie. Based on the trailer, I expected it to be a sort of "Cocktail" for girls. I was hoping this movie would have a lot of the electric booze-pouring scenes from the trailer, but if you've seen the trailer, you've seen about all there is to see (except for a pretty good wet t-shirt sequence). Unfortunately, though, the movie spends a lot of time with Piper Perabo's character whining about her songwriting career and a totally unnecessary, by-the-numbers romance with the type of movie character I like to call an "Accent Boy" (i.e., apparently, his whole charm lies in his foreign accent, here, Australian; see also Ben Chaplin in "The Truth About Cats and Dogs"). I found the romance scenes boring, and the other bar girls' characters underdeveloped. I thought this movie would be about a bar (e.g. "Cheers"), but it's really just another insecure-girl-goes-to-NYC-to-make-it-big story. You've seen this story before, and if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the good stuff already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually can be appealing to females...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I called my friend today to see if she wanted to go see this movie, we agreed that it was one of those movies that you 'want to see, but can't figure out why'. And true, from the commercials and previews it looked like a bunch of girls dancing in a bar so I don't know what appeal it really had for me (Besides a tiny shot of the attractive Adam Garcia).So we walked into the theater with basically no expectations except to kill a few hours on a lazy Sunday afternoon. We were both surprised at how much we enjoyed the movie.Most of the main characters (Kevin, Violet, Mr. Sanford) were quite endearing to the point where I actually cared about what happened to them. Many times I sit through a movie where, by the end, I am not even aware of the characters' names, let alone feel any emotion for what may or may not happen to them.Maybe my opinion of this movie is somewhat biased because I have a life dream similar to Violet, and by seeing it I can pretend for a few hours that it's actually happening. Sometimes you need to be a little delusional for a couple hours.For anyone who likes guys (and believe me, I do), Adam Garcia should be reason enough to make a trip to the theater. From what I saw of him in the commercial I though he would be mildly attractive. I have to say, Australians have the sexiest accents in the world. He is an attractive man and a terrific actor. I look forward to seeing him in other films in the future.All in all, I learned a lesson today. I learned that while a movie can appear to be tasteless and plotless, commercials may not be accurate. If a movie 'might look good' to you or you have the slightest idea that you might enjoy it, just go for it and see it at a cheap theater. You might just be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent. I was waiting to see this movie for a while, and I was not disappointed. While the trailer does the movie some justice, the plot was actually good even though it started to get a little predictable at the end.I did not expect a whole bunch of girls dancing on the bar for two hours, but that wouldn't have been bad. I had a feeling that it was going to be a girl that was trying to make it in the big city, and it was. Though, I was impressed at the way Violet/Josie (Piper Perabo) started to get the hang of the big city as the movie went on. She started to lose that cute country girl look and took on an edge that seemed appropriate for her character.As for the other girls, even though their parts were small, they played them well. 'Lil (Maria Bello) was very tough as nails, but not as much as Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), who played the violent loner coyote. Cammie (Izabella Miko) and Zoe (Tyra Banks) had minor roles.Overall, I would say that the movie was very well done with an excellent plot, good dancing and "party tricks", i.e. spitting fire and such. Women as well as men would get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashdance revisited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to see this movie on it's first day of screening in New York, just before I went back to Europe.'Coyote Ugly' is a nice romantic comedy, perfectly fit for the generation who didn't grow up with 'Flashdance', Saturday Night Fever etc.Piper Perado plays the young aspiring song-writer who wants to get a major record-deal, write songs and then safely watch others perform her music. But then there's this little snag, called reality. Although the story is not very surprising it is solid and consistent told. We understand why she ends up on the bar dancing (no spoiler here). And at the same time we understand why her father is disappointed. A fine part played by John Goodman. At times their relationship reminded me of the one Madonna and Danny Aiello had in the 'Father Don't Preach' music-video. Father reluctantly sees his daughter grow up. And she only wants him to be proud of her.After I saw the trailer on television I immediately went to the REAL Coyote Ugly Saloon on 1st Avenue on which this film was based (unless there's another one, of course). The real bar is not nearly as flashy as it's celluloid counterpart. But they DO hose down annoying customers with beer and there IS dancing on the bar. However by the female customers, rather than the waitresses. But they do get fresh with you if you happen to order something they don't serve. (anything besides beer and Jack Daniels) And they do drink shots with the costumers. Funny detail is that in the movie is explained why they don't get drunk.I know, I know, we already have Flashdance. (Also from Bruckheimer) but I don't mind if this type of story is being updated now and then, right? Although the soundtrack could sound a bit more contemporary.</fullReview>

My movie partner thinks something has to blow up or be chased by a car to be entertaining - he enjoyed gawking at the Coyotes and I enjoyed gawking at Adam Garcia (which I did not mention to the movie partner). So we both got something out of the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well to put it quite plainly, I've seen better but I was amazed mainly by the leads storyline. While the other Coyote girls were not really given a backstory, I was rather impressed at how the Director just chose to stay focused on Violet's character and her relationship with her dad (a rather impressive Blue-Collar performance by John Goodman), her boyfriend, and the other Coyotes. All in all I'll just say this....Not bad for a Bruckheimer film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is cool. In addition to flying beer bottles, there is a plot. It's about Violet Sanford, a small town girl who wants to sell her songs in the big city. She doesn't want to sing them, she has stage fright. But when a robbery leaves her broke, without a job, and without prospects in the big city, she gets a job as sassy, spunky Jersey, a barkeep at the trendy Coyote Ugly. Will she give up her dreams for a little adrenaline-laced bottle-flipping? Or will her new job give her the confidence she needs to succeed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this movie. I thought it was awesome. It's true the previews don't give you much about the movie, save that it's about a bunch of fun-loving bartendresses who twirl bottles of whiskey and dance wildly. The movie follows a young woman from New Jersey as she moves to NYC to persue a career in the music business, and takes a "day" job at a bar named Coyote Ugly to pay the bills.I thought the movie was a LOT of fun. Being a woman, I was impressed that the female characters were strong, smart and displayed their sexuality proudly without being sluttish or ditzy. The music was incredible, even though the acting by the female lead left something to be desired. I felt the story went in too many directions to really develop any relationships and the editing made for some difficulty in following the movie. But overall the movie was a blast. Great dance scenes and hilarious lines made for an incredible time.It makes me want to stomp on a burning bar right now!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a terrible film. The acting is horrific, the script obviously hammered out in a few hours, and the piece-meal editing of a Bruckheimer film so easily recognizable that for a minute, you think Nick Cage will bust out onto the screen. But, for all its problems, this movie is entertaining in a way. It has a dumb plot, but everything is frantic and fun. The girls are gorgeous, and the Bar is nuts. It really makes you wish that this bar was right down the street from you. You'll hate this movie, but you might walk out smiling if you give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie succeeds as a female fantasy and a male fantasy. Innocent, naive female becomes street smart and learns to celebrate her sexuality--- as a reward she finds true love and a stable income....badass....As a male fantasy, this is a thinly veiled exploitation about a strip joint....And it "titillates" without even showing any skin...What this film lacks in intelligence it makes up for with energy and humour. John Goodman is consistently funny, and Piper Perabu is unbelievably appealing, even though she obviously has very little experience. If the bar actually existed I would definitely be a regular.By the way, if you're looking for deep truth and meaning, don't look here. The film is pure fun, pure fantasy, and pure hormones. But there is a message behind all the funk--- be unafraid. Be very unafraid...... Guys, this is a good date movie. Especially if your date is in high school, is a cheerleader, and likes to dance more than she likes to think--(just like me)--------Robert Murphy of Austin</fullReview>

But the gurls in this one made up for it in a big way. They are sexy, sassy and sweaty. Most of the action takes place in a bar that is wild and weird and lots of fun. There is also danger as the gurls get into tricky situations with all sorts of characters, some of them shady. This movie is pure entertainment and made me want to be a bartender, or at least get into a hot relationship with a female bartender that's for sure. Don't miss one if you like your music loud, your beer ice cold, your ladies strong and smart, and your breasts big and firm. Jerry Bruckheimey has done it again!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Film of a Young Woman Following Her Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, "Coyote Ugly" is worth watching because of Piper Perabo (who plays Violet). I am a fan, having seen most of her films and every episode of "Covert Affairs". She's the spunky girl who follows her dreams. The story is reminiscent of "Flashdance". Violet is a small town girl who wants to become a songwriter and/or singer, but suffers from stage fright.In order to survive in New York City, she takes a bartending job at Coyote Ugly--a rowdy, high-energy joint where the girls are expected to dance provocatively on the bar, sell as many drinks as possible, and appear available--where she discovers her inner chutzpah.The soundtrack is immensely popular and the music helps drive the action. Violet's singing is dubbed by LeAnn Rimes, who makes an appearance on screen. The film has a competent cast including John Goodman, Maria Bello, and others who are fun to spot.Don't think too much while watching this film. Just relax and enjoy the music, the energy, and the formulaic story of a young woman learning to make it on her own.The name (of the bar) Coyote Ugly is a monument to the concept of getting mindlessly drunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coyote Ugly- "I'd be shocked if you last another night!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of the movies I write reviews for are branded 'amazingly bad' nearly every single time and more often than never, I'm left sitting there going, 'did you even watch the damn movie?' Because sometimes, that's how I feel. Sure, I'm all open for people to share their opinions but there's just some out there that make me want to tap them to a chair and play the movie over and over again.Anyway, that's exactly how I feel with this movie. I've read reviews where they judge even the music they use during the film, which is ridiculous - the music choices in Coyote Ugly just help make it.This is a story about Violet Sanford; an aspiring musician who moves to the big apple in hope of getting a record deal. So, that doesn't happen as easily as Violet had hoped and in order to gain some easy money, she becomes a bartender. Oh! But, not just ANY bartender - A Coyote. Sounds fun, doesn't it? They dance on the bar and guys buy them drinks (which they subsequently hardly ever drink). There is a lot of reason behind the making of this film. I mean, for one, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer film; Mr Big himself. So, just because the movie isn't something along the lines of CSI: Miami, doesn't mean it's not worth the watch. It's funny, it has romance, drunk hot guys... drunk hot girls! C'mon, you have to hand it to them - the whole cast made the film good, great even.Personally, I love this movie, I would've given this a 10/10 BUT I had to take into consideration what other people thought. I mean, whether you watch the Director's Cut or the cinema version, it's still worth the watch. Don't take any one review for granted, watch it for yourself. Solicit Opinions. It's totally worth it. I give this 8/10. Thankyou!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you don't know what to say, display for TnA, I guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most clever scene in Coyote Ugly is when Maria Bello explains why the bar is named what it is. She says it's when a woman wakes up in bed with a man after a one night stand and he's so ugly, but you have your arm around him because last night he seemed hot. Desperate, but not wanting to be rude, instead of pulling your arm out from under him you try to chew it off like a trapped coyote. That my friends, is Coyote Ugly.It was much to my surprise that Kevin Smith actually did a rewrite of the film's script at one point. I would imagine if Smith's version was made into the final film that it would be less about the girl's bodies and more about their problems. Instead of so many overhead shots of women dancing on one another, soaked in water, comparing wet t-shirts, I'm sure there would've been more sincere dialog between Violet and her friends. Maybe we would've gotten to know them better. It's all one big "maybe." The film centers around Violet (Perabo), an aspiring songwriter trying to make it in the complicated and relentless world of music. She tries to get her demo tape heard, but is always met with reps that blow her off. Violet leaves home and goes to New York to try her look, but realizing she needs to make end's meet, she goes to work at a bar called "Coyote Ugly" where she will entertain customers by seductively dancing on the bar countertop while pouring drinks and showering her and her fellow employees with water. That's the extent of it.In the meantime, Violet dates a shady guy who she had mistaken for a record exec (Garcia). Let me ask Violet, do you think it's a good idea to date a guy who just tried to pass himself off as a guy who could get you a record deal and doesn't discuss any of his past? Does he seem like the dream guy mothers would want their daughters to date, and could have a good ol' day out with the father? I neglected to mention that the club is run by Lil (Bello). Lil, full name Liliana Lovell, actually runs the real-life Coyote Ugly in New York. Maria Bello was excellent in The Cooler, and does more sure-fire work in this picture. She is still as hilarious as ever, and plays a very strict, yet laidback bartender.Coyote Ugly, even in possession of a decent storyline, is ruined by its own immaturity. There are too many overhead shots of women on the bar countertop that go nowhere and aren't arousing or entertaining at all. I appreciate John Goodman's role as Violet's protective and caring dad, but the scenes with him are far to spread out and far too short to fully enjoy. I imagine if Kevin Smith was responsible for writing the entire screenplay maybe the movie would've been more about the daddy/daughter relationship rather than the women.The story isn't gripping, but it works for a while. Until the bar comes into play. Then it's down to twelve year olds controlling the camera. Piper Perabo is gorgeous, and is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood today in terms of looks and acting skills. She still hasn't had that "breakout" role that has taken her career to new heights. Surprisingly, as juvenile as this picture can be, this really didn't jump-start any future projects for her. Nor anyone else in this film.Starring: Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, and John Goodman. Directed by: David McNally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. I know it's definitely not the best film ever made, but it's my favourite one. I watched it when I was 11, and I couldn't resist on its magic. My sister owned the OST, and there were many times per month I used to listen to it. Anyway, I think that the whole story of a girl coming to the big city, full of dreams and no money and finally makes it, is totally motivating. I suppose many guys will think I'm stupid loving a chick-flick, but keep in mind that it's also about a bar full of bartenders singing, dancing and... showing what they've got!!! But, it was also a great film. I've watched it more than 15 times ( I stopped counting four years ago), and I gather it's gonna be the movie I'll be watching in future... If you haven't watched it, run and rent a DVD or blu-ray disc of it... A night full of joy is guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is a film that I have to admit I was looking forward to watching, I'm not normally a fan of rom-coms, but this film had been described to me as a raunchy teen drama so I thought it was worth a watch. However imagine my disappointment when I realised it was basically just a boy meet girl film all over again only with a bar where girls dance and sing.After 15 minutes I was bored and ready to turn it off when there came a scene that made me stick around to watch the rest, the scene is when Violet is having breakfast and the other "coyotes" walk in. The scene isn't a fantastic one but it was enough to keep me watching and I have to admit I enjoyed the film for a small time in the middle. It was thrilling to watch the girls dance of the bar and the way in which customers where served and pelted with water if they ordered it, it was just a shame to see it ruined so soon and revert back to the badly written rom-com it had begun.The last ten minutes are in all honesty probably the worst last ten minutes of a film I have seen in a long time, honestly beginning with the toll booths stupid light flashing, the ridiculous u-turn the turning off the power; then Le-Ann Rhymes appearing and everyone being happy it was stupid and to end the film with the biggest cliché of all other than a freeze frame... a slow motion kiss, was ridiculous and took away all the enjoyment I had from the mid-section of the film.This film is not raunchy and it is not a teen drama, my friend has lied to me and I cannot help feeling that nearly two hours of my life has been completely wasted and wish I had turned it off after the appalling start.5/10</fullReview>

This movie really inspires me to compose music (NOT dance on a bar! - LOL). I thought that Kevin had some awesome dance moves, and he seemed like an overall nice guy (something I have a hard time finding for some reason). He tried his best to cure Violet of her so-called "stage fright", which I can proudly say I have FINALLY overcome after years of jamming' parties and karaoke! She never gave up, even after her apartment was broken in to and it seemed like the whole world around her was falling apart. Her father finally came around, and all it took was a car accident! HAH! And I betcha he married his nurse! Overall very entertaining, and I give it 2 thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More watchable than it probably deserves to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director listed for this movie is someone named David McNally. Who? The writing credits are given to Gina Wenkos. Who? Actually Kevin Smith apparently did some work on the script, I hear. Anyway, there is only one name that matters in these credits. Jerry Bruckheimer. Of all the slick, commercial, featherweight productions this man has made, this one might be the most slick. And that's saying something. Coyote Ugly almost makes Days of Thunder look like Shawshank Redemption.That said, the movie is often rather entertaining. Much of the credit would seem to go to Piper Perabo who plays the main character. Her name is Violet, and she's just moved to New York to pursue a song writing career, but it seems like the big city will swallow her up before she ever gets her chance. She ends up taking a job at the bar of record, and the rest of the film details the ups and downs of her time there. It must be noted that Piper Perabo is not only beautiful, but quite charming and likable. As someone watching the movie, you really hope she succeeds. A bad casting choice here could have really given us a turkey of a film. The rest of the cast is spunky, and generally talented. Maria Bello shines as Lil, the owner of the bar. She is actually based on Lil Lovell who was the founder of the franchise. Adam Garcia shows some promise as the male lead, but its a thankless role. John Goodman adds some laughs and acting gravitas as Violet's dad. Tom Brady's baby momma Bridget Moynahan is there as a bitchy bartender. A chunky LeAnn Rimes plays herself in an ending scene. She also provides the vocals whenever Piper is singing. Tyra Banks isn't in it as much as you'd hope.There is not a shred of credibility in any situation we the audience are presented with. For example, the Coyote Ugly bar is about the rowdiest bar east of the Double Duece in Jasper, MO. Yet, there is only ONE bouncer who sits by the door and mostly just reads. Fights in this bar can be broken up simply by throwing a bucket of ice down on the crazy patrons. Violet lives in Chinatown, yet there are never any Asian people around. Kevin seems to be broke and has to do all kinds of odd jobs around town, yet he drives a huge gas-guzzling old car when public transportation would be the likely choice for such a person. Or how about the scene where Violet has just humiliated herself and is hiding out in the bathroom. Another bartender gal informs her that there is a guy at the bar asking about her. "Asking for me?", Violet asks, completely stunned. Because obviously nobody in a bar full of drunk men would ever ask around about a hot new employee. Sure. But this film takes place in a magical dimension known as Bruckheimer Land, where the improbable is not just possible. It is demanded. You know, here's a big question..... since this film was such a hit, why was there never a sequel? Since 85% of all films released from Hollywood now are either a remake, sequel, or based on a comic book, why was no sequel for Coyote Ugly ever made. Heck, this summer we're getting sequels for Hell Boy, and the Hulk. Those weren't even hits!!! 6 of 10 stars for Coyote Ugly.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain awful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does any of this sound familiar: Small-town girl goes to big city to pursue her dreams. Small-town girl faces obstacles in the big bad city. Girl meets some tough-talking friends and does some ethically questionable things in pursuit of her dreams. Girl meets perfect guy who sweeps her off her feet and believes in her. Girl makes all her dreams come true.If you've heard it all before, you're not alone. "Coyote Ugly" breaks no new ground, takes no risks, and doesn't even have any decent acting to redeem the movie. It's almost painful to watch Piper Perabo trying to decide whether her character is tough-and-sexy or sweet-and-innocent. She gets neither quite right, and in truth should've just gone for "porn star" because that's how she comes across.The script is laughably awful, containing lines that surely made movie audiences across the nation groan aloud and roll their eyes. The plot - such as it is - is utterly unrealistic and offers us nothing in the way of insight, profound thinking, or even lighthearted laughs. Some men (mostly teenaged boys) may like this because it features good-looking women dancing on a bar... but even those scenes are fairly tame compared to most of what you'd find in your average PG-rated flick these days. The movie sets back the cause of empowerment of women by at least five decades. Oh, and the soundtrack blows. In fact, there are almost no redeeming qualities here whatsoever.So why the three stars? I'll give one star alone to Maria Bello for her performance as the bar owner who turns out to have a heart under her tough-as-nails exterior. And I'll give another star to the dance sequences, which, while tame, were at least fun and mildly energetic. The final one is for John Goodman, who has one of his worst roles here, but is a cut above anything else in this mess.Two hours of my life I wish I could have back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>coyote ugly........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote ugly tells the story we've all seen a million times, yet i think a plot like girl-next-door moves to big bad city could still work if the script could be spiced up a bit.A good actor can do wonders with a bad script (if the director lets them) and a great script AND great direction can bring out an outstanding performance but in this film Piper whatever her last name is couldn't even do that and after wondering why, i came to the conclusion that she just simply can't act and her 'performance' is what let the film down.I couldn't emote with her cause her acting had no depth. In the scenes where i was suppose to feel sorry for her, i didn't. She doesn't have any screen presence, and she reacted to lines BEFORE the other had said it. I can't believe out of all the takes they did that these takes were the best.Adam Garcia had not done much screen acting at the time but his performance was okay.....he didn't need to characterize at all so all he had to do was stand there and say the lines and hoped it sound convincing. I was entertained by his little jiggy on the bar for about half a second but the film could have done well without it.The bar scenes were just stupid, i didn't enjoy them and from where i come from you don't have to be wild and crazy to get up on a bar and shake your ass. There was nothing seedy or shocking about it in fact i was worried about the patrons safety when they started spraying water everywhere and going by piper's reaction to people dancing on a bar, obviously she had never been out of the house and to a party.....This film will only be enjoyed by teenies. So if your 18 and over save yourself the time and avoid coyote ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I love this film and it's one I can watch for hours on end without EVER getting bored! I'm 16 and hooked. Not because of the romance involved (how lucky Piper Perabo was 2 kiss and get involved otherwise with Adam Garcier), but because of the whole singing and desire 2 follow her heart. I too sing, and am starting a drama course at college in a few weeks.The film shows how hard and cruel life can be, deterring girls from thinking that getting into the music industry is easy. Violet took the plunge at the end, she never gave up fighting for what she wanted. Coyote Ugly Rocks!!!! A well wrote and superbly acted film, give Coyote Ugly credit where due!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I accidentally tuned in on this movie on Cable over the weekend. What a pleasure this film was. This was an excellent relief from all the realism on the T.V. and in most of the movies today. Bette Davis was correct that in todays T.V. there's too much realism. I agree. Anyone can play realism in the movies or on T.V.. You see it on the streets and in the news. This is acting? Of course not. The problem with Coyote Ugly, with most people, is that it's just good old fashioned entertainment to take you out of this lousy world we live in with nothing but a bunch of psychotics and neurotics you have to deal with everyday of your life. The reason that I love the Jerry Springer show is that everyone on his program is so over-the-edge that it's entertaining, and that's what made the movies years ago so great to watch. They could take the worse script there is and make it believable because they knew their craft - acting! This film has everything in it. A girl down on her luck. Falls in love. Has a Father than doesn't like what she's doing, but comes around. Goes for the Gold in life, and finally succeeds. If you think about it, this movie is almost a modern remake, in many ways, of "The Jazz Singer".I loved every foot, minute, and second of this movie, but - with John Goodman playing the father, I almost expected Rosanne to show up and yell out, "Dannnnnnn! Becky's working in a trashy bar!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've loved this movie ever since I first saw it. The outline of this small town girl going out in search of her dreams in NYC, really provides a positive outlook for anyone wanting to get out their home with their parents and be out on their own in the big city. Before this movie, I had never heard of or seen Piper Perabo or Adam Garcia before, but now whenever I do see them in a movie, I remember what a great performance they gave in Coyote Ugly, and just that motivates me to see that particular movie. Definitely see this movie, because you won't be disappointed by any means. It's the perfect film for all people with all different tastes in movies. I'm not one to watch something over and over again, so that definitely says something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly was the first movie to make me declare my devotion to a single movie as my "favorite." Having only been ten years old when I saw it and immediately liked it, I'm assuming most pre-teens nowadays will enjoy it. In fact, I will venture to say that it appeals to all types of people, as it is not your typical "chick flick", but it is certainly not a movie solely for men who see the cover and immediately pick it up, wanting to see chicks dressed in skimpy outfits and dancing on a bar.The film's stars are displayed in the film at their absolute best in both acting and appearance. Piper Perabo kick-started her movie career with her leading role, later being cast in the family favorite, Cheaper by the Dozen. Adam Garcia was at his very cutest in this film. A couple of years after the film was released, he appeared in Riding in Cars with Boys, playing a forgettable role for anyone not a die-hard fan of his acting. In this film, however, he and his charming Australian accent shine undeniably as the boy-toy of Piper Perabo's character. This film also launched the costars into stardom, and even the actual bar Coyote Ugly, which is located about an hour away from my hometown.As the old saying goes, you should never judge a book by its cover. This film may appear to be targeting a predominantly male audience, but it is also a brilliant blend of coming-of-age wisdom, family crisis, and romantic drama. It presents all aspects of Jersey girl Violet Sanford's life and journey to stardom with smart humor and inopportune situations. Featuring a few timeless songs on its intelligently varied soundtrack, it creates a vibe with absolutely nothing to criticize.This being one of my favorite movies of all time and featuring my favorite song of all time, I am quite convinced that this movie was created flawlessly and would appeal to all audiences, but I tend to be very opinionated. However, if you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your friends OR your spouse on any given weekend, I would highly recommend giving Coyote Ugly a try. Recognizing some of your favorite actors of the present will undoubtedly be only half the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quality of John Goodman's performance was surprisingly good considering the movie itself has a lot to be desired.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie. I found it full of clichés i.e small town girl trying to make it in the "Big City" as some kind of struggling artist, her apartment gets broken into, she's down on her luck and then gets hired to be a well paid Coyote. However, despite all of the "cheese" I found John Goodman's performance to be one of his best. I'm not sure if his performance appeared to be one of his best because the abilities of his cast mates have a lot to be desired or if he truly gave a good performance. I also have to admit that I have not seen everything that John Goodman has been in so I can't comment on all of his performances. I just thought it interesting to note that such a poor movie could have a quality performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Piper Perabo is a great new talent to watch. Her acting ability and style to her role in this movie is a pleasure to watch. Her behind the scenes interviews, shows she is a hard worker and will do what it takes to get the job done. I also enjoyed the performance of Bridget Moynahan, her acting and timing as Rachel, worked very well with Piper Perabo, when she started at working at the bar, replacing Zoe. Veteran John Goodman plays a perfect single father, trying to care and do the right thing for his daughter and in the end helps her make the right decision. The story was easy to follow and the director made it feel real. The addition of Lyann Rymes singing at the end was a great ending. It is a great movie and one that you can watch more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie and I think it is a very good story. Forget a litle bit about the image. It tells a story of a girl chasing her dreams, despite her stage fear she as to win and she finally beats the stage fear. For me, thats what this movie is about, a small town young girl who leaves her home place, to pursue her dreams, who finds herself in a distant, diferent, and wild place (New York City), and despite all that she makes her dreams come true. Its a good lesson. The script was cool, well written, the feelings of the characters are involving, and whith great deph. It is not only a movie where good girls shake themselves in a bar, as some people think, it is much more than that. The best actor was certainly Jonh Goodman, as Violet's father. Piper Perabo's performance, has Violet Sanford was well made, she was able to give that inocent/country girl style. The older coyote Lil(Maria Belo)has a leader and boss, but with origins a litle similar to Violet, was a well atchieved performance. One of the highlights of the movie, is Leann Rimes song "Can't figth the moonligth", one of the best songs I have hever heard. In fact it is one of my favorites.</fullReview>

Violet is a waitress with ambitions to make it in the big city (NY this time) as a singer-songwriter (what else really :). The movie follows all the necessary steps (work sucks at first, meets boyfriend, work's getting better, boyfriend is great, breakdown at work, break-up with boyfriend, thinking about returning, chat with dad that she has to stay to make it, finally makes up with boyfriend and makes it in music industry). Now, we've all seen it before (showgirls comes to mind), but it's carried out really good in this movie. Perabo is perfectly cast as innocent but sexy star, Garcia is good as boyfriend and Goodman is perfect as dad and comic relief. Not a brilliant movie, but just fun to watch and pretty flawless. 7/10, which is high for the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly was made for boys between the ages of 13 and 16. One of the worst movies of the year. Not impressed with this one by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Gone in 60 Seconds," "Armageddon," "Con Air," etc) Piper Perabo ("The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle") -- a wide-eyed beauty from central casting -- is the movie's generic ingenue, a girl named Violet from small town New Jersey who moves to New York to pursue her dreams of being a songwriter. Of course, even though she grew up just down the turnpike from Manhattan, she's as naive as a farmer's daughter and learns the hard way that peddling your demo tape to snide receptionists at record label offices isn't going to get you anywhere in the Big City.So instead of becoming an instant music biz success, Violet finds herself working at the meat packing district's wildest road house, Coyote Ugly.Staffed by 102-lb. sexpots who habitually shake their stuff atop the bar in size two leather pants and tank tops, the joint is packed wall-to-wall every night with hooting, drooling patrons that the girls tease like pole-dancers to coax drinks into them and money out of them. Written in Screenwriting 101 style, packed with every New York City cliché in the book (her dank, dingy flat is broken into her first week in town), and overflowing with young girls in wonderbras while dancing, the first half of "Coyote Ugly" plays like it was penned by a 13-year-old boy who just discovered masturbation. For the second half, the script must have been handed off to a 13-year-old girl who thinks Britney Spears is the greatest musical talent the world has ever known, because the rest of the movie is launched by a "Face it dad, I'm not your little girl anymore" speech and built around Violet overcoming stage fright and chasing her dream of selling bubble-gum pop songs - aided, of course, by the charming encouragement of a handsome boy (Australian actor Adam Garcia) who just knows she can do it!And yes, Violet sings. A lot. It's an endless source of unintentional comedy because when she's slinking across the bar at Coyote Ugly, singing along to the jukebox (each Coyote girl has a gimmick, that's hers), Perabo warbles in her own, weak and gritty voice. But when belting out one of the acoustic Lilith Faire-lite ditties she hopes to sell some day, suddenly she's a honey-voiced songbird, courtesy of audio looping by jailbait country music star LeAnn Rimes (who has a cameo in the finale). Another hearty laugh stems from the fact that "Coyote Ugly" takes place in a picturesquely gritty, fantasy version of NYC in which a 21-year-old cutie pie bartender can walk down an alley at 4 a.m. in a 15-inch skirt and knee-highs, counting her tips without a care in the world.On the respectability front, the picture's one saving grace is John Goodman, who is blue collar perfection as Violet's modest, toll-collector pop.But even though "Coyote Ugly" is tedious, obvious and badly staged, it does have an infectious spirit. That's hardly enough to save this one aimed at the can't-wait-to-be-21 crowd. </fullReview>

After I've seen it I'm quite surprised it actually made it to the silver screen. Probably because the title song was marketed as a hit. So, stay away from this film and do something more enjoyable!

The performances (especially those of Perabo, TyraBanks, Maria Bello, and an embarrassing John Goodman) arelaughabley over dramatic. Coyote Ugly is so tawdry, sappy, andbrain dead that it becomes hysterically funny. Watch out for ascene where Perabo stops a bar fight by performing a Blondiesong!! I dare you not to snicker at a scene where John Goodman's"inspirational" speech to Perabo from his hospital bed. If you canenjoy a campy cheese fest, then rent this film.

		<fullReview>..or nothing else is on..or if you're a sixteen year old girl..then by all means enjoy but don't say you were not warned!There is limited appeal in this uneasy combination of 'Flashdance', 'Valley of the Dolls', and 'Cocktail.' If you have never seen another movie, all this might seem new to you. If you've seen any of the ones I mentioned, or have lived on this planet for longer than five months, you can see it all coming a mile away. The plot (you should excuse the expression) is paper thin, the acting is amateurish for a high school play and the biggest complaint of all is its not bad enough to be good..its just bad enough to be bad. I DID enjoy seeing Melanie Lynskey, who was so memorable in 'Heavenly Creatures' and she did a passable New Jersey accent. I guess you have to pay bills, but I hope she gets better opportunities in better movies before she is stuck in the second female lead forever. I enjoyed Perabo much more in 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' but part of that could be because she is not carrying the whole movie with that one. She does not have the screen presence necessary for you to even consider the possibility that you are seeing a future star. She might be a legit actress someday, but you can't tell from anything seen here. She is not helped by a dreadful script, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really bad PG-13 "tease" movie that should have been made as an R-rated guilty pleasure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly might have been much more effective if the film-makers had made it an R-rated guilty pleasure/exploitation film (with plenty of nudity.) But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days, we end up with a movie like this: a PG-13 "tease" flick that isn't allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone.The script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing could be done with them. There were also a lot of points where it seemed like I was watching a music-video rather than a movie.The film's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads. We get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits.....but only so much could be shown due to the PG-13 constraints. There's plenty of cleavage and toned, heaving bodies doing some well-choreographed dance numbers, but there's no nudity or sex to speak of. Tyra Banks (she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age) is also in the movie for a very small amount of time. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some genuine acting potential.The only people I could see this movie appealing to is pre-pubescent boys who aren't allowed to watch R-rated movies yet. That audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect, but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated.Rating: the movie-1 the women-10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Total fun movie, nice DVD "extras", I give it a solid "7".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film "Coyote Ugly" gets it name from the bar where the girls work, apparently a real bar of the same name in NYC, but this film was shot on a set. The lead actress Piper Perabo was chosen from about 4000 girls, and she does a fine job, very believable as "Violet". In fact, her life leading up to this film paralleled the character very closely. She looks a little like both Jennifer Lopez and Sarah Jessica Parker, and delivers her lines much like Parker would have.Storyline - young Violet, mother dead, father (John Goodman) works as toll booth operator on the NJ Turnpike, she decides to move to NYC to realize her dream of being a successful songwriter, against dad's wishes. Meets all usual obstacles, rejection, apartment is robbed, broke, she quite accidentally finds about Coyote Ugly as one worker/dancer is leaving. Not "her cup of tea", she perseveres anyway. Also meets a nice young man who also helps her get over her fear of performing on stage.Although it looks like Perabo does her own singing, as we learn on the DVD extras, Leann Rimes does all her singing, dubbing her voice to match Perabo's vocal style. Rimes also does an appearance near the end. Goodman is his usual good self as dad.The DVD has selectable sound in either DTS or Digital Dolby 5.1. I selected DTS and the surround track was fine. There were a couple of "glitches" in the video, but overall was just fine. "Extras" included a commentary track by the "girls", which is fun to listen to, but not particularly helpful in understanding subtlties of the film. There are deleted scenes and short features on how some of the stars were selected. Anyway, the film is a nice story, has some fun barroom action and dancing, no violence nor bad language, and only subtle sex suggestions. A good, fun movie for young and old alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER*** Do not read this, if you think about watching that movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway)If you are wondering whether to see "Coyote Ugly" or not: don't! It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", one could say. The plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American Dream. The young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in New York. The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (Director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails in convincing one of "Jersey's" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and quite funny thing) about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.I was very astonished, that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this... what happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff.If you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this flick.Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film last night. It was a toss-up between this and "What Lies Beneath", but the final choice came from my mates who said that "What lies.." would be a film where some old farts try to act young - which is quite justified for Harrison, but Michelle?? Nah. Anyway, maybe I expect to much from films nowadays - they seem to be thinking up new adorable ideas which are both romantic, funny and interesting, so I thought this was going to thrill me with some more crazy innovative stuff. But, I'm afraid not. They seem to have cut this down to a sequence of little "nice" moments which don't fit together very well, so the result hardly involves at all. The script wasn't funny (apart from the occasional quip by John Goodman), and the ideas upon which the film were based were silly and not-very-clever-at-all. A nice idea, done many times, but still nice - but it was rubbish (couldn't think of any clever adjectives there). Oh well. ?5 down the drain, at least I don't live in London where it would have been twice that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't say "Coyote Ugly" was the worst movie I've ever seen and all the girls I've met so far who saw that movie really liked it. To be honest - I didn't. First of all most of the plot is not that realistic (are they sure there are filthy bars like the one in the movie with girls like Tyra Banks in them?). Nevertheless my basic problem with this movie is that our hero (yes - she might be talented and some of her songs sound good in the beginning) needs almost the whole one and a half hours to fight the fear of getting on stage. Finally she makes it BUT it is her last time on stage - because she prefers to be a song writer. OK... Whatever... Then what the heck is this movie all about? If you don't want to be a star just forget about it? I don't know. Like I said - girls like it - but they also like the way the nice songs were destroyed by LeeAnn Rimes - who seems to be the actual hero. I don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Much More Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A talented young woman from New Jersey, filled with hope and desire, moves to New York to chase her dreams of becoming a songwriter in `Coyote Ugly,' directed by David McNally and starring Piper Perabo. Against the wishes of her father, Bill (John Goodman), but with his acquiescent approval, Violet (Perabo) begins her quest and soon learns what every aspiring newcomer to show business discovers: It's tough out there. Soon, in order to pay the rent and keep the dream alive, on a tip she seeks employment in a bar called Coyote Ugly; the owner, Lil (Maria Bello) lets her `audition (work one night)' to see if she can handle their kind of action. It's a tough gig, but Violet knows she's going to have to make certain sacrifices if she's to succeed. And that is really what this movie is all about: Personal character, having the tenacity to maintain ideals and dignity, and deciding what and how much one must be willing to sacrifice to achieve one's goals; and most importantly, having enough heart to see it all through. Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet; she's fresh, somewhat naive (but not entirely), and the way she presents her character makes it easy to connect with her right away. She becomes someone you care about quickly, and there are moments early on, especially when she first arrives in New York, that allow you to emphasize with her immediately. There's a fragility about her, but at the same time she exhibits a strength of character and sense of morality that is becoming; and being able to convey this level of complexity convincingly is a tribute to her ability as an actress. John Goodman also does a good job as her father, a caring bear of a man who obviously has nothing but the best intentions for his daughter at heart. His performance, and the way the situation of his having to let Violet go is handled makes it believable, and helps create an emotional bond between them and the audience. It's something with which many will be able to identify, and it becomes one of the underlying strengths of the film.  One of the weaknesses of this project comes, not from the movie itself, but from the `promotion' of the movie; in this case the theatrical trailer, which is a gross misrepresentation of what `Coyote Ugly' really is. Certainly the `coyotes' and the bar are a significant part of the film, and it's all exceptionally well and tastefully done, and is a fun part of the movie and definitely gives it some life; but I think the presentation in the trailer will do more to alienate a cross-section of audience that ultimately would appreciate this movie, but initially at least will not even see it, and only because of a misconception caused by the preview. It must be noted that this is a PG-13; there is nary a profane word, and no sex or nudity in it. It is an upbeat, entertaining film that should be readily embraced by a much wider audience than one would expect simply from seeing the trailer. The excellent supporting cast includes Adam Garcia (Kevin), Izabella Miko (Cammie), Melanie Lynskey (Gloria), Bridget Moynahan (Rachel), Tyra Banks (Zoe) and LeAnn Rimes (In a cameo as herself). Hopefully, if only by word-of-mouth, this movie will gain the audience it deserves. Reminiscent of `Flashdance,' there is a universal theme here of having a dream and going for it. In the final analysis, `Coyote Ugly' is a decent film that will appeal to anyone who's ever had or pursued a dream. Do yourself a favor, put any preconceived notions aside and check this one out; I think you'll be glad you did. I rate this one 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Babelicious dancing girls and wicked cocktails aside, this is perfectly harmless fun that manages to subtly entertain while looking deceptively stylish. "Flashdance" it's not, though it tries its damnest to copy Adrian Lyne's signature flamboyant style. The story is way too familiar - small town girl goes to the big, dirty city to sell her soul, I mean songs.In the case of Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo), one too many rejections land her way in over her head in a gofor-broke party bar with the unlikely moniker of Coyote Ugly. Big bucks to be had, but you've got to earn them the hard way. Tossing bottles of Jack with the finesse of a swaggering Tom Cruise (remember "Cocktail"?), brazenly shakin' your groove thing (that pesky "Flashdance" again), and maybe even belting out a song or two ("Little Voice" anyone?). Violet, affectionately renamed Jersey, catches on to the after-hours ropes, but doesn't let go of her dream. Oh, you've heard this one before?Not a whit of imagination, but every predictable moment is drenched with an emotion closely resembling heart. Violet tackles the bright lights of the big city and the love of her man (hunky Adam Garcia) with let's-put-on-a-show gusto that's endearing in its struggle to seem genuine. With her big-hearted Dad (John Goodman) to show her the way, there is no mountain high enough to keep Violet from making her show-biz fantasies come true.I poke fun, but the truth is the package works like a big old fun house mirror. Images are not always what they seem. Coyote Ugly is one bog party, where zany girls light the bar on fire (literally) and burn the floor with some frisky moves. When the action is elsewhere in the sprawling jungle of New York City, it looks gritty in an artsy, artificially lit way. The plot twists and turns can be seen coming from a mile off, but much is forgiven when the costumes are tantalizing and the dreams burns bright. Excellent psychological approach...Perabo, the month's "It" girl, works her story with effort. Her chemistry with just about everybody - from the bitchy bar dancers to her best buddy from home - is vintage good girl clicks with the universe. Bar dances are a disappointing, quick-cutting mishmash of leather-clad thighs, kick-butt boots and bare midriffs. Relentless strings of pop tunes wear thin early on. A mixed bag, but one that's chock full of delicious eye candy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, the Internet Movie Database only allows 1,000 words, which is not nearly enough to sufficiently communicate how horrible this movie is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The drawback of watching the huge amount of movies that I watch is that you find yourself watching the same previews over and over again. I saw the preview for Coyote Ugly so many times that I was sick and tired of the movie before it was even released. I was unable to decipher any kind of plot from the preview, and the reason is simple. If the producers had allowed the preview to reveal the extensively recycled and re-done and re-made and used up plot, no one would have bothered to watch the movie. From a business point of view, that's very understandable, and I respect the decision not to reveal how shallow this movie is too early on. However, after seeing the entire film, I have realized that Coyote Ugly is packed full of every cliche ever created by every unoriginal and boring film ever made in cinematic history.(spoilers) Young kid decides to leave home to pursue wild dreams in the big city. Encounters difficulties, gets robbed, decides to go home, father encourages her to keep trying, success is inevitably and laughably attained. I accurately predicted at least 80% of everything that happened in this film. Did anyone not know that there would be a robbery at her new apartment in New York? Was anyone surprised that she would have some sort of superficial problem getting her music heard? Is it that hard to predict she would succeed at the end? Okay, I'll admit that if she failed, the movie probably would never have been made (what a relief that would have been). You can't put a Fight Club ending or an Arlington Road ending on a movie like this. But look at the way the entire movie panned out. Violet was completely isolated from reality during the entire film. Think about the logic here. Violet goes to New York to become a star, but obviously has trouble getting a record executive to listen to her music. She goes home one day to find her apartment robbed. This is the pathetic attempt to make it seem like the real world, but even if it did do that, this is where it stopped. For the rest of the film, everything worked out perfectly. The first guy she meets becomes her wonderful new boyfriend. The first group of girls she overhears in a diner are talking about the lucrative jobs they have, and how one is leaving and there will soon be a difficult effort to replace her. This very same bar happens to be the hottest bar in town, and when Violet inquires about the opening, she is hired within minutes. You gotta be kidding me.Besides all that, everything that happened in the plot is just recycled garbage that has been seen dozens of times before. Violet finds a cute new boyfriend. They get in the usual fight somewhere in the middle of the film, and when she tries to call thinking she wants to apologize or something, she hangs up a split second before he grabs up his receiver, anxiously saying "Hello? Hello?" to the usual dialtone. She goes to his house to make things right, and just as she shows up, he's got some girl walking into his apartment (THAT was the most predictable element of all). But wait! He's not sleeping with her, he's showing her the apartment to see if she might want to move in! He's a sweetheart after all! How about Violet's job? Obviously some problem has to come up (the suddenly lonely parent, as always, winding up in the hospital), and she has to get fired at least once. When she does, she decides to get a job at a quiet little restaurant (which, for some reason, doesn't seem to have electricity), but eventually goes back to her old job. The bar scenes were both laughable and ridiculously exaggerated. No bar in the world looks like that, and even if one did, there would not be scantily clad female bartenders dancing on the bar every few minutes, and even if there were, there would be about 50 bouncers, not just one. You would think a policy or two would change when the airheaded blonde Cammie was pulled into the crowd and fondled by a bunch of drunks. I guess nothing came of that because she didn't seem upset about it at all. Every bar scene in this film was the result not of skillful filmmaking, but of audience manipulation.What a pathetic waste of time. Everything in this movie has been done before, and it has never been done worse than it was done here. Even though New York City is portrayed terribly, at least they thought to throw in an acute bit of stage fright for Violet so she would have a problem that coincides slightly with reality, even though this was also ridiculously unoriginal (ever see Runaway Bride? EXACTLY the same thing). Coyote Ugly is an awful movie. It follows a formula that is more easily decipherable than the script, and it is the kind of film that will probably be hugely entertaining to you if you have never seen a movie. If you don't like being jerked around at the movie theater, avoid this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok I have been waiting for months for this movie to come out and yes i will admit the only reason i wanted to see it was because there was many hot women in this movie.... at first.Then I read the reviews and saw it it got 1 and a half stars in my local newspaper and I was kinda of thrown off by it but because i had read a plot summary i decided to give a shot. Lemme tell you I am so happy I saw this movie. Not only are the women in this movie trey hot but it is an emotional movie as well. Of course those harsh critics who went for a complex plot and in depth character development and guys who went to see it just for the chicks are going to say it sucked because they didn't go to see the movie to be entertained they went for T&amp;A (which because its pg-13 i knew wasn't gonna happen). Well not only did this movie please me it almost made me teary eyed (and i do not cry at movies at Titanic I didn't even come close I laughed at my friend who did). And because Pierabo is so sweet and innocent-looking she sold me. So in my final analysis if your looking for a date movie this is it, and if you want to go to the movies to critique it because you knew you were going to hate it anyway then don't. If you liked High Fidelity or Keeping the Faith, you will be pleased.P.S. To all you Coyote Ugly haters, you probably thought Battlefield Earth was a classic or perhaps Sphere</fullReview>

It was nothing like "Flashdance" or a female-"Cocktail." The dancing was minimal and the close-up shots of boots on a bar is hardly dancing. New-comer Piper will get better roles but she should continue taking those acting lessons. Adam Garcia showed the most potential to breakout. Maybe it's just me but did anybody else think he looked like a blend of Dylan McDermott &amp; Ralph Macchio? The movie was derivative and cliche. The soundtrack was the only good part.

		<fullReview>This movie was in a way two movies. A story about Piper Perabo's character, Violet Harper, and a seperate story about the bar. Each one alone, isn't much of a story, but together they make a real good tale.It is by no means without it's flaws...you were never sure if it was a feel good, heartwarming tale of the girl trying to make it big, or the sometimes dark and seedy environment of a bar that takes female empowerment to a whole new level. It's best moments are when it's both. It shows a more human side to the girls at the bar, and adds more depth to Perabo's character.No, this movie isn't for someone looking for an Oscar winner. It isn't. Some of the acting (read Tyra Banks) is weak. Some of the story is too good to be true. You may not like what it has to say about men...or women for that matter. But if you aren't able to suspend all disbelief, and let yourself be entertained for a solid hour and half, then don't go see this.Even if you just go to see it for the hot girls, you'll get your money's worth. But you'll find this is actually quite an entertaining movie. I'd go see it again. In fact, I'm fairly sure I will...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly: Coyote Ugly: Rather than follow the classic script - marry your high school sweetheart, settle down in a house with a white picket fence, 2.5 kids and a dog named spot, Violet sets off (against her father's wishes) for New York to fulfill her dreams as a songwriter. Our heroine soon discovers that life in the big city isn't easy, and getting noticed in the music business is even worse. In order to make ends meet she gets a job as a bartender at a local bar. Let the games begin.I've always found it interesting that women (at least the ones I know) will go to a movie, no matter how bad it looks, as long as their favorite star (Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, etc) is in it. I can't stand the thought of an actor I enjoy being in a lousy movie, and tend to avoid them like the plague. But all that came to a crashing halt when I saw the trailer for "Coyote Ugly" - I didn't think "Hey, this is the movie based on the GQ article" or "This looks like an interesting story". The only thought that came to mind was "Wow!" So much for my credibility?Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, known for such testosterone laden dramas as "Con Air" and "The Rock", has dropped the guns and explosions in favor of bars and bombshells (the non-exploding kind) in this homage to "Flashdance". The first half-hour of the movie is like a trip to a strip bar with several notable exceptions: the girls look better, they keep their clothes (what little they happen to be wearing) on, they can actually dance, the crowd is mixed and everyone is having a great time. Furthermore, you don't have to worry about a cover charge, choking on smoke, or paying $6 for a watered down beer. Unfortunately, they choose to spoil the fun with a "plot"- it seems that our little Violet has performance anxiety and gets involved with a cute do-gooder boytoy. Will she triumph over her fears, become a success, and marry her Prince Charming? Honest, it's not predictable (note: heavy sarcasm alert!). They should have spent more time in the bar and less time in reflection. Story aside, there actually are some good performances.The casting call for the part of Violet involved hundreds of girls and I can say without fear of reprisal or recrimination that they found exactly what they were looking for in Piper Perabo - she is cute, dynamic and possessed of a wide-eyed innocence that is genuine. Not only does she have to look adorable, but she had to take piano, guitar, and singing and dancing lessons for the role (doing quite well at each I might add). It was also a pleasure to see Maria Bello once a again - she was the no-nonsense-tough-as-nails doctor on ER who quit to pursue other interests and whom I feared would join David Caruso at the "Home for Abandoned Actors". If your script calls for a "Gutsy Broad" she's your woman. The one piece of casting that sticks out worse than sunflower in a field of tulips is Tyra Banks - her character retires from the bar to go to law school. Please, the only way I'm going to buy that one is if I've had one too many drinks beforehand - I would try to diminish her successes in any way, she is a beautiful, successful, vibrant woman, but by her own admission, if you're looking for brains from her, you had best look elsewhere. In summary, if you are searching for a tightly written cohesive plot, beautiful cinematography, suspense, or deep characters, this is not the movie for you. If however you want to watch the beautiful people have some fun and don't feel like thinking for awhile, this may make for an entertaining matinee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible in that it promises and promotes itself as some lurid vivacious film about sexy lady bartenders yet delivers PG-13 wholesome goodness. Perhaps the problem is a sensible script is reduced to a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The name alone is synonymous with everything wrong with modern cinema: movies that sell sex rather than show it, movies that at best can only parody actual human life, movies that seem manufactured rather than made...it sucks. Maybe for you this is a great movie and you had fun seeing it, that makes you lucky in my book, but me, I had the misfortune to see this movie, not a high point in my day, in fact I watch it now and again just to try to take back from this crap movie whatever it took from me the first time I saw it.

		<fullReview>I honestly have wanted to see Coyote Ugly for a while and I finally thought of it when I was renting some movies, so I just watched it on Friday night and while I could predict every second of this movie, I have to admit, it's still a fun movie that I think anyone could get a little kick out of. It's a cool teen movie with fun music, hot actors, and one of those "tubular Dawson's Creek" stories. But I thought it had it's moments that made it an enjoyable movie, especially the girls dancing, they provided some fun entertainment. It had a couple laughs here and there, but it was more of a drama type of teen movie.Violet is a young song writer who has big dreams of going to New York and getting her songs published and sung. But of course, she goes with very big disappointments ahead of her. She gets tricked into giving her tape to a guy, with a pretty corny accent by the way, Kevin, and he is fascinated with her. But she's making no money and goes to a sexy bar where girls dance and tease guys while they bar tend, but her dignity has been stripped away while making tons of money, and her career takes the back seat, oh, will she realize the error of her ways and follow her heart back to Kevin? I guess you will just have to see.The acting is pretty corny and so is the story, but it's all good, for a teen movie, it's a fun one that I think people need to give a better chance too. It has sexy actors and is everything any teen drama fan would like! Lol, well, all I can say is just to sit back and enjoy, don't be too judgmental, this was a cool movie and had it's entertaining moments, as silly as it was, I'm sure you'll like this movie if you let go of all you know that is movie knowledge and might just find yourself dancing along to Coyote Ugly.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst not the most original of ideas, Coyote Ugly works well for what it is. A movie for teenage girls (and guys who come to perve on the gorgeous Piper Perabo).Violet, a shy singer from New Jersey moves to New York to become a songwriter. Along the way, she pulls a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly where she learns to make drinks, as well as singing and dancing suggestively for the male client?le. Whilst it is very predictable, with the romance, curing of stage fright and eventual triumph at open-mike night, Coyote Ugly manages to insert a bit more humour and heart than average. Maria Bello as Lil, owner of Coyote Ugly does an excellent job (I loved her explanation of what Coyote Ugly means) whilst Violet is less insipid than most heroines. I'm a fan of LeAnne Rimes, so the inclusion of her songs works great, although I would have liked for the dubbing job they did on Perabo to not be so obvious. Adam Garcia (as Kevin) was bland and boring, and even the 'tragic past' they gave him failed to warm me up to him at all, but it could have been worse.Better than I expected, but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM.Whenever I am discussing Tyra Banks, the woman I plan to marry, to other women, without fail, they immediately begin to sip on a tall bottle of Hatorade and dis the hell out of her. I've heard it all: She's phony, her forehead is too big, her breasts are man made; all statements in which Rocky the Bear does not care. My latest Tyra complaint however, intrigued me somewhat. I was arguing with a girl, a post sex tradition for me, and when she realized she couldn't change my mind regarding my feelings towards the famed Victoria Secrets model, she scraped the bottom of the barrel and said, "...And what the hell does Coyote Ugly mean anyway??"At first, I didn't know she was serious, but when I began to ask around, I noticed many women did not know what this phrase meant. Maybe because it's a guy thing. Coyote Ugly is a bar or club term, used to define "a stranger in your bed, particularly one who was fine as hell last night, but in the morning is coyote ugly." The kind of chick who is so disgusting, you'd rather gnaw your arm off than wake her up, in the same fashion a coyote gnaws off his leg, if caught in a trap. Ladies who aren't familiar with this term are probably the same ones who wake up in the morning with a lone bicep under their necks.Sharp readers out there will probably notice how I am discussing other issues, and not the movie. I am doing it on purpose. I am saving you the time, and saving myself the embarrassment of admitting that I actually sat through this travesty of a flick; a flick that not even T&amp;A could save, if you could imagine that. What happens when you mix a half pint of Cocktail, add two cups of Flashdance, and a shot of Fast Forward? Actually, you get nothing, but when you stick an umbrella in it, it instantly becomes "Coyote Ugly." Fine a*s Piper Perabo plays "Violet," a New Jersey girl who moves to New York City with dreams of becoming a songwriter. Everyone in Manhattan treats her like a complete outsider, as if Jersey is on the other side of the earth, and not 40 miles away. Okay, on second thought, I can understand that. But what I can't understand is how when she moves to a dump in Chinatown, we do not see a single Chinese person.After no luck with the music biz, she auditions for a job at a bar named Coyote Ugly. Three girls work there already, including Zoe, the token, brilliantly played by Tyra Banks. Zoe is leaving the bar in one week, to go to law school. This is completely understandable because she only makes a measley 300 bucks a night at the bar (or 78k a year.) Violet takes her spot as a Coyote, and then the 80s pop era of film, which I thought was dead, begins. The bar itself is handled very realistically. Why? Because the bartenders perform choreographed routines on the bar, as if in a music video. The NYC fire marshal frequents the bar regularly, yet never shuts it down-- even though every night the place is 100 people over maximum capacity. Bartenders spit fire balls at the crowd, and on some occasions, light the bar itself on fire for no reason.The film is one cliche after another, including the following scenes: boy meets girl, girl hates boy, boy shows "stalker persistence" so naturally girl begins to like boy, boy and girl have an opening up discussion on the hood of a car overlooking Manhattan's skyline, girl has fight with over protective dad, girl has fight with boy, girl loses job, girl makes up with over protective dad, girl makes up with boy, girl even gets her job back, girl makes it big in the music biz, girl meets LeAnn Rimes.There. You've just seen the whole movie, but chances are you've seen this same movie dozens of times before this one even came out. My only surprise of the film was Jerry Bruckheimer's name in the credits as a producer. He truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood. Or the most desperate.* out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bottom Line Coyote Ugly was made for boys between the ages of 13 and 16. One of the worst movies of the year.Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.Not impressed with this one by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Gone in 60 Seconds," "Armageddon," "Con Air," etc)Piper Perabo ("The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle") -- a wide-eyed beauty from central casting -- is the movie's generic ingenue, a girl named Violet from small town New Jersey who moves to New York to pursue her dreams of being a songwriter. Of course, even though she grew up just down the turnpike from Manhattan, she's as naive as a farmer's daughter and learns the hard way that peddling your demo tape to snide receptionists at record label offices isn't going to get you anywhere in the Big City.So instead of becoming an instant music biz success, Violet finds herself working at the meat packing district's wildest road house, Coyote Ugly.Staffed by 102-lb. sexpots who habitually shake their stuff atop the bar in size two leather pants and tank tops, the joint is packed wall-to-wall every night with hooting, drooling patrons that the girls tease like pole-dancers to coax drinks into them and money out of them.Written in Screenwriting 101 style, packed with every New York City cliché in the book (her dank, dingy flat is broken into her first week in town), and overflowing with young girls in wonderbras while dancing, the first half of "Coyote Ugly" plays like it was penned by a 13-year-old boy who just discovered masturbation. For the second half, the script must have been handed off to a 13-year-old girl who thinks Britney Spears is the greatest musical talent the world has ever known, because the rest of the movie is launched by a "Face it dad, I'm not your little girl anymore" speech and built around Violet overcoming stage fright and chasing her dream of selling bubble-gum pop songs - aided, of course, by the charming encouragement of a handsome boy (Australian actor Adam Garcia) who just knows she can do it!And yes, Violet sings. A lot. It's an endless source of unintentional comedy because when she's slinking across the bar at Coyote Ugly, singing along to the jukebox (each Coyote girl has a gimmick, that's hers), Perabo warbles in her own, weak and gritty voice. But when belting out one of the acoustic Lilith Faire-lite ditties she hopes to sell some day, suddenly she's a honey-voiced songbird, courtesy of audio looping by jailbait country music star LeAnn Rimes (who has a cameo in the finale).Another hearty laugh stems from the fact that "Coyote Ugly" takes place in a picturesquely gritty, fantasy version of NYC in which a 21-year-old cutie pie bartender can walk down an alley at 4 a.m. in a 15-inch skirt and knee-highs, counting her tips without a care in the world.On the respectability front, the picture's one saving grace is John Goodman, who is blue collar perfection as Violet's modest, toll-collector pop.But even though "Coyote Ugly" is tedious, obvious and badly staged, it does have an infectious spirit. That's hardly enough to save this one aimed at the can't-wait-to-be-21 crowd.</fullReview>

That alone should have been reason enough to stay away. But when the movie came on tv several months ago (yes i saw it several months ago, but could not bear to speak of it until now)i decided to watch it. I have a condition where once i start a movie i watch it start to finish. Anyhow, this movie staggered my imagination, even after so many months i can't think of it without cringing. I had never before, and never since been in physical pain from a movie. And in all honesty i was in actual pain watching this. Like i said i understand what they were trying to make, when they made this movie, but... i am speechless that such a horrid movie has received funding.

		<fullReview>Without a doubt, one of the worst ideas for a movie of all-time. Where do I start? Well, it is not worth writing more than a few brief comments so as to dissuade others from watching this dreck. Based upon a true story? Who knows...who cares! The "story" is BAD and is not worthy of a movie treatment.The lead, Piper Perabo, looks like a cheap imitation of another actress, Sarah Jessica Parker, neither of whom possess much talent. When Piper adds to the mix her character's whining, sad-ass life story, it is comes across as an annoying Kristy McNichol imitation...remember how hard that brooding delivery was to take in the TV show "Family?"...well, multiply that by about 10, and you end up with "Jersey," a character every viewer wants to instantly hate.This movie is like the female version of "Cocktail," minus the talent and budget. I truly am surprised that nobody tried to shoot "Jersey" when she was playing her "music" on the roof. Only her next-door neighbor had it right, by smashing and banging on the adjoining wall to her rat's nest of a hovel (a.k.a. apartment) the very instant she began playing her horrid version of what was supposed to pass for "music." Clearly, there must have been neighboring penthouse units nearby, and unfortunately there was no Vietnam Vet sniper living in one of them to pick her off when she was on the roof. I guarantee he would have done anything to get her to stop playing. A cat fight would sound better than her worthless renderings.Do NOT see this movie, unless you were thinking of "retiring" your TV with your foot kicked through the screen. -1,000,000 on a scale of 1 to 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Small town Jersey girl (Piper Perabo) goes to NYC to be a songwriter. While waiting to be discovered she serves drinks (and dances on the bar) of a horrible place called Coyote Ugly. All the bartenders are beautiful, big-breasted, untalented actresses who show as much clevage as a PG-13 rating will allow. As for the "plot" it's been done HUNDREDS of times before. Every single situation and line of dialogue is yawningly predictable. But most of the screen time is devoted to the half-naked bartenders dancing and twitching and (naturally) poring water all over themselves. It's a PG "Showgirls"! I started fast-forwarding through them--there's too many of them and they are dull--although I must admit the women throw their all into it and seem to be enjoying themselves--too bad they didn't realize the movie is objectifying their bodies. And what the hell is John Goodman doing here? Was he really that desperate for the money? There's a few things that save the film from being a total washout. It is colorful (the bar has tons of little colored lights), the dancing is energetic and Perabo is a good actress and makes for a very liakable heroine. Also Adam Garcia...he can't act (and what a stupid accent!) but when you look like him, who cares? He's very handsome and the movie does show him shirtless a few times (definite highlights). So, there's half-naked woman and a hunky shirtless Garcia. If either of those sound good, this is your movie. Otherwise, stay away--FAR away!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based upon a true story based upon a bar in NYC. Too bad they had to Hollywoodize the main character. It comes off in total more like a female version of the male bar movie Cocktail. The main female lead character role seems like she was based upon a real person, but then her phobia seems to be manipulated in order to pull in the viewer. This manipulation insults the viewer and treads too far from the main story.The main story here should be the bar. There are times when the bar almost takes over. If it had, instead of having a contrived story based upon truth, the story would have rang more true and been a much better film. It could have been closer to televisions CHEERS where ultimately, the bar always was the focus.The things to watch for are the women who are good looking, and a solid workman like performance from John Goodman. There is half a chick flick here as young chicks might enjoy this though older woman sleep through it. The music is good including the talented LeeAnn Rhymes. This helps it avoid being awful, but there is no real classic material in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Coyote ugly" is more or less a typical Jerry Bruckheimer production and everyone who knows something about the movies of today knows exactly what that means. It's not an action flick, at least not the way like "Con air" or "Gone in sixty seconds" were but Bruckheimer's films are always the type of a traditional, meaningless Hollywood entertainers like this one is. Don't expect a masterpiece. You'll just have to watch it, don't think about it. The more you use your brains, the lousier it looks. Story is a big cliché from start to finish and everything we see is highly usual and predictable. Naturally film includes corny romantic elements. And not surprisingly "Coyote ugly" was quite a hit.Of course it's always a pleasure to eye good-looking girls and I have to admit, Piper Perabo who played the leading role of Violet: now she was an incredibly lovely girl, extremely charming and a real cutie in every way. I didn't even care about is the film bad or not when I admired her beautiful looks. One of the main reasons for me to watch this movie was a chance get a glimpse of America's official jackass Johnny Knoxville. He was only in the screen, like, couple of seconds but fun two seconds it was. John Goodman made the best performance of the film as Violet's daddy. Now when I've spend over hour and a half with "Coyote ugly" I've got no interest to watch it again, ever. Maybe for Piper Perabo's sake, but the film itself is not worth a second look. You don't miss anything if you don't ever get a chance to see it.</fullReview>

As far as the filmmaking, the dialogue was even worse than The Perfect Storm, which I thought was the worst I'd ever heard. The scene where she shows her boyfriend how it feels to be nervous singing by stripping was truly in horrible taste for a movie that junior high girls are going to be viewing.

Flipping bottles, spraying the costumers with beer, dumping ice(!) on out-of-line drunks... It just makes you want to be there and do that, and the hell with computer-science!Secondly, it's touching and romantic without being mushy or sickening. A beautiful love story, a simple love story. It's not one of those that-could-never-happen-in-real-life kind of stories. It's one of those that-could-happen-to-me kind of stories. Plus, he's cute and romantic, and has a beautiful Australian accent. What more could you ask for?It is also an inspiring story of success, and overcoming your fears.To sum it all up, it's a cool movie (did I mention this already?), with beautiful songs (I actually got goose bumps when Violet sang the last song, and that only happens when I hear a song I *really* like), a beautiful story, and some funny spots here and there to top the cool whipped cream with a comical cherry.Bottom line: I gave it 10/10, and I wasn't being generous.

		<fullReview>Yet another coming of age movie where the obstacle to be overcome is a performance.This one is differentiated only by having dancing girls along the way: pretty tame stuff pretending to be edgy.The thing we are supposed to focus on is the charm of the girl, who doesn't dazzle. But let's see, the anchor of this thing is Maria Bello. The broad outline is conventional, the tough madam who has "been around" and cares about her girls.Its a funny thing but where she's been as an actress is places we have encountered her. "The Cooler" was something transcendental in a way and I will never see her again without knowing how open she was. So she brings a sort of special depth to this pat role here, our personal experience of her own performances before she opened this bar.We can't pretend that the person of the actress and that of the character can be separated. Sometimes it adds, like here to this thin movie.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really think Bruckheimer directed this movie....who else would have conceived such Wellesian use of deep focus,such a lean, tight, wet script that surprises at every turn, with a backstory of such monumental humanity and pathos? The cries for mercy in the barroom scene reminded me of the Odessa Steps sequence in Potemkin,especially as the innocent man was catapulted into the jukebox glass, thus symbolizing for all cinematic history the tides and fluxes of human history upon which we all ride helplessly, like that bull in Gilley's from another film, which cast all aside in its merciless sweep? A film to savour smackingly again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You need to be in the right mood to enjoy this film.In a plot along the lines of "The thing called love", Violet (Piper Perabo) arrives in New York City with aspiriations of becoming a song writer. Desparate for cash, word of mouth leads her to a bar called Coyote Ugly, where she winds up working.The bar scenes are fun, and there are some great lines as well as the requisite love interest and conflicts with her father (John Goodman), and she winds up loving her work. Check this one out if you have time, a couple of bucks, and the burning desire to kill. It is one of those movies where you might see it if you're overly curious, and you just might like it!** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

Watching John Goodman play her father is both painful and embarrassing. And, for all the hype, the movie isn't very sexy at all. Girls twirl bottles and shake their asses....that's it.

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is a really cool film. Newcomer Piper Perabo puts in a brilliant performance as Violet "Jersey" Sanford. She was made for the role and Adam Garcia as Kevin O'Donnell is great too. He's a brilliant actor and dancer and looked great as always. He and Piper had such an amazing chemistry on the film, it was great. Melanie Lynskey puts in a small but cute performance as Violets best friend, Gloria and John Goodman is great as Violets dad, William. Maria Bello (Lil.) makes a really cool boss and is obviously the one who hires Violet to work at Coyote Ugly and Izabella Miko, (Cammie.) Bridget Moynahan, (Rachel .) and Del Pentecost (Lou.) make really good co-workers to the bar. With a small performance from Tyra Banks as Zoe. The music in the film is brilliant and it was really cool to see LeAnn Rimes in the film singing the theme tune to Coyote Ugly-'Can't fight the moonlight.' The soundtrack to movie is brilliant too and includes four LeAnn Rimes' songs. Among many other great tunes. Coyote Ugly is a great film. It's one for the guys and girls. Brilliant. 8-9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever sat in a theater watching a movie so boring that you wanted to scream? Or so cliché and contrived that you wanted to puke? Go see Coyote Ugly and you'll be slapping yourself like I did.I honestly wasn't expecting anything special, but I definitely thought I would get something better than what I saw. So Violet wants to move out of her small town to pursue her writing career in music (yawn, been there, done that) only to realize that when she gets in New York she's going to have to do more than try to hand over tapes at record companies (You think!) It actually comes up that she's going to have to pay rent (Gee, wonder why she never seemed to have thought about that before)After seeing three girls "winding down" after a night at their job, she gets a job there. And that's when I thought the movie might pick up. I'm a girl so I'm not really into that boobs and butts scene, but at least the bar was a cool setting and had the potential to pick up a little speed and actually get interesting. Wrong I was. The bar scenes were few and far between and some of them were kinda dumb. (i.e. let's make the rowdy crowd calm by me singing)By the third act, the main character has so many things happening to her that didn't even tie in with the resolution of her fear of the stage that it made me feel ill. So finally Violet gets a gig and somehow her boyfriend learns the building and knows where the power switches are so he can turn them off so she won't see anyone and get stage fright. Then her perky voice is heard and somehow, even after the main power switches were cut, the stage lights come back on. And when you finally think the trite c**p is over it cuts to the bar and you get to see the worst scene in the movie: the one with Leeann Rimes signing on top of a bar. And I thought the price of admission was scary!Save yourself from this movie. Unless of course you like predictable, cliched, fuzzy movies, and have time and money to waste. I will give the proper dues to the directing though, it was the best thing about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke I watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed.For starters I'd like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more the whores. Are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? This is not the only right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of cash. A fine example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film. Money is depicted as the only important thing to young people.The manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. Any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs.And finally, why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father. She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend. I find this most strange.In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascistic, degrading to women and frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>COYOTE UGLY (2000) ** Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, Adam Garcia, Melanie Lynskey, Izabella Miko, Bridget Moynahan, Tyra Banks, John Goodman, Bud Cort. 'Cocktail' meets 'Flashdance' could have been the pitch for this dead in the water update of the old 'bright eyed girl with a dream moves to the big city' chestnut, this time around with energy to spare Perabo as a na?ve New Jersey budding songwriter who embarks to The Big Apple wide eyed and bushy tailed and winds up as a bartender at the infamous eponymous establishment where she gets some life lessons, a well-meaning boyfriend and a chance to prove herself. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, master of the no-brainer and low expectation ratio, the storyline is trite, dialogue laughable, situations ridiculous and many of the characters one dimensional. Make of it what you will and yes that is LeAnn Rimes (who also has a cameo) dubbing Perabo's singing. (Dir: David McNally)</fullReview>

I remember those endless busy nights, pasting on a flirty smile and going home with the sunrise all too well.Anyways, I enjoyed Violet (Piper Perabo) here, especially the relationship she has with her dad (John Goodman) The romance angle is kinda meh as is the whole (inherited) struggle to become a songwriter with stage fright in NY.

		<shortDescription>Classic movie "Coyote Ugly"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly, released in the year 2000 is still to this day a favoured film. It's a 12 rated romantic comedy/drama based on the existing Coyote Ugly Saloon, which stands in New York just as this film is set in. The running time is 100 minutes. It's directed by David McNally, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman, written by Gina Wendkos and stars Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, Izabella Miko, Tyra Banks and John Goodman.New Jersey girl Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) leaves her hometown, her father Bill (John Goodman), and best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) to live up to her ambition of becoming a songwriter in New York City. Whilst everything was going wrong, Violet results in visiting an all-night diner and notices three girls, Cammie (Izabella Miko), Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), and Zoe (Tyra Banks), flaunting the hundreds of dollars in tips they earned. She then finds out that they work at a trendy bar named Coyote Ugly. She decides to find the bar and convince the bar owner Lil (Maria Bello) to give her a shot at it. Whilst in the process of trying to please Lil, Violet ends up getting cosy with Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia). Kevin commits himself to helping Violet overcome her stage fright so that she can sell her music.She then feels that she can proceed to pursue her dream, and performs at an open mic night at the Bowery Ballroom with the Coyotes, her father, her best friend, and Kevin all there for moral support. The performance goes exceptionally well and she finally lands a deal with a record label.I believe that this film can be loved by millions of people, and that it will never get old. Not only is it a brilliant film, it can show people that as long as you appreciate the support you have and believe in yourself, you can conquer anything,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violet moves out of Jersey and heads to New York to follow her dreams only to discover frustration, mostly because he has no idea how the music industry work.Having been robbed and down to her last few bucks she lands a job at the Coyote Ugly bar based on the real Coyote Ugly bar which is run by a strong beautiful woman and all the bartenders are women who dance on the bar top among other things.While many people have seen this movie as thinly veiled excuse to put scantily clad women dancing on the screen the reality is different. The women are sexy and sexual but empowered. The dancing scenes are more about the group interaction and the scene of the scantily clad guy dancing on the bar top is in the context of him being auctioned off.It is through this environment where sexy women are in control of their sexuality that Violet become empowered and gets the chance to follow her dreams.Over all this is a fun movie though a little contrite. If you are not expecting titillation or Shakespeare then you will be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shy Jersey girl hits New York hoping to be an aspiring song writer and she ends up working at a sleazy joint doing dances on the bar with her fellow 'coyotes'. Why is this happening? What kind of moron would use such a contorted device to advance a story? Unfortunately, Coyote Ugly doesn't not want to be a descent music movie, it wants to be Showgirls; a bad decision. I'll give points to the choreographer for staging a bar dancing style that doesn't rely so much on nudity to sell (unlike Showgirls), however that fact that the movie spends more time on such sequences than it does on anything else, results in Coyote Ugly being pretty Indescent. On the other hand, Coyote Ugly, is a much nicer film than Showgirls. There are fewer A**holes in the cast of characters, and far more laughs (although some may be unintentional)None of this however changes the fact that the storyline is tripe. Of course the intended audience won't care, but even if one treats the film as pure eye candy, its effectiveness doesn't go beyond moderate. Coyote Ugly feels wacky and rushed, and it's over before you know it. Ignoring the indecency, I don't feel there's quite enough here to warrant a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never understood why reviewers and many people has rated this movie so low. It's actually a quite decent and enjoyable film, although of course it's not a masterpiece. The story is quite conventional and simplistic and that's might the reason that this film didn't reached so many people. Some of the gags are funny, but at times they also feels constrained. Piper Perabo is stunningly beautiful and delivers a okay enough act. It's a shame she didn't got a bigger breakthrough in Hollywood. Though, she doesn't have enough chemistry with Adam Garcia on screen and the lines between them which the screenwriters came up with are awful. Adam himself doesn't show a big range in his act in this film. John Goodman does a decent enough act as Violet's father, although this is of course not his greatest part. The other girl actors (Tyra Banks, Maria Bello) delivers okay act, without leaving so much impression.The target audience for this film are youths/people in the twenties/older teenagers and "Coyote Ugly" have all the ingredients to satisfy them, both males and females. Why does it then fall on the category "bad"? It's not the best movie in this category, but, like I said before, it's decent entertainment. The only bad thing I can come up with is that the story is predictable. Still, it's entertaining enough to don't make me my eyes leave the screen throughout the film.I liked the song "But I Do Love You", while "Can't Fight The Moonlight" I learned to like throughout the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a True South Amboy Girl!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in Amboy, Perth Amboy, right across the river from South Amboy where the girl, Violet Sanford, was supposed to be from. I was there the day that the film came to town to shoot the opening scene. They all ordered pizza from the pizzeria, Delios, right across the street whose owners are truly Sicilian born and bred who have been making pizza since before I was born. I met some of the crew members. The filming only lasted a couple of days but I remember it like yesterday. South Amboy is not so far away from New York City that Violet could have made the trek on her own like the hundreds who do from the South Amboy train station which goes directly to Penn Station. I really became a fan of Piper while watching the film last night on television as well as Maria Bello who plays bar owner, Lil. My family are huge admirers of Melanie Lynskey mostly from her role as Rose on Two and Half Men but she's good here except she plays the accent just a little too thick. Nobody in South Amboy talks like that. You can't help but love John Goodman. Anyway the film's alright with a story of Violet Sanford who wishes to become a songwriter.</fullReview>

What amazed me is how much effort goes into being a successful bartender. Beyond the dancing there is more preparation in their success that is planned out, way ahead of time. It was considerably easier for the writers and directors in that this is an based on an actual successful bar ran by women. Go ahead and watch it and enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Think of this as an unofficial &amp; toned down PG-13 remake of Showgirls if you will.There is a trace of wit &amp; satire found here,believe it or not,just as there was located in that infamous United Artists release.Melody Perkins sparks matters up at the end with a brief bit,one of the best in the film.She steals the show here,just as she did nonstop in her immortal role on Power Rangers in Space.Of Ms. Perkins film credits so far,I shall give Coyote Ugly the edge,second only to Power Rangers in Space of course.I think the film was unfairly panned at the time of release,it's quite enjoyable as a matter of fact,spellbinding escapist fun.Enjoyed the new Director's Cut as well.My Uncle William Hagood owns &amp; operates Atlanta's high class Cheetah Lounge,&amp; I couldn't help but be reminded of it throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldn't find his car.Breaking the code-A very rich father is almost nagged to death by his spoiled daughter, who wants to see her marginal screenplay about her adventures in the NY club scene made into a movie. He finally agrees to bankroll the project on the condition that she turns over all actual production decisions to a competent production company. The production group casts a pair of likable actors and get John Goodman to play a supporting role. They target the Britney segment of the Lifetime movie audience with a teen angst/struggling artist story-line. They also go after a large secondary audience-those (of both sexes) who like to watch hot women in tight pants. They have a large enough budget to staff the project with an excellent crew although they skimp on production design, supporting cast talent, and editing. They make a movie called Coyote Ugly and successfully market it to their target audiences. If you are part of their secondary target audience it is best to watch it on DVD so you can avoid any scenes devoid of tight pants.Problem--Nothing happens. This story is so tired only the worn down father of the screenwriter would dream of making it into a movie, and just on the long shot that his daughter would move out of the house and get a real job once she had a writing credit on her resume. The Olsen twins, credited as someone named Piper Perabo; play Violet, a young songwriter who makes the BIG journey all the way from New Jersey to New York City to realize her dream. Olsen Twin Violet has stage fright but immediately meets the nicest boy in NYC - an Australian (played by Adam Garcia) who collects comic books, thinks he saw her in a television show with Lori Loughlin, works an assortment of entry-level jobs, and still has time to truly care about her. Supermodel Tyra Banks appears on the screen a few times but does not have to act or to play an actual "character".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cookie cutter when it could have been cutting edge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not that there's anything wrong with Coyote Ugly. It is certainly watchable and not near as bad as some would make it out to be. I'ts even fun in some areas.What is lacking however is any originality. It is completely generic. Cookie cutter is a great word. I had a problem with that aspect of it, that and the complete lack of believability in anything about it.Violet (I'm sorry, beautiful name but this girl did not look like a "violet"-Cindy, Stacy maybe but not Violet) is determined to become a song writer and moves to the big bad apple to do just that. Yet from the opening scene(WARNING-SPOILERS THROUT REST OF POST) we know exactly where this movie is going, the predictable formulated movie problems that will get in her way, the movie characters that will appear and how it will all end.This movie reminded me of two others-flashdance meets cocktail-Yet even though I don't think either of those movies was particularly great they had something that I can't put my finger on that was lacking in Ugly.The strengths of the movie was in the quirky cast and the actual bar scenes-this is a perfect movie to watch when you don't want to concentrate to hard because you don't have to with this. Yet although this movie was better then it was reported to be, it was also light years away from being anywhere near as good as it could have been. There was a lack of buildup toward things-characters simply appear, things happen that are so unrealistic they border on ridiculous-take away the racy dancing on bars and a few other things and this could have been a 1 hour after school special on going for your dreams etc etc-not that all after school specials are bad but there is this unreal quality to the movie-and a rush at the end to make it feel good that reminded me of a high school version of cocktail(a better movie in my opinion). A good example is the whole painfully dull ordeal of Violet getting to the club in time to sing her song and become a star(which you know through all the u turns, screaming and general hysteria is gonna happen anyway).Still, the movie wasn't all bad-good looking characters,fun dancing and singing, a few great one liners-all combined to make Coyote a pleasant movie view if not outstanding. 6 out of 10 is my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of Bruckheimer crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been compelled to comment on this movie because it managed to waste 101 minutes of my precious time. "Coyote Ugly" is much too lengthy to discuss such a basic premise: girl moves to big city to fulfill her dreams and encounters interesting experiences along the way. Mediocre, teenybop and emotionless performance by lead Piper Perabo, who happens to be in almost every scene. Plus a dumbed-down script that will make you scratch your head and go "Whaaa?" while you feel that you're being dragged on by a hole-filled story.I haven't been to Coyote Ugly, so I couldn't say if the movie is a close depiction of what really goes on in a Coyote Ugly bar. In any case, if you like to see women gyrating on bar ledges and people being doused with ice cubes, then this movie is for you. If not, don't punish yourself by watching this crap bar movie.The only good thing about "Coyote Ugly" is Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia)'s bar dance.</fullReview>

Any film that says, "And John Goodman" must be pretty desperate. (He's not a bad actor, but it's not like he's the best, either, when it comes to actual roles--I think he should stick to animation voices [i.e. "Monsters, Inc"] and avoid some of the other human roles he's been taking, as they all come across rather poor--"The Blues Brothers 2000," "What Planet Are You From," "The Flintstones," "Fallen," etc.)I hear another unnecessary sequel is currently in pre-production.

		<fullReview>Yet another in the endless string of films intended solely for the 15-25 year old female demographic. Males need not apply unless they want to indulge in brief views of the beautiful bartenders scantily clad during the bar scenes. Although not unpleasant, nothing upwards of PG here. Nothing thought provoking or otherwise fulfilling either.Small town Jersey girl comes to the big city to realize her dreams of becoming a screen writer. She overcomes adversity to find a somewhat meaningful life as a waitress at the Coyote Ugly bar and eventually realizes her ultimate dreams with the help of those she meets along the way. Have I seen this movie before? Probably. Done better? Almost definitely.Maria Bello and John Goodman do what they can with one dimensional roles. Adam Garcia also delivers an adequate performance considering the genre, but the rest of the acting is atrocious, especially that of Piper Perabo. Her miserable performance in the lead role is what brought my rating way down.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 90's musical/comedy/drama about music ends up being a love story.When Vi Sanford heads up to New York, her dream is to make it big like so many before her. She has many demons to fight though,like the fear of the stage like her mother before her used to have,like growing away from her father and winning his respect. But she displays grit and wisdom in not selling out just to make it. Along the way, she gets to work in the Coyote Ugly bar, and starts to learn a thing or two about the streets, the hype and the reality. Love, loss, growing up all drift through in naughty doses. The scene where she's finally on stage and starts singing in the dark before the super trooper blazes on her is a huge climax. It just sweeps through you and makes the wait worth it. Featuring a beautiful score and massive soundtrack. Coyote Ugly is anything but ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a 20 year old girl who lives in New Jersey and moves to New York City to start a new life and get a new job in music writing arts but things get difficult with her life in the big city, until she meets Lil (Maria Bello) who she then asks for a job in a male teasing bar called Coyote Ugly, but unfortunately it won't be an easy work since there are a lot of men breaking into the bar to dance with all the girls and cause a riot in the entire place. It's the best romantic comedy i've seen, Piper Perabo really deserved to win an MTV Movie Award for her acting, and I admired her songs in the movie especially the one with LeAnn Rimes which is my favorite song in 1st place in this movie ''Can't Fight The Moonlight''.When I watched this movie I discovered that the bar really exists and the girls from the movie really exists too, that's when my older brother told me about that. I love this romantic comedy and to all the actresses who played the parts: You did a great job. There's nothing that can replace this great movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer movies are not intellectual endeavors; as we all know his clichéd scripting, 'wall of sound' soundtracks, and fast-cut action are mostly applied to slam-bang, kick-ass adventure movies. On the level of pure, mindless entertainment they usually work; they certainly make him and his team buckets of money. In "Coyote Ugly" Jerry takes his style and applies it to the romance genre. It doesn't work.Yes, the production values are super slick, and the story, although unoriginal, holds promise. To digress, Violet (Piper Parabo), pizza joint songbird from New Jersey, pulls up stakes and heads for Manhattan to hit the big time. To pay her bills while launching her music career, she bartends at Coyote Ugly, a bar where the female bartenders dance, prance, and sing (all very suggestively) for a raucous male clientele. It's all very predictable from the stage fright, the romantic misunderstandings, the trouble at the bar?will her career get launched, love find its way, the bar remain open? Need you ask? Since we've plowed this ground many times before it's the 'getting there' that should provide the entertainment. But thanks to an incredibly bad script, getting there is an unintended laugher. At this level the film works, but if you want to take it seriously, I'm sorry, it fails.</fullReview>

And, what the hell was john goodman doing in this low budget crapfest? these are a few of the things i was pondering after submitting myself to the urges to finally watch this low-grade piece of trash. i don't feel too bad since it only cost me $0.50 to rent...but i can't believe i wasted an hour and a half of my life to witness the sheer horror this movie has to offer. I don't know if you've seen it, but yes i thought it was that bad. last night i had a dream that i was dancing around on a bar with a bunch of trashy cowgirls, throwing water on perfect strangers and wasting ump-teen dozen bottles of liquor. with the amount they waste/break/give away i have absolutely no idea how the place continues to stay running. 60oz bottles of rum and scotch ain't cheap...unlike the quality of the film. okay, that's enough movie bashing for one day. i guess i'm just tired of seeing losers come into my store buying the stupidest crap and recommending it to me. ''oh yeah, this movie is awesome...it's not what you think at all''. yeah, it sure wasn't. i had a glimmer of hope that it was actually going to be a tad enjoyable. i guess the average male/female population, ages 18-40 must be easy to entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had this been produced twenty years earlier, we would have seen bare breasts, the flesh would have looked more like flesh, the women would have looked less alike so that at least ONE of them would have been more attractive - perhaps she would have had a body as well as a face - and what we've lost in explicit detail and natural fleshiness, we have NOT gained in erotic presentation, although I admit that adolescent sex teasers of twenty years ago were by and large pretty poorly produced. Decisions of who to cast and how much skin to show are now determined to the millimetre, it seems, by simple, cold algorithms. There's no spontaneity whatever. I'm aware how silly I sound in saying this, but if you must watch "Coyote Ugly", don't do so for the chicks - watch it for the story. It's another slickly produced, enjoyably formulaic tale from the Bruckheimer factory, and since the selling point is this time ersatz sexiness rather than ersatz violence, it's a good deal less offensive than most. I was happy enough to cheer Violet on in her quest to break into the music business. Why not? But don't construe this as a recommendation.</fullReview>

John Goodman NEVER mails it in, no matter how insipid his role or the film, and he was up to his usual form here. I thought the strongest performance was by Maria Bello, and I was far more impressed by her here than in her stint on "E.R.", the only other place I had seen her. The plot was predictable and formulaic. The bar was kind of interesting. Why would all those people flock to that sort of place, instead of just going to a strip club?

		<fullReview>First of all I must say that I was pretty disappointed in the cover of this film, which had me believing that Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) was the hottest of the five, while in the film she was the ugliest Coyote. The rest all more or less made an impression similar to the one on the box. But on to the film itself. I liked it and I liked it a lot. You can call me a romantic ba***rd but still I liked it. Almost everything about it. Ok I admit this is a film with not much depth or twists but it is really great fun from the moment 'Jersey' (Piper Perabo) leaves her house to the predictable ending. The best scenes in my opinion the ones in which we see 'Jersey' singing her own songs (damn she, or better LeAnn Rimes, can sing) and it makes me wonder why the Can't fight the Moonlight became the single for this movie.Moving on, there is everything you could possibly want in this movie, hot chicks, dancing, romance, fights, comedy and last but certainly not least a good deal of great music. All the actors and actresses are good, but I especially liked seeing John Goodman again in a good part. Highly recommended because highly enjoyable.

		<fullReview>Yes, unbelievable, but I really liked this! First, when I saw the trailer, I thought this movie might be a kids version of Paul Verhoeven´s "Showgirls", which belongs more to the sector of trash and satire. But finally "Coyote Ugly" was an old-fashioned but pretty sometimes-dreams-come-true fairy tale. It would be better to make comparisons to the dance movie "Flashdance", which was also produced by Jerry Bruckenheimer and tells the same story about a poor girl from the countryside/province/suburbia who wants to become rich and famous in New York... The chicks in "Coyote Ugly" fulfill their jobs in looking great very excellent (especially Tyra Banks and Maria Bello), but I think none of the actresses will have their breakthrough with this one. The film itself is for being shady too harmless, for being a social study too surface, and for a comedy it´s not funny enough. It´s just one of those films, if you haven´t seen it you won´t miss anything. But if you do, you will be reveling in a pink bubble for two hours... (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good soundtrack and excellent hair design will never hide the fact that this film is less scholarly than a Playmate of the Month video. For the guys in the audience, it's also less, shall we say, `rewarding' than preview advertisements might promise. Piper Perabo hardly carries the film in the lead role of a young girl who moves from her tiny New Jersey town to the Big Apple in search of her dream of becoming a pop songwriter. The plot device of her songwriting dreams allows the filmmakers to let LeeAnn Rimes dub Perabo's voice (badly) to the tune of Diane Warren's (sometimes good) songs, and then actually bring Rimes into the film in the last five minutes (our girl made it! She's now writing for the girl she mysteriously sounds exactly like!). Perabo's deliciously pretty with a great smile, but her acting is wobbly and kills a lot of credibility for the film. Supporting cast, particularly Maria Pitillo, do much for the film, but in the end the word `Inane' kept rattling through my head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed "Cocktail" with Tom Cruise/Brian Brown, then you would enjoy this film."Coyote Ugly" provided a fairly light-hearted plot which was acted out well and made for a very consumable formula.I would imagine that bars such as that portrayed in the film will become trendy in the next few months. Any of you who have been to the Wanchai district of Hong Kong would know that bars of this type, where people can dance on the bar, are actually a lot of fun!A good flick to take the Girlfriend/Wife along to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly's fast paced and fun filled mix of comedy and hip moves will have you doing just that. You will want to shake your stuff with some of the most beautiful and talented actresses that are in this picture. That's not to say that there is no plot. Piper Perabo plays the struggling song writer trying to make it in the big city, which is a very common plot used in many movies. Nonetheless, it is done very well with heart filled dramatic story telling. This is a much see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie because it had a great plot, not just T &amp; A flashing all over the place. The acting was great, I personally would love to have a combination of Lil and Racheals' adittudes and personality. Myself personally i have wanted to be a dancer for 14 years and this movie helped me to believe it could happen! They had killer dance music, great moves, and an awesome wardrobe. I think they chose the perfect actors and actresses for every character perfectly. The movie also shows you what the real world is like (well, except we can't all get lucky and walk into a club and find a completee hottie, who also happens to be a nice guy). All in all this is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coyote Ugly is truly an uplifting tail about a girl who moves to NYC to pursue her dream, and at the same time, to come out of her shell. Despite the way the trailers made the film out to be, it's not just a "bar" movie with topless dancers or anything like that. It has a plot, an excellent plot I might add, and the sexuality of the film just boosts how good of a film it really is. I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

She was actually quite good, as was her father [John Goodman] and the rest of the cast were bearable.The token Australian love interest was a strange character who never went anywhere, but this was actually watchable all the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great, not only does it contain plenty of great girls but it also has an alluring soundtrack to it, which creates a wonderful film and an atmosphere for each scene of the movie.I thought i would watch it and come out satisfied with having seen the girls, but no i was impressed, especially by Piper Perabo, not only is she good looking but she has a smile that would make anybody she looked at smile. She plays a fantastic role, which is supported by other actresses such as Maria Bello, Izabello Miko, Melanie Lynskey. I felt that Tyra Banks didn't participate in the film for long enough! so no mention for good acting for her !On the whole, a romantic story set around Violet (Piper Perabo) who has her heart set on becoming a song writer, so she moves to New York where she encounters Mr O Donell (adam garcia), but she lacks the courage to perform thus leading her to Coyote Ugly (a bar). The film generally gets better as you watch more of it and by the end you have to be singing one of the several songs in it like 'Can't Fight the moonlight' - just excellent!I certainly recommend you watch this, and would guarantee anybody even vaguely interested in films would enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straightforward entertainment - engaging braincells not needed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who gave us Flashdance, Gone in 60 Seconds, Con Air and Dangerous Minds, this is entertainment that doesn't require you to engage too many brain cells to enjoy it (Is that bad??)The story of a would-be songwriter who goes to New York to find success, it is mostly about the red-hot bar where she starts working out of necessity. As it has the familiar music-video formula it is especially disappointing that the soundtrack is not more memorable, but visually the movie delivers what it advertises and is a great feel-good movie, popcorn movie or date movie. There's plenty of New York adrenalin, gutsy females that will tantalize the guys and a male lead that's not bad looking for the ladies, plus a few wish-fulfilment themes to also appeal to the girls. Out and out fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Howl! At The Screen' and believe me you will when you see the sexy bartenders of `Coyote Ugly.' This feel-good movie is about a beautiful struggling songwriter who goes to New York for fame &amp; fortune and ends up being a karaoke-dancer bartender in a very upbeat sexy bar called `Coyote Ugly.' The bar girls in `Coyote Ugly' dance and sing near-naked on bar stands to very upbeat 80's music while they shower their patrons with sprinkles of Jack, drops of Cuervo, and showers of Comfort. Ok! Stop daydreaming! And read the rest! Even though it does not have some intellectual screenplay or strategic direction, the film does have the right formula to be one of the best films of the year. If you don't know what it is, just read the review again and focus on the words `near-naked' , `jack' , `cuervo' and `comfort.' Case closed! ***** Excellent</fullReview>

Those were base purely on flash and sex appeal, but I personally don't even really like Ms. Piper Perabo's face (or acting for that matter). The whole stage fright thing got really old. Besides, they never conveyed that she had worked hard enough to even deserve this success. They already expected us to start bawling just three minutes in when Violet parts with her friend outside the apartment. I guess her authentic Jersey accent is supposed sway us. But I don't even know where to start on that tollbooth u-turn scene... As for everything but the silly bar gimmick: canned and cookie cutter. They must be using some kind of Madlib-like movie templates when they come up with this stuff. (Witty pun:___Frozen_Assets___) I'll save my worst rating for something truly horrible. This is nothing different from a hundred other movies we've all seen.</fullReview>

Never mind the degrading nature of the bar (which had nothing to do with the excuse for a plot), the whole film was insulting to the average person's intelligence. It trotted out every cliche in the book. One can tell that the movie pushed for its PG-13 rating -- it's pandering to the simple hormones of teenage boys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your typical teen movie, with the addition of some hot girls dancing on top of a bar. The premise is not really interesting, and the plot is extremely predictable. The only reason guys would want to see this is because of the girls dancing on the bar, and who can blame us; apart from one or two decent humorous lines, the hot girls are the only thing the movie has going for it. Something I truly loathed was the amount of annoying pop music, that almost kept me from sitting through it. It isn't exactly as bad as some of the truly bad teen movies(read: Crossroads), but it's definitely no masterpiece. Most guys will probably watch it just to see the girls dancing, but the good thing is that they can watch it with their girlfriends, since it does feature a lot of girlie stuff. So watch it with your girlfriend, and you'll probably both like some parts of it; it's not as horrible to sit through as the truly bad teen movies(read: Crossroads), but it does take some effort. On the other hand, pretty much any guy should see this just for watching Tyra Banks pouring water down her chest. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself a feminist, and I suppose that is why much in this movie really just doesn't cut it with me at all. Of course in this drivel we are given the portrayal of feminism and females in general that people seem to think is good nowadays. Real women dance in bars and exposes as much bare skin as possible and splash water over themselves, and at the same time they talk about this independence complete BS. At one point of the movie we are told why the bar is named Coyote Ugly - entrance "funny" joke that isn't a fraction cliche by now - "because X was taken". Whee. Actually contrary to most people I guess, I didn't find one of the female cast attractive. You know this thing food. They should try it. They all just look anorectic to me. Which leads to another problem, the total absence of acting in this movie. Nobody can act, especially not John Goodman, it's as if he tried to act really bad but making it turn out even worse in the process. This film, aimed at teen girls primarily, also sends out many messages that are very unhealthy in my humble opinion. Alcohol is nothing bad, "looking good" is another word for being an anorectic and yes of course you will become an actor or a singer or whatever if only you work hard enough. I gave it a 2 out of 10, but honestly I can't remember why I didn't give it 1, I guess I must've slipped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The term 'Beer Goggles' refers to your perception of things when you consume vast amounts of alcohol as depicted by some of the characters in this movie. I'd recommend drinking as much if you're settling down to watch this trash, the theory being that you'll be asleep before the opening credits have transpired.I could waste my time writing a tirade about what is wrong with the actual movie, but it would be a complete waste of time and keystrokes. Young girls who don't know any better won't pay any attention to any negative publicity this bile gets, they'll just watch it, vainly hoping that if they look reasonably pretty, and open their legs to opportunity, their life will be a breeze too. The same young girls will probably watch this film in a double bill of a Katie Price/Jordan/Paris Hilton show on the ITV2 networks Thursday slot of dumb-ass programmes.Piper Parabo is terrible in this movie, although she can't be held accountable for such an unlikeable character. In a key scene which points out what a doxy she is, she waltzes into a record company HQ like she's the Queen of England and demands that they listen to her music and sign her up. Because that's how it happens in real life isn't it? I write reviews on IMDb, it doesn't make me Siskel &amp; frigging Ebert! They could have made this a 'Working Girl' for the 21st century, but it's closer not to Melanie Griffith's industrious heroine, but rather Bambi Woods in Debbie Does Dallas.</fullReview>

Even though they could have been a lot better!Oh, I almost forgot: I really liked "Enemy of the state", that was a truly thrilling roller coaster ride.Do me a favor, will you? Please stay away from these movies that deal with women and their strive to success! They´re shallow and sexist..."Coyote Ugly" is simply the worst film I´ve seen in years!

		<fullReview>To sum it up, this movie is just plain awful!! Piper Perabo couldn't act her way out of a paper bag with a road map ... her biggest feat in this film is trying to see how doe-eyed she can look, or how long she can bite her lower lip and appear naive. Her "performace" was excruciating to watch, and how anyone is able to stomach it is beyond me. Thanks to this crappy movie, Coyote Ugly has been thrust into main stream marketing, and has lines out the door of drunk tourists paying 15 dollars for crappy watered down drinks. No plot, poor acting, and trailer trash values ... I give this movie an F!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a a dumb chick stop a bar brawl between sailors and construction workers by singing along with a jukebox? Me either.In a buttshell: Dumb girl heads to big city to pursue pipe dream of pop star. Stranger in a strange land. Can't pay the bills. Crappy apartment in crappy part of city. Must resort to 'songwriting' on rooftop of crappy apartment building to avoid bothering neighbors. Gets job as new hot girl in sleazy cool joint. Dumb girl meets nice guy with accent in music industry. Oh enough. Puke.Featuring a blockbuster performance by someone named Piper Perabo (huh?), this film is an abysmal petri dish, complete with women using T &amp; A to sell booze to horny patrons in NYC. The cast is stereotypical in every way, and Tyra Banks even cameos as a sassy model-type that says things like "you go girl" and "oh no you di'int." The other girls include a psycho hottie, a tough boss hottie, and the other fill-in-the-blank hotties. Likewise for the men - all portrayed as beer-swilling blue collars, Jamison-swigging brokers, or tequila-shooting fratboys. How original.The biggest problem? Why would John Goodman agree to be seen in this??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually Has Plot!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't have been more pleased with "Coyote Ugly". Being a huge New York fan, I loved the setting and atmosphere of the film. Piper Perabo was excellent as Violet and has a very promising film career, and Adam Garcia who play Kevin O'Donnel is my new fave actor. The songs, performed by LeAnn Rimes and written by Diane Warren could not have been any better (especially "But I Do Love You"). The trailers (although they are what made me want to see this film!!!) mislead you greatly, and I think that's why critics panned this film. The advertising leads you to belive there's no plot further than a bunch of scantily clad chicks shaking it on a bar, but the movie has heart and substance and is very positive in inspiring people to follow their dreams. I recommend this film to almost all tastes!!! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely made but too predictable and sappy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movie of which you already know how it's going to end. Nothing in the movie happens as a real surprise and it's a quite formulaic one. Still it has been made with lots of talent and profession involved, which definitely helps to makes this movie a pleasantly watchable one.I truly think that director David McNally is a greatly talented one. Problem is, that so far he only has been given awful material to work with (this movie and "Kangeroo Jack".). This director certainly deserves better and I hope producer Jerry Bruckheimer also sees this and gives him another chance one day, with a movie with a better script. McNally made this movie with lots of flair and vision and certainly makes the story look more interesting than it really is. Because lets face it, there is very little plot and story present in this movie. At times the movie jumps to one sequence to another without feeling an obvious connection. Horrible editing and continuity at times.It really is the story that prevent this movie from being a great one. It's all very predictable and formulaic and all of the clichéd moments you could expect from a movie with a concept like that, are present. The movie also tries to be too dramatic at times with as a result that it becomes unnecessarily sappy at times. Guess it's more a chick-flick than anything else really.The actors do their best and they did their job well enough, although it is fairly obvious that everyone was cast on their looks and not their acting skills. But I, as a well functioning heterosexual male, am not really complaining about that.The style is certainly good and somewhat uplifts this movie and helps to make it just better than slightly above average. It's worth to watch and enjoyable enough, when you have never else or better to do. But it's far from an excellent movie, obviously.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like movies like Maid In Manhattan and Charlie's Angels, you'll LOVE this little gem. If you're over the age of 15, have above room temperature IQ, and are mentally stable, my advice is to not waste your time on this offensively trite piece of trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so entertaining date movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it isn't something to rush to either. There are enduring performances by Ppier Perablo and some others, and the story is good, but it is missing something. I think it is called brains. This film (despite being entertaining) is kinda stupid, so it can appeal to stupid teens. And it does (not that I am stupid). But I think that couples will like the sensuous parts and some of the romance. But that might be it. Also, you might want to see this movie for Perablo's performance.One more interesting thing (and according to this site) is that Kevin Smith (of Jay and Silent Bob fame) is supposedly a uncredited co-writer on this film, and I actually think he did do a couple of things. The clues- 1, the character Violet (Perablo) comes from South Amboy, New Jersey (which is where around Smith is from) and 2, the Adam Garcia character's prized possession is a Spiderman comic book (Smith had Stan Lee who created Spiderman in the film Mallrats). Just a notion, I could be wrong. But one thing I am sure of is this film is a must see, for girls. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiots gave this movie 10 stars...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...or maybe they were teenage girls with dreams of making it in soft-core porn. This movie is nothing more than dumbed-down flash and trash. If you saw this movie, gave it a glowing review, and are reading this, you probably like Jerry Springer, The View, and are contributing to the next generation's smaller brain power by raising even dumber kids. Yes, I know you don't get what I just wrote. Sigh... The best part of the movie? Piper Perabo, who is adorable and--... Wait a sec. I just realized I am wasting my time. You like crappy mindless snack foods and other junk? You'll like this tripe, and I can't change your tiny mind. You want a good film that is challenging and different and enjoyable? Try Maria Bello in 'The Cooler' instead. She deserves better than this 'Ugly' garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coyote Ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew about this film for two reasons, the big actor from The Flintstones being in it, and the successful song, I was certainly interested, from director David McNally (Kangaroo Jack) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air). Basically Violet Sanford (The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle's Piper Perabo) is an aspiring teenage songwriter, and she finally gets her dream of going professional going when she leaves home and heads for New York City. She finds herself a place to stay, but her efforts to give her demo tape to a music producer are useless, and then her apartment gets broken into leaving her with nothing. Feeling useless she gets some lunch with what she has left, and by coincidence she overhears some girls who work at a bar as they say goodbye to worker Zoe (Tyra Banks). This leads Violet to the Coyote Ugly bar, run by Lil (Maria Bello), who gives her a chance behind the bar to experience what goes on, and Violet is surprised to see that it is a very raunchy bar, the girls call the shots, they thrust moves on the bar counter, and the attraction of what pulls in the punters. Lil warned her that she may not last long at the bar, but after meeting Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) she learns more of the ways of the city, and gains a bit more confidence to work in the bar, she also auctions him off to get money she needed. But what she really needs is confidence on stage, as her demo tapes aren't gaining the interest, so she needs to sing the songs herself live and maybe get some attention that way, and Kevin tries to help her with her stage fright. One night while working in Coyote Ugly there is an incident that causes a fight, so Violet grabs the microphone and sings along to the song on the jukebox, Blondie's "One Way or Another", and that gains the bar some more punters. Violet's toll-booth father Bill (John Goodman) does find out about the bar and doesn't approve seeing what goes on, and there is a point when he has a car accident, but he survives and supports his daughter with any decision she wants to make. After having a disagreement with each other, Kevin returns to give her confidence as well, and she completes a new song ready to present at a live show for newcomer singers, musicians and writers. In the end, Violet initially still has stage fright, but Kevin helps her and she gets through her song gaining high interest, and of course in the end a professional singer, LeAnn Rimes comes to Coyote Ugly to perform her song with her, and a proud Bill gets auctioned. Also starring Izabella Miko as Cammie, Bridget Moynahan as Rachel, Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey as Gloria, Del Pentecost as Lou and Johnny Knoxville as College Guy. Perabo is pretty good in the lead role, Goodman gets his humorous moments, including that scene where he lies about eating a vegetable meal when it is in fact KFC and going "yum", the raunchy is obviously very easy to enjoy, the music soundtrack is all good, the story is pretty much a cross between Flashdance and Cocktail, it may be a little predictable, but "Can't Fight The Moonlight" by LeAnn Rimes is a fantastic number one hit song, it's not a bad romantic comedy drama at all. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don`t want a reputation for writing four word reviews therefore I wasn`t just going to write Weak Shallow chick flick but it`s very difficult to add anything to these four words . As you`d expect from a Bruckheimer production there`s very little substance to the wafer thin story which seems to be a throw back to the days when Jerry made films just to sell a few records , ala FLASHDANCE and TOP GUN . Most the story involves a bunch of teenage bimbos dancing on a bar table which means COYOTE UGLY is hardly compelling , but being a 36 year old male I guess this movie wasn`t marketed for me</fullReview>
