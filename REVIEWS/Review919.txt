		<shortDescription>A smartly modern elegy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx. He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles. Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.El Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function. With intricate structure, 'Amores perros' tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls 'illegal economies' (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can't depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world's mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments. Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.These two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his 'job', wiping out businessman. If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left, happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.There is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the 'Cain and Abel' half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia's functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.Except for the director. Like Paul Thomas Anderson in 'Magnolia', although to a less self-conscious degree, Gonzales Inarritu is the God of his film, intricately creating the structure that links his characters and their different environments. These are negative connections, however, which work against the idea of coherent meaning in life - contact usually results in destruction (physical, material, spiritual), or diminishing.He is also an Old Testament god, punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success - the gains of capitalism are prey to the violent whims of chance: Gonzalez Inarritu doesn't need frogs to shake a rigid society or mindset.Moral change is linked to physical change - being beaten up, losing a leg, cutting hair. The punning title, with its reference to the dog-eat/fight-dog nature of modern life, and its general unsatisfactoriness, also gives the film its Biblical feel, the idea of Mexico as an asphalt desert, or a rubbish heap, with all these scrawny mutts scavenging the remains.'Amores perros' shares the sickly, bleached near-monochrome look of many recent crime films, like 'Chopper' or 'Bleeder'. But where the heightened mise-en-scene in those works were expressionistic projections of their protagonists' psychosis, here it's part of a controlling world-view, the universal consciousness that creates, connects and destroys.The three stories, though connected narratively and symbolically, are mutually distinct - the first is an exhilirating mix of violent gangster film and frustrated romance; the second is like a short story (the screenwriter is a novelist), a figurative plot where movement is through image, symbol and idea, rather than film narrative; the third is a kind of spiritual journey, with an appropriately Biblical (or Wim Wenders-like) openness.'Amores perros' is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim - it says more about contemporary cinema that a film only has to hold your interest for it to be a masterpiece - but it is consistently enthralling, and, despite all the stylistic tics and brutal violence, bracingly humanist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lest the Dramatic Structure be Stillborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True to the structure, I?árritu attacks the subject of love with a multi-pronged approach, addressing three different stages, or complications, common in `love.' All three storylines represent the `struggling' aspect of love. It would be fair to say that Amores Perros, roughly translated to be `Love's a Bitch,' makes the ultimate statement, `Love is a struggle.' More specifically, however, Octavio's narrative can be most suitably seen as the `hunt for love' and acquisition or fight for it. To be with his love, Susana, he must overcome both the fact that his brother is married to her and the fact that his dreams of leaving the city are hamstrung by his less than admirable socio-economic state. Daniel and Valeria, who are about fifteen to twenty years Octavio and Susana's elders, represent love's most frustrating peak - when one is already in it and wants or needs to get out, for better of for worse. Daniel is trying to get out of a marriage in which he has kids to be with the supermodel, Valeria, a woman whose meaning to him is ultimately superficial. El Chivo, whose story is a perfect compliment to Daniel's, represents distance and alienation from love, inwardly looking at it from the outside. He has abandoned his family twenty years prior to become a guerilla terrorist and now operates as a vagabond hit man. It would be difficult to look at these three different `stages' of love in a classically structured film. The episodic structure eases us between each stage, at no point forcing us to tolerate the unrealistic concept of one couple going through all of these stages. Breaking it up into three different narratives, each revolving around different characters, presents the audience with the ability to view each story as independent the others, a more pervasive perspective.However, this film is not a simple three-part love story. In Amores Perros, violence is akin to love. Each character displays this brutally: El Chivo leaves his love to be a terrorist; Octavio engages his dog in violence and even attempts murder to provide money for his love; Daniel and Valeria's relationship is verbally and nearly physically volatile to the point where they hate each other. Each character's love for another character is manifested in their violent acts. This is an interesting theme considering the paradoxical relationship between love and violence, one of which is the induction of harm, the other which is the polar opposite. This juxtaposition of love and violence, if for no other reason, is meant to show the impulsive nature of love. We take it for granted as a compassionate, helping characteristic of life but I?árritu reveals his characters through this juxtaposition, allowing the audience to consider the consequences of love that are otherwise unforeseen.I?árritu does a lot of things right in this film. Mainly, he keeps us in constant suspense through the causality of the plot, forcing us to anticipate the results of the characters' actions. This causality can be as brazen as Octavio's decision to stab Jarocho, inevitably leading one into apprehension over what will happen to Octavio. Less obviously, however, is the way he creates suspense around Daniel and Valeria. Their whole relationship is characterized by conflict. While this makes for good dialogue, it insists upon a boiling point - one that is anticipated throughout the entire length of their chapter. Likewise, there is delicate suspense over what Valeria's disfigurement will mean for their relationship. Not only is Daniel forced to confront whether or not Valeria's beauty is the only thing keeping them together, but Valeria must adjust to living without her beauty. Suspense revolves around El Chivo from the moment he first comes onto screen. We see him. He murders someone. We're back to the story of Octavio. The entire first two hours of the movie beg of an answer as to who this man is and what he has to do with the subject of the film. We later find out, not only does he have everything to do with it; he makes the film, seeking redemption on behalf of every other love-torn character. The type of monologue Emilio Echevarria's character, El Chivo, delivers at the end of the film would have a completely different meaning in a film without an episodic structure, in which case he would only be seeking redemption for himself. However, the way I?árritu cross cuts between El Chivo and the other characters, in all their woe - the consequences of their actions, applies greater meaning to El Chivo's words and actions in the final scene.Perhaps where we get some of the most important information about the characters, and Amores Perros as a whole, is through what is representative. I?árritu makes steady use of symbols and motifs throughout the film, some of which work well, lending themselves nicely to the dramatic structure of the film, others failing to enhance the story. For example, the massive Enchant billboard looming above Valeria's apartment like the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg is one of the more lackluster motifs in the film. First, we are unavoidably asking, `Why they would want to live under that thing in the first place? Second, the removal of the billboard coinciding with the fall of Valeria's career, Daniel's self-assurance, their relationship, whatever you want to intuit, is much to explicit for this film. The more understated motifs such as the recurring telephone ring, `Bueno?.Bueno?' someone always answers, come off better. This repetition is telling of the deception and unfaithfulness rampant in this world. It works. Another representative device that supplements the story is how the dogs act as metaphors for their respective owners. El Chivo's dogs are the very embodiment of him. They are all strays much the same way he is a vagrant. Cofi, Octavio's rottweiler is equivalent to Octavio in his impulsive and aggressive behavior. This is displayed in Cofi most notably during the fight scenes, but we see it particularly in Octavio when he head-butts his brother, Ramiro, and when he stabs Jarocho in the stomach and thereby provoking the car chase. Valeria's dog, Richie, is lost under the floorboards, confined for most of this narrative. Valeria is physically much the same way, confined to her wheelchair. More implicitly, she is confined to a life that has been propped up around her by people who idolize, envy, or lust after her. Valeria's death is also parallel to her dog's death in that they both die from their respective internment, Valeria being trapped in a room and too immobile to save herself, Richie trapped in the floor and too exhausted to fend off armies hungry rats. The motifs and metaphors within each narrative help structure them as self-contained bodies.The episodic structure of Amores Perros could have been damaging to the film had it not been for the inspired way the stories overlap only so much as to not exasperate the audience. In the three stories, rarely does a character from one interact with a character from another, outside the unifying car crash scene. There are truly only two occurrences: when El Chivo, sword in hand, scares off a frustrated Jarocho who plans to sic his dog on one of El Chivo's, and when Valeria appears on a Mexican morning show broadcast into Octavio's home the morning of the accident. This interaction was all that was needed for Amores Perros to be successful as an episodic film. Its structure lends itself well to subject matter and storyline. I?árritu tells it to us this way; the literary devices at use bring it to life and its structure gives it legs to move. Throughout it, so well crafted, one can mentally fuse all three stories together and see one single character going through the process of fighting for love, realizing what a trivial pursuit it is, abandoning it, and then spending the rest of his life trying to touch it from behind the bars self-guilt.</fullReview>

Its a perfect peep to what life is here. We have expensive models that go to stupid tv shows, we have dog fighting, we have mercedes, we have old trucks, we have killers, businessmen, we feel love, we have houses... our life, as you can see in the movie, isn`t as different as you think. Amores perros can show you that life is not easy here. but that`s it. What you saw is thousand`s of people life. that`s why it`s so magic to you. Your? seeing what you will never live there, in london, new york, seattle, paris, berlin... reality is weirder than fiction... see it on amores perros, and you`ll believe me... live it here, and no movie will surprise you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant movie! One of the best this decade...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Amores Perros' impressed the hell out of me. Three interrelated tales of the darker side of life in contemporary Mexico City, each one as fresh and as fascinating as the last. Each of the three stories are dark, disturbing and filled with humanity. Superbly acted all round, but especially noteworthy is the standout performance by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo, a political dissident turned hitman, and if the charismatic Gael Garcia Bernal (Octavia, the lovesick dog fighter) isn't an international star in the making I'll eat my words. This brilliant movie shows up the mediocrity of most current Hollywood "product", and to my mind ranks with a small handful of movies made this decade ('Chopper', 'The Pledge', 'The Way Of The Gun') that are truly memorable and with genuine substance. This one is a winner and essential viewing for all movie lovers. A future classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must've beaten Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon in the Academy Awards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think we're talking about one of the best Mexican films ever (i say so, knowing there's been excellent Luis Bu?uel films as well as Arturo Ripstein ones, like 'Principio y Fin' -Begining and End- that is this director's highest peak (based on the book by Naguib Mafusz)and Emilio 'El Indio' Fernandez ones that i don't personally like that much (even though he received the Golden Bear in the 'Berlinale').Being surrounded by terrible Mexican movies, 'Amores Perros' was so refreshing and remarkably above every expectation that everybody could have about a first-time director (even though he was well-known for his wonderful work at advertising (changing the way ads were made in Mexico) and as a radio DJ in a WFM radio station that contributed to change radio in Mexico, too, along with Rock 101. Gonzalez I?arritu (in cooperation with his almost personal screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga) creates such a complex yet flawless history based on three individual ones that converge not only in the dantesque (reference to Dante Alighieri's style, The Divine Comedy) car accident, but in their perception and description of how love can be harsh, as well as life itself, of how love can get to be a bitch, a struggle.First Story ('Octavio y Susana') is about Octavio's (Garcia Bernal) obsession with his sister-in-law, Susana (Vanessa Bauche), but it's also about the violence, about an illusion, about betrayal, about loss. This is also reflected in the character of Octavio's dog, Cofi in a parallel relationship with his owner while he seeks his own destiny, having lost everything, he'll have to redefine his life. This parallelism also occurs in the second story('Daniel y Valeria'), an almost surreal one, where Ritchie being trapped underneath the condo's floor represents how it's owner Valeria (Goya Toledo) is trapped in a relation with Daniel that grows sicker as her injury (caused by the car accident) gets worse. The removal of the gigantic advertising of 'Enchant', the scent campaign that she used to be the image for, from the view of her balcony represents their decline: Daniel (Avaro Guerrero) left behind his marriage for this superficial mirage kind of dream, and she will have to make a whole redefinition of her life after losing everything. The dog-character parallelism with the main characters of this film can also be noticed in the third story ('El Chivo y Maru'), where 'El Chivo' (Emilio Echevaria), a former College teacher that left it all, family included, to become some guerrilla terrorist (is there a symbolism for Subcommander Marcos, from EZLN?), and now finds, by losing it all (all of his dogs being killed), but finding a new reason, new company just before a hit-man-type mission where he sets a confrontation between two brothers in such a biblical style the chance that none of the characters from the rest of the stories had: redemption. That's when he decides to retrieve some of the things he has lost, like Maru (Lourdes Echevarria -Emilio's actual daughter in real life), by at least apologizing to her, and redeeming himself finding a new life. It's clear that he'll stop being a homeless, because by the end of the movie he's got plenty of money. This story is one step ahead of the other two, cause after the loss they are all victims of, 'El Chivo' is the only one who gets that chance to start from scratch once again. Huge merit to Emilio Echevarria's performance for making believable the only character that was in risk of not being plausible of the film. Because of the relation within the characters, their dogs and their own love personal story, the title is, too a big success (both in Spanish and in English). Of the episodic narrative structure of the movie (a few critics in the Cannes Film Festival compared it with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction), it can be said that besides making it more beautiful and complex, it's also necessary. One can't figure a way to resolve the situation other than this one. The thrill, the shock would never be the same. For example, if each one was a short film instead, it wouldn't work the same way as the whole movie.In the film, Gonzalez I?arritu allows himself to appear a few times: in the editorial where Daniel works, for example, verifying a magazine cover; having some of the TV spots he made in the 90's when he was a publicist shown in the movie; and in the last scene, 'El Chivo' names the dog he rescued (formerly known as Cofi) as 'El Negro', I?arritu's nickname.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doggie Holocaust makes for Best Mexican Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature "Y Tu Mama Tambien"). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, "Amores Perros" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Men And Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Mexican movie was surprisingly good. I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.Three different stories in today's Mexico mix with very few common elements. The characters belong to different social categories, and nothing connects them at first sight, excepting the feeling of un-happiness, and - yes - dogs. Dogs play an important role in all three stories. One more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers. Directing is excellent, the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome, they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. There are so many memorable scenes, that I would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent, or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do dogs have personal characters? Or they just try to be loyal to their owners? What if they reflect our personalities by means of their loyalty?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to contributors, plot synopsis has been very well written. Amores Perros is included in the most important movies for the beginning of the 21st century. It marked a new epoch with its thoroughly life-like vision on a twist of fate. Then in a 5 years' of time within more recognized movies, we started seeing similar plot schemes telling different stories over accidents that binds each person's fate. One of them was Crash, and it won the best picture Oscar in 2005.The more you see this film over and over again you'll get to a deeper point where the lives and choices of the characters won't matter any more. It's still affecting in the first-time watch, but with an examining view the next time you see it; you're driven into a vision, a cast of mind.There were 3 main characters and 3 main stories from each one, which are nested altogether. If we look at these stories over the characters' relationships with their dogs, it's intriguing. As if the dogs exemplify their owners: 1' Young loafer Octavio commits crime in order to earn money to make a living. He fights his dog Cofi in dog-fighting tournaments. How Cofi needs to fight for his life, so does need Octavio to commit crime for his life.2' In the second story, beautiful model Valeria receives a surprise gift from her fiancé to choose a puppy from a pet store. By time, the puppy gets used to live a super-luxury pet life; which is the same life style of her owner. Valeria and her fiancé's apartment unit is under a hardwood flooring construction. One day while alone at home the puppy falls into a gap between the hardwood and the concrete; thus stays stuck there and began to squawk, since she is not used to live without comfort. At the same day her owner Valeria gets involved in a car accident while driving alone, having no one to help her just as happened to her puppy. She loses her leg in this accident and her luxury life comes to an end, as same as the life of her puppy. She begins complaining like her puppy squawking.3' In the last story, the grim hit-man El Chivo saves the life of Octavio's dog Cofi, after Octavio gets killed in the traffic accident in which Valeria lost her leg. Saving him changes Cofi's life, he no longer needs to fight for Octavio's bets on dog-fighting. His life becomes safe and peaceful. El Chivo starts looking after Cofi beside his other dogs. Among the other dogs Cofi looks very ugly and dirty. One day when El Chivo leaves the dogs together at home, Cofi kills every one of them. His reason of killing all the dogs explains why his owner is a hit-man. As Cofi killed innocent dogs; El Chivo kills innocent people for El Chivo seeing himself ugly,dirty and strange among the people; like his dog feeling himself ugly,dirty and strange among the dogs. El Chivo feels bad about his dogs, when he finds out Cofi has killed them. Yet, he feels worse about himself when he actually realizes that Cofi's attitude gave him a lesson of life. Then El Chivo shaves, cuts his beard and hair, gets cleaned up and turns out looking like a gentleman. Cofi's attitude changes his life; his life becomes safe and peaceful just as when El Chivo saved Cofi's life.The vision we're getting when we compare these 3 stories is about the public loneliness of an individual. The only person, who can guide and who can help us, is ourselves. This loneliness brings our freedom of choices. With making our own choices, we build the essence of our character: Our quintessences. Life is sum of all our choices. In order to build our quintessences; we always face the risk, fear and pressure of the chance of making a wrong choice. Life makes it obligatory to make choices. This obligatory builds our inner crisis and develops our personality. To find the secrets of our own personality, we try to find someone or something else to lay a burden on the responsibility of self-search. Here in Amores Perros, the 3 main characters are used by their self-search reflection on their dogs.Doesn't this vision form the idea of Jean Paul Sartre's "Being and Nothingness"? Since Amores Perros hides the character views through the situations created by dogs; it is a movie that has no characters, but only situations. This is the systematic of Existentialism. If there was no situation or happening, there wouldn't have been any characters. Existence precedes essence. A person is nothing without his actions. So, a person doesn't have a soul(or a character) if he is not alive. Then there wasn't and won't be anything before and after our lives. If we don't believe in this vision, certainly the signs of fate that we come across in our lives must be delusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a director's film it is astounding but as a narrative it has it's highs and lows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man gets into the world of illegal dog fighting in order to get enough money together to be able to run away with his brother's wife, but in the meantime he starts tension with another dog owner. A beautiful young model signs a lucrative contract with a perfume company and moves into her new flat with her lover ? only for her tragedy to strike and her dog to go missing. Finally an ex-convict and guerrilla mourns the wife he left decades ago and longs to meet the daughter who thinks he is dead ? but is also contracted to kill a businessman. These three lives come together in a car crash that acts as a catalyst in changing their lives.After seeing 21 Grams I knew that I had to get round to seeing this film. With it's appearance on TV (BBC4 showing itself to really be a 'place to think' and a wonderful channel to have) I took the opportunity to watch it, expecting a film that would match the good things I had heard about it. &gt;From the opening car chase that results in the crash that the film spirals outwards from like debris, through for most of the first hour, I was hooked ? the pace was great and the story gripping. It was violent, exciting and yet had a human element to it as well. However the second story knocked the wind out of it for a moment, and seemed to lack the emotion of the first. It was based around an urban myth of sorts and wasn't as good ? even if it did pick up towards the end.The third story saw it return to a much more involving story of pain and the grinding out of life (as in 'getting by'). Maybe it was the rich lifestyles of the characters in story two that stopped me caring as much ? I don't know but I know that the contrast between one &amp; two made it more obvious how much the pace had dropped ? especially when we are left wanted to know what happened to the characters we had spent an hour getting to care about. Anyway, the third story is a satisfying ending to the film and drew me back in emotionally where the second story had cut me off by it's abrupt start. Story two finishes before story three begins, and therefore it was easier to move on.I think the problem with this film for me was not the fact that three stories were intermingled but that I didn't think they were actually mixed well ? the way the film moves away from characters before concluding their section (eg Octavia), the way the stories are actually quite separate from one another, these things and other I felt weakened the films ? although each story was strong on it's own I just felt that story 2 was such a change to the film that it hurt it.However, as a film debut this is an amazing piece of work and is relentlessly impressive. From the opening car chase to the dog fights to the silent pain of the model looking out where her image once hung ? in all these different moments I thought he did a great job and visually the film was never dull once no matter if it was set in a penthouse flat or a basement of an old building with the blood of dead dogs. And while we're on the subject, at the time of release I heard critics say they walked out of the film, refusing to watch cruelty to animals even being simulated. I can see their point but also think that they missed the fact that the animals in the film are mostly loved (even if they mostly die!) ? however it is love and compassion for other humans that the film shows the characters having difficulty with, and this is where the emotional impact of the film is ? not in simulated dogfights, albeit very well simulated dogfights that are hard to hear even if they are mostly unseen.The cast were all natural but I always find it hard to judge performances when they are not in English. Having said that, there were no bad performances in the whole thing ? even if some have better material to work with than others. Of course I still think this is a director's film and the cast often take second place to the style and the feel of the film.Overall I really enjoyed this film but don't believe it deserves to be considered one of the 'best films ever made?'! The opening hour is superb and it's pace is relentless (even in more sensitive moments) but the sudden stop the film makes when it changes to story two is too much to stand and really caused the film to stutter for me. It gets better and is fully back on track for story three but there are problems running all through the narrative. Even though it has a lower rating on IMDb at time of writing, I'd still say that 21 Grams offer this same fragmented style but with a much more satisfying narrative. Regardless of my nit picking I still think this is a powerful film that makes 150 minutes fly by with a huge amount of style from the first-time director, even if it does not live up to the endlessly gushing praise lavished upon it by many viewers.</fullReview>

I don't buy the comparison to Pulp Fiction or any other work. The disregard of chronological scene order and intertwining storylines have been occuring in films for years. Its done for effect here, is all.Alejandro Inarritu simply lets his actors take over and finishes off a puzzle that is almost complete as a result of the writing and acting. Not to denigrate his work, of course. After all, the ability to trust your actors and let them work is key to being a great director.

		<fullReview>This movie is a must-to-see if you can get over the 'subtitles' fact. (I didn't have no problems with it because I understand Spanish). Personally I was really impressed by the quality, perfection, and superb acting of this Mexican movie. The movie consists of three different stories connected by one sole incident. Sometimes you will see the same scene from a different point of view. Or you'll see an out of place scene that will make sense later on. The script was exquisite, very loyal to the culture. The direction was brilliant keeping us interested from beginning to end. And the performances were excellent, so natural and real that you felt as if they were people you knew. Be aware there's extreme violence in this movie, and even though there were kids in the theater I went to, this is not a family movie. I don't recommend it for children if you are a responsible parent. This movie deserves an award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may enjoy it more, but I found Amores Perros to be a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To make God laugh, tell him your plans."I usually love these kinds of sprawling dramas about interconnected people, but I suppose there's an exception to every rule. Amores Perros is that exception, for me. It felt more like a 2 1/2 hour soap opera, than a riveting drama.&nbsp;The only story of the three presented here that somewhat interested me was that of Daniel and Valeria. The rest of my time with Amores Perros was spent wondering why none of these people have caller ID, wondering whether this movie set some kind of record for most fake dead dogs in a film, wondering who El Chivo reminded me of (Il Duce from Boondock Saints), wondering why they just didn't cover the darn hole (who leaves gaping holes in the middle of their apartment floor?), and trying to think up a name for the dog (never came up with anything I liked more than Lost Dog). Mostly, I was just bored.&nbsp;I've read other people describe this as a powerful movie. Unfortunately, it just didn't do much for me. I give it credit for breaking my heart over those gorgeous legs (a true tragedy, my friends), but that's about it.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will someone please tell me what all the fuss is about? If the presence of gore is the gauge of cinematic skill, then yes, AMORES PERROS is a masterpiece. But surely one first-time director's fascination with maimed dogs and Mexicanismo does not a 21st-century film template make. Granted, it's a somewhat cleverly crafted story, but this blood-guts-passion trip through Mexico City fails to make any real point or leave the audience with much to ponder. (Though I did find myself contemplating how they managed to locate all those dead-dog body doubles for the live dogs...)AMORES PERROS, which the film translates as "Love is a Bitch," might be better rendered "Love is Like a Dog," or "Some of These People Actually LOVE Dogs," or "If You Love Your Dog, Don't See This Movie." It opens with a truly gruesome car crash in which blood and guts swirl around liberally. If you happen to walk in late, never fear: the scene will replay twice more. With this event as the anchor, the film flashes back and forward on the lives directly and tangentially involved--what led up to this bloody wreck and how it affects all concerned.Driving the offending vehicle is Octavio (Gael García Bernal), brother of the abusive Ramiro (Marco Pérez) and lover-in-waiting of his wife, Susana (Vanessa Bauche). Octavio's role is basically to hang around the house panting at his sister-in-law, until he decides to make money by entering Ramiro's vicious mastiff in dog fights. The car he's slammed into conveys supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo), whose successful career ends on impact. She is mistress to Daniel (Álvaro Guerrero), who's gone middle-age crazy and separated from his wife to live with Valeria 24/7. The supermodel's true love, however, is her moplike Lhasa apso, Richie.The triptych's third panel focuses on El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría), a former revolutionary. Imprisoned while his daughter was born, he has never met her, though he's remained obsessed with images of her for more than 20 years. He moons over her while alternately practicing his assassination skills and living with his own pack of canines.AMORES PERROS is the debut film of director Alejandro González Inárritu, a Mexican DJ who's apparently seen PULP FICTION a few times. While it doesn't slavishly imitate Tarantino, it noticeably cops a few of his moves. Like a bad case of coffee nerves, the film functions best at high velocity and on razor's edge. There's plenty of speeded-up action, trick cuts, and always the threat of imminent gore. With many scenes rife with tension, AMORES often strays into telenovela territory, though it's tough to tell if the melodrama is intentional.Yet, strangely enough, after all this adrenaline puts us on red alert, we are thrust into an extremely tedious middle portion, in which Valeria's dog gets trapped beneath floorboards and the hapless couple can't reckon how to retrieve him. Richie whines night after night, Valeria whines night after night, fights ensue, she stages a minirevolt from her wheelchair--and we're left with a yawning, "And your point is...."Is love a bitch? Sure. Do people treat their loves like dogs? Sometimes. Is this a rich metaphor that bears 2 1/2 hours of graphically violent exploration? Not really. Does this represent, as raves the NEW YORK TIMES, "the first classic of the new decade"? I'd hate to think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiringly unpleasant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dense, overtly sophisticated, but never really wise, script by Mr. Arriaga gets the famed "Inarritu treatment" ? otherwise known as "fanciful free fall in the arms of obsessive despair and educated repulsion". The "problem" with Amores Perros (also with 21 Grams and Babel) is you just can't ignore it. Or, to put it better, you'd feel some kind of terminal guilt (appropriately?) if you did. The three intertwining stories revolve ambitiously and high-poweredly around the theme of fatalism, on "love's a bitch" (more or less the title), on "brother against brother" religious motifs, on Kieslowski, Poe, a bit of Mexican-period Bunuel, and on a to-the-point requiem on Viva La Revolucion. In short however, this is a salute to the idea of "God laughing when people make plans". (To be honest, God laughs when people make movies about God). In any case, the only one laughing in Inarritu's humorless universe could be God, though I don't really see why He'd be so pleased in seeing his creatures miserable as hell (?). Obviously this is a vengeful divine presence overlooking the production of Amores Perros, a production stately (while recalling Mr. Babenko's 1981 Pixote) and, occasionally, inspiringly unpleasant. Undoubtedly a masterpiece for those who get their ideological kicks in non-American speaking filmmaking, an intriguing torture for the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Amores Perros' is a shocking experience from visionary director Alejandro Gonzalez I?arritu. It's a difficult film to watch, one which continuously challenges its audience, but a reward in of itself for those who can withstand its brutality. It puts a magnifying glass to the pain of love, and those who are destroyed by it. It gives new meaning to the film title's literal translation, 'love is a bitch'.In a single moment in time, several lives in Mexico City will be changed forever by a devastating car crash. The film divides itself into three separate segments: representing the past, present, and future. Octavio is searching for recognition and love, but looks in the wrong places. It's a desire that drives him, leading him to make choices in life that will soon haunt him. Valerie, whose life is most impacted by the car accident, finds herself living in a relationship that's crumbling and self-destructing. El Chivo must deal with the absence of his daughter, and the void it's left in his life. He finds companionship in the dogs he picks up off the street, and they soon become the only living things he can connect with. Together, the lives of these individuals will collide in more ways than one. They will find themselves connected by a single thread: love. And the hell that can be unleashed with it.When I finished watching 'Amores Perros', one of the first things that popped into my mind was why 'Babel' couldn't have been this good. Where 'Babel' lacked in emotional depths and highs, 'Amores Perros' at times finds itself drowning in it. It's a visceral and gritty film, so raw and intense. You may think you've seen it all, but 'Perros' will challenge even those who are rarely phased by cinema. You may find it difficult not to look away at times. I?arritu's movie has been described as being a 'dog holocaust', and at times I can't disagree. The film's sheer violence is so penetrating and disturbing, it packs a mighty punch. And while this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart, there's no question that 'Amores Perros' has a tender heart and message ready to be heard. I?arritu crafts a compelling story from start to finish, which strips down to the bare basics. His ability to capture a piece of the human spirit is wondrous, even if it doesn't always cast us in the best light. It's dark, fierce, and relentless, but nothing short of greatness.'Amores Perros' features an array of actors and actresses, all of which work wonders in their respective roles. Gael Garcia Bernal is, as always, brilliant. It's a more restrained and less quirky role than many are used to seeing him in, but nonetheless has the rare ability to capture and audience's attention with ease. Emilio Echevarria stars as El Chivo, and delivers a haunting performance as a man who finds himself alone and saddened. It's the weakest part of the film, but is made up for by Emilio's wonderful presence. Goya Toledo plays Valerie, a celebrity crippled by the accident the film revolves around. I found her part in the story to be most interesting, if not for the fact of seeing the life of someone who goes from having it all to nothing at all. There are many numerous performances, too many to cover, but they all lend their talents to create something extraordinary.'Amores Perros' is an adrenaline rush for its entire running, which tops two-and-a-half hours. It's all a very human and primal film, which can be attributed to I?arritu's impeccable style and talent. Combining a mutli-faceted story with electric performances, 'Perros' works on many different layers to satisfying results. An original and bold step in film-making, this nearly perfect picture will have you experience a collage of emotions, and invest in flawed characters... all for the sake of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mexican Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course I watched Pulp Fiction and when I first saw this movie, it was on TV on local station. Later bought DVD, and watched movie a couple of times and realized, in some way, that this film is even better than Pulp Fiction. It's more human than any US multi-plot-anachrono-psycho-thriller film that I ever watched. Acting is very intense, young Bernal and old Emilio especially, and the cohesion of the different-class stories is excellent. Also I must say that the tempo of a movie and soundtracks of the song are doing just in a right way. Comparing "Crush" to this masterpiece is like comparing Coldplay to Radiohead in rock music. Although I never saw a Mexican film before (only their moronic love-story series), I felt like I was right there in Mexico city, while watching. Brutal scenes for the first time in my life, make film more realistic, instead of making distance from the real life. Everybody is so edgy in this movie, but in a natural way. Great atmosphere, great film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about LIFE beyond our noses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Been reading the comments posted... To all the viewers who angrily ask "what is all the excitement about?" (or questions along those lines) I here now have an answer: It's about life in the core of the largest city on the planet. That's all, but of course, if you've never been in Mexico City I can see how understanding this film can be tough.The problem is that we are so used to watching commercial Hollywood productions that only serve the purpose of entertainment (if at all) that we forget there's an entire world out there where LIFE is different and where the movie industry has very limited funds. This film does a superb job at portraying real lives (read it again: REAL) in Mexico City. This is Gonzalez-Inarritu's gift to us. When countries that are not particularly known for they film industry come up with something like AMORES PERROS, it is my opinion we should simply rejoice. (For a list of -the very few- good Mexican films please see my comment on "Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN".)Let us be grateful that we have these kind of movies that make us think about, reflect on, and realize DIFFERENCE. Of course AMORES PERROS is hard to watch... so? Isn't life hard to live?... but you and I are still waking up every morning.AMORES PERROS is no Pulp Fiction, and comparing it to Traffic makes absolutely no sense at all. Gonzalez-Inarritu's opera prima stands proudly on its own.Mainstream Hollywood productions live on our noses, yours and mine (it's unavoidable.) So when we get the chance to witness a foreign film of this caliber, we should learn to place our senses way beyond the nose and maybe then we'll begin to understand what all the excitement is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Car Crash, Canines and Consequences Examined in I?árritu's Viscerally Powerful Feature Film Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If like me, you were dazzled by this year's "Babel", you will likely be as curious as I was to check out the first film in director Alejandro Gonzalez I?árritu's trilogy about death. Similar in narrative structure to "Babel", this viscerally shattering 2000 movie carries three overlapping stories tied together by a defining car accident. Written with dramatic precision by Guillermo Arriaga (who later wrote the other two films in the trilogy, "21 Grams" and "Babel"), all three take place within the different social strata of Mexico City, and as the title implies (English translation: "Love's a Bitch"), dogs are intriguingly pivotal to each story. Also like "Babel", the various interconnections among the stories do not come across as contrived but rather as emotional resonant in a gradually revelatory manner. Even though the movie runs an epic length of 153 minutes, it consistently holds your attention.The first plot line, "Octavio and Susana", is about a love triangle that occurs between young Octavio, his abusive older brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife Susana. Dog fighting is common sport in their downscale neighborhood, and the brothers own a rottweiler that's a natural aggressor in the fight pit. Octavio sees the dog as his meal ticket to steal Susana away from Ramiro and escape to Juarez. The second story, "Daniel and Valeria", focuses on Daniel, a married, guilt-ridden TV producer who buys a fancy new condo for him to live with his tempestuous supermodel girlfriend Valeria. Their relationship unravels in light of the car accident, and further complications occur when her little dog is trapped underneath the floorboards. The third story, "El Chivo and Maru", is about former political revolutionary El Chivo who has years ago left his family and became a hit man for hire. Living in squalor with a herd of homeless dogs, he is recruited by a businessman to kill his partner, both of whom turns out to be brothers. The integration of these stories is handled with supple dexterity in a non-linear fashion that allows the viewer to peel off the layers of the characters in order to understand their common dilemmas.Unbelievably, this powderkeg of a film represents I?árritu's feature film debut as a director, and his confidence and audacity are felt throughout although the third episode seems too deliberate a pastiche of "Pulp Fiction". He has assembled a superb cast with Emilio Echevarría the standout as the grizzled El Chivo, a scarifying vagrant who reveals himself to be a troubled soul who is the only one who successfully escapes his trying existence. In his first major role, Gael García Bernal portrays Octavio with escalating emotional fervor; and as Susana and Ramiro, Vanessa Bauche and Marco Pérez provide powerful support. Together, they generate a palpable sense of imminent violence throughout their episode. Goya Toledo makes a vivid impression as Valeria, fully capturing her spoiled character's misplaced sense of entitlement, while Alvaro Guerrero affectingly humanizes the put-upon Daniel's increasing regret. Just as he would prove later with "The Motorcycle Diaries", "Brokeback Mountain" and "Babel", Rodrigo Prieto showcases superbly evocative cinematography that is in keeping with the emotional shadings of the story.The 2001 DVD provides a surprising number of extras beginning with an informative, often meticulous commentary track by I?árritu and Arriaga (spoken in Spanish and subtitled in English). There are three quick featurettes. The first is a six-minute short that shows how the numerous dogs used in the film were trained and protected during the production. Considering how realistically violent the dog fighting scenes are, I find this short helpfully reassuring. The second is the standard, making-of featurette, about fifteen minutes long. Even though I?árritu seems to be promoting the film as well as explaining the genesis of it, there is good behind-the-scenes footage, including some interesting table readings from the cast. This leads to one quick short about the staging of the car accident itself. Also included are about a dozen deleted scenes, totaling about fifteen minutes, which actually help provide context in understanding some of the characters' motivations. There are also three music videos from the movie's soundtrack, which is a dramatically effective mix of Mexican and Spanish rock-rap tracks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes It Takes Thirty Six Drafts For Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two boys are on the run, being chased by a pickup through the streets of Mexico City, their fear fueled by concern for the bleeding dog slumped on the back seat of their car. Something bad has happened and is about to happen; though we don't know what it is or what it is going to be there is no slipping off for popcorn now; we are hooked. lollWithin a few minutes an event occurs which will change the lives of all the characters we will follow through three stories. In 'Octavio y Susana' we find the uneasy building of a relationship between two unlikely characters ? Susana, the wife of Octavio's brother, Ramiro, and Octavio. Thrown into uncomfortably close quarters, propinquity indeed fuels Octavio's interest in Ramiro's woman. But there is more, much more, and in expressing his love for her and concern for her treatment - by his insufferably self-centered brother ? he acts as we might. Through Ramiro's (or is it Octavio's?) Rottwieler dog Cofi we are introduced to the world of dogfighting; this is Octavio's opportunity to raise the cash he needs to accomplish his goals.In the second episode 'Daniel y Valeria' we dolly in on the lives of two more fortunate (read upper class) characters ? he a conflicted businessman carrying on an affair, she a supermodel the object of his affections. Their dog Ritchie will cause them no end of stress through an unfortunate accident, altering forever their relationship. Valeria's physical infirmities are traced to the life-altering moment all the film's characters eventually share. 'El Chivo y Maru', our final chapter, picks up on the events of a homeless sort we have met early in the film. And so it is revealed that he is a colorful character, sick at heart over his separation from his wife and daughter in the distant past. His actions and inactions ? and how he becomes entwined in the lives of those we have met along the way ? send him irrevocably into the path of all those we have followed earlier.All these characters are threaded through the narrative in such a way that their presence at a particular place at the same time will be totally natural; in retrospect we will determine that fate is less happenstance than it is some grand design. The acting is first rate ? see Octavio's visage (and note the lighting) as he reveals his feelings to Susana, watch the pain on El Chivo's face as sad events batter him in rapid order, feel the hurt on both ends of a phone non-conversation between Daniel and his estranged wife.The dog fights, the premeditated crimes, mishaps and love affairs all arrive at a terminus and we will not ever forget the journey.According to director Alejandro González I?árritu (interview, http://www.indiewire.com/people/int_Alejand_Gonzal_010330.html) thirty six drafts of the script were developed ('It was like a domino effect') over three years. As ideas were framed he notes it was difficult to blend these new threads - with any subtlety - into the fabric of the whole. But accomplish this he did; the results are terrific, bold, unpredictable, unsettling and ultimately satisfying.Rating: Four Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first ninety minutes of so of Amores Perros is magnificent. It would maybe even qualify as one of the greatest films of all time. Gael Garcia Bernal is incredible, perhaps his best role, and the cinematography complements the plot perfectly, full of dark and dirty shots. The dog fighting is intense and particularly well shot. The characters are real, the acting is believable and nuanced, the plot goes at a fast pace and I was gripped.Then the film changes course completely, to a film about a model and her unfaithful boyfriend who get caught up in the car crash. And the film dies right there. It becomes boring, stilted, uninteresting, and I found myself drifting away several times. The characters didn't intrigue me, the storyline was weak, and even when they brought the old man with the dogs and the beard into play it wasn't enough to save it. Watching the model cry 'Richie' over and over again while her dog was stuck under the floorboards bored the tears out of me, and it's a subplot and dialogue line that went on for nearly half an hour.They had something really special here and ruined it. This should have been edited down and the latter plot lines should have become minor distractions if they were included at all. It's such a waste of the groundwork laid early on; a masterpiece turned into an average film. I only watched on in the hope I'd see the conclusion to the initial plot. Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Motorcycle Diaries and La Mala Educacian are all better than this as far as the classic Gael Garcia Bernal films go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Storytelling But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this as I had heard all the hype about it off IMDb and managed to get it in a DVD sale for ?8. The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.When Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it's not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.The movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. Another good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros is a film which I did not enjoy, it's not a bad film but it's just not enjoyable.Three stories are connected by both one event and the use of dogs. The actors are quite good, the film is shot well but it drags, especially in the middle portion of the film which is unfortunate as the characters from the middle story are the most likable.The violent backdrop of dogfighting is extremely hard to watch for dog and animal lovers, some of the scenes are just too close to the bone. In my opinion I think that it departed from drama and art and crossed the line into senseless and horrific violence.The actual mixing of the stories was very jarred which seemed to weaken the film and there seemed to be too many plot points unresolved by the end of the film.I scored the film 5 out of 10, due to it's problems with pacing, plot and un-likable characters. I wouldn't recommend this film to any animal lovers but those who liked the film 'Crash' might enjoy it.</fullReview>

Hard to prove...but just watch Amores Perros and see for yourself.This film is superbly acted and directed. The love of the animals is obvious and heartfelt, and is key to the humanity at the core of this movie.I picked this movie because I really am a fan of Garcia Bernal...but all the other actors, to a person, are extraordinary. It is a gritty and realistic story that deserves to be seen.I will watch more movies by this director, and will look for movies with these actors.

It is not only an excellent film with extraordinary performances but also a captivating movie with 3 different stories with the connection of the dogs. All the actors play their roles brilliantly. Thanks to all these things I highly recommend this movie to all the people who love good movies. Thanks to this film I am starting to love Mexican films and Mexican actors, specially Emilio Echevarria, recently seen in 'The Alamo', film which I did not like at all due to the way in which the Mexican soldiers are portrayed, but this is not the case. What I am saying is that 'Amores perros' is absolutely recommendable to all those people interested in good movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood does not make movies like this - its honest but made with good quality editing, thoughtful directing with attention to the smallest detail. The dialogs are very true and row; there are no Tarantion's clichés here. The cast is excellent - and you will end up thinking if they are acting at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I was really excited about seeing this one: stunning debut, the Mexican Pulp Fuction...But, quite honestly, I was bored by about halfway through, and that didn't change before the end. Some nice touches throughout rescued it from being drudgery, but it just wasn't enough.I normally like this sort of film, with separate stories suddenly coming together...but for that sort of film, the stories actually have to come together at some point. And they didn't, apart from a couple of random tenuous links that really aren't enough. If it's just meant to be three separate stories, they just needed more to them.Sorry, I tried. Harsh but fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylistic with some undercurrent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros is pretty good stylistic film - got all the 'modern' elements e.g. color filters, camera techniques, quick wit gangster talk, disjoint time lines, etc. I'm happy that this is a breakthrough Mexican film, I even praise the thoughtfulness in integrating the modern film techniques with the culture. Well done. I just hoped to see more new styles created by Mexican film industry, in a way that isn't subordinate to American or European film fashions - something even newer and more extraordinary so to make Hollywood/Europeans be the copycat for few decades would be wonderful to see :)The undercurrent in the film, what's the symbolism of phone calls that hangs-up? (distance? fate?) It happened in two stories, and there is considerable reuse of the phone scenes to warrant some design in the metaphor of the phone. The dog trapped under the floor board, what does that mean? I mean it is extremely unusual people to leave their pet trapped for so long, what does it represent in terms of their relationships or maybe personal baggage, or that their relationship is going through mazes in the dark with rats lurking? What does the floorboard breaking on the first day represent - breaking the surface?That's all the questions I have right now. Good night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more i see Amores Perros on DVD (I am proud to make this DVD as my private collection) the more i am moved by the director's work. The film maker is so honest in his film making. I think it takes a lot to give such a BRILLIANT cinema. This film tells three different story at the same time. Past, Present and Future is the judgment running in all the three tales.The performances are very natural and awesome at the same time. Gael Garcia is the best amongst all. Vanessa Bauche is also good. The camera work and technical aspects will be remembered through this film always, As they give a noticing turn to Cinema History. This film is according to me the years best reviewed film.This film MUST be kept in the film making museum (If Exists) so that different film makers learns different things and levels of film making. A film that is a Classic. And Classics are never RE CREATED. Be it 21 Grams OR Babel (Of course i've not seen BABEL yet).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I believe that the future of film is now firmly in the hands of Spanish-speaking filmmakers. Not that they make the best films, but that they have the current crop of ideas. We saw Italians introduce us to the notion that a camera can be tethered to the soul of a character and follow him around. This is still the standard of the much celebrated Scorsese.The French were briefly interesting when to this they added the notion of reflexivity, where the mechanics of film-making became a character. Hollywood - in their more interesting films - extended this notion of folding to an amazing collection of ironic and self-referential devices.Meanwhile, Spanish literature was long incubating a synthesis of fabulism within self- reference (Cervantes invented the notion) combined with earthy sensuality, sometimes natural energy.So in contrast to the Scorsese-led `character' stuff, and the often mechanical Hollywood folding exercises, we get Spanish films from Medem, Almodovar and Garcia. Rodriguez is very much in this camp. And now this.Yes, it is overly long and uneven. Yes it is artificially gritty and has some dishonest performances. But it is extremely well constructed, both on a dramatic and conceptual level.Folding in this context is placed in the fantasy of rather than perspective or character. Why give several stories? Taratino does because Kar Wai Wong does, and his motive is to bleach the story away and focus on the musical texture of the mood. But Garcia does it (`Ten Tiny Love Stories,' `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking at Her.') to synthesize a single entity out of many and a single larger context out of the many sketched situations. The focus is on that larger context, and what magical dynamics are at work. It is pop cosmology as art drawn from drowning the soap opera content. It is new melodrama - melodrama is when the characters are puppets to external forces - with attention to interesting exposition and subterranean channels of those forces.Fate. Dogs as astrological entities.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love for dogs or for money?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director Alejandro González I?árritu did an extraordinary thriller combining masterfully three different stories where fighting dogs are included, and also using the camera in tricky ways several times probably to increase the excitement. In Mexico there are many ways to earn money for survival in some cases or for lucrative purposes in others. There fights among animals are arranged regularly. In Mexico the so-called Palenques are famous where the people go to see fights between cocks, but also fights of dogs are organized in places less formal than Palenques. In both fights the people bet, some small money but others high sums. The film goes around this issue of fights between dogs, where obviously you have always a persistent dog champion, highly susceptible to be killed by other means in order to take it away. But the film is in fact about the misery of the humans, no matter if they are poor or rich. Amores Perros is an exceptional film, and a sample of the quality of several new-era films in Latin America, which may compete easily in their plots and depth with other films made in Europe and USA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three stories are connected by a horrific car accident in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's feature film debut. All three stories also revolve, at least to some extent, around dogs (the title translates to Love's a Bitch, with "Bitch" having a double meaning). The three stories vary in interest, in my opinion, and I struggled by the end to connect them or really to care about any of them on a deep level. Still, it's a pretty entertaining flick and very strongly directed. In the first story, Gael Garcia Bernal stars as a young man who's in love with his older brother's wife. He decides to enter his rottweiler into a series of dog fights, but he runs up against an opponent who isn't keen on losing. In the second story, a model (Goya Toledo) moves in with her boyfriend, but their happiness is immediately destroyed by the aforementioned accident. During her recovery, her beloved terrier disappears into a hole in their apartment's hardwood floor and never comes back. In the third story, a hit-man (Emilio Echevarria) who poses as a bum has an existential crisis. I more or less preferred them in the order they played out, though even the first story has its flaws (am I really supposed to have much sympathy for a guy who participates in dog fights?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alejandro Gonzáles I?árritu's Feature Film Debut Is An Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Gonzáles I?árittu's feature film debut is a masterwork of outstanding direction, terrific writing &amp; fabulous performances which, thanks to its ingeniously layered &amp; cleverly narrated story, commences his directional career on a rousing high while also succeeding as one of world cinema's finest films to surface on the silver screen at the turn of the new millennium.Amores Perros is a three segment story interconnected by a car accident. First segment concerns a young man who enters the world of dog fighting for easy money in order to start a new life with his sister-in-law. Second segment is about a supermodel &amp; covers her life after the near- fatal accident, and the final segment involves a mysterious vagrant wandering the streets of Mexico City.Directed by Gonzáles I?árritu, the film is the first instalment in his Trilogy of Death and where its real strength lies is in the cut-throat fashion in which it grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moments &amp; never lets go until the very end. Written by Guillermo Arriaga, the screenplay is a work of quality in itself, for each event is thoroughly refined &amp; the characters are carefully fleshed-out.Cinematography makes extensive use of hand-held cameras &amp; provides a raw, gritty look to the whole narrative. Editing is deftly carried out for each segment is emotionally gripping &amp; steadily paced. Gustavo Santaolalla's score &amp; other incorporated songs nicely compliment the story, and its entire cast chips in with a stellar performance which ends up further elevating its overall impact.On an overall scale, Amores Perros is a brutal reflection of love, loss, loyalty, betrayal, revenge, regret &amp; hope, expressed through its characters' dilemma in a highly compelling manner, which also offers an insight into the different sections of Mexican society. This instant classic may not be an easy sit for few due to its disturbing content but for its remorseless take on the fragility of life, this essential cinema comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie serves the viewers with three sub-stories which don't really correlate. It opens up strongly with a sequence that serves as an anchor for all those sub stories. But the anchor isn't the only congruency point this movie uses. There are other quite meaningless rendezvous where the focus characters, who don't really know each other, meet and don't really share any line of dialog. But those smaller rendezvous serve well as time anchors, helping the viewers understand the timings of each scene. The stories also come very strong. Focusing on different backgrounds for each story, They each reveal themselves full of varied surprises and twists, although some of them are fairly predictable. The acting overall is just another decent effort. It sure is not really this movie's strongest point. But again, the story and the general story flow alone should suffice to make this movie good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flawed nature of the human being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this wonderfully crafted film allures to dogs and, in fact, dogs do make a sort of assistance to the human stories being told. Three in fact, that at one point or another interconnect. By now we have become familiar with Alejandro Gonzáles I?arittu's style of inter wining lives and the effect that these connections have, however he hasn't done this better than he did with Amores Perros. This being his film debut one can see that he was meant for big things, as most of his movies have shown by their critical success.So with this film we get a first chapter which involves a young man who seems to be both enjoying his new found way of earning money, while also struggling to cope with his brother's wife's pushing him away. This first part involves some of the more graphic scenes, which may be tough to watch for some viewers, especially if you're dog person like I am. In short this was a good start to the movie that ends with the car accident that links the three parts together. After that we get the aftermath of this tragedy, through the eyes of Valeria, an aspiring model who is confined to a wheelchair, spending most of her time at the newly acquired apartment by her lover, a former family man who left his wife &amp; children. Slowly she starts to lose it, as her dog gets trapped in a whole hole on the house floor and she sees her career fade away. This middle segment of the film sees a more emotional backdrop, as it shows the audience the difficulty some people have coping with problems such as the one the model goes through. Finally we are introduced to an old, bearded man who was always in the background during those other stories and is now the central focus of the film at this time. His story is one of regretful decisions and a bipolar dynamic that follows him, as he shows a nurturing side by taking care of dogs, while also being a near sadistic hit-man. In the end we see him set up a conflict between two brothers and attempts to connect with his estranged daughter.Upon concluding this film, I found myself rationalizing about how this movie is an excellent look into the flaws of humans in comparison to, say the dogs, which are as much a part of the movie as humans, You see, dogs in this movie are nothing more than loyal companions that only serve to accomplish their owner's goals. In the first story, Octavio, the young man, trains his dog to be vicious and fight other dogs to the death. In the second story, although to a much lesser extent, the dog gets trapped because he was playing with her owner, therefore being good company. And in the final story the dogs are obviously a big part of the old man's life. Now by saying this, I don't mean that dogs are perfect, because either by their own instincts or by human influence, they can be savages, as is show by their fights and when the dog in the first story kills all the other dogs owned by the old man. What's I'm trying to say here is that the darker side of a human being is explored here, and in my opinion in great fashion. Amores Perros is a tough movie to watch, yet it's a great way to go deep into the most harsh things about human life, something that we have to fight in order to carry on living, be that as a poor man or a successful person.Rating: 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Distinctive, realistic, but unsteady pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mexican films are not very common in Europe, and Alejandro González I?árritu has become a certain sign of quality, with his own approach. The three main stories are jointed and disjointed as in Pulp Fiction (although not so twisted and not so stylish), and the prevailing topic is disloyalty of people vs. loyalty of animals - shown through dogs (whose depiction is apparently too painful for Westerners) - followed by greed and jaundice.The stories are not of equal intensity, I found No 1 the most catchy, followed by No 3 and No 2, but No 3 demonstrates the best acting and profundity typical to Spanish / Latin-American films (Emilio Echevarría as El Chivo, above all). Well, all male leading actors are distinguishable, while female ones spent much less time on screen and had to play less elaborated characters. Anyway, directing and cinematography are good, and events seem realistic, not specifically created. But as for I?árritu's trilogy of death, I have to admit that I find the other - 21 Grams and Babel - stronger and more interesting. But, without doubt, Amores perros is a strong film worth watching, and pondering on and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating, grim and dark multi-stranded narrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the first instillation of I?árritu's Death Trilogy, Amores Perros is a violent, epic and twisted vision of people and their relationships. I am reminded of Roger Ebert's review of Tyrannosaur - "This isn't the kind of movie that even has hope enough to contain a message. There is no message, only the reality of these wounded personalities." - apart from that I believe Amores Perros has the narrative complexity and dexterity to hold a message, even if it is only for those willing to create a message themselves. From a technical front, the cinematography and score are enough to carry the heavy dense narrative but not enough to dazzle or excite.The acting is consistently incredible from all members of cast, showing true and powerful dedication to their craft and to the film. The pacing sags in the centre but is quickly lifted for the conclusion. The film feels very long in a Magnolia kind of way, that is, a good way - leaving you utterly engrossed in the narrative with plenty to think about afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>@ Mr. David Schleicher: The dog fighting is very disturbing, more so than the other violence depicted as that does take place. The violence between people is staged, at least for this film. Whereas, the violence against animals (not just dogs) is entertainment in a depraved world. So for people, it is largely a matter of choice. This lack of respect and compassion extends to all living things. For many, the dog fighting is more horrific to watch than the 'staged' violence that we are accustomed to viewing on TV. We have created this world, and incorporated others, including the dogs, into it. Why is that so "ironic"?</fullReview>

There is a lot of blood and violence but it heightens the tension and draws the audience into the plot. The casting of each character is perfect and the acting is superb and Inarritu's representation of infidelity and love throughout the film is well thought out and authentic.

		<fullReview>Amores Perros( Love's a Bitch)is probably the best Latin-American film I have ever seen. Just like 21 grams and Babel, Amores Perros has a non-linear structure, just like a puzzle. The movie tries to decipher the contemporary Mexican society, interweaving two worlds- the world of the poor, dealing with hunger, anger and street violence , and another world- the capitalist one dealing with models, TV shows, about phones, and so on and so forth. El Chivo, the ex-guerrilla, is the character who connects the two different worlds. He gave up a wealthy life as a bourgeois when he joined the Sandanistas because he wanted to create a better world for the poor.Although the film's distribution was delayed in certain countries owing to the violence in the dog-fighting scenes, I believe those were absolutely necessary because they act as metaphors for the rotten Mexican society and also show the way in which human relationships work ( the violence of love).The dogs are the embodiment of their owners, showing the cancerous kernel, displaying the dog-eat-dog attitude of the modern Mexican society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Take on Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to understand about Amores Perros (or "Love's a Bitch") is that its title provides great insight into the interpretation of this film. At first glance, the film appears to be about the differing aspects of romantic love: Octavio and Susana's steamy and guilty affair, Daniel and Valeria's not-so-steamy and guilty affair, and El Chivo's remorse over having left his family several decades prior. However, it is much more than just a film about the various aspects of love represented. I'd argue that it is titled "Amores Perros" because the film is pointing out the flaws in romanticized love. The three subplots weave together to give the audience a modern view of the realities of love: young, emotional teenage love with Octavio and Susana, old, superficial, failing love with Daniel and Valeria, and a non-sexual love found between family with El Chivo. One of the most powerful aspects of the film is its paradoxical combination of violence in a movie where the main subject is, ironically, love. Most of the graphic violence has to do with the dogs, not humans. This itself helps define the film's thesis on love. In many ways, the characters care more about their dogs than they do about their 'lovers', which goes to show how deep their love actually is. The car chase scene is a perfect example of this because Octavio is willing to stab his brother's friend over his dog Cofi being shot, and get into a car chase which ends up crippling Valeria. Subsequently, Daniel's superficial love for Valeria is stifled and ultimately crushed by her crippling injury, leading him to abandon her. Octavio's "love" for Susana leads him to enter violent dog fighting arenas in order for him to make money so she can leave her husband for him. Meanwhile El Chivo is the example of what ultimately happens to everyone: guilt over what they did to their lovers (or, In El Chivo's case, his family). After seeing this film, all I know is if this is what love is, I don't want anything to do with it. It's all incredibly selfish and violent, hence the title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dogs in this movie play an interesting part. With each of the three narratives there contains a dog(s), their role seems to be to help the main characters on the path of discovery. In the first narrative 'Octavio and Susana', the black Rottweiler, Cofi, helps Octavio not only in the minor plot to pay Jarocho back for the death of his dog, but also to help Octavio save money so he can have his dream of moving away with Susana (sister-in-law). In the second narrative 'Daniel and Valeria', Valeria's little dog Richie helps Supermodel Valeria by giving her something to live for, although the dog isn't seen much we know the dog is alive somewhere under the floor boards trapped because of his whimpering. This knowledge gives Valeria something to live for. Her traumatic accident took her leg and sense of self along with it, her life and success was based on her ideal looks and beauty which was took from her in the crash.In the third and to me the most moving narrative 'El Chivo and Maru', El Chivo who needs the most help has two dogs that help him. The first is a pack of happy mongrels that wander the streets with him, this group of dogs have been his companion loving him unconditionally licking his feet and following him where ever he goes. The second dog that has more of an impact in changing El Chivo is Cofi Ramiro/Octavio's dog. El Chivo brings the dog back to life-and heath, and the dog ends up killing his pack of mongrels in return. It is in this moment that El Chivo starts to reflect on his own life comparing it to Cofi's life. Like Cofi that was once good El Chivo reflects the unchangeable circumstances of his life that changed him forever, making him leave his family and turning him into a cold-hearted killer. Cofi has helped El Chivo onto the path of reflection by showing him his true nature.Without the roles of these dogs that tie the main characters together, helping the characters expand and come to life, this movie wouldn't have gotten far. The benefits of making the dogs be the helpers in this movie, is that many people automatically take sympathy with these dogs, which connects real emotion to what is seen on screen. Like with 'Octavio and Susan', we see that Octavio loves and takes care of Cofi, then when we see that Octavio is willing to put Cofi into the fights so he can run away with Susan, from this we understand more of what Octavio will sacrifice to be with her. With 'Daniel and Valeria' Valeria is show with the dog at her side at all times (before trapped in floorboards). She loves the dog completely, even after Richie is lost she is willing to try. Compared with Daniels love for Valeria which seems to shallow out after she gets into accident, showing his love was based more on the ideal beauty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love parallels violence in Inarritu's "Amores Perros"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love parallels violence. "Amores Perros" is a typical Spanish movie; However, it's a captivating film that can be appreciated across the world. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu captures the subject of love with a complex approach and addresses the different stages common in love. In other words, the film makes the statement that "love is laborious". The reoccurring theme of how love parallels violence can be seen through the intertwining story lines.The first plot focuses on a dysfunctional family that includes Octavio, his brother Ramiro and Ramiro's wife, Susana. Octavio is in love with Susana &amp; decides to save Susana from Ramiro's abuse; he achieves this by making money from dog fighting. When jealousy overcomes Octavio, he attempts to murder Ramiro in order to prove his love for Susana, &amp; further proves the strong theme of love &amp; violence.Daniel is a magazine editor who leaves his family for Valeria, a famous actress-model. Their bliss turns to misery when Valeria is severely injured in a car crash (driven by Octavio) and her beloved dog Richie suffers an undignified death. Again, love has been transformed into violence and hatred as Valeria's accident escalates her hostility towards Daniel. Her deep depression ruins her relationship with Daniel &amp; ends her life.In the third, El Chivo is a bum/assassin who cares for street dogs and has left his family to become a terrorist. During a 'job', he rediscovers his former self, and realizes the mistake he has made by leaving his family. His love for his family &amp; daughter overwhelms him &amp; he changes his life around &amp; gives the money he made from his 'jobs' to his daughter, and goes on with his life."Amores Perros" is a film that can be watched by audiences who can appreciate and identify the many aspects love brings. Each characters' love for one another is often masked by their hatred &amp; violence. This is a solid film that presents many different lifestyles, and ties all characters together in one event. The problems that accumulate because of the car accident help establish the difficulties that love presents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Drama story and acting bring the director to create a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regardless of the Spanish subtitles, the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has climbed into my favourite directors of all time list with this wonderful dramatic masterpiece. A friend mentioned his work in Babel (2006) and how great that was. I hadn't seen his earlier films including this one which is now nine years old. As I went back to Amores Perros, It caught my eyes as a work of art. From the moment it started, Alejandro uses many film techniques which intervene the characters and certain parts of the plot with each other. I personally love the alternative film making in some films and this is shown well with Amores Perros.As part of the death trilogy now. Alejandro's first film truly shines out to be the best of the three. The film traces three different characters who really have nothing to do with each other until the end, where a car crash takes place and we see the different characters reactions and relation somehow to the accident. As the plot unfolds so do the characters such as Octavio, who changes due to love. The overall understanding of what Amores Perros stands for could in fact be the English title; Love's a Bitch. Which is quite accurate when considering the symbolism in this film. Dogs are used throughout, which somehow resembles the bitch in the title. The overall title meaning could certainly link the relationship of dogs and people together and that how unjustly it may seem, that people show emotions in everything they do. In Amores Perros, we could consider, the tragedy of a close friend, the fight with the brother, love of the sister in law and even the companion between life of a dog and human beings. The overall message is that life is sometimes cruel when dealing with any relationship in life.The overall review comes down to whether you like a strong drama, and if you haven't seen this film. My word would be to rent out the three films of the trilogy together: Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel. All three films are brilliant and have similar film styles, but different stories. It's great to see such a director make his debut film a classic. Well done Alejandro.

		<fullReview>I watched this film a couple of months ago. It was late at night and I was channel-hopping. I found the film to be engaging, moving, and completely watchable, if at times violent. The way that the stories are all linked together reminded me of "Pulp Fiction" in a way. But in the way that "PF" was a mish-mash of characters loosely binded together with harsh language and larger-than-life visuals, "Amores Perros" holds the viwers'attention with a fantastic dialogue and impeccable acting. This is a masterpiece of film-making by Inarittu, and I will be sure to look out for more of his work in the future. One of the best "foreign" films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love maybe a bitch but this movie is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this film after seeing 21 grams and thinking it was an amazing movie and were interested in seeing the directors earlier work. I can see the similarities between the two, both having a motor vehicle accident as a plot linking device, and I have to say it is really difficult to say which is better. They are both great but I think I would vote for the this one as it is even more hard edged than 21 grams. Maybe because it is Mexican and not American it was a little more convincing. The scenes involving the dog fights are a bit gross but the cuteness of the guy who plays Octavio is a bonus.My one major criticism would be the thing with the dog trapped under the floor goes on a little too long, I get it was a symbol of their 'lost' relationship but enough already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harshly realistic and intense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros (Love is a Bitch), is a powerful film. It is made up of three main stories, whose characters affect each others lives without even knowing it. The film goes back and forth in time, to intrigue the viewer and to show how what starts as small decisions or actions can have drastic consequences. The film shows characters that run the gammut of Mexican society, from the life and mysterious past of an older street person, to members of a poor/lower middle class Mexican family, to a wealthy succesful family man and beautiful young model. The main theory or life lesson being espoused is however, is said by the movie's title. The movie shows shocking scenes of dogfighting, which is a core element of one of the stories, and which starts the avalanche of events in all the character's lives. These scenes are real (not computer generated effects), and animal lovers may be appalled by them, but the film also seems to say that the only true unconditional love people can get is from dogs. In closing, the film does not spell out any deep answers to life, but says that you take your chances! Life and love isn't easy or pretty, and that you can be dealt a bad hand no matter what your economic or social standing is. Life isn't a book or movie with their typical, cliched happy endings, and that is what elevates this film above the rank of pure film entertainment. This is powerful, unconventional filmmaking as an artistic and social statement, and should be seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that dazzles with narrative, stuns the senses, and genuinely touches the heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a stunning film with a story that fans out like an octopus from a central disaster linking three separate storylines. The ideas and tone were very similar to director Inarritu's more recent "21 Grams", but I found this film to be more masterfully executed and more personally touching. Each story line and character were so carefully drawn that I remained mesmerized as I experienced the overlapping and out of order narrative. I also felt as though I had been transported to worlds-within-a-world that I had never experienced before. The story is filled with infinite sadness, but leaves one with the feeling of true life authenticity, of having touched some things personal in my own life. Days after seeing the film, my mind is still filled with vivid images and my heart aches from the emotions. This is one of the few films I would give a solid 10. Must see for serious film buffs and dramatic screenwriters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie about dogs and their owners, love and destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a few days ago and I must say this movie is great. With its many strands it creates an atmosphere you can hardly describe.Although each story is independent they meet together in an accident by accident. This coincidence links the destiny of all 3 main characters. The dogfighter, the model and the bum. I must say the first story was the most interesting story in the movie because it deals with everything you need for a good story: love, passion, tragedy and many more. Although this part of the movie is quite cruel and brutal you have to see those pictures to understand in what situation the main character is. He lets his beloved dog fight dogfights so that he can flee with his sister-in-law from his brutal brother and his misunderstanding mother. The second and the third story were very interesting too and they had their tragedy, the model lost her leg because she tried to find her dog which jumped in a hole in the floor. The bum lost his family and is an assassin. At the end he also looses his dogs and he has nobody except "negro" his new doog.The movie was really good and very hard to describe. If I were you I would go and watch the movie - real nice</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The photography is stunning, the plots more subtly intertwined than anything Quentin Tarantino has been involved in (although no disrespect to him) and the dialogue deeply moving.On the surface, this is a film that should be unwatchable, containing themes such as invalidity, attempted fratricide and dog fighting for goodness sake. And yet it is all handled with superb maturity. I guess what makes it easier to watch is the knowledge that no animals were harmed, so all I can say (without spoiling anything) is that some incredibly smart editing must have been used in the first story.I was also pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the music, as I have not been exposed to any Mexican popular music before - I'll certainly be buying the soundtrack CD when I've finished writing this review.I can imagine that some people will be put off by the subject matter and also the fact that this is in Spanish with subtitles. Regarding the latter, I really didn't find it a problem and regarding the former... well, I think all the scenes were justifiably part of the story, none were excessively gratuitous in their nature and I would challenge any other filmmaker to handle such difficult subjects in similarly good taste.There is a very powerful moral message that comes across through this film and I feel that my life has been enriched enormously by watching it. I would urge that you do the same.</fullReview>

Our life can change in a second, and although we may be experiencing pain, the future will bring us hope for a better tmrw. This movie captures lifes uncertainty with biblical undertones."If you want to make god laugh, tell him your plans". Is God in charge of our lives or are we?The common theme within the three interlaced stories are dogs. The story that stands out from the rest is the tale of "el chivo" the old hitman/assasin. A man with no emotional connection with humans experiences the very pain that he himself inflicts to others, when the dog he nurses to health murders El chivos family of dogs. The main reference to this act is that "dogs resemble their owners"Beautifully acted, wonderful cast, great direction, great cinematography! You must watch this movie with an open mind, concentrate on the performances of the actors, put yourself in the characters frame of mind and then you will truly appreciate the story of this movie.It is not tarantino, neither is it trying to be.

Personally I got nothing out of this film. The stories are of common sense ignored and as such I found it hard to make any connection with them. But if someone gets anything out of this film then perhaps some countries wouldn't be looking to invade others. Violence begets violence, (that's my preaching not the movie BTW). I found the movie relentlessly negative. Perhaps in my younger, angrier days I would have got more from it. But where Magnolia gave a message of hope in it's narrative, Amores perros only shows the consequence of negative actions. Which is interesting in a documentry sort of way but I can't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to clarify one thing. I almost didn't see this because of the reviews here that claimed dogs tear each other apart in this film This is not exactly true. The storyline includes dogs that are torn apart, but you do not see any of this. The viewer sees the suggestion of a dog fight with the initial contact made by the dogs (pretty much a chest collision) and very little else of the fighting dogs. No gory flesh tearing as I was afraid of. It is very disturbing to see the aftermath of dogs portrayed as dead (presumably on a sedative that rendered them unconscious) tongues hanging out with red splashed about their bodies, but there is no torn flesh nor tearing of flesh shown. At no time does the film become a "slasher" film. What it suggests is very emotional and sad, but it is done in a way that I felt was tasteful (if a dogfight can be tasteful) and certainly viewable. I didn't feel I had to close my eyes to avoid being offended. I have great respect for the makers of this film. I won't go on about that because others here have covered the bases. I will only say, that it is an excellent film about love and how painful and disturbing it can be. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FABULOUS FILM--ONE OF THE YEARS BEST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros is a gritty Mexican trilogy beautifully woven together and features fascinating characters, great first-time direction by Inarritu, and an underlying sense of raw comedy, not to mention one of the best introductions of any film I have ever seen. The first story is centered on a young man that is in love with his stepsister and decides to convince her to run away with him from her abusive, thieving husband by bringing her money he won from the world of underground dog fighting. The second story is of a man that leaves his wife and kids in order to live a dream life with a supermodel. And the final story is centered on a homeless, ex-politician hitman whose only goals in life are survival by any means and to reveal to his grown daughter who her real father is. This segmented, subtitled film is horrifically violent at times, depressing, shocking, and even part comical, yet the bleak, bloody, and raw tone of the film suppresses your laughter. You struggle to force yourself to continue being drawn into the terrible yet fascinating multiple worlds of the characters, as Inarritu shows how his stories collide by one brutal car accident. This was definitely one of the best films of 2001, and should appeal to any audience. Although graphically violent, there is no unnecessary footage purely for shock value, and I think this film is so powerful it should be seen by all, even those easily offended by violence. WONDERFUL MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a raw and visceral experience. Real passion, intelligence and craft has gone into making this wonderful film. By contrast most other films of the last few years seem bland and antiseptic. The film places the viewer right in the heart of urban Mexico, and amidst this teeming environment the characters' lives play out - full of immanent (and often eruptive) violence and feeling. The film has one of those episodic structures familiar from "Traffic", "Short Cuts" and "Magnolia". Yet it is a superior work to all of these films, not only because it feels less contrived, but also because it is blessedly free of the kind of characters who spend far too long hand-wringing and feeling sorry for themselves. Refreshingly, "Amores Perros" is not concerned to dissect "dysfunctional" people or "dysfunctional" social systems. It pulls off that rare trick of seeming to issue from right inside the worlds it portrays, rather than standing apart from them. This may well be an illusion, but that of course is what makes the achievement of "Amores Perros" all the more impressive. (It is also one of the only films I have ever seen that uses animals to signify in a way that is neither sentimental nor monstrous.) 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros is a manically-paced, emotionally exhausting and challenging film. It successfully interweaves several stories (as has become quite common in the past decade, e.g., Dahl, Tarantino, Tykwer, McKellar, Egoyan) as it tells a story of desperation and struggle in Mexico City. Combining the adrenaline rush of Pulp Fiction with the camera angles and slower views of street scenes that reminded me of Kieslowski, the director gives us a tale of how a single event can dramatically transform one's life (the loss of a leg for a fashion model, the loss of his beloved pets for a worned man in poverty). Whereas the dogs early in the film symbolize what is wrong with the characters, the dogs later catalyze or at least symbolize many of the emotional transformations for the characters and it might even be able to said that the animals inspire the adults to embrace a more responsible attitude towards others, reminding me of the role of children on selfish adults in many recent Iranian films. The acting of Amores Perros shouldn't be ignored (and may be overlooked as the acting was so effective that the actors seemed like they WERE their characters so to speak...the greatest compliment for actors). Bernal, for one, was simply outstanding. I often judge acting on the range of emotions conveyed. Bernal did it all. This gifted director is one to watch for in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Mexican Film in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Como Agua Para Chocolate" about 9 years ago, there were a lot of hopes for a revival of Mexican cinema. Since then, not many more Mexican films gained much international or even national success. I hope "Amores Perros" reverses that. Most of the important points about the film have already been made. I will just add it is a very realistic portrayal of life in urban Mexico, especially the constant friction between social classes and the sexes that is so tangible on the streets. Also the incredible strains on family life in an environment where everyone is trying to get ahead is also apparent.I saw the film twice, once in the cinema and once at home on cassette. The version I saw at home was subtitled very loosely, I think you have to know Mexican idioms very well to get some of the meanings in the conversations. Many Mexican slang words have a double or even triple meaning, even the title "Amores Perros" is impossible to translate. So maybe some people miss parts of the story or subtexts because of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is "Pulp Fiction" set in Mexico, but with more realistic characters involved in more realistic situations. It's also the better movie.The film begins with the story of a poor young man who falls in love with his brother's wife. His married brother works as a cashier at a local grocery store, but that doesn't make him a good guy. And in order for him to get his sister-in-law to comply, he will need money. So what does he do? He takes his dog and puts him in fights to bet on. I'll stop here.The second story is about a magazine editor who leaves his wife and kids for a beautiful model. Living in a lavish apartment room that is still in construction, the model's dog accidentally falls into a hole in the floor while she and the dog are playing fetch. I'll stop here.The third and final story is about an aging hit-man who surrounds himself with dogs (most of whom are strays that he's taken a hand in comforting). He's hired by a guy to kill his brother. I'll stop here.What brings these people together is a fateful car crash in the busy streets of Mexico. "Amores Perros," meaning 'lover of dogs', attaches every character with a dog, and each one of those dogs affect their lives in spectacular ways.What makes "Amores Perros" better than "Pulp Fiction" is again, it's humanity. When I saw this film on April 14th, at 10:30am (you have no idea what time I went to sleep the previous night), I was kept awake throughout its two and a half hour running time. And this isn't a movie that moves rapidly throughout the duration, either. But a film with such interesting people, filmed and performed so brilliantly and with such subtlety that I began to confuse this work of fiction as a documentary. And this is obviously no documentary, considering a story is being told from three different perspectives. Never at the movies have I ever said to myself, "I could watch a year's worth of footage with these people, following them till their deaths." This is one of those films that should be made into a sequel, or a trilogy, or more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers* The three stories that interweave in this intriguing picture are all linked by themes of loss or betrayal. A man trying to get his brother's wife to run off with him (and failing), a supermodel who suffers a career-ruining accident and an old man who gave up his family to join a guerilla movement and has deep regrets. The best character in the movie and also the most moral, is the latter, El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría). He is an occasional hitman, has the appearance of a tramp but has a lively mind and a caring disposition (not to mention a penchant for opportunist thievery). Really, it is this character that carries the heart of the film. The dogfighting scenes are cleverly done, using minimal footage of the dogs actually fighting. However, there are many scenes of what look like damaged or dead dogs after fights which are quite unnerving. Indeed, 3 people left the showing I went to, presumably because of the dogfights. In the grand scheme, the dogfights are a useful metaphorical device, although to the film's credit, two of the dogs featured are crucial characters in the story. In a similar manner to Magnolia, all three stories interlink via catastrophe. No raining frogs here, this time a calamitous car crash. This is in places, very impressive stuff, quite powerfully done and quite bleak. I found that I was expecting bad stuff to happen all the time, and it did. My main criticism is that probably 25 minutes could have been cut without much damage to the overall story, which would've put the running time at just over 2 hours. But asides from that, a well acted, well directed debut feature from director Alejandro González I?árritu.7/10.</fullReview>

The dogs are allegories, of course, for all that is wrong with the world (and Mexico in particular) but this is a multi-layered, beautifully acted, jerkily (and grittily) shot film by a director who knows exactly what he wants to say and how to say it. Some images are startling (blood flows like spitting butter over a griddle in a restaurant shooting) and heart-rending (an unrecognised old man waves uncertainly to his long-lost daughter through her bedroom window after years of no contact). But there is also humour and love amid the constant betrayals and carnage. And, also, there are the dogs.</fullReview>

But I was a little disappointed because I anticipated some of the intersection points, probably from seeing so many films using a similar narrative style (i.e. Mystery Train, Dekalog, Trois Colours, Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Reservoir Dogs, Before the Rain, etc.). But the second time I felt freer just to watch all that was unfolding in the lives of the characters and I loved it. Being a sucker for redemption, I liked seeing the changes that occurred in the life of El Chivo, and also that it was far from being a trite overnight transformation; he was still on a journey...

		<fullReview>"Amores perros" is not a bad film by any means. There were moments where I was genuinely interested in the plot and its message, and direction wise there was a good number of times where the director's and actor's abilities shined brightly. But there were also flaws that stuck out too strongly for me to strongly recommend this film.One of the first things that came to mind was that I have seen and heard the message and format of this film over and over again, in numerous pictures. I think those who compared it to Pulp Fiction, in terms of structure, are correct in pointing this out. But when one is concerned about seeing the same thing done again, usually, this means to me that the originality level on certain levels leaves something to be desired. Film makers "borrow" ideas all of the time, from other film makers it is more of what the "newblood" add to the mold created by past directors/writers, etc. that allows those who have seen the older films to enjoy the efforts of younger directors. This the director of "Amorres perros'" first film, so I think the potential is there. This relates to one of the other problems that I had, which was the length. Sometimes it is necessary or enjoyable to watch the in between scenes, when there is some level of suspense, etc. that builds. But when it is used, in what seems to be more of a..."look how cool this shot is" it comes off as a bit pretentious at times. This was the notion I got occasionally...when the music levels were raised and the camera followed a character. At over 3hrs running time, Mr. Gonzalez could have been a bit more merciful towards the audience, especially when over 30 minutes seemed devoted to this in between scenes. The first and last stories were the strongest but by that point I was waiting for the picture to end.Other issues I had were flaws with the plot. There were characters who we were completely left in the dark about (the man shot in the restaurant early on...was that a hired hit or just he eliminating the step-father?). Other characters who we were somehow supposed to care about (the dogfighting owner's brother) just didn't fly. The logic of leaving the dog under the floorboards for days!? There just wasn't enough background of how some characters came to be who they were. We were just thrown into their tragic events and strong emotions which came out of them, and supposed to understand everything. What I mean by that is that there are many REASONS, other than one tragic accident as an adult that causes one to break down. Maybe this is too strong of a demand, but I believe the director could have done a better job of developing them. There were some very strong performances, some scenes were excellent and the connection to how other animals behave is on point. I just think that there were still too many problems to really enjoy the film, and I was disappointed because many believe this to be better than "Crouching Tiger," which I did not think it was. I suspect, though, that the director's next film will be an improvement...there is too much potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5/3/01 was the last day of Chicago's Latino Film Festival, and I spent the preceding month viewing a lot of excellent latino films. Now being a "mexican-american," and speaking both languages fluently I know that the majority of Mexican films are about mariachis and drug traffickers. So a good friend of mine told me we should go see this movie, "Amores perros ." He did not tell me it was a mexican movie, for if he had I would have missed the best movie I have seen in a very long time. This movie is incredible, the intensity, drama, and dialogue all flow so well. You must see this movie! If you have a problem with subtitled movies see it twice. Even if you don't have problems with subtitles, see it twice. This movie is a masterpiece. The first great movie of the twenty-first century!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is, without question, a marvelous achievement, a powerful work that stands alongside such other brutal/poetic world classics as "Forbidden Games", "The 400 Blows", "Winter Light", "Los Olvidados", "The Tin Drum", "L'Argent", "Das Boot", and "Underground". Most professional critics have been too simple-minded to compare this film to anything other than "Pulp Fiction", to which it has absolutely no thematic connection. I'm pleased to see that several reviewers on this page have noted the true influence at work here - the late, great director Krzysztof Kieslowski and his screenwriting partner Krzysztof Piesiewicz, to whose magnificent "Dekalog" and "Trois Couleurs: Bleu, Blanc, Rouge" "Amores Perros" is indebted. Which is an acknowledgement, not a criticism. "Amores Perros" tells a trio of interwoven tales questioning man, God, faith, family, and love through a stunning combination of expert direction, writing, editing, cinematography, scoring, sound, and acting, creating a truly classic work that needs no comparisons. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Guillermo Arriago have created a masterwork. Bravo! Not to be missed by the serious filmgoer."The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated" - Mohandas Gandhi</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...this is the theme of the film. If you plan to screw people over for your own selfish, worldly desires, then you will get karmic payback in spades: destroyed lives, dead dogs, etc. This theme is very obvious in the first two stories in regards to the character's on-screen actions and interestingly in the last story, by learning about El Chivo's past. If there is a "winner," it is El Chivo, as he physically fares the best of the lot of the other characters, however his game is a null sum--there is still no happy ending for him.The theme of the film is what separates it from it's Hollywood counterparts where the protagonist(s) always win. Individually, three stories vary greatly in quality: the first (Octavio y Susana) is fast and frenetic with excellent camera shots and editing. The second (Daniel y Valeria) is much slower and is too long for its own good--however it does develop the theme of karmic payback quite well. The third (El Chivo y Maru) is arguably the best, in large part due to the acting of El Chivo and how it ties up all the other stories.This film is a breath of fresh air for Mexican cinema, especially in light of some of the dreck I've seen recently (Santitos and La Otra Conquista come to mind). Film has changed...we can't expect Mexico to produce Pedro Infante and Maria Felix-style movies anymore. Self-important "artistic" work ain't gonna cut it either. "Amores Perros" is a fine step in the right direction and one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could easily have collapsed into three stories whose little morality plays resolved themselves at the end; to the filmmakers' credit, they don't. Nor does love. Or hate. The two are so intertwined in this film it's hard to pry them apart sometimes. The handheld documentary style gives an immediacy to the surroundings, and the action is so continuous and hard hitting, in one quiet moment, a ringing telephone is enough to startle. The script is smart. No easy answers here. As many have noted, vicious dog fights play a big role, but there's no preaching about the sport. It just is. And we see, inevitably, that the handlers are no less animals themselves. It's the dogs' world.</fullReview>

Everything was top-notch, from the Faulkner-influenced style of story-telling, to the cinematography. This is three seperate, yet intertwined stories that very easily could have been confusing and lost it's audience. But what happened while watching this film was anything but. From the opening segment, the audience is deeply engrossed in this film, until the very end. If this film is exemplary of the type of films an audience can expect from Mexico, than I'm anxiously anticipating the next film to cross the divide. A MUST-SEE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros is an amazing movie. As in Pulp Fiction the whole movie is centered around a few minutes the story keeps coming back to, filling the gaps in the characters' lives with every stroke of the camera brush. But there is no irony, and definitely no hip-kitsch. This is the real world, with hand-held cameras showing the blood in saturated video colors. Yet it contains enough tense nearly surreal moments to make us stop and think: the dog under the floor, the two brothers chained trying to reach a gun first to take each other out, the moon-like landscape of the urban periphery. Great cinema talking about the violence and desolation of everyday life.</fullReview>

But where Tarantino uses cool one-liners and beautiful set-pieces to make his mark, the director of Amores Perros uses his camera do disturb us, awake us, break us. This movie shows that we are all wolves among wolves, selfish, brutal and animal-like. This movie will definitely scare and disgust many people, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I have never seen such brutality become beautiful. Try it, it is worth every single minute. It runs at over 2.5 hours, but you won't notice it (it's not Saving Private Ryan anyway)because there is so much to see, and it is unbelievable that this can be a director's debut.

All the characters are constantly looking for something, this kind of loneliness, sadness and strong action is something you find travelling in Mexico. The class of super-rich people who CRASHES with the two guys from very poor families, the constant aim to get a lot of money and get out of the s**t, the genuine sound track (taken from local music bands) that reflects the ultimate styles... I feel this movie will open a new school of cinema in Mexico, sort of realism. I find lot of similarities with the style of the movie Black Cat, White Cat from Emir Kusturica. Despite the fact that Mexico is in America, I think this kind of cinema closer to the European style, rather than the US style. Last thing: don't forget to learn some mexican swearword before watching the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bottom line...a great movie. The direction and the photography finally put this movie among Hollywood standards. The first story of the movie is brilliant and beautifully crafted, every scene has the necessary elements that take you right into the other. But after the first act, the story begins to drop...and it drops fast. I think it was Hitchcock that said: "The length of a movie should be relative to the size of the human bladder." Taking this into consideration, I Think "El Negro" (Alejandro Gonzalez) has a bladder the size of Manhattan. Personally, and I read the script before the movie came out, I think that act 2 is weak, with a very weak plot, act 3 is very good, but unfortunately too long. I want to make clear that these were my exact comments when I read the script, when I finally had the opportunity to see the movie I understood what Alejandro was trying to do...bring closure to the whole thing. But with a third act that lasts 45 minutes I think the overall story structure suffers. But that is just my personal opinion (I think Goldman and McKee might agree with me), this doesn't mean the movie is bad...au contraire! I think it is one of the best films done in Mexico in the past decade. I will put it up there with Dos Crimenes and Danzon. Congratulations to Alejandro, to Rodrigo and to Alta Vista for finally doing this! This is what the Mexican movie industry needs to put us back where we belong!</fullReview>

In this painful to watch film (I cried a lot), full of human heartlessness, egotism and cruelty, only the dogs manifested redeeming qualities of devotion, heart, bravery and focus. At first, I kind of liked the character, El Chivo; as he seemed politically and socially idealistic as well as to really love his dogs; but ultimately, he showed himself to be angry, selfish and weak. The reason I watched Amores Perros until the bitter end, was that I sensed Inarritu, the director, was himself suffering with the revelation of human cruelty and I admired his dedication to telling the truth.

		<fullReview>Alejandro Gonzales Inarrituru first feature film is the first Mexican masterpiece in a very long time, maybe since Los Olvidados and whit this film Mexico could gain some more attention of other countries.I saw this film when i was very young and i totally love it, maybe in that time i don't understand all the points of the film but still i love all the essence of the film.The plot is just great and the idea of the three stories is amazing, maybe not original because of films like Mystery Train or Pulp Fiction but still great.My personal favorite is the first one: "Octavio y Susana", whit Gael Garcia in his best role until now and Vanesa Bauche in her unique good role for me. Inarritu put actors that never do films i mean they only work in theater plays and also use common people that previously assault the film team. This facts only confirm what i think of the film: Amores Perros contains all the essence of Mexico City, i mean the Chilango style.Once one of the worst journalist of Mexico, i mean those that only give gossip of famous people said a warning to all the world:"Mexico City is not like in Amores Perros, don't watch this film"I think the film is very realistic because those things (dog fights, murderers, kidnapping) really happened in my City and in all the world so there is nothing to hide. I mean there are a lot of problems in my country but there are also a lot of good things and beautiful places. Mexico City is one of the biggest cities in the world so it is very difficult that we don't any problem, but i think is a wonderful place to live. And well, this is only a film so please watch it.Well, what else i can say?, i mean this film contains all the elements to be a masterpiece: good director, good plot, good storytelling,hang out characters, good performances and the most important thing, is honest.DVD: just great, whit good extra material and of course deserves to be in my collection. Also i own a VHS cassette, just for remember the days that i saw for the first time this film, back in the year 2001.PS: the Oscars, well i really don't care about prizes so i love this film with or without an Oscar but is also a fact that is almost impossible that Hollywood could recognize a Mexican for his work. I mean, i don't like to compare between films but it is a shame that Mexicans were expecting something from a country where there is racism to our people that lives there. And the racism is the thing that the Oscars represent.</fullReview>

Suddenly you are on the streets of Mexico, smelling the air of jeopardy and constant risk - risk for the sake of living, being loved. Life isn't a game that one can quit - once you've taken responsibility you have to keep on going deeper. It's about the issues of integrity, moral choices and sacrifices that have to be made. Those must be essential - like dogs'. They don't think if it's right or wrong - they follow the natural feeling of being honest whether in love, loyalty or death.So far I watched the movie twice and both times enjoyed a lot. The director and actors made a great job at exposing the characters at best - they're real to the extent when you love and loath them. Everything is pointing out for the happiness but here is another test crossing out the rest. And the music background does its part, fits perfectly in the action. Absolutely loved it! I'm giving it 9 out of 10 just for the hope Inarittu would try to reach higher for another masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out with a car chase that winds up in an accident, an accident that links the lives of three people. The stories of these three, before and after the accident, is told by way of an intricate plot structure. Deft time sequencing and inter-cutting of each story with the others keeps you on your toes - you have to pay close attention. In each story the accident is seen from the perspective of each of the three main characters - it must have been filmed using multiple cameras. The film editors deserve recognition for putting this film together.There is some pretty strong stuff here. The auto accident is gruesomely realistic and shocks every time it is shown. The dog fighting scenes will turn the stomach of most - in fact if you know someone who does not react to those scenes, you may want to give them wide berth. There are several ruthless murders, and a graphic stabbing.The acting is first-rate. Gael Garcia Bernal is a dynamic and charismatic actor and Emilio Echevarria is great as an ex-guerrilla who has become a homeless man. He is wonderful in an extended solo scene where he is recording an emotional phone message.The second story about an ad man and a classy model was the weakest. The biggest problem I had with it was the hole in the floor. For one thing a hardwood floor would never collapse in the manner shown. Any decent construction would have a plywood sub-floor, and this was a high-end apartment; in any event oak flooring would never behave that way. If they could not afford to have the hole fixed, they could have at least nailed a $10 piece of plywood over it. Who would live with a dangerous hole in the floor like this? And, if the dog was so important to them, why wouldn't they be a little more proactive in getting him out of the hole?The musical score, by Gustavo Santaolalla, augments without intruding. As dazzling as the presentation is, I sometimes had the feeling of being too aware of the brilliant technique at the expense of the stories which show that, regardless of societal class, love drives people to take actions that have profound and often unexpected consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores perros" has garnered a lot of comparisons to "Pulp Fiction", most of which are unjustified. While it does juggle three interrelated stories, the style of the film is completely different. "Amores perros" is a much grittier, much more realistic, and overall more depressing work than "Pulp Fiction". Its also one of the best films of the millennium so far, and each of the three stories are full of humanity. The film lacks a sense of humor to liven up the proceedings, which is the only flaw (this is what made "Pulp Fiction" absolutely perfect). Still, the film resonates and by the end you care about all these people, despite their often discernible actions.The ensemble acting by a cast of mostly unknowns is great all around. Emilio Echevarría gives an emotionally charged performance as the guerrilla turned hit-man. His character is the most fascinating in the film and the one the has the most impact on the viewer. Gael García Bernal seems to be becoming a star due to his fantastic performance here. He is among the most impressive actors of his generation, proved from his work here and in "The Motorcycle Diaries". The rest of the cast isn't as memorable but is still very fine.The film proves amongst all other things that Alejandro González I?árritu is one of the most exciting directors of the last ten years. "21 Grams" was good but failed to live up to the promise of this film (I have yet to see "Babel" but I hear very good things). "Amores perros" is one of the best films of our time and will undoubtedly go down as a classic. (9/10)</fullReview>

You can go into a Prada store with hungry children begging for food in front of it. This movie captures the essence of this city, it intensely shows the difference of problems people might have. In the first part you will see people who struggle for survival, then richness with different problems and in the third part a broken man. But there is one thing that brings them all together, the plain force of love and one car accident. I loved every minute of that movie and I think it is a must seen. The movie is sometimes compared to Pulp Fiction, but I don't think that both movies are comparable. Amores Perros shows violence as plain and simple as it is, and in Pulp Fiction Violence is shown in a somewhat aesthetic way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With that out of the way, I have to say that this film was a welcome surprise. Having seen Gael Garcia Bernal in Los Diaros de Motocicleta, I was very interested in seeing his previous work. I rented this out of the Foreign Film section of Blockbuster with little prior knowledge except for his presence.Amores Perros is a multiple story line flick, which I'm a fan of to begin with. It often leaves the viewer with questions throughout film, as personal histories of characters are usually not revealed until later in the movie. Sometimes these movies can be harder to follow if the director doesn't know what he's doing, but this one rarely tripped me up.The director plays with the time frame, notedly repeating the opening car crash (that shouldn't be a spoiler) several times as the story permits. The characters are well-realized and multi-dimensional, and the acting is excellent. I can see why it won millions of awards.While I definitely got a Tarantino vibe watching this (a consequence of every non-chronological movie I seem to see nowadays) this movie isn't nearly as violent (except for dogs) or deliberately funny, though the banter between some of the characters can be. This film is definitely a straight up drama. There is a lot of Spanish swearing, most of which I recognized after taking five years of Spanish class, and I got a big kick out of it. But that's just me.Great film; can't wait to see Inarritu's other work. Director definitely has talent and vision.And there are a lot of dead dogs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen 21 Grams a few years ago and was really impressed with I?árritu as a director. Amores Perros is a great movie as well. At the beginning I didn't find the movie very promising, as the only thing I saw were dogfights. But once the movie progressed and the other stories started unfolding it became an impressive movie. The stories are told separately but in a way in which the other stories tag along and relate to each other. I can't really say which of the two movies I find better, Amores Perros or 21 Grams, I find them both equally good. Amores Perros stands out because of the character development and the way the stories are related to each other, film-making at its best.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not original, but it impressed me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie only yesterday and it impressed me much. First novel is really frightening as all this blood and injured dying dogs - made me really sad. I love animals so watching this blooded horror was really difficult. But the second and the third novels are indeed fine - they have special mood and style which I think is a must for a good movie of a high class. A master's hand is felt in all details, in a way the plot is going on, in the director's choice of colors, in all.. The movie is not very original as it has some allusions with Kitano's Dolls (especially the second novel about a model), with Tarantino's Pulp fiction (in the way the novels are connected with each other - this time mosaic, heroes not familiar with each other but influence on each other's lives - many reminders). I like the Amores Perros and really didn't expect that such good movies can be made in Mexico.</fullReview>

It truly is a captivating work of art. If you've seen 21 grams you know what to expect. When I found out that the director Alexandro Gonzalez did both movies, after the fact, I was not surprised.

		<fullReview>For a long time I thought that Mexican film industry was just about "Rancheras" and shallow movies like the ones with Timbiriche, Luis Miguel or Lucerito. But from the last couple of years, I´ve seen really good movies from this country, such as "Y tu mamá también", "El pecado del Padre Amaro" and of course "Amores Perros".This three stories movie, is just the best movie I´ve seen this year. The narration of the movie flows just like "Pulp Fiction", with jumps from the present, to the past, and from one story to the other, in a really interesting and well developed web plot, you can see that the characters meet between them in several times.Each of the three stories just reflects the different kinds of affections (love and hate) between the characters, and just reflects how primal and rude is love, and how easy love can became hate, and then hate became love and such.The performance are well given, Gael Garcia is at his best, just like Emilio Echevarria. The only ones that I really disliked me were the actors that played the roles of Valeria and Daniel (the couple from the second story).I give this movie 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I saw it yesterday: my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems in the style of pulp fiction or resevoir dogs, but with some spice added due to its Mexican setting. Its camera work is quite 'wobbly' as is the fashion, but this film isn't a hollywood blockbuster, and so it isn't such an obvious plattitude in this arty and slightly alternative film.Amores Perros lengthy and not all chronologically ordered. It meanders between the stories with gradual clues as to their convergence and significance. I enjoyed the theme of poverty and morality to the film. It does show a realistic, if alternative, portrait of life for some people, and the emotions involved in their struggles. The bad guys get what they deserve in this film, although as the title suggests, 'love is a bitch' and it mustn't be relied on to deliver happy endings. Poverty and hardship are central to the film, and the supermodel's misfortunes help illustrate how nobody is immune from a fall.Its not a film that you will 'love' due partly to its vicious and violent nature (the dog fighting seems especially vivid). Neither is it one you should watch with your parents in the room - as i did! However it will provoke a strong emotional response as films should. Other plus points are the well chosen soundtrack, and powerful atmospheric filming. Amores Perros is a genuinely powerful, and an emotionally and visually impressive movie - recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very powerful quote, losely translated into English from the German dubbed version of `Amores perros', which, unlike the English version, has left the original Spanish title, meaning something like `Dog Loves'.Dogs is what all three episodes of this film are about. They really are. In some episode film (e. g. the Austrian-German `nogo'), some combining element is constructed in order to lump different stories together and make them seem one unified whole. I?árritu's movie tells three astonishingly different stories, each developping its own style and creating its own macabre fascination. These stories could not exist without each other, they are linked but not in a presumptuous, too demonstrative way.And, what makes this movie even more unique: It is presented by a group of marvellous actors in an absolute down-to-earth, almost naturalistic way, like some social-criticism-movie by Bu?uel, but at the same time telling highly imaginative stories. Additionally, the viewer gets a notion of the atmosphere in Mexico City.`Amores perros' has everything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic movie! The actor who played Octavio did an amazing job. What I liked most about this movie, is how well it contrasted to American movies that deal with Mexico. I thought Traffic was very good, but Amores perros surpassed it by far. It showed levels of Mexican society, other than the corrupt general in the drug trade, and the simple honest poor peasant. We Americans mostly think of Mexico as the desert border, Tijuana or a resort that the Love Boat stops at. But through this triptych like story, we see the dichotomy of Mexico City, in much of the same ways we used to see the extremes of New York City in some of the better 70's movies. As long as those dog sequences were truly monitored by the humane society, I have nothing but good things to say about this powerful movie.</fullReview>

I have just purchased the DVD and plan to watch it with as many of my friends as possible because the reactions of the people I watched it with originally were varied to the point that I was unsure if we'd been watching the same movie. The intensity is augmented by the grainy footage and sense of speed (especially apparent in the opening scene). Also the way in which the director dealt with time and space worked beautifully. The characters are surprisingly profound, and even the dogs seem to develop as characters (maybe it's just that I have a rottweiler).

		<fullReview>The debut of Alejandro González I?árritu, vital "Amores Perros", is a thoroughly carried out piece of modern mexican cinema, ready to nail you to the chair for its approximately 2 1/2 hours duration.Three stories are spun together up against each other. Octavio is the average guy in the street, passionately in love with his brother's wife, Susanna, who is married to Ramiro. He lets his dog participate in dogfights, always with a dying part, in order to make enough money for Susanna and himself to escape from Ramiro's violence and cruelty. Nothing, however, goes in the right direction.Daniel, a prospering editor, leaves his wife and kids to move together with the "not-so-stunningly-hot-actually" supermodel, Valeria. Preferably, Daniel's hopes and love, developes into frustration at a higher level, as Valeria gets smashed in a car accident, and later has to have her right leg amputated.El-Chivo, "The goat", is an ex-communist living in a bunker along with his stray dogs. He abandoned his wife and daughter at an early age, to become a soldier fighting for the fate of the world. Only to be put in jail, losing an entire life with his daughter. Now, over 20 years later, he tries to get in touch with his daughter, who thinks he is dead. ---These are the lively, dramatic lifestories, drawn together by Alejandro González I?árritu's artistic mode of expression. With this rough concentrate of consequence spectrums, Alejandro González manages to rise questions whether pain may be a leading path to hope. And.. how would you react if the ultimate euphoric luck, turned out to be leveled with the ground, destructively?When I put this film into my dvdplayer, I had no expectations beyond good reviews etc. It turned out to be one of the best "non-english speaking movies" I've seen. The acting, cinematography, directing, and the music are all spellbinding factors. Brilliant!(10/10)</fullReview>

Divine justice: hopefully one day in future *AMORES PERROS* will appear in movies history as one of the best directors debuts. Nothing in common with "Pulp Fiction", highly original and depth, *AMORES PERROS* deserves a remarkable place in film history, aside with generational masterpieces, lets cross fingers for I?arritu's future works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One movie that shows LA still has hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has generated a lot of polemic in all the places it has showed, in some countries like England cuz of the dog fights and in LatinAmerica cuz nobody (not even the mexicans) thought that there was able to do a good movie with few money (the movie cost was 2 million dollars), and that started a lot of envies, but this movie shows 2 things: 1.-there's only one thing that warranties succes, and that thing is talent. 2.-there's a lot of talent in countries like Argentina, Brazil or Mexico, no matter if the USA don't care about it.The movie talks about 3 stories that mix in a car accident in Mexico City and about the way that accident afected all the people that lived it, after that the stories never really meet again, in the beginning it shows a little bit of inexperience, but as the time passes the movie becomes really good, better that a lot of the crap that happens in HollywoodThe 1st. story is about Octavio, a guy that enters his dog into fights for having money and scape with the wife of his brother, this is the part that some people don't resist, if you pass the first 30 minutes you will be ok. This story is the most commercial of the film.The 2nd. one is the shortest, it was the sacrified when the director had to reedit the movie cuz it was too long, here is where I?arritu and Arriaga experiment the most with a lot of metaphores, mainly where the dog is lost in the floor of the building.The 3rd. is the crudest of all, is about El Chivo, a guy that lost his family 20 years ago and lives doing jobs of killing people, he has 2 conflicts, the first one is to try to recover the love of his daughter Maru, a character that doesn't say one word, but still one of the most important of the movie, the other one is a job to kill a guy, the he discovers that who wants to kill him is his brother, and he puts them face to face, in the Cain VS Abel scene.The movie has wrongly been compared with American Beauty or Traffic, but this movie has been done before that movies, and it has nothing to do with Pulp Fiction, yes, there's some violence in the movie, but it's different, in american movies violence is for having fun, in "Amores Perros" it is a circunstance, what that kind of people live daily. It was nominated to the Oscar as Best Foreing Movie, is obvious that it was never gonna win, is something like Central Station (BRA) VS Life is Beautiful (ITA) in 1999, but it was not fair to disqualify it the way they did in the USA just cuz they hadn't watched it, and if the oscars were fair the movie should have been nominated to best edition.The movie in general makes a lot of analogies with the dogs, and shows how the director talks about the lost of humanity saying that we can see a hurted dog and a hurted man and we help first the dog. I think that this is 'cause of the answer, we help a dog and he's gonna be always loyal, but humans are not that way.It's a very good movie, the NYTimes named it as the first classic of this decade, I do believe they're right, CTHD is a very good movie, but this one too, and if you like to watch movies with something more that a lot of explosions and that make you think, and mainly feel, this is a movie you can't lose.</fullReview>

I love movies, I´ve tried to really catch the efforts of the staff and actors, directors,etc. this elements in Amores Perros really mix well during ALL the movie.The contrasted film is a very effective method for creating at atmosphere, just like Three Kings (even as it was not used during all the movie) or Saving Private Ryan. The Actors were so natural that you´ve just buy the whole thing, the handle of the camera was well used and supporting through the whole movie, the dog fight scenes were so real .The sour taste of what is to live in Mexico City is displayed here, you can walk half hour and pass from a very lujurious neighborhood to a miserable site, that is the thing that catch most mexicans, the Irony of living here and pride that one man was able of translate that to film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Colours: (Mr) Orange!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the film had a unique quality all of its own, both stylistically and structurally it felt like a cross between the 3 Colours trilogy and Pulp Fiction - and for me that was a positive thing, because both of these were great works of filmmaking, and the idea of 3 linked stories, if done well, can be far more satisfying and entertaining than a straightforward movie. In fact, I don't know why it isn't done more often. But 'Amores Perros' definitely transcended its sources, and the crucial role of the dogs as a mirror for the humans at a stroke gave this file an originality and depth to make it stand out. For me, two of the most moving scenes were when Richie is finally rescued from beneath the floorboards, and then when El Chivu comes home to discover what 'Blackie' has done to the rest of his dogs, which in retrospect, was probably the film's key moment. In fact, despite all the canine gore, I think that dog lovers (myself included) get more out of the film than those indifferent to them, as there's more emotional involvement.I also loved the contrasts of the different sections, from the frantic pace of the first story set in the lower end of Mexican society, to the more measured, 3-Colours style approach of the story of Daniel and Valeria, to the final segment which blended the two. I felt this approach worked perfectly, and unlike some of the comments here, I don't think any story went on too long - in fact, this was one of those films that was so good that (a bit like Traffic), I would have been happy for it to carry on another half hour. The characters were all utterly believable, and one of the joys of a film like this is gradually being shown how they all link together, even if they don't know each other, and understanding how one action leads to a whole chain of events which touches the lives of everyone. In fact, ultimately, 'Blackie' is responsible for everything that happens in this film!A real pleasure to watch - if you want a film that has your brain chewing over it for hours afterwards, go - and enjoy!</fullReview>

Pulp Fiction is a great movie, but Amores Perros stands on it's own. Great editing, great script, great camera.The dogfights (dogs used plastic mouth covers, and were sedated for 15 minutes for the dead scenes), The car chase, The blood of the shot man spilling on the cooking table, The model getting back home and seeing the blank wall where her add used to be, The beautiful love scene combined with a brutal one of a beating, it's all just so shocking. Like it or not, this film does live up to it's fame.Without pretention and with most intelligent storytelling this movie shows the reality just like it is, without masks. It will shock you. "Si no has visto esta pelicula, no te preocupes, La vas a vivir" (If you haven't seen this movie, don't worry. You're gonna live it)The only thing this movie lacks is an Oscar.

		<shortDescription>It felt like director I?árritu has put everything (his heart and soul) into 'amores perros' as though it were his last - yet it's his first feature film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it seems like a whole ten years' worth of materials, experience and effort from Mexican director Alejandro González I?árritu. A hint: Don't go to see this film hungry, but not too full either, as your stomach will need room for emotional churns. Its Web site claims the film encompasses: betrayal, anxiety, death, sin, selfishness, pain, hope. It's true: AMORES PERROS has it all.From the very beginning before the start of the film, you see a statement about the filmmakers have in no way ill-treated or harmed any animals depicted in this photoplay. Well, it's still NFE (not for everyone). The director is forward and direct in his depiction of life, people and dogs as they are - he's bold and makes no apology to the faint-hearted. The dog fight scenes can be hard to take even though the camera did not show any direct shots of dogs actually fighting each other. But the atmosphere and build-up around the events felt so 'real' in delivery that warning to those who are squeamish just might need to look away or cover their ears momentarily. The sound effects by sound designer Martin Hernandez are truly well done, especially subtle for the second segment, when you can hear but cannot see the little pet dog? It's quite a way of telling his story, or stories, in three segments. It's ingenious how the main characters in each of the segments somehow have their fate unknowingly intertwined. You actually get to see them as passing background persons whom you'd catch a glimpse of or note as follow-up scenes in another segment than their own. Flashback retelling of events, and fast forward repeating to the cars a-crashing scene (the fateful connection point of the characters from each of the segments) come across as more mind challenging than "Memento", with layers of humanity and tight emotional entanglements. It's kind of like Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski telling his stories in three films: "Trois Couleurs: Bleu 1993; Blanc 1994; Rouge 1994." Director-producer I?árritu did all three stories in one film, 2 hrs. 27 mins. worth. He insightfully linked them all with a strong character thread that is present in all segments. El Chivo is played by Emilio Echevarria, who delivered the role with deep sensitivity, vulnerability and sense of resignation to life's unfairness - yes, "Love's a bitch", and life is, too. What you want to have happened, happens not. Let it go. Hence the ending is practically philosophical. The imagery we see heading towards the horizon beyond might just suggest rebirth?Scriptwriter Guillermo Arriaga has provided a storyline with facets of life and characters: two pairs of brothers in conflict, two cases of infidelity triangles, the bond between a father and his daughter, mother and sons or mother and 'son' of a pet dog, the inseparable relationship between man and dog. Segment 1: Octavio and Susana (and Ramiro, and Cofi the dog; glimpses of Daniel's family, Valeria's billboard, and El Chivo) - the energy is highly charged in this beginning story, where it revolves around the 'slums' of the city where money is hard to come by without involvement of gansterhood, gambling of lives, be it man, woman, or a dog's, and swearing (in Spanish, subtitled). Segment 2: Daniel and Valeria (and Ritchie the dog?) - this story may seem 'trite' and happens not in the slums, yet both characters are pretty much in a slum of emotions. It's the helpless love attraction (rich or poor) which is such a 'Bitch" as Octavio has towards Susana. Segment 3: "El Chivo and Maru" (and Gustavo, Mauricio, and Cofi; glimpses of Ramiro and Susana; follow-up on Octavio and Susana) - culmination point of the film, where we get down to know El Chivo up close - how he came to pass, what he did and is doing, and where he's going in life?AMORES PERROS certainly shows plentiful the lack of love and understanding between brothers, family members, man and woman, man and dog.Bravo! to the filmmakers of AMORES PERROS. Esfuerzo magnifico! Thank you to the distribution of this film by Lions Gate Films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, graphic but intelligent (did I miss anything?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking a path pointed by Tarantino and firmly explored by Guy Ritchie, González I?árritu (Director) does not fall into plain comedy. The 3 graphic and somehow hiper-violent (realistic?) stories in this movie get deep into our emotions. In the first story, a young Octavio secretly lures about his sister-in-law, Susana, and trying to get money to help her, enters the world of dogfighting. In the second one, Valeria, a supermodel, and Daniel, a succesful editor who has abandoned his family in order to be with her, live very despairing moments when losing a small dog. Finally, el Chivo, a dirty, old, angry hitman who likes dogs, get paid for killing a young succesful executive, and maintains a mysterious interest in a pretty girl. Along the 3 stories, the fate of the dogs became a metaphor of the lives of their owners. A very good film, strong, honest and of a new kind of directors in Mexico. The soundtrack is fantastic (specially a song from Nacha Pop, called "Lucha de gigantes") and we must thank the Director for showing us a different view of Mexico very far away from the "taco", the "indio" and the "narco" movie. I still don't know why they translate the movie title as "Love is a bitch". It doesn´t make any sense to me and seems to be very poor related with the movie, but that's life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great movies of 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros is a brilliant, compelling, and gritty film from the heart of Urban Mexico. Most have lauded it as the Mexican Pulp Fiction, but in terms of style, they are two very different films. Amores is again three intertwined stories that are linked through a devastating car crash, the first about a young man who gets rich off dogfighting, the second following a supermodel who is confined to a wheelchair after being fatally injured in the crash, and the third about a former communist-guerilla who covers his former identity through contract killing. The stories aren't pretty but the whole movie is an amazing experience. The second story is a real standout, a very creepy Hitchcockian drama that packs a real sense of dread. While Amores Perros may be flawed, it's fascinating, intriguing, and superb filmmaking. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is destined to become a movie classic. Weather you are Mexican or not, this movie will grab you from the bal... neck and throw you to your seat because you'll see your self in it!Fast paced... aggressive... and profoundly moving.Writing: A great sequence of stories that tell a side of humanity that we are all to hypocrit to admit. AL OF US.Directing: In the tradition of movies like "Pulp Fiction" and "Run Lola Run", it is a movie that takes the subject of entangled stories one step further. Inteligent, daring, on-edge, go the distance and let the audience judge the person in the screen if they dare, for let he who bares no guilt, throw the first stone.Story: It just happens. Some one in the story IS you. No one knows when or who, the who is not important, until you know why... if you ever do...Acting: ALL OF THEM live up to the challenge. This is the true portrait of Mexican talent and craft. It is about time a Mexican production displays and pushes the creativity and expression of all the involved parties.Bottom line: A MUST. It WILL become a classic. It IS timeless since human enfatuation has no time boundaries, and the apartment, car or merchandise you use or loose is of no importance, it's what it means to you that counts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros is a truly prodigious piece of work, resembling a career summation far more than a maiden voyage. It is an anthology film containing three distinct stories which are connected by a car accident in Mexico City. Each of the three tales is also a reflection on the cruelty of humans toward animals and each other, showing how they may live dark or even hideous lives.The film is a startlingly successful debut from a director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu) and a screenwriter (Guillermo Arriaga) whose colliding story lines have since become shop-worn; here they came blazing off the screen in sensationally well achieved, operatic style. The brutality of Amores Perros may be difficult to watch at times, but this intense, gritty film packs a hard wallop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's dog-eat-dog in a godless world?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be warned: dog lovers of the world should avoid this movie simply because most of the graphic violence in this film is visited upon those animals. Sure, it's only a movie, but it looks so real...Having seen 21Grams (2003) and read the reviews of Babel (2006) ? I hope to see the latter soon ? there's no doubt that this writer/director (Inarritu) follows a set formula when constructing his works. That's no criticism ? simply a fact: if there is an overarching theme in his movies it's that of chaos; or, perhaps chance is a better word.We all know that the world ? our own individual world ? is governed, in part, by random elements: what if I'd arrived two minutes earlier...?; what if I'd turned left, not right, that day...?; what would have happened if I'd said yes, instead of no...? There are so many instances of how lives change, for better or worse, when we make choices, as we must.Life's a bitch, no? Well, almost. So, yes, often bad things do happen to good and bad alike, but sometimes, things do work out for the best, even for the worst of us. It's that sort of scenario that Inarritu explores as he intertwines the lives of three sets of people over a period of a few months ? a used-to-be revolutionary who's down on his luck, down in the dumps, and down on humans; a couple of brothers trying to scratch a living in the poorest sections of the city ? one's a store checkout dude masquerading as a bank robber, the other's trying to make a zillion pesos by dog-fighting ? the human ones and the real nasty bull terriers; and last, there's the husband with the seven-year itch who's after the super-life with a super-model who has super-sex appeal.As the viewer, we enter these slices of high and low life with the bone crunching (literally) collision at a city street intersection. What a doozie! However, like 21 Grams (and no doubt, Babel) we've dropped in half way through the narrative, so once again we have to sort out what's in the past, what's in the future and what's happening now... Now, of course, Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) was doing disjointed narratives long before Inarritu arrived on the scene ? like, 1992 -- but the latter director is, I think, even more demanding for the viewer. However, Amores Perros is less of a chore than 21 Grams.Don't get me wrong, however: this is well-crafted cinematography, worthy of the Oscar nominations it received. It's visceral, it's vibrant, it's vicious, it's vaaanderful, darhling ? everything that drama and action fans want to see. I liked it ? particularly the irony of Chivo's (Emilio Echevarria) rescue of the Rottweiler fighting dog from certain death; and, if you are familiar with The Conversation (1974), then you'll just love the scenes of the husband with the seven-year itch (Alvaro Guerrero) tearing up the wooden floor of the apartment he'd just bought for his super-model lover ? but he's not looking for electronic bugs; just for a while, it's real creepy stuff...But, life goes on, and when the final scene fades, you can easily visualize how each of the characters ? those who are still alive ? will carry on: everything changes but nothing changes, fundamentally. If you've seen Crash (2004), if you like Tarantino, if 21 Grams (2003) entertained you, then you should see this film. But, like I said ? if you love dogs, you might want to reconsider...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, loss, pain and death intertwined in a staggering picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros is called by some "the Mexican Pulp Fiction" because of its plot structure. That's actually all they have in common: Tarantino's masterpiece is a terrific film, but, as the title suggests, a little hyperbolic in its depiction of street life; Alejandro Gonzalez I?arritu's debut, on the other hand, deals with real people, and in a painful way.The title literally translates as "dear dogs". A bit ironic, since most dogs in this film are damaged on some level. Not that their owners are having a good time, either: the protagonists are linked by a car accident, around which I?arritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga construct three separate stories.The first episode features a raw, astounding Gael Garcia Bernal as Octavio, a young man in love with his sister-in-law. He's trying to leave Mexico City with her, but has no money, hence his decision to enter his dog in a combat, shown at the beginning of the film in one of the most gruesome scenes ever shot by any director. The combat goes badly, and he runs away, only to cause the collision the whole story revolves around.Another segment focuses on Daniel and Valeria, a couple trying to find a new spark in their relationship. Pity she's lost a leg in the aforementioned car accident. In addition, their dog has fallen through a hole in the floor, causing a lot of despair in the already sad Valeria.The last part is about El Chivo (the superb Emilio Echevarria), a tramp who takes care of stray dogs, especially those who have been mistreated, and witnesses the accident. Having saved Octavio's dog from the car wreck, he considers doing one last job (he used to be a hit-man, you see) before eventually seeking redemption.As debuts go, I?arritu's is quite impressive, given how well he controls the interconnected stories and characters and keeps the same pace throughout the picture. Amores Perros showed he was a name to keep in mind among South American filmmakers, something he confirmed with the beautiful, harrowing 21 Grams. Watch the two movies on a double bill and you'll be rewarded by some of the most powerful cinema of recent times.</fullReview>

The movie is awesome, Amores Perros puts the viewer right in the movie, if you get into it and are not distracted it almost feels like your in the place watching these dog fights! It is a realistic look at the lives of 3 people who all have in common a love for dogs. Even though one of the characters (Octavio) puts his dog through vicious dog fights the man still loves his dog. The director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu does a great job of putting you the viewer right in the heart of Mexico. The opening scene sets it off and right from the get go the movie gets your attention, slows down a bit in the middle but gets going again towards the end. If your a fan of movies that almost seem like the story is really happening then buy this flick, don't rent it go to best buy or wherever and pick up this movie it is a classic for sure! If you like Inarritu's film 21 grams as i did, then your guaranteed to like this one as long as you don't mind reading subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very first second of "Amores Perros", something happens. You get sucked into the movie and your eyes become aroused with the incredible direction. The movie is an awe-inspiring set of plots joined together in an amazing editing process that draws attention to every cinematic aspect possible in movie-making. This is a movie that I saw with very high expectations and ended up getting way more than I bargained for. From the stellar camera-work to the flawless cinematography, the movie is almost a friendly gesture in proper film-making.The movie begins with a car chase. A kind of reminder of the movie Reservoir Dogs (especially with a dog in the back seat!), but quickly becomes something else. The swinging camera throws you back and forth and you actually feel as though you're about to lose control. A car chases from behind and then begins to shoot. You almost duck to avoid the bullets. The car gets closer and you press your foot against the ground hoping that the chased car will go faster. A bus comes out of nowhere and you hold your head hoping the car won't crash into it. It doesn't and it turns outrunning the chasing car, until finally the car crashes into another car. Inside the car we're introduced to Gael García (Octavio), who's later shown as a money hungry young man who uses his strong dog to fight and kill other dogs for money. He protects and seduces his sister-in-law, attempting to allude her away from her crazy husband. The car in which Octavio crashes into is Valeria (Goya Toledo), a supermodel who breaks her legs during the accident and eventually becomes an amputee. She struggles between living as a cripple, her husband who's had a history of being a disloyal husband, and her dog stuck under her floor. A homeless person passes by as the accident happens on his way to kill a man for a good price. He sees the accident and rescues the dog in Octavio's car, shelters him and breeds him. These three stories are connected by one single crash (this may be why so many people hate Paul Haggis' version), and their life is a fitting perspective of the movie name (Life's a Bitch).The dogs in the movie are a strong motif that celebrate life, and undertake a more tragic idea of fate. Director Alejandro González I?árritu knows that this isn't a story with three different short stories. He quietly connects them with subtlety, all the while reminding us that they are a result of something completely different: the tragedy that is life. Alejandro portrays class struggle in a realistic way. He shows us that the dirt poor will do anything for money, the working class will be happy but will go that extra mile to please someone, and the high class will always be unhappy unless they keep getting more and more. In one beautiful scene, the homeless guy - El Chivo (Emilio Echevarría) calls his daughter and tells her that life is unfair, that he didn't have money so he got arrested and couldn't face her until now. The message of the whole movie is so thought-provoking it almost makes you choke. The whole system of life is just one big circle and everyone is somehow struggling with the same problem.Octavio is the fifth wheel in the movie. He becomes the reason for Valeria's accident, and El Chivo's sudden decision to not kill the man and finally face his own daughter. Within reason, Octavio is the central character. And although we never really know what happens to him after the accident (aside that his brother dies and he once again gets turned down by his sister-in-law and leaves), we almost know that the result will not be good. The same is the result with Valeria's story: we see her husband struck with anger as he finds out she is now an amputee, but we don't know if he will leave her or not. Especially because his former wife is begging him to come home. The only story we feel any optimism for is El Chivo's. Ironically, he's always been the one who has the word 'unfair' stamped on his forehead."Amores Perros" is as deep as it is cinematically beautiful. It shares a very interesting idea and thought about the world, and challenges us with eye-squinting visuals. Performances that leave your jaw dropped, and one hell of a thrill ride. One of the most suitable titles for a movie, it defines new cinema in a completely strict manner. Aside from that, it's a good thing there's a disclaimer saying "no dogs were harmed", otherwise it would have been hated by the critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At 2 hours and 33 minutes, you would think it would be hard to sit through the whole movie, but that's not the case with this film. The first scene grabs a hold of you, and only barely loosens its grip during the movie. Each story is mesmerizing and you stay determined to see the outcome. The first story is one of the most stunning of the three. However no story is really over when the next begins. The three remain connected. The dog fights are a little uneasy to watch, but it isn't shown on the screen for more than 21 seconds. I would recommend it to anybody, unless you can't stand to watch a dog getting shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new step in Mexican film industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think in recent Mexican movies, the majority involve a lack of originality, full with clichés of corruption, political situations, economic situations, even language ones. The reason I believe that it's because people in the Mexican film industry don't want to risk the originality of their thoughts, or more specific, their money... But I believe, as the saying said "Who doesn't risk, doesn't win" that its for sure a difficult business, but it isn't impossible. Actually, the more you risk, with this I mean a equal balance between what you feel and what you think, the more you get. Amores Perros did this step, they risk for something never done in Mexican Film History, and they did it right, I'm not saying that it wasn't done before, It was in movies like Los Olvidados of Bu?uel or Y Tu Mama También of Cuarón afterward. It's a walkabout in a dark pad, but when you see the light you get to see a beautiful movies as it is Amores Perros, you get inspiration for uncommon project and thoughts.Jach</fullReview>

All this people have dogs that tie them to life and help them run away from this mixed up relations.As the movie goes on we see their lives change in good or bad ways with the change of their relations with their dogs.Some how in the end they all change their static going lives( at least first we think so).The director makes us believe that everything can change like the flowing river. No one in the movie stays in the first happy or sad situation that we think will go on for ever. The movie just seem to smash every bit of thing that they know as life. In the end we see the not so expected final and the movie forces us to think about the life for twice.A must seen twice for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting and Violent Intersections of Varied Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a Mexican take on the "Pulp Fiction"-inspired violence genre of circling around events to examine how each character in a different strata of life, work and politics got to a particular intersection (literally and in their life) and how they are affected by that encounter.The overriding theme is the power of love, all kinds of love, very complicated loves, such that the English translated title of Love's A Bitch is a pun around the connections of dogs to the intersections. While the structure is a bit imitative, the characters are unusual in their situations, three-dimensionality, and complexity, all very passionately acted, and unpredictably concluded for each.Of course when I could be sure I was getting the dialog. Foreign movie makers complain bitterly that American movie audiences don't go to foreign films, but at this point in the 21st century can they not come up with legible subtitles, let alone with translated before and after credits? It sure was tough trying to figure out the great sounding music credits, but it didn't seem to be any Latin rock bands I'd heard of and it was unfortunate not to be able to tell if the music was commenting on the action, other than "Long Cool Woman in A Black Dress."

		<shortDescription>Stark depiction of modern Mexican society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)There are a lot of dogs in this movie. And there are some dog-fighting scenes that dog lovers may not want to see. Be forewared, a lot of dog blood is spilled.And why? Does director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has some kind of obsession with dogs? I don't know but according to something I read at IMDb there's a blurb at the beginning of the film stating that no animals were harmed in making the film. I played the DVD back, but I couldn't find the statement. I wonder. They sure looked harmed, and at any rate must have been sedated for some of the scenes. There is a short documentary called Los perros de'Amores perros (2000) that explains it all for those who are worrying about the dogs. Personally I'm not too worried because I very much doubt that Inarritu would make a film involving so many dogs and allow them to be hurt.Anyway, this is a violent movie with a lot of the violence happening to the dogs. It was Inarritu's first film, or at least his first big film. He has since made, most notably, 21 Grams (2003). As in 21 Grams, there are three stories here, connected only by chance and the dogs. The opening scene is a car chase in which, we later learn, the three stories collide. There was also an accident in 21 Grams that help to hold the stories together.Here we have (1) the story of Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is in love with his older brother's wife, Susana (Vanessa Bache); (2) the story of El Chivo (Emilio Chevarria), one-time guerilla fighter, now a hit man who dresses and behaves like a homeless person; and (3) the story of Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who leaves his wife and children for a lanky runway model, Valeria (Goya Toledo). All three stories include dogs. Octavio's dog Cofi becomes a big winner at the dog fights and makes money for Octavio which he gives to Susana to save so that they can run away together. El Chivo lives with four dogs, and Valeria has a little dog Richie that somehow (I can't figure out how) gets stuck under the floor and put upon by rats after it chases a ball through a hole in the floor.Presumably this film shows us the violence that is endemic in Mexican society, perhaps inherited from the Aztecs and the Conquistadors, who were pretty bloody in their time. Or perhaps Inarritu knows that violence plays with the young American audiences that go to the theaters, and what he has is a nice commingling of purpose. One thing for sure, Inarritu knows how to make a film that engages the audience with not just violence but the clash of character and aspiration. A lot of the credit for the success of this film must go to the outstanding cast, in particular Emilio Chevarria and Gael Garcia Bernal.Best, most original scene: when El Chivo leaves the two men tied up with the gun equal distance between them, just out of reach.Bottom line: not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

Yes, the plot is all about human tragedies; yes, it incorporates first rate feelings such as love or loss; yes, it keeps you watching for more than 90 mins of your life BUT... What is the message? What new light does it cast on any aspect of our lives? While Amores Perros is certainly worth seeing, its impact vanishes within a day or two (unless you're some dogfight perv in which case you've definitely found your movie). Rather like some other latin american movies (I'm thinking of Y tu mama tambien, for example) this movie has great actors, great direction but lacks depth, meaning and relevance. All in all, Amores Perros is alright but so are hundreds of other movies. Don't get me wrong: IT IS A GOOD MOVIE but just don't expect a once-in-a-century-masterpiece (as hinted at in other people's comments on this page). Go see it if you've got the time or simply go bowling. Choose the latter if you want to lift your spirits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutally direct film with an equally direct message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so good I feel compelled to comment.The only film I've ever seen that even vaguely reminds me of this is El Topo,a Spanish made film from the 70's. While I could feel a little of Clockwork Orange, the message of Amores Perros is more evolved and less tangential.Through 3 separate stories, the filmmakers of this well-acted and craftily produced challenge-to-our-senses convey the same unavoidable truth: no one escapes the price for their actions.In grand allegory and shocking visual depictions, specifically of horrific and incredibly insensitive (to us) dog-fight settings, we are forced to accept this undeniable part of our existence. Each one of the characters undergoes severe inner and outer turmoil within the framework and context of their own life.The lower economic class is pervasively plagued with stereotypes and dead-ends. The limitations of the ghetto become apparent in the predisposed perceptions and corresponding acting-out of roles we see. Young women are wantonly lusted after in this undeniably male-dominated society, yet the mothers of these same men are devalued to the point almost of non-humanity. Their own self-worth and lack of virtue is just as meaninglessly predicated. These men display absolutely no sense of loyalty or appreciation for anything but immediate gratification; even among brothers. Morality becomes secondary to the law of the street; easily replaced with a clear "take what you can get" system of belief.The altering sociologic strata of the settings portrays a cross-cultural inevitability that everything catches up with us sooner or later. A successful businessman who leaves his wife and children for a beautiful woman finds he has stretched himself to the limit,and feels trapped by his own sense of responsibility. In another vignette a man who befriends dogs rather than humans rockets into reality upon the discovery of a quasi-victimless crime. With an inability to punish what he sees as the equivalent of brainwashing in dogs, he feels compelled to face the shame and the pain of confronting his own regretful past. An eternally optimistic young man who characteristically replaces hope with the facts, suffers incredible disillusionment through the impossibility of his dream.Not all suffering in this movie comes at the hands of one's own mistakes or misdeeds. Accidents and unfortunate twists-of-fate play themselves in award winning manner.The violence and pain of this movie happen in the mind as much as on the screen. With such redeeming value as the movie has, you may be able to force yourself to watch for 3 hours.It's not easy to do.As difficult as it is to witness the message of the film, the graphic illustrations are blatant and without apology. Perfectly fitted for the subject it addresses. No matter; it's not nearly as bad as what we experience in our own most dire moments. The film's horrors simply occur in concentratated form.I was left with a feeling that our time without struggle should be cherished. And as a result,I came away accepting the easily mouthed, yet painfully experienced, tenet that our darkest hours serve us by providing relativity to our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to rate it higher,but its has 3 episodes and the "Daniel y Valeria" episode is more annoying than anything else. So, 2 out of 3 is the best it could get.According to Martin, "Masters take after their dogs". Octavio and Cofi. Both surrounded by crap and pushed to do dumb things. Both seem to be on top but both get taken out by something more dangerous than themselves. Both get a second chance at life and seem determined to screw that up too.Valeria (a dumb blonde) and Ritchie (a dumb yap-yap dog). There's a pair. These two deserve each other. Both trapped in their own private holes. Sense(?) of a woman. Ritchie goes in a hole and won't come out. They put gourmet chocolates at the entrance to the hole to tempt him out. Still, no Ritchie. Valeria sees rats in the hole and thinks the rats ate Ritchie. Daniel says "let's put rat poison in there." Valeria says "No, Ritchie will eat it. "Hello? Blonde? He wouldn't eat the gourmet chocolates. Sense(?) of a woman. If you read this before seeing the movie, I'd recommend you fast forward through "Daniel y Valeria". You'll be more satisfied with the rest.Martin and his dogs and then Cofi/Blackie? Here the master/dog theory falls apart. Surely, at the beginning they are all outcasts, scrounging out an existence. So, why do the dogs die, but Martin goes on. Perhaps here the point is that, in order for Martin, to be able to move ahead, his current life (his dogs) needs to be shattered.And one hilarious scene, made all the more hilarious coming in the middle of so much tension and violence. I'll get it ... toss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of this kind of jump-cut editing will no doubt compare Amores Perros to Pulp Fiction, and that is a fair assessment of this film. Set in a hot, dry climate pulsating with malevolence, Amores Perros features a similar array of simmering malcontents, wealth, poverty, violence and sex. Where it differs from Tarantino's film is in the strong emotional draw of the characters.Gael García Bernal performs wonderfully (as always) as the unlucky Octavio, and he gets a lot of the screen time in Amores Perros, but the real hero here is Emilio Echevarría, who pulls off one of the most astonishing on-screen transformations in recent memory. His wordless performance alone is worth watching the 2 and a half hour film for.Interconnecting the three stories is the theme of dogs. All of the characters bestow a kind of love upon the animals which is not bestowed upon the humans. When they die, as most of them do, we are saddened beyond the brief shock of a human death or, as is the case, a terrible car crash. Dogs are the redeemers, too, of every story.This is a long film, and slow moving. Whatever you might hear about it it is much less violent than most Hollywood films, which revel in casual slaughter. The car crash is horrific, and makes me want to drive at 5 miles per hour in a Volvo for the rest of my life, but generally this is not a violent movie.Shot in beautiful, trembling, leached colour, it is an achingly beautiful film to watch. With the strong performances and literate screenplay it makes a very fine movie. Probably will become a classic in a few years. Oh, and it knocks the socks off Pulp Fiction...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen some unnerving movies in my life, but "Amores perros" (alternately called "Love's a Bitch" in English) is a level all on its own. It knocks the breath out of you the way "Mystic River" does (maybe even more so). The plot centers on a car wreck in Mexico City and how it affects several people. The people are from every walk of life - there's a doctor and a homeless man - but they're all desperate, with a capital "D". And everything in their gut-wrenching lives all relates somehow to their dogs.This is a very accomplished piece of cinema. Among other things, it introduced the world to Gael Garcia Bernal, who went on to play Che Guevara in "The Motorcycle Diaries". And director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu went on to make the equally gut-wrenching "21 Grams" in the USA. Despite the unrest that has dominated Mexico, they have always turned out some good movies. Hollywood should take a cue from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing. The type of film that stays with you for days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu is one of the greatest filmmakers of the 21st century for his breathtaking vision and the power he brings in his darkest films. "Amorres Perros" is a heartbreaking story that digs into your soul and stays with you. It's blistering performances and depressing subject matter are the things that build upon strong films. While disturbing and saddening to watch at many times, "Amorres Perros" thrives in doing what it intends on doing, that being showing you the real world and how multiple people of different backgrounds can relate to one another no matter their lifestyles. Three interconnected stories about the different strata of life in Mexico City all resolve with a fatal car accident. Octavio is trying to raise enough money to run away with his sister- in-law, and decides to enter his dog Cofi into the world of dogfighting. After a dogfight goes bad, Octavio flees in his car, running a red light and causing the accident. Daniel and Valeria's new-found bliss is ended when she loses her leg in the accident. El Chivo is a homeless man who cares for stray dogs and is there to witness the collision. With three stories being interconnected by an accident, we see the dark sides to each group of people. We learn about their motifs, their failures, and, surprisingly, their mutual love of dogs (hence the title "Love's a Bitch"). What Innaritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga do is craft an amazing masterpiece that stands out as one of the greatest foreign films of all time. This powerful drama brings the hardship and hope of life in magnificent and creative ways that help you appreciate the power of storytelling and good drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real comfort-zone-pusher of a film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a dog lover, this film was a hard watch during some of the scenes, but man did this film give the dogs honest character not only for themselves but their owners, which is the purpose of the story; we see the world revolving around the animals rather than on a human protagonist and how this dog-eat-dog world is always changing.Amores Perros is well written and directed, but this film is one of the biggest heavy- hitters I've ever watched. It makes you feel uncomfortable a lot of the time and you get stressed with the characters when the story calls for it. This film shows just some of the everyday chaos people can go through in Mexico City, and the dogs change with the people who own them. The people are only as good or as corrupt as the people who care for them; keeping that in mind, Amores Perros makes for an impactful experience that doesn't leave the viewers unaffected.This film is simply worth a watch. It's not a rosie-painted Hollywood flick; this is international art-house cinema that has a lot to say about human circumstance and city life of the underprivileged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a dog's life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remarkable first film by Alejandro González I?árritu, an incredibly well-crafted film that initially seems fragmented, but where the pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly once finished.We are presented with three seemingly unconnected stories; a young man involved with dog fighting in the seedy districts of Mexico City who lusts after his sister-in-law, an executive who cheats on his wife and later divorces her and buys his lover and her dog a luxury apartment, and lastly a scruffy dog-loving bum who clearly has a troubled past.Initially the only link between these stories seems to be the protagonists' love of dogs. However, slowly the connections between these three stories become clear through the director's clever use of flashbacks. The way the three stories interconnect is ingenious and as the story dramatically unfolded it left me stunned.This riveting film kept me glued to my seat and that says a lot; it is quite long at two and a half hours.I found the performances by all the actors outstanding, the hand-held cinematography some of the best I have ever seen, whilst the pulsating musical score that fitted the mood of the film was just perfect.I rarely give a full score to films, but in this case I award it an outstanding 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores perros, a.k.a Love's a bitch, a trichtype: three apparently disparate stories, not necessarily distinct, amalgamate and provide a combined effect on the viewer, has all the necessary ingredients of a simple movie aiming to tackle complex issues related, but not limited, to love, in all its forms, loyalty, treachery, faith, brotherly love , or lack of it, and hope. In one story, protagonist caves into lust and doesn't care whether God laughs at his plans; contrastingly, in the third plot beleaguered veteran, an assassin, tries to see clearly even though he jests earlier in the movie that if God wishes him to see everything blurry, he will do so. Just as having all the key ingredients, fresh and appropriate, doesn't guarantee an exquisite dish, so having appropriate cast, relevant production values and stellar writing doesn't promise a great viewing. This is where a director's worth really shows. While viewing the first part, the viewer feels adventurous, hopeful and eerily guilt. These feeling give way to feeling of irritation, nagging and loss of hope, during the second part ; one again feels hopeful, furthers his understanding of life and human nature, and acknowledges importance of moving on after viewing the third and final part of the movie. Innaritu's genius has an effect. It lies not in showing what life is, but in making the audience feel it. For English audience, who know little about fame of Mexican actors, the movie may sometimes feel like a well-directed and edited documentary, with close up shot spreading throughout the movie and realistic portrayal. You neither appreciate what most characters do, nor condemn them; because u realize love's a bitch!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling, deep, in the style of 21 grams...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores perros, in the style of 21 Grams or Crash (21 grams coming from the same director, Crash from a different director I believe), tells 3 stories about 3 different people (or pairings of people, actually), from 3 completely different walks of life in Mexico City that are united by an unfortunate and tragic car accident. Each struggle with love and loss, illusion vs. reality, as well as loneliness/isolation. Alejandro Gonzales Innaritu is a brilliant director and producer. Amores Perros is a film that can be viewed multiple times and interpreted slightly differently each time. The script is also so well written that the characters do and say just enough to tell the story, but leave enough vagueness to make you question the depth of their character and their motivations. Each story is accompanied by a parallel story involving man's best friend, el perro, the dog. All characters are accompanied by dogs, who mirror their life experiences in some aspect, as well as physical appearance (if you look closely enough). A perfect fit for the Spanish and English titles of the movie. You can tell every single little detail of this movie has been well thought out and carefully crafted. An excellent watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie that should not be skipped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes great cinema is not always based on things that are easy to watch and digest. Ameros Perros is such movie where the viewer will get to witness painful things and through that pain come the art of realization. Maybe there is no other pleasant way to tell this story without making it less effective. Whichever it is the final result is a staggering piece of true cinema.Amores Perros is directed by Alejandro González I?árritu, and is the first movie of the death trilogy followed by 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). Though there is no relativity in plot between these movies the sublime and underlying similarity in style of storytelling is what binds them together. Here in Amores Perros there are 3 parallel story lines that seem very different to each other on surface but speak of a common theme all together. And at one point the characters of each story line overlaps and meets ones another at a common symbolic incident. This incident is what binds the stories together however not largely dependent on each other's success. This is one reason I called this point symbolic than crucial.Story line one follows the most painful to watch material. It's about a young man from the city low class who turns to fighting his dog in underground dog fights to earn money for his plans to get away with his unconventional girlfriend. Here you may come across the ugly trade of dog fights and the fate of dogs that goes in to them. For dog lovers this section is nightmare. Story line two is about a super model who faces an unfortunate road accident. The drama between her illegal partner and her struggle to survive takes a very different mood and rhythm from the previous story. Yet she also has a pet dog that keeps her company. The key character of story line three is a hit man. Beaten up by life and mistakes he did in the past he lives with a bunch of dogs and almost homeless. However he struggles to put things right by his daughter and for some reasons he is pushed away from his dreams.As you may realize these three story lines are far from being common. But they are beautifully connected by dogs. The dog is a symbol of loyalty at each story and the people are symbols of disloyalty and unfaithfulness. This combination works perfectly and Amores Perros gives the viewer heavy breathing. Powerful performances, wonderful cinematography and music ads spice on top of each other without making a single story lines prominent over each other. It seems like the director has done a perfect job in phasing out the sequences and laying out a perfect ending as well. While I highly recommend this I would like to recommend 21 Grams and Babel too if you have not seeing them already. They complete one of the most satisfying trilogies of contemporary cinema.</fullReview>

Well directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, directing his first full-length feature film.

		<shortDescription>Love the first section</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts with a car chase ending in a horrific crash. The crash serves as a pivot for three interconnected stories. The first is Octavio (Gael García Bernal). He lives with his mother, his older brother, and sister-in-law Susana. He lusts for his brother's wife and wants to run away with her. A local hoodlum dog fights and one day, he sends his dog at Octavio's dog Cofi. It nearly kills the hoodlum's dog. Octavio takes Cofi into the world of dogfights to earn the money needed to escape with Susana. The second is the model Valeria who barely survives the car crash with a severely injured leg. The third is El Chivo who roams the streets with his cart. At his run-down home, he takes care of his pack of dogs. Then he's hired to track down a guy.This is brought to us by director Alejandro González I?árritu who would eventually direct other interconnected story lines movies such as Babel and 21 Grams. He's got a style and he's good at it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the first story with Gael García Bernal. It could be a great movie all by itself. It's gritty. It's compelling.The second story starts slow. Then it takes a weird turn. I don't want to spoil it, but it builds into something poetic. It's quite a special little short story. The third story is probably the least compelling of the three. The dog part of story appeal to me the most. I'm not terribly interested in El Chivo, but it's a good enough to finish off the trifecta.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the word go!. Fast moving - great screen play and story unfolding. Special mention about dog fight - I don't know how they took some shots - it was good. Great entertainment even now. In this movie the greatest starring is played by fate. That decides everything and so in that sense everything just changes in just a second. And how that change affects three interconnected stories is very engrossing and meaningful. I personally felt that what Octavio was doing absolutely wrong and appreciate the way Susana did. She kept telling Octavio that she loves her husband no matter what!. Daniel's character was just perfect for the setting. El Chivo's character was the one which made more deep message for me. Valeria - the model's change after the accident and her crazy attraction for her pet dog - is very chilling because of the way the story was set. Amores Perros has meaning for any one. It makes one introspect. A must watch and my rating 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the Rennaissance of Mexican cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You and your plans. You know what my grandmother used to say? If you want to make God laugh... tell Him your plans."Amores Perros was Mexican director, Alejandro Gonzalez I?arritu's directorial debut, and he really entered with a bang winning several awards for this acclaimed film. Along with the success of Guillermo del Toro (El Espinazo del Diablo) and Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien), these trio of directors began the renaissance movement in Mexico during the beginning of the century. Today they are all directing big budget movies in Hollywood, but it wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for this gem of a movie that put Mexican cinema in the international map again. Gael Garcia Bernal was also a revelation in this film and has become a well known actor after his performance here and in Y Tu Mama Tambien. Having watched I?arritu's later films, 21 Grams and Babel, I kind of knew what to expect from Amores Perros. He has a way of interconnecting several stories and playing with linear chronological events, and Amores Perros seems to be the film that started this trait. I wish I would've seen this film before the others because this feels like a more complete film, but I have grown a bit tired of the director's stylish and depressing vision of the world. This is still a great film with some powerful scenes, although the movie does suffer from being a little too long (150 minutes) and I thought one of the stories (Valeria and Daniel's) wasn't up to the same level of the other two and I could have done without it. Having said that I still believe this is one of his best films and definitely Mexico's best film. It deserves all the awards it has received and should've won an Oscar for best foreign picture if it didn't have to compete against Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The script from Guillermo Arriaga was also gripping and realistic. In my opinion I?arritu's best work has been done alongside Arriaga.The film centers on three interconnected stories that overlap with each other in a terrible car accident. The first story focuses on Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche), with whom he's secretly in love. His brother, Ramiro (Marco Perez) treats her terribly, but Octavio promises to take care of her if she runs away with him. In order to make money, Octavio gets involved with dog fighting, since his dog happens to be a great fighter. When one of the dog fights goes wrong, Octavio has to escape from a group of gang leaders that eventually cause the traffic accident. The second story (and my least favorite one) centers on the relationship between a successful model, Valeria (Goya Toledo) and magazine editor named Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who has abandoned his family to live with her. And finally the third story introduces us to a bum named El Chivo (Emilio Echeverría) who also works as a contracted killer. All these characters also seem to have special relationships with their dogs. As the title suggests dogs do play a very important role in this film, not only because the accident is produced in the first place due to a dog fight, but because I?arritu compares the violence in dog fights with the brutality and savagery of humanity. There are several themes and layers to this film, but I?arritu knows his craft and delivers a very brutal and realistic film. Amores Perros is an ambitious movie with several scenes that will stick with you and some powerful performances from Gael Garcia Bernal and Emilio Echeverría. I?arritu is very familiar with the brutality in human nature and isn't afraid to show the dark side of humanity along with the search for true love. Amores Perros is an emotionally involving movie with a gripping humanistic story, but I think I?arritu should shift gears for his next movie and focus on another aspect of humanity instead. This film was fresh and innovative, but his tricks have grown old after 21 Grams, Babel, and Biutiful.</fullReview>

Mexico City serves as the perfect backdrop to showcase the failures, poverty, greed, and lust that each and every human and society encounters. There are no frills or Hollywood clichés in this movie and Amores will strike hard in every emotion that you have while keeping you entertained. The whole movie revolves around dogs/dog fighting and how humans are intertwined and share some of the instincts of animals. Amores also shows how no human is safe from evil and failures no matter where your from or who you are.</fullReview>

The three stories are nicely connected to each other and the performances of all actors and actresses are fantastic.

		<shortDescription>Life in Mexico City depicted through three stories of love and violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a big picture. It contains three separate stories that straddle different social classes. The connections between the stories are made through an auto accident mainly. The accident is a plot device. The connections it makes are not inherent to the structure or meaning of the individual stories. What really matters here, first and foremost, is the movie's depiction of life in Mexico and Mexico City, and what we see is a scary place. I would not want to live there. These depictions are effective, but also somewhat heavy-handed, labored and obvious. The movie is a slow-going slog at times, with a good deal of repetition, especially in the first story. The third story moves along best.The feeling the movie gave me was of depression and hopelessness, of miserable people trapped into miserable lives, no matter what their social status, of little or no joy. It also gave me the feeling of people who are misleading their lives, not living them well, no matter what their circumstances of wealth.There is a basic spiritual poverty being shown here. People are seeking meaning or redemption in love of their fellow human beings, in their connections with others, and they are not finding it. In one story, a man has replaced love of human beings with love of his dogs. This brings him misery, however. Instead they are finding violence in the attempt to be happy on the temporal earthly plane via their connections with others or nature or any earthly thing such as success and applause and renown.The movie does not offer an explanation for this misdirected activity and it doesn't offer a way out of it and beyond it, but the general outlines of these are clear. In the modern age, God is dead. He has nothing to offer these people. They are growing up and living without the connection, requisite for happiness and proper living, to the spirit. Mexico's case may be peculiar in why its Christianity has failed or been corrupted or failed to take or be perpetuated. I do not know. No idol, no human thing, including love can be counted on as a replacement for living in God.Despite not bringing us any such messages, the picture suggests that one should live by the moral rules or suffer the consequences. Every person who doesn't do so in the movie suffers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ruthless debut leading to a legendary trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An astonishing film from Mexican director Alejandro González I?árritu, "Amores Perros" packs a complex emotional wallop that rivals "Traffic" or Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" -- and the fact that it's I?árritu's first film makes it even more remarkable. Its dark and disturbing--an almost surrealist tone that escalates it high above the usual film laced with carnage. I?árritu doesn't present Mexico City as a tourist attraction with exotic locales. Written by Guillermo Arriaga, the film lies in the belly of the underworld--a rat's-eye view of a city undergoing economic upheaval. The political angle doesn't exactly leap off the screen, and it doesn't have to. But circumstances are dire--an environment where only the strong survive. Structured as a triptych, "Amores Perros" opens with a speeding car racing through the streets. Its backseat cargo is a wounded dog -- not the last you'll see, either. Its driver is a shrieking mess of blood, sweat and tears. His name is Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), and his car is making a getaway from a dogfight gone deadly. But before we get a whiff of what precipitated it, there's a crash. A narrative rewind then takes us back a few days, to when Octavio has hatched a plan to run off with his brother's girlfriend. "Amores Perros" interlaces three distinct tales around this single event, and then plays fast and loose with structure and narrative to fill in the befores and afters. There's slum kid Octavio (Bernal), who, with a friend, enters his hulking rottweiler Cofi in the local dog fights. He's also in love with his abusive brother Ramiro's (Pérez) wife (Bauche), and begs her to come away with him to the coast to open up a storefront using his dog fight winnings. Then there's the gorgeous model Valeria (Toledo) and her magazine editor lover Daniel (Guerrero) -- the aforementioned car crash acts as a terrible proving ground (for better or worse) for their romance. Finally, there's a disheveled vagrant -- El Chivo, the goat -- played by legendary Mexican character actor Echevarría, who collects the city's homeless canines and occasionally moonlights as a hit-man. "Amores Perros" at 154 minutes is a heavy, prolonged story-- rich with characters and atmosphere. His characters are people with feelings and motives. They want love, money, and revenge. They not only love their dogs--but desperately depend on them. And it is clear that the lower classes are better at survival than the wealthy, whose confidence comes from their possessions, not their fortitude. It is the work of a born filmmaker-- you can sense his passion as he plunges into melodrama, coincidence, sensation, and violence."Amores Perros" has much more going on in its multi-layered plot--but the less viewers know going in, the better off they're likely to be. Forewarning however: The film's portrayal of the brutal world of back alley dogfighting, and a way of life in their culture, is utterly realistic, appalling, and difficult to watch. Those averse to the sight of dead and dying canines should at the very least be prepared to cover their eyes. As with everything else in his film, I?árritu's camera doesn't flinch from the mundane cruelties of the street. Entirely apart from the remarkable narrative, "Amores Perros" is a triumph on virtually every conceivable front. Rodriego Prieto's cinematography is unique to each storyline.I?árritu feverishly works to earn the existentialist melodrama that closes the film. He's daring you: Can you see beneath life's luridness? Admittedly, this violent, ruthless film is not going to be to everyone's taste. But for those willing to submit to its unrelenting misery, will be rewarded substantially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful---if dark---moralistic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Russian wife's major criticism of western cinema is that they always have a happy ending, rendering them unrealistic crowd pleasers. "Amores Perros" could, in a sense, be said to have a happy ending. In a sense, the good guy wins. It's just that throughout the film you would never come to relate to him as the good guy, nor with the bad guys as being the bad guys. And that is the beauty of this film: it lures you into relating with people, such that you see the world through their own eyes, and understand how they perceive their actions as being right. It's only after the credits roll down, and you consider what you've just seen, and how it all interlinks that you come to understand the deep moral undertones of this film, and who was really representing the good, the bad and the ugly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If any serious movie lover hasn't watched it, I suggest go watch it. A brilliant and thrilling movie. The stories are interconnected brilliantly and woven together to put together this masterpiece. Some people might find few scenes disturbing so viewer discretion is advised. For all its sensationalism, however, this is also a very moral film, with all its characters inexorably heading towards the fates they bring upon themselves - it's a brilliant portrait of the dog beneath the human skin. The movie is very well supported by all the actors be their role only be with out uttering a word. On the technical front the slick editing and the camera work is amazing. A must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros (Love's a Bitch)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Alejandro González I?árritu (Babel, Biutiful), I spotted this Mexican film after reading about it in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and it was rated five stars out of five by the critics, so I definitely had to see it. Basically this film sees three sets of characters connected together by a tragic car accident that brings them all together for the brief time, and we see the three points of view before, after and at the time of the incident. The first segment sees Octavio (The Motorcycle Diaries' Gael García Bernal) in love with his sister in law Susana (Vanessa Bauch), who is mistreated by his brother Ramiro (Marco Pérez), so he tries to persuade her to run away with him. To make the money he needs to start a new life with Susana, Octavio gets involved with dog fighting, and with his really savage black dog Cofi he makes enough money to travel, but she takes it with her husband. Cofi is shot by a rival dog owner, and Octavio stabs him before ending up in a car chase, driving with his lifelong friend Jorge (Humberto Busto), and obviously in the high speed they crash, with Jorge dying and Octavio badly injured. The second segment sees successful magazine publisher Daniel (Álvaro Guerrero), who has left his family to be with Spanish supermodel Valeria (Goya Toledo), and they end up in the serious car crash. Valeria severely breaks her right leg, meaning that she can no longer do her modelling, and forcing her to use a wheelchair while she recuperates in the apartment, and this is made even harder to cope with when dog Richie disappears chasing a ball down the hole in the floorboards. With the dog being heard under the floorboards, and unable to get him out, this causes friction between Daniel and Valeria, and trying to help Richie she ends up injuring her leg even more, causing internal bleeding and gangrene. The doctors had no choice but to amputate her right leg, so there is no chance to return to a modelling career, she is upset to no longer feel a sense of purpose, but she is happy to get Richie out from under the floorboards. The third and final segment sees former private school teacher turned tramp El Chivo aka The Goat (Die Another Day's Emilio Echevarría), who lives in an abandoned warehouse and roams the streets, and spends most of his time caring for abandoned dogs, but he is also a professional hit-man. At points in the film he is trying to make contact with his daughter Maru (Lourdes Echevarría), who he was forced to abandon at two years old after being sent to prison for twenty years, and her mother told her that he had died. There is a cutaway from this segment for a moment, that sees Ramiro and an accomplice robbing a bank, and they end up shot and killed, and injured Octavio tries to convince Susana again to run away with him, but she refuses, as she has lost her husband. Anyway, El Chivo witness the car accident, and he notices the injured black dog with a bullet wound, so he takes him back to the warehouse, and he recovers well, and he was going to carry out a new hit before the crash happened. While away from the warehouse El Chico is shocked and angered to see that the black dog has killed all his other rescued mongrels, but he cannot kill the dog as he would lose his only remaining companion. Next he goes to the man he has been paid to kill, and he ties him up in his warehouse, and learns his client is the man's half-brother, so he also catches and hold the client hostage. El Chivo decides to clean himself by cutting his hair and shaving his beard off, and he leaves the two restrained men in the warehouse, with a gun put between them, so they can have their fate decided for themselves. El Chivo breaks into his daughter's house, and he leaves a bundle of the money he earned, an altered photograph with himself in it, and an emotional answer phone message explaining who he is and why he had to abandon her as a child, and he walks into the distance with his dog, he names him "Negro". Also starring Jorge Salinas as Luis and Rodrigo Murray as Gustavo. The cast are all really good in their parts, especially Echevarría who is really sympathetic and a cool hired assassin, the third segment is definitely the most magnificent, the other two segments have their compelling moments as well. The imagery of violence with animals and the characters, the cursed love, the traumas and the tragedy seen throughout makes for powerful emotion and hard-hitting material, with well crafted characters, exciting sequences, and an extraordinary plot line with interconnected stories, this is a must see drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>deeeeeep movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx. He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles. Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.El Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function. With intricate structure, 'Amores perros' tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls 'illegal economies' (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can't depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world's mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments. Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.These two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his 'job', wiping out businessman. If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left, happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.There is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the 'Cain and Abel' half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia's functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people just won't want to sit through this film because of the overtly graphic and disturbing dog fighting scenes, which is ironic, because most people don't seem to mind the graphic violence involving the people in this film. Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature "Y Tu Mama Tambien"). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, "Amores Perros" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mexican Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three stories of life along the margins in Mexico City converge in this inventive thriller. Amores perros is a realist Mexican film, directed by Alejandro González I?árritu.The movie features Emilio Echevarría, Gael García Bernal and Goya Toledo together with Álvaro Guerrero,Vanessa Bauche,Jorge Salinas,Adriana Barraza and Gustavo Sánchez Parra. It is the first movie in I?árritu's trilogy of death, and was followed by 21 Grams and Babel. It is an anthology film, sometimes referred to as the "Mexican Pulp Fiction", containing three distinct stories which are connected by a car accident in Mexico City. Each of the three tales is also a reflection on the cruelty of humans toward animals and each other, showing how they may live dark or even hideous lives.It was written by Guillermo Arriaga.In the story,Octavio is sharing an apartment with his brother, which leads to a serious problem when he falls in love with Susanna, his sister-in-law. Octavio and Susanna want to run away together, but Octavio has no money. He does, however, know a man who stages dog fights, and he volunteers his dog Cofi for the next round of fights. Cofi bravely rises to the occasion, but the dog's success in the ring leads to a violent altercation. Elsewhere, Daniel, a successful publishing magnate, leaves his family to take up with a beautiful model, Valeria. Valeria, however, soon loses a leg in an auto accident, and as Daniel tends to her needs, her tiny pet dog gets trapped under the floorboards of their apartment. And finally, El Chivo is an elderly homeless man who is trying to contact his daughter, whom he hasn't seen in years. Desperate for money, El Chivo is hired by a businessman to assassinate his partner; however, as he's following his target, he's interrupted by an auto accident, from which Octavio and his injured dog stagger in search of help. The film was a great directorial debut from director Alexandro Gonzalez Inarritu. It was compelling and absorbing from start to finish for the screenplay presents the following:a hyper-violent movie against violence; a graphic portrayal of infidelity in the name of marriage; and a tale of murderous sibling rivalry in the name of family.Also,it shows shows a deep understanding of people as well as a truly cinematic storytelling technique and brilliantly choreographed fight and chase scenes.Aside from that,the cast performed brilliantly and excellently.In other words,this Mexican epic works at all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inaaritu's masterful beginning to his trilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Written by: Guillermo Arriaga Jordan, Starring: Emilio Echevarria, Gael Garcia Bernal, Goya Toledo, Alvaro Guerrero, Vanessa Bauche, Jorge Salinas.Inarritu's breakthrough feature detailing the lives of three people that become intertwined in Mexico City each connected with their dogs. A helpless romantic and street thug (Bernal) gets into the business of dog fighting. A supermodel (Toledo)'s pooch gets stuck under the floorboards of the apartment she shares with her lover and a hit-man (Echevarria) rescues a rotweiler while completing his newest assignment.The best part about the picture is how well Inarritu and Arriaga show the stories and how each effects the next or the previously mentioned. They connect the stories loosely without getting the characters too associated with each other, henceforth showing us the irony of life connections. They bring the characters together in an intricate way that confuses us because of its simplicity. Inarritu points out that we overthink a lot and the way he brings everything together with the intricacy he does is something that is left out of Hollywood films.Each of the characters is written in a manner that brings them to light in a way that does not expose neither hero nor villain. Echevarria's character can easily be interpreted as a villain at first glance but his sentimental reactions to certain situations make us think about it more in depth. Toledo's character is the most normal and seems to have normal problems, which makes her a protagonist in some eyes, but her flaws are too many and her character is clingy and gets annoying. Bernal's character is a street punk involved in dog fighting and gang violence, but his reasons are out of love for a girl.There is no hero and there is no villain, that is what gives the film its dynamite. There is something to love and something to hate about each character. Who we side with is not important because each character has something to add to our own set of moral values. The grittiness and the violence likely will not appeal to everyone, but Inarritu is a respectful director who understands the life of his characters and their situations but does not judge them. He respectfully leaves that for us to decide and does not contradict any of his well-established credibility.</fullReview>

I sure had no idea. But this film just grabbed me by the throat and pulled me in for the full story (or stories). El Chivo is incredible, Octavio is incredible... the model (Valeria) is just average (she is rather annoying) but the god that goes underground to fight the rats is wonderful.I need to see the movie a second time to see how everything ties together.

		<shortDescription>THISP376 Film review for Amores Perros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Valeria Amaya is a famous, successful working model. In the horrific car accident that ties the three stories together, she sustains an injury to her leg that requires constant use of a wheelchair, extensive physical therapy and a scar-inducing leg brace. Upon receiving the stunning phone call that her large modeling contract had been canceled, Valeria's entire image that she had worked so long to build was figuratively, as well as literally removed (the billboard outside her apartment was taken down).Her contract was not only her income, but it also represented who she was as a public figure as well as her self image and self worth. Without her modeling career, she lost what she perceived as her purpose in life. Before the accident, Valeria's image was seen everywhere, like on the cover of magazines, television, and billboard advertisements. She was a tabloid fixture with a public facade to portray and sell, the "model" life.Daniel, her lover, bought into her image like the public and Valeria herself; he paid for it by leaving his family and purchasing an apartment that was out of his price range. Once the contract was gone, the value he saw in the relationship vanished with her paycheck. Her beauty was a large selling point, and once her leg was injured she became damaged goods in his eyes.As a whole, Daniel and Valeria's story symbolizes the inherent faults that lie within a consumerist culture. One's material possessions and physical appearance equal self worth, and that in itself is problematic. The theme of this particular story in the film shows that letting consumerism run one's life, and the culture as a whole, creates a dystopic, throwaway society. Looks are fleeting, and material possessions aren't what is important in life. One should invest in meaningful relationships not based on appearances. Valeria and Daniel are a lesson to the viewers that if a relationship lacks a substantial connection, it is bound to crumble once the passion and money run out. The film is a commentary on the state of Mexico, and possibly the entire consumerist world today.</fullReview>

The three micro-stories (Octavio and Susana, Daniel and Valeria, El Chivo y Maru) are all connected by a single car crash, but it takes the whole movie to piece together the puzzle of how they are all connected. I think that the reason I like this movie so much is the raw emotion that is portrayed. It is definitely not an easy one to watch, and at times I had to close my eyes because I simply couldn't stand the images that flooded the screen, but I couldn't stop watching. It's just so real ? the love, the frustrations, the disappointment, the small moments of happiness. Even with all the unfortunate events, the film doesn't leave you empty or depressed. I'm not quite sure why, but there is a sense that yes, life and love are difficult, but that it is okay to struggle and hurt and cry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores perros" brilliantly winds three utterly different stories together in a complex and fascinating masterpiece of a film. Three individual stories are all developed thoroughly with great attention to detail. Where the stories intersect is, ironically, is a street intersection with a violent car crash that shakes up the lives of multiple individuals. Octavio, Valeria, and El Chivo are the centers of each perspective story, all of whom's lives are shaken up by the car accident. Each life tells the story of an impossible love that is hindered in some way by hurt, lies, deceit and passion. The impossibility only swells or is brought to life after the accident when their "love" is exposed, vulnerable and uncertain. Acting is impeccable; viewers will be on edge for all 154 minutes of the film. Editing is superb; fast cuts and contrasts of colors bring to light the constant battle for a peace and equilibrium that cannot exist: they just remain contrasted. This movie is a must-see for its artistic achievements in story and presentation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom does a movie come along that is so mind bogglingly great that it makes you just want to stand up and shout to the world how incredible the cinematic experience you just witnessed was. Amores Perros is one of those films. It's a Spanish film from auteur director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and it intertwines three stories, all with themes of love and loss. The three stories connect through a horrific car crash that changes the lives of all the characters permanently. The first story is about Octavio who is obsessed with his sister-in-law Susana. He wants to run away with her so he enters his dog into the dog fighting arena to raise the money. The second story is about supermodel Valeria who has just moved in to a new apartment with her lover, Daniel. Her story opens with the car crash, and we witness her difficult physical and mental deterioration. The third story is about El Chivo, an assassin who cares for Octavio's dog that was wounded in the crash. Chivo is on a quest to put his life back in order by setting things straight with the daughter he abandoned so many years ago. All three stories are equally excellent in their construction and despite the film clocking in at 2 and a half hours, you never want it to end.This is a truly beautiful film. It is harsh and it is brutal, but it really makes you feel. You develop a sincere connection to these characters, and watching their stories unfold is moving, as well as gut wrenching at times. Too often the themes of love are sugarcoated and beautified for no discernible reason other than to please the viewer. In Amores Perros, love is expressed just as brutally as any other darker theme would be. It makes this film much more believable and much more memorable than your typical romance. This is evident even in the films title which translates to "Love's a bitch" in English.It's always amazing when such harsh and violent characters are portrayed on screen, but you grow so close to them all the same. The characters in this film are murderers, gamblers, and thugs, yet they are all connected through their love for someone or something, which makes them all so human. They aren't ideal humans in any way, but they are realistic, believable, and compelling. We are also treated to a great diversity in this film as far as characters are concerned. The characters span the social classes, from rich upper class, to poorer middle class, to the homeless. This makes each story very different in content, but thematically they are the same.If you're a dog person you should still see this movie, but be weary. Dogs are a central part of this film, which is appropriate seeing as they are one of the most loyal and loving creatures on the planet. But I already said this film is brutal, and dogs are part of the reason why. There are some grotesque depictions of dog violence that will make you shudder, as well as tug violently on your heart strings. Love in its purest form comes from dogs, and they teach the characters in this film many things about life whether they know it or not. Being a dog lover I had a difficult time with this film, but none of the violence is meaningless and it all furthers the strong thematic points of the film. The violence is brutal and tear jerking, but also very important.Just to make the film even better, Inarritu directs his debut film in a very sincere stylistic way. The film is not sugarcoated in any way, and the direction makes that clear. The direction is fast paced, brutal, and chaotic. But it is also masterfully done with a lot of respect towards the subject matter taking place on the screen. The direction is consistent in its in your face punchy style that keeps the film incredibly exciting no matter what is going on. This whole film feels so real and so human in every brutal way possible. It's something absolutely incredible, and not something we see enough of in film. The film is in no way exploitive. In fact it is just the opposite. It's a film with a meaning, a purpose, and a lot of feeling.Amores Perros is simply unforgettable. It is an intense and passionate movie experience with a beautiful array of fascinating characters that all go through such harrowing and gripping events. This is an incredible film. There's no two ways about it. It is stunning in its aesthetic wonder as well as its thematic significance and its brutally compelling storyline. See this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros is not Inarritu's best effort. But then, Mexican filmmaking is still an experience to behold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the shining lights of 21st century independent cinema, Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's debut picture, Amores Perros, packs a solid punch. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and winning numerous plaudits in film festivals around the globe, Amores Perros is a unique picture that is presented non-linearly and has three sub-stories that are inextricably linked in the wake of a terrible car accident.The three sub-stories have a resounding theme, one that homes in on the relationships between people and dogs, and juxtaposing it with the relationships amongst people. The title Amores Perros is loosely translated as 'love's a bitch', an apt title considering the content of the film. Here, 'love's a bitch' can mean 'dog-loving' or that 'loving someone is unpleasant'. Both are relevant in this context. The screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga Jordan may seem incoherent at first but as the film plays on, viewers will gradually get the big picture.Two-thirds into Amores Perros will probably leave most viewers amazed at what Jordan and Inarritu are trying to attempt; the three seemingly unrelated stories that are connected to each other are done with such consummate skill that it's like three pictures rolling into one. The quick-cut editing and lots of close-up shots of people make Amores Perros a gritty and in-your-face piece of filmmaking. The music used is minimal (a hallmark of Gustavo Santaolalla's score which consists mostly of the solo strumming of a guitar), though the sudden input of modern Spanish song-and-dance tracks might be too intrusive for some. Amores Perros is vulgar both in terms of language used as well as from the copious amounts of violence and gore observed, especially when it is inflicted on dogs by dogs. Any animal lover is advised to stay away from Amores Perros although the filmmakers have repeatedly stressed that no animals were harmed during filming. If there's a flaw to the picture, it will be its long runtime of 150-plus minutes. And it is also one of the reasons Inarritu's next two pictures, 21 Grams and Babel, are more concise and better conceptualized within a shorter runtime. It's a rousing debut, though Amores Perros is not Inarritu's best effort (21 Grams remains my personal favorite of the trio). But then, Mexican filmmaking is still an experience to behold.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film as open-ended and enigmatic as its title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a three-vignette film that's not so much concerned about creating a harmonic epiphany among its three plot lines, but rather it aims for compelling stories with a brutally honest portrayal of life, love, sin and redemption. Getting a unified message out of the film is about as difficult as translating its title. Literally translated the title doesn't make much sense, but "amores" translates to loved ones or while "perros" literally means dogs but is also an obvious pejorative for lowly people such as criminals. The title can also be broken into "Amor es Perros" which means "Love's a Bitch." All of these are fitting for the film and their multitude is appropriate considering the open- ended nature of the truths the film preaches.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga give us three stories from Mexico City that are biblical in nature, each named for the two focal characters of the given story. All the stories deal with violence in some way, crime, love and lastly, each has a vital connection to dogs. Each story is as complicated as human beings ought to be portrayed in film. The characters are people of great love and passion, but with great capacity for error and sin. The dogs in their lives serve as instigators of conflict, distractions, sources of comfort and more, taking the emotion of these difficult stories to the next level."Octavio y Susana" is about Susana, a young married woman with a baby who lives with her abusive criminal husband, Ramiro, and her brother-in-law Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal), who keeps asking her to run away with him. Octavio trains the family dog, Cofi, to fight and wins money that he uses to support her and convince her to leave Ramiro."Valeria y Daniel" is about a supermodel, Valeria, who is having an affair with Daniel, a businessman married with children. Daniel buys them an apartment announcing he's leaving his wife when a horrible car accident caused by the characters of the first story puts Valeria in a wheelchair. Both the incident and the disappearance of their dog, Ritchie, under the floorboards of the apartment tears at their relationship."El Chivo y Maru" is given to us in bits and pieces throughout the first two but eventually gets its own focus at the end. El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) is the film's most complicated character. Seen in the beginning as a homeless man with a half dozen dogs who also doubles as an assassin, we learn that he left his wife and daughter to be a guerrilla fighter and landed in prison for 20 years, at which point he wanted his daughter to believe he was dead. After he was let out, the man who captured him gave him a place to stay and employed him as an assassin. During the story he tries to carry out a job while gathering the courage to see his daughter again.The summaries might be long, but grasping the compelling circumstances, complication and depth of each story is essential to understanding what "Amores Perros" is trying to do. The stories are meant to show us the many facets of life and human nature. The film is not trying to find that one common denominator, but the several. We're supposed to experience internally somehow that connection that makes all of the film's difficult stories clear, not be lectured on it by the filmmakers."Amores Perros" is not a film for people looking for cathartic satisfaction from movies. There is no moment of feeling "at one" with the film or that pleasant feeling when you feel all the loose ends are tied up. It's also one that animal-lovers should be careful with. There's a lot of suggested animal violence -- dogs that appear to be bloody and or dying. It's a tragic and beautiful (in the literary sense) comparison to the brutality of human nature in the film, but it's not one that's easy to handle.Most people, however, will appreciate the great storytelling and intensely interesting characters and events in this 2.5-hour film.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores perros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very shocking but at the same astounding. It gives it audience an inside view of the corruption and the life's of different people that live in Mexico. The translation of the title Amores perro's would be funny which is dogs love but then again translated in a different meaning it would be Life's a bitch. Very interesting title one would think. I feel like the movie is not only about how life a bitch but through several characters in the film but we get to experience how people in different classes live. If you actually pay attention closely, all the characters, in the film have dogs, as pets. Which, to me, tells me, why perhaps the tile is what it is AMORES PERROS. A dog's life is pretty simple but compare to a persons, it complicated and I feel like having both together it helps balance out each other out. Even though each of the characters has a certain problem, they always have their dogs to which they turn to comfort. Another thing I noticed was that even though the dogs were never in the best conditions, they never turn against their owners. Although like people they turn against their own kind, which make it another main plot in the film. Throughout the movie we see how these characters, instead of turning to their love ones in tough circumstance, they stab each other in the back, and for example Octavio falls for Susan his brother wife and then turn against him. Secondly Valeria falls for a man that is taken and he return against his wife and children. Finally we have Chivo who paid to kill a business man whom later we discover that his own brother is who wants him dead. We live in a world where people have no limit to their own selfishness to achieve one own personal goal. However, what makes this film even more mesmerizing is how each of these characters interacts with the others life somehow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie all-around!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is the best Mexican film I have ever seen. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (director) very successfully takes the three different stories of Octavio, Daniel, and El Chivo and creates one single movie that is coherent, and consistent through the end. He and writer Guillermo Arriaga, along with incredible acting performances, show how the character's lives in Mexico City society are all interconnected in some way and the 'common struggle' they all face between love, loss, pain, passion, death, and finding redemption.The movie is shot using a hand-held camera that adds a documentary style to it and makes you feel like a part of the movie. The cinematography and editing style for each of the three stories is very different and sets the tone for them. Octavio's (lower class) scenes are fast paced and shot up close that gets you really involved and puts you in his world where crime, betrayal, and darkness surrounds you. Daniel and Valeria's (upper class) scenes are slow, tranquil, clean, bright, portraying sophistication and 'high society.' El Chivo's (poor/solitude) scenes are shot mostly from a distance and are usually very quiet which gives his character an element of mystery. These visual contrasts give the movie life and carry with it the socioeconomic contrasts of life in Mexico City, and its vibe is present during the entire movie since it was filmed on location.The movie starts out at the center of how all of the main characters are interconnected through an intense car crash and then flashes backwards and forwards throughout the movie telling each of the three stories in a very methodical way that keeps you engaged."Amores Perros" plays on its clever title by capturing all the intricacies of love, both good and bad, and its affect on humanity. Love is complex no matter the age, gender, or socioeconomic class. The value and price of love and life in Mexico City takes on the persona of each character and their dog adding more and more meaning to "Amores Perros." In the end, they become what they lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros ( Life's a Bitch ) is a brilliantly made Mexican film by director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. In a similar Pulp Fiction style directing, the movie is made up of three different stories that link the characters together without knowing who each other are. The film is about three different stories that deal with people from all different kinds of backgrounds. The first story is about young guy named Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who gets involved with the underworld of dog fighting to make money to win the heart of his brother's wife. The second story is about a white collared man Daniel (Avaro Guerrero) who leaves his wife and two daughters for a beautiful supermodel (Goya Toledo). The third story is about a former college teacher (Emilio Echevaria) who left his wife and daughter to become a guerrilla fighter who later becomes a bum that makes his living as a hit man. In the aftermath, all of these stories reveal a strong message about the certain choices that people make in life that will lead to consequences. The director is not afraid to touch on issues that deals with the realities of life such as pain and suffering as it lives up to the movie's title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, violence and dogs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins frantically with a healthy dose of jump cuts, unknowingly presenting the climax of the story and showing how the main characters from each three stories loosely interact briefly in the film. It's not their relationship with each other that's important; instead it's a violent aspect of love and canine parallelism that links Octavio, Valeria and El Chivo.Octavio represents the machismo in Mexican culture. Like his dog, Cofi, he's unpredictable and violent. The love presented in his story with Susanna is the pursuit of love set in a low socio-economic class in which violent acts serves as a source of income. Valeria, a high class model, represents artificial love - a love airbrushed and manipulated by the media. Much like her trapped dog under the floorboards, she too is trapped by both a social construct of beauty and to her reliance of a wheelchair. El Chivo, the abandoning middle class father turned isolated and elder hit man, represents the absence of love and struggle to obtain it once again. His story is ripe with another social subtext, corruption. It's a corrupt police officer that introduces clients who wish to have someone murdered. Like his dogs, he's disheveled looking, wandering aimlessly pushing a cart around the city.Many of the shots were above the shoulder and zoomed in on the actor's faces. I think this did two things after establishing the setting and differences such as socio-economic backgrounds; it showed the importance of the characters in relation to their setting and intensified the love/violence connection. This humanism is again expanded upon by the camera technique which looked hand-held and wandering, adding also to the realism.I think Alejandro González I?árritu created the film to explore and present the violent associations of love and does so brilliantly by infusing social subtext, a kind of Cinema Novo, which contributed to the mise-en-scene of gritty realism in each shot. In the end, the connected violent aspect of love is set on a course of redemption thanks to Chivo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three lives effected by a car accident</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros, directed by Alejandro González I?árritu, starts off with the a car chase and a bleeding dog in the back of the car, which from the start you can understand that dogs are a main point in this movie. Immediately after the establishing scene and pace of the movie, I?árritu introduces who the main characters are and how they are tied together through different vantage points of the car crash. This movie dives into the culture of the city life of Mexico and its culture by telling the story of Octavio and Susanna, where you get a feel of physical abuse, woman having to take care of their children on their own, and a rivalry between family members. The telling of Octavio's story portrays how economically bad his family is off, where his brother is working but can barely afford to take care of Susanna. Also how Octavio falls into the dog fighting world just to make money for a forbidden love, and causes the car accident that sets the whole plot into motion.Once I?árritu shows how the car accident happened, he goes into showing who is effected, like Valeria and Danielle; a story of infidelity and a failing new relationship, through frustrations of a lost dog and a car accident that ultimately leaves a super model with one leg.Then El Chivo is introduced through out the movie during both stories of Octavio and Valeria, and is portrayed as a bum who seems to have a hidden motive once he assassinates a business man. Being a Father and husband who left his family like Danielle, only for the reasons to be a guerilla and fight for the left wing. You see his remorse for his decision through out the movie as he attends a funeral, and breaks into his daughters house. Amores Perros does a great job in showing Mexico's people and how tough and unfair life can be. To the point where you have no other options then to rob the wrong bank, speed through the wrong red light, and take in the wrong dog</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros - Life is hard no matter who you are</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros", which literally translated means "Tough Loves" or "Love is a Bitch" is a play on words in my opinion. The term "perro" although it literally means dog, in Mexico it is used to depict a tough situation or to describe a ruthless person. This is a reoccurring theme throughout the movie as every character faces corrupt people or difficult situations which give the audience a sense that at least in the movie story, life is indeed a bitch. The intertwining of this "life is tough" theme with the inclusion of dogs in every story is how the title becomes so meaningful and such a creative and artistic definition of the movie itself.The movie portrays three different stories, seemingly unrelated until the scene of the car crash. In each story the theme is one of love and human relations, but not typical "happy ending" kind of relations. There is infidelity, domestic violence, money problems, and treason within the relationships portrayed in the movie. As the director explains in the short "Making of Amores Perros", this movie shows that everybody encounters suffering; the rich, the powerful, the poor and even the famous hurt.The plot of the movie is quite complex, and with each scene the director gives the viewer a little more information but always retaining some key elements. This provokes the undivided attention of the viewer as this is not a movie you can watch casually. The way the stories link together via the car accident is excellent, not only in the context of the plot, but also in the filming techniques and the different points of view (POV) utilized to film that scene. The film utilizes very artistic and unique filming techniques, from the scenes in which the POV is that of the dog, Cofi, to the hand-held camera shots that make the movie feel more "real".I highly recommend this movie because of the complex and entertaining plot, the great acting by the entire cast, the innovative filming techniques, and perhaps most importantly, because it paints a very accurate picture of the complexities of life in Mexico City.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Amores Perros" a.k.a. "Love's a Bitch"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" (2000), directed by Alejandro González I?árritu, acknowledges violence, corruption, guilt, and relationships, not only in Mexico City, but throughout the world. This film's theme circles around broken relationships and love's infinite battle occurring in all social classes, thus the title "Amores Perros." From the beginning of the movie, we see Octavio's love for his brother's (Ramiro) wife, Susana, and his struggle to have her. Then, we meet Valeria and Daniel. Daniel, having cheated on his wife, is with Valeria who is a model, but when she gets in a car wreck, we understand how superficial their relationship was. Finally, we meet El Chivo who left his wife, career, and daughter to be a guerrilla. However, he feels guilty of his actions and wants to be the person he used to be. What is a common factor in these relationships? They all end in disappointment, leaving the message that "life, or love, isn't fair," it's just plain difficult.Dogs also play a monumental role in this film because they represent their owners. When Richie gets lost, Valeria's relationship with Daniel and her career go downhill. Cofi represents who he is with at the time. For example, he represents Octavio's sporadic punch in Ramiro's face as well as El Chivo's murderous actions. These are both represented when Cofi kills all of El Chivo's dogs. Also, the dogs tend to pull out the emotional side of each character at some point in the film, and they tie each story together.The audience for this film is international, since most adults can relate to it, and mature because of it's violence and complex storyline. The director does an amazing to collage these lives together by using jump cuts, a fast paced filming style, and scene repetitions. The use of natural lighting and a hand-held camera gives the film it's realistic appearance. Also, the music in "Amores Perros" tends to fit the event or emotion displayed on screen, such as heavy rhythms to anticipate violent events. "Amores Perros," with it's exceptional and eye-opening storyline, displays utter perfection in Latin American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent for a first time movie director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a first time director of a movie, Innaritu does an excellent artistic job of portraying greed and cruelty. He used some interesting point of view shots. The first example of this is the car chase. The scene is filmed from the point of view of a passenger in Octavio's car, making the viewer feel like they are being chased too. Another example is in the initial dog fight scene. This scene is shot from the point of view of a dog being walked into the arena. We see the blood all over the floor, dogs in crates, dogs with blood on them, and a dead dog being dragged away. Yet another example is in El Chivo's bedroom after Cofi has killed all of his dogs. We see him view the picture of his daughter on the wall from his point of view laying on his bed.Innaritu also keeps the viewer engaged through lack of continuity, revealing some pieces of the story and leaving others for later. The lives of the characters are intertwined through the original car crash. There is an overall theme of cruelty and violence. For example El Chivo is a hit man, killing for money. Octavio treats his dog cruelly by fighting him and opening up the possibility of the dog being severely hurt or killed. Greed is another theme portrayed through Daniel and Valeria, and also Octavio. Daniel has everything he could want, a wife and two daughters and a well paying job. That isn't enough for him; he must have the younger more beautiful woman, Valeria and leaves his wife and girls for her. Daniel and Valeria's relationship is full of fighting and conflict due to Valeria being in a wheelchair with a broken leg and losing Richie under the floorboards. Octavio has all the money he needs to go away with Susana and the baby but he can't resist the urge to fight Cofi one last time for a big win. His greed costs him his best friend, his dog, and Susana. In a way El Chivo is greedy too. He had everything he could want as well, a wife and a daughter. As a result he lost his wife and daughter, went to jail for many years and was lonely for the rest of his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alejandro González I?árritu a master of tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should Alejandro González I?árritu by now, either by watching Naomi Watts' boobs or watching Brad Pitt breaking into tears. But you may still not know him enough until you see Amores Perros.Basically, the movie's title is translated into "Love is a female dog" in Mandarin. But what captured the audiences is the ultra-sad tone of the whole movie. The social disease that infects all of us was portrayed so realistically that one could easily reject to see it a second time. Humans in the desperate status are the main subjects of this study. Although "love" is referred mainly to the love between a man and a woman, and most of the movie's story lines are about this type of love, it went a lot further. For two brothers, it's the beautiful woman that tore them apart. The love and desire for this woman had made them enemies to each other. In the end, one is dead, the other is crippled, all because they wanted to win the woman's heart so desperately. Witnessing all this is their dog Goofy, which was considered a perfect fighting dog...The other story lines all follow this pattern, portraying different miserable circumstances for lovers, friends and families. In one particular storyline, a rich businessman abandoned his family for a model, who had injured her leg and had to be amputated. Before the condition got worse, the businessman didn't really try to find the missing dog, as all things were already messed up between the one he loved and himself. Later the model was sent to ER, and he finally had the determination to find the missing dog. Ironically, within 3 minutes, he found the dog and cried so hard holding that dog, as if regretting all the miserable things he did...... All these portrait were so insightful and easy to connect. There were basically no definite conclusions in some of the story lines. Like in Babel, the characters got passed their impasse with a scar, but the misery won't stop so easily.It's hard to swallow. Not a little bit hard or too hard, but just hard. For anyone above 20, it would be very close to the facts in the life he or she leads. No matter which social class you're in, which role you played(Father, mother, lover, child...)you can't be immune to the tragedies and pains like in the movie. That's the point of it.But, it's not all that negative. In some certain ways, it can be very inspiring and educating. P. T. Anderson also have a touch like this. In Magnolia, Anderson wanted to tell us "You need to be better to me." But in Amores Perros, the director wanted to tell us we need to reflect on our motivation, our means and our deeds. Doing something in the name of Love doesn't make you safer or more righteous. We may need to do a lot more than that.</fullReview>

The stories tie together better than any other movie with similar formulas. It's all so well done, even the acting. AMAZING job by Emilio Echevarria as El Chivo. One of the most complex characters I've ever witnessed in film or TV. I think it was the best performance of the year internationally, he could have been nominated for so much even an Oscar. The rich husband and wife plot was so extreme and interestingly dramatic. And not to mention the first hour just grabs you by the neck and doesn't let go. The movie has it all, almost every aspect I love in film. It has fallen into one of my favorite movies ever. I was amazed bottom line.

		<shortDescription>Love IS a Bitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The English title for Amores perros is "Love is a Bitch," and indeed that's the central theme here in Alejandro González I?árritu mosaic masterwork. Inarritu has created a film that interweaves several different characters on the harsh and brutal streets of Mexico City to create a gut-wrenching look at love, life, death, and redemption.Amores perros follows several unique individuals from all across the social ladder. The first is Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who has a hopeless crush on his sister in law Susana (Vanessa Bauche). Octavio enters the world of illegal dogfighting with hopes of making enough money so that one day he and Susana can run off. The second story tells of Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) a magazine editor who ditches is family for a beautiful, yet disturbed supermodel named Valeria (Goya Toledo). When she gets into a car accident and her dog is lost in the floorboards of their apartment, it soon becomes apparent that their relationship is getting strained. The final story tells of an ex-guerrilla El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) who takes care of a wounded dog while planning an assassination and trying to connect with his estranged daughter.What interests Inarritu are his characters, and it shows here. Amores perros is a thoroughly character driven story with overtones of pain and sorrow. What works here is that Inarritu allows the emotions and themes to play out low key and naturally, they're not shoved in your face or overdone. The main point of interest in the film is the relationships between the characters; these are relationships that feel real. The most interesting for me were the relationship between Octavio and Susana and the relationship between El Chivo, the dog, and his daughter. The Octavio and Susana is the most engaging to watch, but the El Chivo story is the most artistically satisfying as it manages to create a complex, emotional story using little dialog. The weakest story was the one between Daniel and Valeria. Daniel's back-story, unlike the other characters, is never fully fleshed out, we're only given glimpses of his married life, and these scenes do not explain much about why he would want to leave. Plus he comes off as an obnoxious prick instead of a full three-dimensional character. Valeria on the other hand is a thoroughly engaging character who doesn't need to have a fleshed out story; the audience understands what she's going through and why. Despite some flaws, Amores perros carries a powerful story that grabs you and never lets up for two and a half hours.The acting is as expected superb; the actors do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. My favorite actor was Emilio Echevarria who plays El Chivo. Since his story is one with little dialog, it's amazing to watch how he carries himself using facial expressions. There's one scene where he sneaks into his daughters house and steals a picture, this is a scene that doesn't require words, just facial expression, as the pain and loneliness of Echevarria's character just seeps through. The next best actors were Gael Garcia Bernal and Vanessa Bauche who played Octavio and Susana. The make the relationship between the two feel convincing, because they act like real people instead getting all starry eyed and overacting. The weakest link is once again Alvaro Guerrero who plays Daniel. His performance is great, but because of the limited range of emotions of his character we never get to see him do much. Overall Amores perros is a film that boasts a great cast giving some fantastic performances.Aesthetically, Amores perros is shot in a very gritty style lending to the urban setting of the film. Inarritu is a director who knows how to use color to his advantage, and Amores perros makes great use of color to give an added boost to the gritty and melancholy atmosphere. This is one of those films where you could turn off all the sound (well subtitles to be exact) and still enjoy what was going on, because Inarritu has created such a visual masterpiece. Like any great director though, Inarritu understands how to mix visuals with sound, and early on in the film there are some well-done musical montages set to Mexican rock and later on the Rolling Stones. The montages are handled well because they correspond well with the soundtrack to give a nice feeling to it all. Amores perros really is an aesthetic masterpiece.By now you've gotten the idea, Amores perros is a masterpiece and one that needs to be rented right now. It's a film for anyone who loves well drawn characters and thought provoking themes. I have yet to see 21 Grams or Babel, the other two films in Inarritu's "Death Trilogy," but after seeing what he is capable of they've moved to a high spot in my Netflix queue. Amores perros is a beautiful, if flawed masterpiece.4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros by Alejandro Gonzalez Iniarritu combines three stories with a car crash. The first is the story of a young man Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is in love with his brother's wife, Susana. He uses their dog for fighting to earn money and run away with her. This sounds seedy except for the fact that his brother is no good and abuses her. The second is of Daniel, a television producer who leaves his wife for Valeria a beautiful young actress. They move into an apartment across from a billboard of Valeria. The third story follows El Chivo who appears to be a poor street person but actually murders for a living. He is hired to kill a man's brother.These three stories combine in a car crash, which is shown from each of the stories three different perspectives. The segments are shown in consecutive order with occasionally a scene from a different segment. In the first third, the main story is Octavio and Susana. The second (and probably the most hollow) is Daniel and Valeria and the third is El Chivo and Maru. Unfortunately, the screen time is too long and with that the El Chivo story suffers. By the time the most touching story of the film comes into full fruition, it's difficult to sit through the exposition scenes after almost an hour and a half. Also, some parts of the film do seem a bit uneven. However, the best part of the films is the characters relationships with dogs. The humanity of all of the characters is best shown within the relationships of their dogs. Octavio constantly argues with each other about who is the owner of their dog. The majority of the story between Daniel and Valeria revolves around their dog Ritchie who has fallen through a hole in the floor. El Chivo nurses Octavio's dog after the accident. Iniarritu's style when it comes to films could be compared to Quentin Tarantino particularly with the graphic violence. He also shows a talent and an incredible ambition for balancing stories and characters of various dispositions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3 distinct parts in Amores Perros are loosely intertwined. The protagonists of any given story just happen to walk by the ones in the 2 other parts. It's all about their coincidental lives in Mexico City, what really binds it all is the theme, about unfulfilled lives at different ages. Life with the opportunity to make money and settle with a girl, life as a married man settling with his mistress and life as an old man with regrets, lots of love and disdain he didn't actually decided what to do with.The only flaw I could find in this movie is thus the fact those 3 stories are not really related. It's more 3 separated stories than three chapter making a full-fledged tale. Now I?árritu shoots all this wonderfully, everything is so well tuned-in, accurately acted and edited together, that you can't but be fascinated by the flow of images and the variety of emotions they come to display.Did I?árritu topped himself with Amores Perros? 21 Grams and Babel also explore and (over)use the possibilities of disjointed story lines. What's more, pathos became THE emotion to put behind the shop window, so on the whole it looks like a lot of talent going on the cheap and easy ploy, instead of trying harder to give us better and better movies each time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sonata of Savagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whereas Magnolia could be described as a symphony of human hardship and frailty ending in an emotional catharsis, this is more like a sonata in three parts, each with a completely different tone and tempo, but all sharing some common ground.The first movement is about a guy who craves his brother's wife, so he uses his dog to make money in dog fights so he can support and run away with her. His brother is a wildly unstable criminal, and he crosses paths with some angry people in the dog-fighting underworld as well.The flaw with this section is that everybody is so animalistic and savage, you don't care what happens with any of them.In this movement, the dog kills to support a human's love.The second movement features a man who leaves his family for a super-model, but when she has an accident and deteriorates, it snaps the superficial bonds between them.The flaw here is that once again, you don't care much for such superficial, empty people.In this movement, a man puts his priorities back in order after a near fatality, symbolized by his finally attempting to save a dog trapped and dying under his floorboards.The third movement tells the tale of a crusty extremist revolutionary, now a wino-cum-hired assassin who longs for his family and daughter again.This is by far the best episode with immense depth of character and deserves to be in its own movie.In this movement, a killer dog mirrors the man's ruined, violent life and awakens him to find redemption and humanity again.The much talked about Pulp Fiction-like structure is used very well, showing us a God-like view of a pivotal accident and how it changes lives both before and after the event.Summary: Both intensely fascinating and unsatisfying, more authentic than Magnolia but not as cohesive. A mixed bag.Side note: It's depressing to see how so many people can watch violent movies where humans get abused and killed, and suddenly get squeamish when dogs are 'abused' using special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must Love Dogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I loved Babel, and to see Alejandro González I?árritu's first feature film (long before Crash stole the story) was amazing.It was an early film for Gael García Bernal (Babel, Bad Education, The Crime of Father Amaro) also. He played a key role here.This film is actually three stories locked together by a single crash. It is a film about rich and poor - about class. It shows the underbelly of Mexican society: those who fight dogs for money. It is painful to see in that regard as it features many dead animals. But, the fact that some have to resort to this to survive is also painful.It also show the creme of Mexican society: a top model (Goya Toledo) who is also in the crash. her life revolves around beauty, which leads to a superficiality and breaking up a marriage. Her dog gets trapped under a floor and this leads to tragic consequences for her.Emilio Echevarría (Babel, Y tu mamá también) plays both sides. He was from the creme of society, but gave up his family and wealth to become a guerrilla, as he felt that was doing what was right for them. Now, losing everything, he roams the streets with his dogs.The theme of riches and poverty, and family is strong in this film as is, of course, the love of dogs. It is all interwoven in a film that never bores you. I?árritu is a master of storytelling.</fullReview>

Same with "los ilegales", even when this one its not a feature to compare against Amores Perros, the first one remind me the other. Their CONTRAST between good and bad, black and white, dirt and clean, RICH and POOR, immigrant or not immigrant, human or animal seems to be not from this earth. They have just push Mexico momentarily upward in the cinema rat race, but Hollywood its always the lead and Amores perros is and will be a cinema LANDMARK.It doesn't matter where you from or what culture you belong too, Amores Perros will root into your inside. Will make you feel, taste and experience a loaned life, where we are all in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing movie from the streets of Mexico. It combines three different stories which connectin a way. This is a film not for dog lovers, but for Tarantino fans. It has pure violence and gore, but unfortunately the dog fights don't show "much" and what I mean by that is that every time 2 dogs fight we only see the moment they attack each other, which lasts around 5 secs. The three stories are very well written, with strong language and a lot of blood. I put amores perros an 8/10 because of the unfinished dog fight scenes and also because a rottweiler.... even if its very well trained.. cannot beat and kill a dog fighting champion pitbull! Not a chance guys. ha-ha. Overall it is a great film to watch and own.</fullReview>

One hopes for some good to come out of it, and the second that happens, something goes wrong. This is life truly at it's worst. Myself, not being bilingual, making it very difficult to understand without subtitles, was very confused at the title itself. My thought was puppy love, but I was extremely wrong. Life's a bitch has everything the majority of people look for in a movie. Other then the sad endings to each story, even the retired assassin who takes care of dogs had a sad ending with the death of all 4 or 5 of his.

		<shortDescription>Animal cruelty, really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't add any comments on the plot, symbolism, or the director's style...those points have been debated and covered quite well already here. I do have a question/comment for those people who say they were turned off of the movie by the simulated animal cruelty (none were harmed of course). Have you ever seen a movie where people fought one another? Perhaps for the entertainment of other people who gathered to watch? Rocky sound familiar? Maybe Raging Bull? Let's put this in perspective folks...it is legal to pay to see people beat the hell out of each other (boxing, ultimate fighting) and bet on it, but illegal to do that with animals in most places (as it should be, I am an animal lover too). The difference in watching a movie with boxing and a movie with dog fighting is that we are somewhat immune to humans fighting while we probably have not seen as many dog fights. So the impact of the dog fights in Amores Perros is a bit more shocking. It should not, however, be a reason to avoid this excellent movie. Maybe it is good to consider why the impact of the dying dogs in this movie is as dramatic (or more so) than some of the human deaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An outstanding debut from Mexican director Alejandro González I?árritu, the impassioned Amores Perros splices together three interlocking stories which cut the across the class divides of contemporary Mexico City'Love's A Bitch' is the title's English translation, and this visceral drama is all about love's terrifying fragility, its destructiveness, and the pain its loss entails, as well as the redemption it can offer us in the bleakest of circumstances. There's already been controversy about the involvement of real animals in the dog-fight sequences - but the dogs are also used as a symbols of human cruelty, suffering and affection, revealing something fundamental about their owners' characters. A fatal car crash, which opens the film, links its trio of tales. Part one, with its frenetic hand-held camera-work and jagged cutting, involves unemployed teenager Octavio (Bernal), who dreams of running away with his sister-in-law Susana (Bauche). He becomes involved in the underground dog-fighting scene, where his pet Rottweiler Cofi turns out to be a lethal contestant. Cofi is shot by a rival handler, whom Octavio stabs, precipitating the deadly high-speed chase through the city.The second section charts the deteriorating relationship between a married magazine editor and a beautiful fashion model Valeria (Toledo), who is left seriously injured in the collision with Octavio's car on the day the couple set up home together. Meanwhile in the final segment, a former left-wing terrorist turned hit man El Chivo (Chevarria) wanders the streets, picking up stray mongrels, which is how he finds the dying Cofi amid the automobile wreckage. Given its tripartite structure, dark humour and scenes of scalding violence, Amores Perros has, unsurprisingly, attracted comparisons to Pulp Fiction. But it's actually a richer, more humane work, in which the tyro director displays an impressive command of the medium - confidently shifting between styles and genres - as well as a commendable compassion for his fellow human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploring the tough side of life on Mexico City. - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu has introduced a different perspective of life to the viewers; the consequences of tempting fate "make God laugh and tell him you're plans" are shown throughout the film and with flawless ability. Innaritu has shown that he can blend his Catholic beliefs into a modern film while keeping the entertainment flowing. The cunning script has blended brutality with love and to perfection at the least. This kind of work has not been seen since Tarantino through the mixed sequences; starting with the incident that is explored again in a more compelling and vivid manner. To be frank this film was long but for the sole reason to allow you to appreciate the characters more intimately. Each specific character is analyzed in their emotions and actions to allow you to feel their pain as they suffer, if minimal time was spent on these people then this film would have no soul. The filming of the dog fighting is brutal and harsh on the viewer as these two animals tear each other apart and it seems very much legitimate, whether it is or not I don't know. This then compliments the love throughout the film; El Chivo with his adored dogs eventually killed and Valeria's dog Ritchie whom she loves. Gael Garcia Bernal is superb playing the young free spirited Octavio and Emilio Echevarria is sublime and for me steals the plaudits. This film intelligently interweaves between varied characters and reminiscent scenarios are not shown systematically, which may seem too complex for a basic story, though instead produces a more interesting storyline. You find out how three people are directly involved with each other in drastic circumstances. Subtitled this film is but to fully gain the understanding of the characters their dialect must be heard. I recommend this film to lovers of foreign Cinema as it boasts all the necessary antidotes to create a masterful film of technically brilliant filmwork along with a very clever storyboard.Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's SO MUCH to get out of this movie. I've seen it at least 10 times, and will likely end up buying it. The three stories collide in a beautiful way, finally letting the intelligent viewer who's been trying to piece it all together let the bits fall into place. You are drawn into the stories of the different characters, really feeling and believing that these are real stories. It's one of those great movies that makes you want to see it again and again because you keep getting more out of it the next time around, unlike most Hollywood schlock. The little stories within the big stories are also captivating to the viewer and help to illustrate the personalities of the 3 main characters. I don't want to give it away, because I hate it when people do that, so I'll say no more. Simply: if you saw it and didn't like it; see it again. I bet you'll enjoy it more the second time around.

		<shortDescription>Nice film that's certainly worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't as blown away by this film as some other people, but still I think this was a pretty nice film. It has three stories that are connected by a car accident and I will review and rate them separately.The first story is about a guy who's in love with his sister in law and fights dogfights to earn money to take her away from his brother who abuses her. She however sees nothing in his plans. It's very well acted and depressing. You really feel the depression of poverty and unanswered love. However I thought the main characters were a little too far from my bed to really identify with. Some witty dialogue may have prevented this, but in this part you don't see any intelligent characters (except perhaps the guy with the cool Escher T-shirt, but he plays a very minor role, so I wouldn't know). I give this part 7/10.The second story was really boring and I didn't like it at all. A guy left his wife and children to live with a model. Then the drama comes: they lose their dog under the floor and she gets into a car crash and loses her beauty by it. A lot of time is lost on this silly problem of getting the stupid dog out under the floor. There are a few interesting scenes, but on the whole this part isn't deep at all. 5/10 for this part.The third part however is really brilliant and makes up for the whole film. It's about a hitman who lives on the streets. In younger years he was a terrorist who wanted to change the system by blowing up buildings and killing police officers. Now he just kills rich people for money. I won't give away the end but I'm really glad this was the last part, because that way the feeling of the last scenes will stick with you the longest. 9/10 for the beautiful conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying: dog lovers be warned - this movie will probably be very upsetting to you! That said, the film enumerates three stories, all connected by a violent car accident, and loosely connected by a broad common theme: love. We have the capricious love of a young man, the desperate love of a tried and confused young woman, a dispassionate universe's assault on the spouting romance between a beautiful model and an advertising executive, and the attempt of an ex-guerrila to resituate himself in his daughter's life.The stories are all quite enthralling and the acting is top-shelf. Having placed my due praise, I found myself bereaved when the credits began trickling down the screen, as the edification, profound commentary on the film's general theme, or meaningful lesson, all or some of which I thought to be lurking just around the bend, never materialized. Very entertaining but far from a masterpiece.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogs and love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a lot of praise about "Amores Perros" I finally managed to see it. And....... it certainly didn't disappoint. Although not completely in the groundbreaking-classic ballpark some reviewers were quick to award, it contains more than enough passion, inspiration and underlying insightful observations to deserve a strong recommendation.Much like Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction", another auteur (along with Luis Bunuel) Inaruttu noticeably borrows from, "Amores Perros" is split in three stories that briefly, unexpectedly and unaware of each other connect through a single event - horrific car crash on a Mexico City street.Appropriately, considering the movie's title, dogs play important parts in lives of the protagonists of each story. Further fittingly, love is another thing giving them trouble. From enthusiastic Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who hatches a plan to run away with his hothead abusive brother Ramiro's (Marco Perez) young bride Susana (Vanessa Bauche) using funds he obtained by entering family dog Cofi in illegal fights, over to slick magazine editor Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who abandons his wife and kids to be with a young professional model Valeria (Goya Toledo) and her beloved dog Ritchie, and ending with 'El Chivo' (Emilio Echevarria), a gruesome looking squatter with a pack of dogs in tow who was a onetime guerilla and is now supplementing his income by killing for money while trying to reconnect with the daughter he left many years ago...these are all richly observed, authentic, slice-of-life tales.Without visual or emotional sweetener, we're allowed to look at the world these people inhabit. Invariably one will recognize plenty of Inarrutu's cinematic influences, two of whom I mentioned already. Still, this is a very authentic work by a great director. Cleverly vivid imagery (hole in the floor, things bubbling underneath the surface), punch-in-the-gut style, uncompromising treatment of characters.... are just a few of the things making "Amores Perros" a very worthwhile experience at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grade A world cinema, but not for the squeamish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A major traffic accident connects three sets of diverse lives in modern day Mexico City.Life is rough and tough on the streets of Mexico City and you have to do what you have to do to get by. Sometimes dogs are the only friends you have. Even life for those that have made it is no bed of roses.This film is violent, crudely sexual, vulgar, sweaty, cramped and focuses on people that you are glad you are only encountering on the big/small screen; but ultimately it overcomes all its self-made handicaps by being so cleverly made and acted. Indeed you feel you are watching life itself.(A heated-up and condensed version of life itself - but true nevertheless.)Director Inarritu a has clearly been watching modern classics such as Pulp Fiction and Traffic, but thankfully has also seen Accident, from which he borrows certain structures and devices. Indeed the real brilliance of the film comes in the way that what you think you have people tagged, and then find that you haven't quite got it right.The problem with world cinema is that it often plays the game of dumping the ingredients in the stewpot and letting the audience put together the meal themselves. Here we have structure and purpose. Indeed this is the best structured film I have seen in years - I love the way it unfolds. Even the use of music - from a wide range of sources - seems spot on.(I found the story of the model and her lost dog to be equally as valid as the rest of the story and provided relief from the darker elements.)Despite its length, there is no real spare fat on the bone and, if anything, the film gets stronger as it works towards its climax - which is both smart and cinematic. I recommend this film to anyone that wants to see serious adult cinema in a unique setting. The dog fighting scenes are quite tough and if they were faked, then they were faked very well. I found them very hard to watch and they probably go on too long - we would get the message by cutting them in half. Nevertheless a modern classic and proof that cinema still can deliver surprises from the most unlikely quarters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Amores Perros" at the Toronto Film Festival, and I thought it was really good. In the question period the director said a number of interesting things.Emilio Echevarría, who played the old, dirty guy living on the street, is a businessman who takes roles that interest him when he feels like it. He took his role in "Amores Perros" seriously, and went to business meetings with the long hair and fingernails that he grew to look the part. I hope he at least washed his nails, he looked pretty grungy on screen.The director said he spent 5 years looking at locations and going over the screenplay as he got the financing together. I think this is one of the things that distinguish it from typical Hollywood movies, no last minute plot changes and reshoots because of comments from the test audience. Not that Hollywood chaos is always bad, it works when the people involved are good, as in "Casablanca."No animals were harmed in the making of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And the reply? "God can laugh, but I still have my plans."Is God laughing at the characters in "Amorres Perros?" They all fail in love, don't they? Octavio loves his brother Ramiro's wife, but does he confuse love and sex? Daniel leaves his wife and daughters for the shallow model Valeria. Chiva, the revolutionary failed miserably, and regretted leaving his family... Gustavo who would pay to have his half brother murdered... Dogs tie the characters, and the scenes of the movie together.It's violent, bloody and emotional. It was hard to watch, especially at first. The car crash is very realistic, and they don't skimp on blood. If you love dogs, then the fight scenes are difficult. But they are staged, I believe that, and I saw the short clips where they explain how they staged those scenes.It's a very good movie, and it differs in the realism and the violence, from most American movies. If you aren't afraid of reading subtitles, then the movie is very easy to follow and understand. Comparisons won't do justice to "Amores Perros," but its style is similar to "Pulp Fiction," especially the scene in the beginning with all the blood in the car, the car crash itself, the inter-relation of the scenes and seemingly unrelated characters, and finally the use of music. But nowhere does "Amores Perros" try to be as cool as "Pulp Fiction." I say give it a chance, know what you are getting into, and accept the movie as fiction and the violence as staged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, to all those naysayers: If you fail to recognize this beautiful piece of art, then perhaps you should stick to Hollywood emptiness.The brilliance of this film lies in its multi-layered richness, profoundness, ambiguity, implications, and comparisons. Film is art and art does not require a lucent interpretation. This film can mean so many different things to so many different people, that one is forced to recognize it for that simple script structure only. Then, after that, the cinematography, editing, and acting was mastery at its finest. As a lover of film as a form of art, I cannot deny that this is my favorite movie I've seen to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS"Amores perros" is a very dark movie. A friend of mine said that he felt good after watching this, because the movie would deliver a lot of optimism. After having watched it myself I have to say that I cannot agree with that at all. Actually, the second third of the movie in which Richie, the dog, is desperately looked for, is somehow funny at times, still there is not the least spark of optimism to be found. Every character in this story is cursed to fail. Their wishes and their dreams vanish into nothing. In the end everyone is facing an abyss.SPOILERS END HEREI can't give enough credit to this sort of independent cinema. It's so important that movies like this one are being made. Little things bothered me though. I thought it wasn't necessary that the stories were connected to each other. The film also got a little too long in the end. Well, that's just how i felt about it, though. Objectively one must rate "Amores perros" 10/10 points. For the reasons mentioned above, I'll only rate it 7/10 points anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Foreign cinema nowadays can be a gamble. In the past, people knew they could rely on foreign cinema to get themselves away from the sappy, formulaic industry that is Hollywood. Recently, however, foreign directors have realized that more money can be made with high-action, low-plot types of films (This is something American directors have known and cashed in on for years). The prospect of Amores Perros excited me, however. From what I had heard of it, the movie seemed fresh and original. Throw in the fact that the director (Alejandro Inarritu) is a rookie to the big screen, and I was ecstatic. But it is the fact that Inarritu is a rookie which ultimately hurts the film, and keeps it from being the first great movie of the 21st century.Perros is told a la Pulp Fiction or Traffic. That is, Perros consists of three stories that tie themselves together in the end. This method of film making has become such a cliché, but it can be done if the director succeeds in making each story equally interesting. Unfortunately, Amores Perros starts with a bang, but its final two stories drag on while the viewer struggles to stay awake.The first story of the film is, to say the least, brilliant. It revolves around a young man named Octavio (Gael Bernal) who enters the bizarre world of dog-fighting so he can earn enough money to run away with his abusive brother's wife and child. Things, however, do not go exactly as expected, as the dog-fighting goes terribly wrong, and Octavio's dream of running away is crushed.As far as the first story goes, Inarritu did not wrong. In fact, it's easy to say that this segment of the film is flawlessly executed. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the acting and the lighting all come together to create quite a spectacle. The fact that Inarritu chose to use this segment first was really a poor decision. When it ends, I was left looking for something at or around the same caliber, and I was greatly disappointed with what came next.The second story concerns a model named Valeria (Goya Toledo) living with a her boyfriend who left his wife just to be with her. The beginning of the story is intriguing, as I wasn't really sure what to expect next. Though at first the couple is joyous, Valeria and her boyfriend's lives fall apart after Valeria suffers a tragic accident which causes her to lose her leg and modeling career.The ironic coincidence is that when the two lovers' lives begin to fall apart, the movie takes a turn for the worst as well. Instead of the entertaining and fast paced love thriller Amores Perros had been to this point, I was now treated to a obnoxiously slow and boring tale of a degenerative relationship. All this time, the couples' dog is trapped beneath the floor of their apartment. Quite honestly, I was hoping that this second story was just a sick director's joke, and that at any moment the segment would stop, and story one would pick up again.Story three is, well, better, but that's not saying much. The story revolves around a `mysterious' man who gave up his family and life to become a rebel. His rebel days behind him, the man (Emilio Echevarria) is now a bum/assassin for hire who walks around with a pack of dogs. During a `job' the man rediscovers his former self, and realizes what a grave mistake he had made by leaving his family.The third story had vast potential, I will admit that. But it's clear that the director did not try to develop this man's character for a sort of mysterious effect. But I found that I knew so little about the character, that I really couldn't care less what his fate was.As a whole, Amores Perros stacks up to be a slightly above average movie. It runs simply far too long, and it does not focus enough on the first story, which is the only thing really carrying the film. But hey, it was a rookie mistake, and director Innaritu has a long and promising career ahead of him.My Rating: 3 Stars Out of Five.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Linking the three stories here is a spectacular and bloody car crash, where one vehicle is broadsided at an intersection by a car doing about 60. One person dies immediately and two others are seriously wounded -- except for a little white dog. Even though the dog is leaning out the window on the impact side of the struck car, he is COMPLETELY UNHURT! That's because he is key to the movie's second story, "Daniel and Valeria" and a dead or busted up dog ain't gonna work. In the wreck sequence the dog's sole purpose is to, by yapping, briefly draw our attention to the derelict El Chivo and his dogs on the sidewalk, but the screenwriter and director could have accomplished this connection in plenty of other ways with the dog out of the scene entirely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all started with a dog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Inarritu's "Amores perros" was the opening film of a film festival held here a few months back.There was a good number of filmgoers who attended, but the film actually started late (about 7:45 pm, from the supposed-to-be 7:00 pm---it was alright, for I also came in late).The film ran for about two-and-a-half hours, but there was never a single moment where I felt my eyes to be already asking for one good snooze.This Oscar-nominee for Best Foreign-Language Film is so powerful, so moving and so gritty that to divert your attention from it even for a few seconds would be a big mistake (the Academy Award jurors had already committed one by giving the "bald man" to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"). In essence, "Amores perros" contains three stories;though the characters (there are two brothers who become rivals for the love of one woman;there is an ad model who suddenly loses her "market value" because of an accident;and there is an unkempt and odd hitman who is abandoned by his family) move within the same urban landscape, they in fact have nothing to do with one another---they appear as total strangers to each other as is common in a cityscape.They have their own stories to tell---except for that fatal car accident at a city intersection which becomes their "common fate." That accident was actually "triggered" by the dog owned by one of the brothers (Octavio), as he and his friend were on a rush to bring it to the hospital after it was shot during a dogfight. The fateful incident brings each of the characters to a re-examination and readjustment of their lives, making decisions that, whether they intended the outcome or not, would ultimately help them in finding meaning in themselves and their situation:for Octavio, that an adulterous love can't really go through, even if the feelings are sincere and affectionate---what can be of help for the moment is to live on one's own;for the model (Valeria), that the value of one's being can't be measured in terms of the glitter and glamour of a commercial and material enterprise, for they're only momentary and superficial---what can really mold her being is the love and companionship offered by the man closest to her;and for the hitman (El Chivo), that the fatherly love he can show to his only daughter is his one remaining redemption. And this, while they are all affectionately tied to their dogs! A non-linear narrative, an alert and nervous hand-held camerawork, a gritty photography, a well-written script and first-rate performances---plus the dogs---all these serve the film well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I think I see where Liddle is coming from on one or two points, I think she takes herself way too seriously and overstates the case for political commentary. Seems to me that just about every artist coming out of South America has been raised on a shield on the grounds that their art was the voicebox for their generation's political angst. I prefer to believe that in parts of the world that are hotbeds for activism - and specifically where there is a dense population with a marked class divide, all those qualities that are picked out as deliberate efforts to make a political statement are actually just part of the social geography. We might wonder at the abjection during the first story and rue its contrast to the affluence of the second, but at the end of it all, the characters were all caught in circumstances that had little to do with politics and almost everything to do with emotional consequences. Amores Perros wasn't making a point, in my opinion, it was just telling three different stories about tough love in Mexico and linking them and telling them very cleverly. Loved It.</fullReview>

We move between the very different lives and worlds of the characters with such ease. The connections between the stories are so clever and subtle and yet nothing seems self-conscious or heavy handed about the shifts in focus. Aspects of the film are brutal and violent and yet it contains such beauty and honesty that we are drawn in and care about the characters on screen. A very fine film indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bitchin' Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Mexican film, apparently set in the state of Pueblo, tells three modern stories of life in a nation and world where money increasingly serves as the arbiter of `success.' The threads involve such disparate elements as dog-fighting, bank robbery, high-fashion modeling, magazine editing, and daytime TV. These are tied together by dogs, a high-speed car crash, and the character of El Chivo, a former Marxist guerilla who abandoned an upper middle class existence to fight the grimy war for social justice, but ultimately had to settle for the occasional contract hit on a member of the capitalist elite. Amores Perros is translated on screen as "Love's a Bitch," but the title is also a homonym of "Amor Esperas," roughly "Love Hopes." This must be intentional, but I found little honest hopefulness in this film. Whether in the barrio or uptown, we are presented a relentlessly dog-eat-dog world seldom touched by elevating elements like religion, art, or family celebrations. It is a world of diversions, such as sex, television, renting a movie, or buying a new car. Ever-present dogs alternately comfort or snatch up the remains (when they're not killing each other).The acting is uniformly excellent, and the film's gritty feel and directorial style follow a path blazed by Steven Soderbergh -- most impressive for first-time director Alejandro Gonzales I?árritu. One place where inexperience manifests is the film's length -- it didn't have to be 2.5 hours long. Otherwise, if you can stand more than a bit of violence -- and the bloody aftermath of violence with the (faked) dog-fighting -- this is a beautifully rendered and sobering view of human relations in a desperately poor country at the start of the New Millenium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before this film-making stint, "El Negro" (both, González I?árritu's nickname and the way "El Chivo" decides to name the rottweiler at the end of the film) has been known as a highly successful radio DJ and an accomplished publicist in Mexico. Both parts of his life reflect onto this story, with private jokes for the advertising industry and musical references to his radio times (e.g. "Lucha de Gigantes" by Spanish 80's band Nacha Pop during the love scene and end credits).The film itself is of an impeccable technical standard and a visual appeal that achieves its goal: firstly to shock, and then to catch the attention of the spectator through the length of the film (although the model's story almost ends up sabotaging this).I wish I hadn't known Alejandro's works from the past so I could look at "Amores Perros" without bias. Unfortunately I can't, so I can only say that this movie is the product of a great mind and be advised that there still is plenty of excellent stuff where this came from.</fullReview>

This is not exactly the type of movie younger viewers should see because it is very high in the swearing and it has some adult scenes.

It was the first time I've seen a film quite like this and when I realised there were going to be sub-titles I was a bit disappointed. I'd never watched a film with sub-titles before. Despite this, I found the film thoroughly enjoyable for the most part. In parts it is shockingly violent and yet is full of dark humour. The acting was great and some of the camera work was pretty nifty as well. The film is basically in three parts. The first is perhaps the most violent and is probably my favourite. The second is arguably the weakest and yet has a couple of laugh-out moments and is very tragic. The third is very intriguing and basically brings the story together. In conclusion, I would definitely reccommend this film to people who would like to see something gritty, darkly amusing and completely non-Hollywood-like.Rating = 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every Dog Has His Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence of "Amores Perros" instantly hurls you into the adrenaline rush of violence and chaos. Ordinarily, a chase scene comes in the last third of a film, but here it initiates the viewer to the unexpected and uncontrollable world we are about to enter. Octavio, (Gael Garcia Bernal) drives fast and recklessly as Cofi, his dog, lies bleeding in the backseat. Where he is going? We don't know. Who is chasing him? We don't know. After the tremendous impact at the conclusion of the scene, the director, Alejandro Inarritu, takes us back in time to the lives of a poor Mexican family getting by on armed robbery and dog fighting. But this film is not content with telling only one story. Inarritu weaves three main stories all connected by a collision at an intersection. The collision will be replayed again and again, each time showing it's effect on another character in the film. The intersection becomes the place where all disconnected lives converge and change irrevocably. All of the characters own dogs. The dogs are companions, and bread winners. The fight scenes are so gruesome that I had to be reassured at the end that no animals were harmed in the making of this film. Most of the dogs are an outward extension of the hot-blooded volatility exhibited by the men in the film. There are other dogs too, gentle and peripatetic. Unfortunately, the dogs themselves never become characters in the film. Except for Cofi, the other dogs in the film are pretty much indistinguishable. The dogs are integral to the lives of the characters but the emotional connection to them is implied and not explored. The tramp, El Chivo, (Emilio Echevarria) has a pack of mongrels that nip at his tattered heels. Their somewhat predictable fate is lessened because we can't tell one from the other, or exactly how many there are. However, El Chivo is obviously devoted to them and what happens apparently has a cathartic effect on him. His story is long in telling, and he is complex and unsavory. He is a hit man, killing businessmen in a newly emerging capitalist society, who also stalks his long lost daughter. He takes one last job, and the Cain and Abel twist is gleefully ironic. But El Chivo, as interesting as he is, remains remote. If the scene where he invades his daughter's home and leaves a heartfelt message on her answering machine is to be effective, we should see him as something other than a brute. Yes, he loved his dogs, but that in and of itself doesn't make him likeable. Valerie is a beauty and a model, selling perfume on billboards all over town. Her lover has left his wife and two daughters to take up residence with her in a newly acquired apartment with one huge flaw in the floorboards. When her life is shattered by the collision and her beauty is in question her life falls apart, and her lover gradually comes to see the foolishness of his haste to throw away his family. The fate of furry little Richie is ingenius and mirrors the entrapment Valerie feels after her accident. Alejandro Inarritu has made a film that has many lasting images and compelling insights. I wish I could have connected to it on less a visceral and more an emotional level. But it certainly made for a fascinating 153 minutes. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen "Pulp Fiction" (!) &amp; having seen this film only once (last night), &amp; being a cat person rather than a dog person, I still venture to take issue with Alice Liddel (whose comments overall seem on target) on a two small points: (1) "mangy" dogs? How so? The old man was devoted to his dogs &amp; cared for them well. He wasn't going to let THEM get mangy (mange is a skin disease you know, not a figure of speech) even though his personal hygiene habits are non-existent. (2) "In prison for 20 years"? Are we ever told for how long? And how long has he been out of prison? The setting of this movie is 1999 or after (we know from a gravestone inscription), &amp; the Sandanistas (was he really a Sandanista? I caught a reference to Noriega &amp; assumed he was fighting in Panama--was it really El Salvador?) flourished in the '70s &amp; early '80s. Anyway, his daughter was 2 when he left to fight, &amp; she's about 17 now. So the total lapse of time was 15 years--to fight, to be in prison, &amp; to become a fixture of the Mexico City streets.  Not in response to Ms. Liddel but in general, I'm also puzzled by why Octavio's brother would take all the money his wife had saved ("more than enough to support us for 2 years," she said at one point), &amp; still feel the need to rob a bank the same day. (We know it's the same day, because it's the day of the dogfight &amp; the climactic car crash.) Also, he had come home that morning, badly beaten the night before--but we see no evidence of this in the bank robbery scene.  Do such structural discrepancies result from carelessness that the director hopes won't be noticed in the elaborate web of cross-cuttings and flashbacks &amp; flash-forwards?  Also, in terms of motivation, I don't understand why the old man would kill his daughter's stepfather, someone she loved. If he loved her as much as he says, why would he do something so hurtful to her &amp; financially destructive to the family? The only answer that occurs to me is that he wanted to see her mourn a "father," a surrogate for himself. That's why he shows up at the funeral--to see her grief &amp; pretend that it's for him. On the whole, I really liked this old man; he seemed to be the surrogate for God in the movie--so observant, so competent--while invisible to (written off by) the people he is observing so closely.

		<shortDescription>One of the best latin films I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt about it, this is a compelling film, excellently directed. It's hard to be original nowadays, but this manages it with its interwoven narrative. Some may say it's reminiscent of Tarantino, but why not nick from a genius than remain in a predictable three-act structure.A more close-to-the-knuckle portrayal of Mexico than Traffic, quite simply one of the best cinematic experiences this year and unlucky to be up for an oscar at the same time as Crouching tiger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fascinating Riddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off, I have to admit that I don't understand this movie, but I can't stop thinking about it. I know that it is definitely not the Mexican "Pulp Fiction" because this movie does not have Pulp's absurdity, humor, and light touch. Another thing I know is that the director is an absolute master of suspense. And I think I know that there is more here than social/political commentary and that maybe this is a movie about how humans behave. In terms of complexity, this film reminds me of "Yi-Yi" which I personally thought was the best foreign film of 2000 --- at last I have a chance to get MY vote in!!P.S. I believe that the model is oppressed. I mean, no one asked her if she wanted all her stuff moved into a new apartment. She's just another piece of furniture to these guys. Also, some people have written, "Well, how can you let a dog stay under the floor for days??" Well, you can, if the dog belongs to your mistress/fiancee and you don't really like her any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bracingly humanist, indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Mexican foreign film (It was Oscar-nominated, but didn't stand a chance against flying Chinese warriors and the Green Destiny sword), *Amores Perros* tells three tales of love and loss, all connected by a car crash. Thematically, it's pretty depressing, of course, and the stories share common themes of love, loss, and dogs. They all involve dogs, metaphors for the characters in the film and their relationships. Although the stories intertwine loosely, the movie feels like three short films strung together rather than one long movie. Pacing is an issue. It's one of the few movies that I actually think has an issue of pacing rather than being just "slow," like *Eyes Wide Shut*. Another example of a movie with pacing issues is *Screamers*, just so you know. In any case, the film gives you a glimpse of the Mexican underworld, the underbelly of humanity. It is interesting because *Moulin Rouge* celebrates love in all its glory, and then *Amores Perros* comes and illuminates (in a gritty grey brought to us by the shaky camera characteristic of independent film) that sometimes, love and life just ain't that grand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trafficking in stunning views of human frailty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a "Traffic" of urban Mexico. Instead of trafficking in views of a futile drug war, this film is trafficking in stunning views of human frailty. It is engrossing and deeply affective. The dog theme, which loosely ties the three plot lines, is very effective at grounding the grander observations about lust, greed, corruption and fallen idealism. A climactic focal point of all three story lines, a car accident, is at the film's core. "If you want to make Him (God) laugh, make plans." One of the characters delivers this line, a quotation from her grandmother, as though she were also watching the film with the audience. It sent a chill right down my spine. I was aware of the film's length, 153 minutes, but it was an awareness based in feeling full, nearly uncomfortably so. There is much to be taken from the stories and much to observe while the film is running. It is dense and deep. I will see this film again. I am sure there is hidden treasure I missed this first time. I highly recommend this film to the you, if you enjoy making your mind work at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>laboured Mexican Pulp Fiction-type drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen two movies in recent days that have fallen short of my expectations. Both Amores Perros and Audition promised a lot but failed to deliver. I had heard a lot about the dog-fighting scenes in this movie and the questions that arose as to whether the animals were actually harmed. In fact all we saw is a lot of dead dogs being dragged around and snarling animals being held apart - it was relatively easy to envision how it was done. You muzzle the dogs, let them at each other and make lots of quick cuts. Et voila.It did look cool though.The first story involved the dogs and one of their owners. Reasonably interesting. Things started to slow down dramatically in the second and third stories. The third story in itself was not too bad but at that stage the second story had sapped my interest. Question: who is going to let their dog be trapped under their floorboards for days with no food and surrounded by rats? In similar circumstances I'm sure the pitbull/rottweiler owners would have long since torn up the floorboards and these are guys who fight their dogs to the death.In terms of both style and the quality of its acting, this movie is excellent. All in all however, its pretty forgetable stuff and some of the other comments explain why in a more eloquent fashion than I can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing AMORES PERROS I found out that the film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film for the 2001 Oscars. I then came to the conclusion that not only does the Academy screw over the American pictures (I still think TRAFFIC deserved Best Picture than GLADIATOR), but also the Foreign Language Films. I found AMORES to be way better than the popular CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. While CROUCHING TIGER is a feast to the eyes, AMORES PERROS is a feast to the eyes and brain. Many people have asked me on how can I describe this film, it's simple: take PULP FICTION, FIGHT CLUB, and TRAFFIC, and mix it together with a love story and that is AMORES PERROS. AMORES PERROS begins with a car chase that leads to a terrible and deadly accident. There are three major characters involved. One is Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who was the driver of the car that was being chased. The car that got hit was driven by Valeria (Goya Toledo), and a homeless man with several dogs following him called El Chivo "The Goat" (Emilo Echevarria) witnessed the accident. This leads the viewer into the first of three stories. We learn that Octavio lives with his cruel and unfaithful older brother Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) who works as a check-out clerk at a drug store and as a stick-up robber. Daniel is the father and also a husband to Susana (Vanessa Bauche) who Daniel hits once in a while to shut her up. Octavio fell in love with Susana before Daniel even knew her, and Octavio still loves Susana. Octavio learns that his doberman pincher dog is fericious and killed the current champion dog of underground dog fighting. Octavio then plans to make money on his dog fighting and run away from Daniel taking Susana and her child with him. Story two is about a beautiful Spanish supermodel Valeria, who is the most popluar model in Mexico. Three story billboards of her are on display throughout the city. She gets a new apartment with her lover Ramiro (Marco Perez) who runs a fashion magazine. When Valeria was making a trip to a daily errand, she gets hit by Octavio's car, causing her to be confined to a wheelchair. Valeria then gets more scared and worried that being forever in a wheelchair will have Ramiro leave her forever. But to make matters worse, Valeria's dog that she loves so much falls down a hole in the apartment floor tht Valeria accidently made eariler. Valeria cries out for the dog, and all she hears is it's whining cry, Valeria becomes more terrified to learn that there are rats living in the floors of the building. Then finally the third story is of El Chivo, he gets hired by business executive Gustavo (Rodrigo Murray) to kill his step-brother Luis (Jorge Salinas) who cheated him out of millions of pesos. The film shows that El Chivo was once a university professor who then became a gerrila soldier, then a homeless man who takes care of stranded dogs. El Chivo's only wife recently died, and his little girl is all alone. El Chivo then learns that his target, Luis, is dating his daughter. Now El Chivo plans a different outcome than he was hired to do. By the time AMORES PERROS was over, I was applauding in how pleased I was with the film. This was a excellent film that similar to PULP FICTION for over 150 minutes, has the viewer fixated to what is on the screen. And like PULP, the stories all deal with different people in different situations. Like PULP we have, "The Wolf" and Jules being El Chivo. Vincent Vega as Octavio, Mia Wallace as Susana, Marcius Wallace as Daniel, Fabia as Valeria, and Butch as Ramiro. Just take note and watch both films and you can compare the two's similarities. I ejoyed the performances by the three leads (Emilo Echevarria, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Goya Toledo), especially Emilo Echevarria. Echevarria gives a performance that is similar to Harvey Kitel's in PULP FICTION and the weariness of Julies Winfield of Samuel L. Jackson. I can't explain anymore how much excellent this film was! If there is ever a foreign film that is as excellent as DAS BOOT, or THE KILLER it's AMORES PERROS. Just put everything down and go see this film! And after seeing this film, you too will find CROUCHING TIGER to be just o.k. and this film to be brilliant. There is a new foreign director who along with Wolfgang Petersen and John Woo is coming into down to make it big, and his name is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrita. I'm glad to see that Robert Rodregiuez isn't the only excellent Hispanic director making movies. DON'T MISS!!!! ***** (out of five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first frame of this movie one could tell that director of the film has beeen heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino. The film's look and structure is like Pulp fiction, but I believe that that is where the comparison ends. Amores perros is more real and brutal than anything in pulp fiction. The story is real and violent, Tarantino goes for violence, but it is more movie violence. this film has moments that are truly hard to watch,anybody who loves dogs will feel truly appalled at times. The use of dogs in the film is crucial, they play an important part in the films ultimate message. I don't reveal any plot points, one should experience this film not knowing what to expect, all i can say is that it is one of those films that will stay with you long after you leave the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores perros? Sure is!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that if you are in any way a bleeding heart or squeamish when it comes to brutality towards animals, dogs especially, (or just seeing loads of blood) then I suggest that you steer well clear of this film. Although there is a disclaimer saying that no animals were harmed during this film - it's still pretty graphic.This film is heartbreaking in its realism and more than a little "Robert Altman-ish" in its portrayal of 3 stories literally colliding (with a brilliantly executed car chase) and intersecting. The first story is of Octavio and Susana. Octavio discovers the fighting abilities of his brother's rottweiler, Cofi, and starts fighting him - in a bid to raise money to elope with his brother's young wife, Susana.The second story follows Luis and Valeria. Luis leaves his wife and family to set up house with his model girlfriend Valeria, and her beloved dog Richie. Richie chases a ball into a hole in the floor and for much of the remainder of the story can be heard scuttling around the house, or is that just the rats?The third story concerns a former revolutionary El Chivu who abandoned his family years ago and now longs to connect with his estranged daughter. He's a street bum who looks after a pack of dogs and who has become a hitman for hire. The three stories are connected by the car chase and resultant accident. The photography was clever - the use of hand held cameras used to wonderful effect. The stories, each in their own right, are haunting - blowing out of the water, completely, the Hollywood myth of 'happy ever after'. This is a true, gritty and heartbreaking film well worth the watch, and the 2 and a half hour length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crouching Tiger, Hidden WHO???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wow....WOW!!These were the very words I had in my head as the end credits to "Amores Perros" filled the screen. As much as I loved Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", this film should have taken home the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at last month's Academy Awards ceremony. "Amores Perros" is both hugely entertaining and oddly moving. It features great ensemble acting. The performances of Gael Garcia Bernal and Emilio Echevarria really stand out in particular. The handheld camera and the frenetic editing really take the audience into each scene, all the way up to the cathartic ending. Many comparisons have been made of this film to Quentin Tarantino's 1994 hit film "Pulp Fiction" because of its length (153 minutes) and the fact that its three interconnecting storylines each hinge on a jolting event (a car crash and a hold-up at a coffee shop, respectively). This is all pretty accurate, but the comparison ends there. "Amores Perros" is no hip crime drama that self-consciously makes playful references to pop culture. It is, instead, a largely ambitious film that painstakingly weaves its universal themes of fraternal rivalry, sins of the father, cruelty, and redemption into a collage of disparate characters (a young hooligan, a supermodel, and a street vagrant) set against a gritty urban landscape. It succeeds on all fronts, and in flying colors.What makes "Amores Perros" all the more remarkable an achievement is that it is director Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu's FIRST FILM! With a film like this, so ambitious and full of complex existential themes, most first-time directors would be in over their heads. But Innarritu's direction is right on target, and without being vainglorious or "show-offy" in any way. In short, it is a very ambitious movie, but without any vanity on the director's part attached.I really don't want to say anything about the actual plot of "Amores Perros." It is full of surprises and I am very happy that I went into the film knowing very few things about it. I came out of it feeling stunned at what I just saw. This is the first really great film of 2001. I am very certain that it will appear in my top ten list of 2001 at the end of the year. Considering that I see fifty to sixty movies each year on average, that is pretty high praise. What more can I say? Go out and see this knockout film!</fullReview>

The roles were expertly played and the performances transcended the language barrier. Although this film was in spanish, it became a moot point after the first few minutes of action.

		<fullReview>This film is everything Magnolia tried to be but never quite achieved. It has the separate plots intertwining in critical moments, it has the big underlying themes dealing with life, death, and family and has that epic feeling. Only this film does it with coherency, originality, power and on a slightly more modest budget! The director said to a local newspaper here that he gets angry when he hears people compare his film to pulp fiction. He says that this type of plot structure can be traced back to Faulkner. He would rather have his film compared to Kurrasawa's work than Tarantino's. Watching the film and then hearing this interview makes me feel that though this is only the first film by this director, film fans are in for a real treat.. At the end of the film I felt like a (used) punching bag. Much has been said about how intensive this film is but I never expected to be so blown a way. The director's meticulous plot construction, the powerful hyper realistic photography, and the tremendous performances by all of the cast, in my opinion, makes this one of the best debuts I have ever seen and definitely one of the films of the year.

Or the one that talks about the dogs in the film( I know for a fact that the dogs were supervised by qualified trainers in the scenes where they appeared to be harmed or dead. They put the dogs to sleep and then they put some fake blood, and in the scenes of dogs fighting, the director shouted CUT just when he saw the first contact between the dogs, etc ). Anyway, I just want to say that despite all the bad reviews, this film has won a good number of festivals around the world and is nominated for the Golden Globes Awards this year in the Best Foreign Film category, so the important thing about this movie is that it won´t leave you indifferent after you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros is cruel in Artaud's sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some viewers have complained on Amores Perros being excessively violent and even sadistic. I would suggest that the film works within the spirit of Artaud's `Theater of Cruelty'. Amores Perros teaches us that `we are not free, and the sky can still fall on our heads.' It also (hopefully) shakes the viewer's consciousness out of the indifferent stupor most people live in, and which keeps us form doing anything about the endemic violence that is destroying Latin American cities such as México D.F., Bogotá, Buenos Aires and Rio (to mention a handful of the world's metropolises). It belongs to the tradition of Colombia's Rodrigo D, No Futuro, Brazil's Pixiote and Mexico's Los Olvidados. The film is sadistic and cruel, yes, but because there's no other way of depicting the `post-industrial' anomie we face every day.In spite of this, Amores Perros contains some very poetic moments (discussion of the concluding images follows). To me, the last image of El Chivo walking next to his dog towards an ashen landscape evoked Eliot's `Wasteland'. El Chivo's quasi-ritual burning of the killed dogs, his transformation and (failed) attempt at reconciliation with his daughter points to an anti-hero's quest for redemption. To sum up, I find Amores Perros' exploration into the animality of man and the humanity of dog overall inspired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although very well done, the cinema of sadism is objectionable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One could perhaps call the type of cinema thoroughly represented by "Amores Perros" as the cinema of sadism. Yes, the film is very effective, it is deftly acted, photographed and constructed, and most of its production is first rate. The script, with a few slips due to overreach--in this case one might one say overkill--is engaging. Yet, I have artistic objections to a director that sets out, as aggressively as he can, to shock me, and that is monotonous and repetitive in that fierce pursuit. Nowhere does he permit poetic, lyric, or humorous relief to change and modulate the tone. His only other resource is mild melodrama, when the dejected killer cries to his lost daughter over the phone. Not enough, and not by a long shot. Compared to its most famous predecessor, "Los Olvidados" by Luis Bu?uel, "Amores Perros" leaves quite a lot to be desired. Bu?uel could be cruel, but his humor and lyricism were superb. In Latin America, and specially in Colombia, my country, we see blood all the time in television newscasts. Awful things happen here, yes, (as well as in Sweden occasionally), but realism proves in this case to be a bad aesthetic convention. It permits no catharsis. I rated it with a 7. "Los Olvidados" would get a 9 or a 10.</fullReview>

Luckily, this movie is good and original and provocative in its own right. The acting is magnificent, particularly Mr. Echeverria as El Chivo. The cinematography and camera work by Rodrigo Prieto is awesome, the production design by Brigitte Broch perfect, the direction excellent, the music great. Technically dazzling. The animal training is probably the best I've ever seen, unless a lot of dogs died during the making of this movie ;). However, I felt that the writing was a weak spot. It was effective, and in some moments, even inspired, but not particularly rich or nuanced. And if only the episode of Richi the dog would have been shorter... it went on too long. Yet Amores Perros is a richly rewarding experience. Its darkness is extremely refreshing. It has a strong point of view that does not pander to the audience and it sticks with it to the end. The audience may be discomforted by the rawness of this movie but if you stick with it, you will be moved by it. Felicidades Negro!

Although it reminds me of Tarantino at some points, Amores Perros - which is about to be translated as Life's a Bitch for the States - is a superb movie. The main story is about how the lives of three people involved in a spectacular car-crash change due to it. That's it. But then you get introduced to each character, people that you can really find in real life, people that can be you. All production aspects are really pushed to a new edge for mexican cinema, it's almost filmed in the way Darius Khondji does cinematograhy for David Fincher films. This is a great film to watch, ´cause it never intends to be moral, it just puts reality the way it is in Mexico and other countries. And it's very fun too.

Incredible photography and great directing makes this movie a huge leap forward for the mexican film industry.Two elements are constantly played onscreen. How hard relationships can be, the trials and sufferings we all go through, be it between lovers, a father and his daughter or two brothers. And in a lesser degree, dogs. Every character has something to do with mans best friends.Like I mentioned before three main stories are presented, but intertwined in such a manner as to indicate that our actions touch people in what may seem accidental but can affect them in profound ways.What else can I say but congratulate the director and everybody involved in the film for having the strength to make a film such as this.

Never over the top and always genuine. The Spanish speech and subtitles did not bother me at all, and it shouldn't put people off from seeing this movie. The characters are never one-dimensional and the editing keeps the movie at the right pace. Although I do feel the movie could have been more effective with a 15 minute shorter duration.If you like films about life, films that move you and get you thinking, then you will enjoy this film.</fullReview>

The first story, about a man infatuated with his brother's wife, is the most interesting. The middle story is the weakest of the three, but Inarritu generates considerable tension from the simple premise of a dog trapped under the floor board. Although the acting is good all around, the final story features a particularly notable performance by Echevarria as a man who leaves his family to join the revolution and ends up a lonesome hobo.

		<shortDescription>An Absorbing, Gritty, Metaphorical, Relentless, Transitional and Unsettling Drama That Pulls You Into A World Fumed By Rage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogs, known to many as "man's best friend" are loved across the world and act as another household member for many people. Another expression that is often used is "You're no better than an animal", which is one of the crucial metaphors of Amores Perros. The main question Amores Perros asks is "are we any better than animals?" A lot of people think Amores Perros is a film to automatically despise because they suspect animal cruelty (though no animals were harmed) and the film's graphic portrayal of animal cruelty is both excruciatingly realistic and fearfully being an allegory for human violence.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu proves to be one of the most outstanding modern directors in the business. From the deserved critical-acclaim and general success of Amores Perros he's managed to hit main-stream audiences with the excellent 21 Grams. Though it remains no match for the almighty bravo-film-making that is Amores Perros? The film centres on dogs and creates three stories leading up and showing the consequences of a horrific car crash. The film observes and studies people dealing with love, guilt, sorrow, betrayal, anguish, vengeance, poverty, violence and regret. The contrasts between the rich and poor, the parallels between dogs and humans and the general cruelty humans put open one-an-other to gain something they can't grasp. Ultimately the film is a study of the many affects of love and what causes a hatred or violence to develop.The film captures the urban jungle perfectly and visually looks very dark, yet edged with tinges of yellowy light echoing character's facial emotions. Each story holds it's only meaning and own visual style. All three stories work in different ways and varied levels because it helps open up to different character's worlds yet with the added similarities that they're all fighting for love. It's a thrill-ride that does remains reminiscent of very few films baring its raw originality of hardcore, relationship driven drama.The film's gritty style does not except any substitutes as it viscously attacks the viewer with a sharp presence. The almost unflinching camera technique capturing the cruelly embedded imagery fiercely exposing the character's harsh and yet somewhat understandable emotions. You can tell than Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu loves his characters, even in their most despicable moments and the script authentically captures the humane realism needed for the neo-realistic staging. The sense of finding cinematic art in suffering can be held by the viewer, the film's content can always be accepted for the context it needs to be shown with. The film's harsh nature is even there in the title Amores Perros, literally translating to "Love's A Bitch". The film also has some biblical subtext, the fact that the film shows a life fuelled by wrong-doings meets nasty ends.If anybody was to dislike Amores Perros is would be either because they can't handle some of the horrific animal-related imagery or they don't like the film's narrative structure. The film is technically inspiring and the relentless fast-paced filming will not stop from the action-packed opening. The film's acting remains powerful, passionate and the painfully tremendous emotions being flung from every corner of the vivid spectre. Young prodigy Gael Garcia Bernal gives a defining and genuine performance of a tortured soul that had lost innocence in the culture he has been forced into. The heavy Mexican music pumps up the heat in many scenes helping to create the strong sequences of fast and stylistic editing.One of the greatest films to come out of Latin American cinema, a must-see for any film fan. A brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, not amazing and a bit long, but clever, and the acting is superb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Amores Perros has been translated into English as Love's a Bitch, though I might prefer a possible better alternative such as the more literal play on words, 'Loves Dogs', 'Loves the dogs' (as in 'the pits'), or possibly 'Loves Dog' (British slang meaning bad or disgusting).The structure of the film is not a new concept. In cinematic terms it is a portmanteau film in that it consists of several different stories that are all tied together by one event and one theme. The event here is a car accident which we witness at the start of the film, and the theme present throughout the film is that of love.The three stories tell of a youth's love for his brother's wife, a woman's love of herself (although I think anyone would be sympathetic of her situation), and a man's love for his daughter. Though there are many more examples of love within each story.What is original, however, is the way in which the theme of love also revolves around dogs, and the love of dogs and hate of dogs ties the story together as much as the characters' love and hate for each other.The filmography is also very impressive. The chase scene which causes the accident is fast and tense, on numerous occasions the tension becomes quite nerve-racking, and the second story in the film is actually quite scary rather like a horror film.This film is very good, not amazing, but it is clever, and the acting is superb. It has also been criticised for being too long. This, of course, is such a subjective comment because a long film is only long if it feels long to the viewer - and in some cases, as with me and Nirgendwo in Afrika, you don't want a long film to end.Unfortunately, with this film, I did look at the time, and it could have done with being slightly shorter. However, it did allow director Alejandro González I?árritu to later direct the excellent American funded film 21 Grams, and Amores Perros is still a film well worth watching; a film which gives an insight into life and class in Mexico City today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros is not for those with weak stomachs. The movie is relentlessly violent, filled with moments of gut-wrenching gore and power. That said it's also a brilliant movie.Alejandro Gonzalez Inniratu's hold-no-prisoners, in your face style nicely suits the wonderful screenplay by Mexican born Guilermo Arragia. Characters in this movie don't necessarily find the redemption they are looking for but they're journey is nevertheless powerful and stunning.The film basically center's on a group of characters all of whom have fallen in love, lost it or are becoming dissatisfied with it. For example a political hit-man named El Chivo lives like a hermit with his motley gang of dogs. He carries deep emotional baggage and desperately wants to reach out to his estranged family.The movie's script is absolutely flawless although its hard to keep up when we move at such a breakneck speed. That said this truly is one of the best movies of recent years. The ending is especially powerful, and will haunt you till after the credits have rolled.So what more is there to say? Go out and watch this movie! William Friedkin loved it, so why shouldn't you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******************** Fabulous ******************* More fabulous than most films lately. "Crash" tried to imitate it but, despite having won an Oscar, "Crash" fell flat intellectually. Something "Amores Perros" doesn't do. This is not only visually engaging it's mentally stimulating. So if you like movies like "Crash," that are told in a multi-layered format, that engage social and personal questions, then you will like "Amores Perros" even if you generally don't like foreign films, or have little experience with Mexican cinema. As for dogs, animals are always more than what they seem to be, especially in films from Spain and Mexico. And I reply to a recent post when I say that Cofi is no mere Rottweiler; he's an embodiment, a living metaphor. So yes, he can beat a top-of-the-line fighting pit bull. Like in many other "underdog" stories, the winner isn't always the sure-thing. I find it interesting that some people who've posted here don't like the middle story. Why does Valeria and Daniel not speak to them? I found their story to be the most damning of "love."And that's what this movie is, a conceptual story that presents us with fragments of the whole, variations of love and love themes to illuminate and make us think. Let's face it, intellect is a weak point in many movies -but not this one. See for yourself. And then let me know what you think this movie says about love, how and why it's a such a damn "bitch" sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed this well-made film, handcrafted in Mexico, is a wonderfully interwoven tale of acts and consequences. Whether you want to believe in it or not, Alejandro Gonzalez is hell bent to make you see that bad karma is alive and well in society today.This story, which involves three different stories, are all ingeniously connected with one another. And without giving any spoilers, it is important to know that karma is present in all three tales. If you do something bad in your life, you will pay dearly down the road in one way or another.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and not just because the director and I share the same name, but because it was powerful, colorful, and the acting was superb. Above all that the screenplay was one of the best I've seen in a long while.If Love is for the Dogs (as the title suggests), then this critics' tail is wagging for more movies like this. Highly recommendable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film. However, doesn't anyone else notice a close resemblance to Requiem For A Dream?? Good plot, many unique characters, and good relationship issues. The film has a very interesting layout, as the first hour is pure action and dog fighting, then it changes over to a woman that gets injured and is searching for a her pet dog (which becomes annoying after a while) and then finishes off with an old man and his life - very interesting. There is a link between them all, but moreover, it just shows that in life there is more than one thing going on, unlike other films. This film has a similar layout to Requiem for a Dream and the new Crash. One to watch, whether or not you speak Spanish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a dramatic and exciting story that should not missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, and nominated for an Oscar as the best foreign film of 2000, "Love's a bitch", a story of three strangers united by a violent crash and a love for dogs, is a masterpiece. The film is masterpiece, not simply due to its story, but due to the collaboration of cinematic and artistic elements. During the years following the formation of NAFTA, the movie deals with the subjects of a global, Mexican society and of solitary living in the present. This is a dramatic, tragic, and exciting story that should not be missed by any audience.The movie tells the three stories of El Chivo, of Octavio, and of the relationship between Valeria and Daniel, each beginning before the crash and ending soon after it. First, Octavio is introduced to the audience as young man who desires to be with and runaway with his sister-in-law. As luck would have it, Octavio has the opportunity to earn large sums of money with the help of his dog, Cofi, in order to do so. Cofi then wins more than fifteen dogfights for Octavio until he is shot by a jealous rival of his owner. After this moment, Octavio tries to save his dogs life and speeds away in the condemned car. During this story, we are introduced to Daniel. An advertiser, Daniel plans to leave his wife in order to pursue a relationship with an up-and-coming model, Valeria. In the process, we learn that Daniel has given up everything for the romantic affair. Later, El Chivo is introduced to us, an ex-Zapatista revolutionary and supporter, who is now nothing more than a poverty-stricken man in the company of dogs. More so, we quickly learn that El Chivo is now a hit-man who was once a husband and father. All of these stories progress until the moment of the crash.After the violent crash, we learn of the faced perdition of the three lives. Octavio's sister-in-law betrays him and escapes with his earnings from the dog fights, effectively ending the sordid affair. The accident cuts off one of Valeria's legs and causes insufferable tension between her and Daniel. Additionally, as a witness to the crash, El Chivo saves the life of Cofi, who later kills his only company as a poor man, his dogs. Finally, the three become stranded and alone. Octavio, embarrassed, leaves his house due to his betrayal of his sister-in-law. Valeria dies due to complications associated with the loss of her leg, and Daniel loses his family and his lover. Also, El Chivo loses his substitute family in the street dogs. The three are connected as the ultimate victims of life and love.This film receives many merits, not simply due to the three unique stories, but due to the collaboration of artistic and cinematic elements. Inarritu, with many others, create an unbelievable atmosphere surrounding the three unique histories. A chosen mix of rap, jazz, alternative rock, and instrumentals compose the soundtrack. This mix allows the audience to understand the pace of such a grand city, as Mexico City, the velocity of violent and dramatic actions, as well as the spectrum of emotions amongst each of the characters.Likewise, the cinematography has a similar effect for showing the diversity of the situations and actions. Inarritu uses various lenses for creating the atmosphere of distinct areas of the city and in order to explain the different tensions and stresses. In many of the scenes where we see Octavio and El Chivo, the atmosphere is dirty, gritty, and a bit void of color. In scenes with Valeria, all appears clear and pristine. The city appears clean and the sky full of smog, showing the audience the differences between society's classes of people.Nevertheless, these elements cooperate with the story and the performances to create the film. The story is central to the masterpiece. It deals with the theme of a crash as the only means able to touch the life of another in a large city. Through the crash, Inarritu uses the presence of dogs to connect the lives and to accentuate the phrase "love's a bitch." In the end, all of the story's aspects depend on the performances and appearances of the characters. We feel their pain when we see each person lose their happiness. Octavio loses his dog and money because he was preoccupied with a woman who betrayed him.Valeria understands that her career is ended as a model because she no longer appears beautiful, and El Chivo realizes that his former company of street dogs had been serving as his lost family. All characters are transformed into memories of themselves, lost and alone in the world.I recommend this film all who would want to see a masterpiece that combines many styles of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so Mexican film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've talked to a lot of people who have seen this film and loved it, and in all honesty i can see why. It has all the qualities of an independent film with the polished quality of a mainstream film that had a considerable budget to work with. The acting was good (7.5-8), the cinematography was great (8.5), the score and soundtrack was great and really added to the film (9). The story was what really bothered me; it's extremely difficult for me to sympathize with any of the characters because, with the exception of one, all the bad things that happen to the characters happen because of poor, selfish choices that they make. It's a little like Requiem for a Dream in that respect, but it's not quite as fatalistic. I'd give the story a 6. The dialogue is reasonable, but throughout the film i just couldn't bring myself to really care about any of the characters. Overall it's a good movie and definitely worth watching at least once, but i don't think it will be making its way into my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros really does a great job to keep the pace moving and enveloped me immediately. It is gritty and as the director put visceral in it's tension, pacing, and editing. The three tales are seamlessly interwoven, and although I found the 1st and 3rd tales more interesting, they're all inter-related fusing a magnificent series of events.. Even better...I'd thought "Man on Fire" did a good job of showing Mexico City as backdrop and setting, but this outweighs that a good deal. Although the colors often are drab, you can assimilate the dirt and griminess of some of the inner-city - people crowding, trying to co-exist in their own world of problems, creating problems for others in chain reactions. The filmmakers do a great job with moving back in forth in time intermixed along with Characters points of view too. Realistic characters like Octavio add credence. The characters are always at odds with themselves and their surroundings. Although the runtime is well over 2 hours, the movie whizzes by in a great way. Excellent film worthy of ownership. Highly recommended, but not a movie to make you feel wonderful.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's written on the back of the DVD: "Bigger then Pulp Fiction" I saw both films and i am thinking about for 50 years, which one is better.Amores Perros shows the brutality on the streets of Mexico City without much blood. Also the psychological Violence, the doubts of the Characters.The Dogs symbolize the real feelings of the people. Every deed has its source in the savage animal in each of the human. A Study of the different social circumstances, in which every character has its own problems. There's the young guy, who cant see how his older brother treats his wife. He gets the possibility to escape from this misery by making money in dog fights to be able to leave with the girl of his dreams, but he has finally to accept that love has its own rules.The Man who leaves family and children to be together with a Model, which has an awful car accident and has to watch her carrier going down that constantly The old revolutionary man, who left also his family for a life as a guerrilla. He murders for money, lives in a dirty room with lots of dirtier dogs and detects the cruelty of human (First biblical murder )and also wants back to his family.A Very Long Film, sometimes the passages witch the Model and the awful pronounced RIICHIIE is alil bit to long, but what makes this film so great: Different people with different problems cross their ways without knowing and this technically hard scene with the car accident is the melting pot of this three social "layers".Excuse my bad English please :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" (Love's a bitch) is a typical Spanish movie; but more importantly, an intriguing film that can be appreciated around the world. "Amores Perros" has typical Spanish-film themes, specifically, love, violence, and betrayal . While these themes are unraveling, the movie follows five couples as they deal with the hardships of love that they encounter. The couples are all different; economic status, ages, and desires; however, they all are tied together by a terrible car accident. The car accident is in the heart of Mexico City, as each character is dealing with love, violence and betrayal.Mexico City is the capitol of Mexico, and is the most densely populated city in the world. "Amores Perros" solidifies each economic class and their lifestyle differences. Some of the characters in this film have honest jobs, such as "Daniel", but "El Chivo" has a completely opposite job. "Daniel" is a magazine editor, whereas "El Chivo" is an assassin. These characters also solidify Mexico's common stereotypes. Specifically, characters in "Amores Perros" exhibit extreme poverty, sexual, and wooly behavior. Like most Spanish movies, "Amores Perros" is intense. Because the audience follows the lives of five couples and interactions with each other, it is essential that the audience watch with a careful eye. Because the cinematography is complex, the characters are fully developed, and one can get a good impression of Mexico City; however, one must also keep in mind the crime and violence that occurs in densely populated cities. The audience should know that this movie is of a violent nature before watching. This movie features a lot of dog fighting; however, the dogs are not shown fighting, there are bloody and dead dogs shown throughout the film. Cursing and sex are also prevalent throughout the film. These factors make this film great, and give the audience perspective of their own lives, and of those less-fortunate in Mexico City. "Amores Perros" is a great film for entertainment, but it might not be a film of choice to show for educational purposes.Educational movies have historical plots. "Amores Perros" is set in the present day, with present day themes; thus, there were no historical aspects to it. I would not recommend this film for educational purposes as a historical movie. "Amores Perros" is a solid film that presents many different lifestyles, and ties characters together in one event. The problems that accumulate because of the car accident establish the difficulties that love presents. The present day themes, such as dog fighting, do not present any historical facts. As a movie purely for entertainments sake, "Amores Perros" is a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The importance of the pace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look at the backside of your Amores Perros DVD box, before having seen the movie, you think: 'Oh no, this movie lasts for 148 minutes, that is way too long for me.' Nothing is more distant from the truth.The movie indeed lasts for two and a half hours. However, it never becomes boring. It must be said that Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu started his career as a DJ. This fact is candidly reflected in this movie. There is tempo within the movie. It moves on. When it is finished, you do not have the impression that you have been sitting down on that couch of yours for one hundred and fifty minutes.Everyone will agree on the fact that splitting up a story helps increasing the tempo. The movie is split up in three parts. The first part, about Octavio and Susana tells us an emotional, though realistic love story. The second part tells us a love story, a lot different from the first one however. The third part tells us the story about el Chivo, a bum in Mexico City, in whose life love has played an important role as well.Dogs play an important part in all three pieces of the movie, this, in combination with the love explains the title. Amores Perros (=Love Dogs) Along with the nice beat of the music, the separation of the movie into three parts delivers us a very well paced film. Pace becomes more and more important these days, especially for the younger generation. I know there are people who are absolutely not of the opinion that pace is one of the most contributing traits of a film, but it is. This reflects what cinema will be like in the 21st century.9 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What must be said of this superb Mexican film is that it is far superior to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's follow up film '21 Grams'. Combining three separate stories into one horrific car crash we see elements of the script reminiscent of Tarantino. Set on the streets of Mexico City we are given a close look at how three people go about their everyday lives. Octavio (Bernal) is a young man who is in conflict with a a number of people such as his brother and rival dog fighter - the dog fighting scenes are so realistic they must be real. We are shown a young woman named Valeria; she is a beautiful model who is entering into a complex relationship. And finally there is El Chivo 'The Goat', a once lone hit-man for the government. His story is again involved with the heartbreak of love and how he copes with it. Together all three individuals show immense struggle to overcome great adversity and try to resolve their problems that seemingly go on and on. The grittiness of this film complements the compassionate love that smothers each character. An intelligent film, with fast paced Mexican rap (Control Machete) and Nacha pop, which is subtle music of acoustic rock ballad, we find a very intriguing and emotional story. It may seem like a very bleak and cold film but it does have a lot of life, which you should expect from such a populated city as Mexco City. This film is a must see for all fans of foreign cinema, but for those who have not tasted more European cinema then this film will definitely leave the sweetest taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film during the lessons on school. I think the film is really good, it shows the reality of living a a huge city like Mexico City. Maybe , for us it's hard to believe that such things really happen in life, but as you can see in the movie, they do happen! For me , the director of the film has done his work excellent, especially when you know that this is one of his first films ever, he brings everything in screen on a very high level. The only thing that's a bit strange in certain scenes are the flash backs and flash forwards ( this happens especially with the car accident that you see three times, but every time through the eyes of another person) Conclusion: A very good film which is highly recommended to see! On every school they must see this film, and certain bad things in the society of the world.Jens</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A somewhat disturbing film to watch dealing with various aspects of relationships between "human beings" and "human beings" and their "best friends". In this film there are stories of brothers who could kill each other, cheating spouses who betray their vows and a raw insight into the world of dog fighting. I could not help but continuously think of the words "Betrayal" and "Hatred" as every character in the movie seems to betray or has been betrayed by someone else. The acting is superb, the action riveting, and the 'erotic' scenes between brother and brother's wife titillating if not downright sort of "tabooishly engaging". There is more "affection" in this film for the "perros" that survive than for the "human characters" who "make it" to the end of this film.So I asked myself? What is there good about this film...and I sum it up for you in just FOUR word: RAW, REVEALING, REAL AND RIVETING!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent movie that could've been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flaws in Alejandro González I?árritu's Amores perros underscore a major problem in cinema today: the need for complexity and grandeur-not emotional complexity (the only complexity that deserves credit), mind you, just any kind of complexity. The complexity that is most appreciated is plot complexity. A movie with a few characters about issues of every day life is considered an insignificant film by the media. A great film is big: lots of characters, important problems, dozens of interesting locations. How else can you explain why Pulp Fiction-an endlessly complex film in terms of storytelling, but an emotionally empty one-is so hugely popular? How can you explain why a film like Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is considered a more relevant commentary on the war in Iraq than Errol Morris's The Fog of War, a much more complex and thoughtful film about when to engage in war? The reason is that Fahrenheit is on such a large scale; look at the ads: 'From the corridors of power to the streets of small-town America to the front lines!'-it sounds big, it sounds important, or more important than an interview with an old ex-politician in one small room. Does this have any bearing on how provocative Fahrenheit is compared to The Fog of War? Of course not. Anyway, the reason that this affects I?árritu is that he can't simply tell a story about the responsibility it takes to love someone. To make the film more important, he must chop up the plot structure and make it sloppily non-linear. He did the same thing with 21 Grams and it ruined what could've been a good movie. I?árritu is a talented filmmaker, a humanist with good dramatic taste and some effective stories to tell. Why can't he trust his material? Amores perros would be closer to being great if it wasn't so afraid of being good. The time I had to take piecing together the confusingly nonlinear plot cut into my ability to appreciate the characters.The film follows an old hit man (Emilio Echevarría) doing one last job, a young man (Gael García) who has fallen in love with his sadistic brother's wife, and a superstar (Goya Toledo) who lost her dog under the floorboards. All three stories are compelling and the major performances are all great-Emilio Echevarría and Gael García Bernal are particularly excellent-and the dreadfully melancholic score by Gustavo Santaolalla is compelling. Also, there is a car chase scene filmed with an intensity, stemming mainly from skilled sound mixing, that is not matched by any other car chase scene. I'd see the film for the raw materials, even if they were chopped up pretty badly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film title has been translated to "Love's a bitch" in the US edition. Correct as the translation may be, a nice ambiguity of the title, which reflects in plot and style, sadly, is lost. Amores perros means a dog-aficionado. And it means the cruelty that can be conveyed by the means of love, in a desperate, blue sense. As mentioned above, the ambiguity of the title continues in style and plot. In the story, which has been described as non-linear and likened to Pulp Fiction, we will see, after a closer look, that it is perfectly linear.WARNING: possible *SPOILERS* hereafterThe car crash, the film begins with is the pivot of all events to happen. The structure is that clear and appears so loosely that it is hard to imagine how the plot could even be shaped the way it was to produce the outcome we see with Amores Perros. The love-jealousy relationship between Octavio and the wife of his his brother is perfectly aggressive, offensive and fast-paced, so is his treatment of the dog (in the fights) and the overall style and visual quality of the first segment of this Masterpiece of scriptworking and mise-en-scene. Closely after the wounding of the dog (by the thug concurating with Octavio), Octavio himself is harmed in a striking similar way. Without this having happened, the model would not have been hurt and El Chivo would not have gotten the aggressive dog of Octavio, a striking reminiscence of himself. Recognizing the dog under the floor of the apartment as a symbol of the lost relationship between the model and her lover is quite simple, but there's even more. The affection of the man to his wife is mirrored in his treatment and interest in the dog. It's only after she nearly died that he eventually breaks up the floor in order to save him. There are also rats beneath the wooden coverage, symbolizing problems, personal and psychological in nature in the relation and the loneliness of the wife. As the dog is captured beneath the floor, she is captured by her injury in the apartment, as the rats are threatening the dog, ongoing threats by inside and outside factors are spoiling her live. And dog and herself are found wounded by the active (male) part and eventually succeed in recovering. The dogs serve as mirror to the individual characters. El Chivo, as a killer, i.e. made to the killer by the events in his life, finds a dog, which himself is a killer and murders the other dogs in possession of El Chivo. As El Chivo, the dog was made to a killer by his former owner, i.e. Octavio and is merely a representation of his relationship.So, one eager to interpret, might even say, that it's the reflection of Octavio's failed relationship, conveyed by his dog that forces El Chivo into changing and breaking the silence with his daughter. Is it cynic, implying that the eventual fight between the two brothers (the businessmen), who wanted to have each other killed, is pretty much like a dog fight in the beginning? Octavio himself is left broken and lost, since he has lost his dog.The same procedure can be applied on stylistic structure.*SPOILERS* end at this positionOverall, Amores Perros, is a living, vivid and modern form of classic 21st century cinema, not entirely describable or understandable, conveying emotion and desperation, leaving yet hope. It's even better than 21 Gram, the plot isn't far from perfection and the mise-en-scene couldn't be much better. Go and see that one, if you enjoy pure cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The least obvious "character" in this film is the location itself. No other place would do. A façade of decadent modern urban life not unlike that of Los Angeles (including similar cultural and linguistic features).......an underlying set of violent themes paired with parallel expressions of love and longing.......recurrent traces of a fatalistic view of life.......the whole Machismo thing coupled with degrading portraits of women who can't get it together.......the pattern of crooked cops playing both sides against the middle.......and not the least gruesome scenes of dogfights (could have been cockfights, for that matter).In short, all the things we love least about our neighbors to the south. No cheerful Mariachis on this flick.Yet it can be said that this is no more the real Mexico than Hollywood (or South Central L.A., for that matter) is the real U.S.A. But the locale does fit the script nicely, and it comes within an expertly crafted film. In spite of it's being a bit too long, and having a few loose story threads, I liked Amores Perros far more than the disjointed Lynch and Tarantino stuff that also uses non-linear structures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An odd mix of three randomly intertwined tales of love. The first and third are 10's, the middle tale bringing down the overall rating. Exceptional acting, directing, photography and editing. The film has no heroes in the traditional sense, but yet I found myself pulling for characters I ordinarily could not identify with. There was a sense of hope in certain of the misguided players that compelled me to root for their success in even the most wretched of their ventures. Some of the scenes were simply heartbreaking. One scene in particular, (I shall not describe it here, but if you watch the movie, you will know the scene of which I write) though gruesome and sad had my mind darting off down a number of different paths. The parallels between the dog and the man touched off a number of patterns of thought while I was still reeling from the emotion of the scene.Interestingly, I saw Y Tu Mama Tambien the night before Amores Perros, another interesting, though decidedly different film. The thing that struck me about both films was the quality and style of the camera work. Different, I am not entirely certain how, but very pleasing.Well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may not like it, but it's a TERRIFIC film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's a Tarantino's movie wannabe", "Too cruel", "A cheap mexican Pulp Fiction", etc. First time I saw this movie was the day it was first showed nationally. Living in Mexico, I can say I saw it almost before everybody (except maybe the people who saw it at Cannes Festival). I've seen it 4 times at date (2 at the movie theater). And I keep saying the same. It's a GOOD DAMN TERRIFIC MOVIE. Maybe "latin" cultures (people always try to make a difference between people) are a lot different from english-speakers one. But I think this movie is indeed an international masterpiece that can be enjoyed by everybody. I've seen some reviews, and a lot goes straight to the "violence" issue, or the "Dog's cruelty" one. FIRST OF ALL, Mexico is not a cannibal paradise, so it's ABSOLUTELY STUPID to think that the dogs are, indeed, forced to hurt themselves to make it "reallistic". SECOND, THIS IS NOT A COMERCIAL HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. If you watched it and didn´t liked it because you thought so, sorry, but I understand your dissapointment. AMORES PERROS (It's litteral translation isn't "Love's a bitch", but "Cruel love's stories"... a spanish word puzzle) it's not a masterpiece just because it's in a "Foreign language" for non-spanish speakers, but it is because its HUGE EMOTIONAL CONTENT. It's not a movie for cheering you up. It's not a DISNEY'S OPTIMISTIC MOVIE. It's a sad movie, in fact. But it is great because it reflects life. People use to think about a movie as an exagerated and beautiful reflect of life. It's OBVIOUS a Spielberg movies is not a reallistic story about life. Amores Perros isn't, in fact, a documentary. But it reflects the sordid and cruel image of life. And it does it with an absolute precision. I can understand a lot of people could not like it, but say it's a bad movie is to denny a masterful management of opposite emotions, wishes, dreams, and a part of human nature. The three stories reflects a frustrated wish of redemption, but powerfull as almost no movie ever.If you like something else than the typical "hero saves world and gets the chick", you MUST watch this movie. It's not a Tarantino's management of characters and graphic violence (that, in fact, Amores Perros have with plenty), but a psychological violence that, in most cases, it's worse than physical violence. Lots of people in Mexico hated this movie. A lot more loved it. But know you're not going to watch a "happy ending" story, but a very complex masterpiece with a lot of meanings that, without a doubt, will make you think about a lot of things. If you consider a movie like a "spending time stuff", you better watch Spiderman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets progressively more interesting, but the unpleasant nature of the film makes it no fun to watch at all. **1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AMORES PERROS / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)I've never seen a movie like "Amores Perros," and there's good reason for that. Few filmmakers would touch this kind of material, not because of the subject matter-it doesn't cover anything overly controversial-but because it is so dismal. I don't mind movies with depressing themes. "Requiem for a Dream" ranked as my favorite film of 2000. But there's a difference between grim and unpleasant, and this movie is as repulsive as they come.How unpleasant? Because of the film's graphic dogfight scenes, The Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals filed a complaint to the British Board of Film Classification. Now, a disclaimer stating that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie comes at the beginning instead of being buried in the end credits. This is to assure audiences in advance that the dogs aren't tearing each other to shreds.This might be reassuring if the movie wasn't so well made. Movies should convince us of the content, and "Amores Perros" does. The dogfights look so real, the animals might as well be ripping the flesh off each other's backs. We don't want to submit ourselves to such horrific images.Many praised this movie for its relentless audacity and perverse nature. Why? Just because an artist takes risks doesn't mean he deserves acclaim. We all should encourage filmmakers to try new things and explore unique subjects. But sometimes an experiment fails. This is one of those times.The movie opens with a car chase. Two lowlifes dodge heavy traffic, escaping several dangerous thugs. As the passengers shout obscenities, a dog bleeds to death in the back seat. The scene concludes when the driver smashes into another vehicle at high speeds. This accident forever changes the lives of those involved.We cut to a scene where more lowlifes gamble at a dogfight. Their dog tears the other dog to pieces. Soon afterward, we are happy to learn that another dog has killed their beast. What kind of movie evokes this kind of pleasure?Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu inventively structured his film by overlapping and intersecting several narratives. Throughout the 153 minutes (!), we meet the characters who were in the car crash. Although the film does get progressively interesting as each of three scenarios reveal something new about the story as a whole, the gritty nature of the production makes it anything but fun to watch.In English, the title means "Love's a Bitch." This movie doesn't justify those words. It certainly shows the downside (way down) of life, but it wouldn't know love-or emotion in general-if it bit it in the nose. It's about behavior beyond reason. Reaction without impulse. For a movie to portray separation from love, it needs to know what love really is.When two people have sex, it's raw and cold. Yet an uplifting melody fills the soundtrack. "Amores Perros" doesn't know a thing about passion. This director obviously has a big grudge against the world. If filming his aggression helps him work out these issues, that's fine. But why expose the rest of the world to this brutal therapy?Perhaps I'm too hard on the film. It's engaging at points. Its themes gradually take solid form. It's obvious Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a talented, fearless filmmaker. The movie leaves us with a lot to chew on. By the end, we are oddly touched and amazed how everything fits together, but we don't know what to make of it all.</fullReview>

While that is the point of the movie, after a while all of the characters become unlikable.Long before the end of the film, I found that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. This would have better been called "Lust is a Bitch." I didn't see much love here.Well acted, technically superb and also very dark.</fullReview>

Well casted and directed, but I was not prepared for the level of gratuitous, if realistic, violence. If you're a dog lover, the first half hour will be almost unbearable, and will leave you wondering whether all the scenes were staged without loss of life.Some excellent and satisfying scenes and characterizations in the second half of the movie -- which you'll deserve if you survive the first half. A testament to the adaptive, street-wise genius of those caught in a stratum of society that most North Americans don't encounter often, and usually turn their heads from when they do encounter it.Not a film the Mexico City Chamber of Commerce will be promoting. Not a film that I will see again. But YMMV....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LIKE IT OR NOT THIS MOVIE IS OUTSTANDING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros, the directorial debut for Alejandro I?arritu is one outstanding movie. It may be hard to swallow for people who are not aware of some of the cruel realities of our world and people who are bad at reading subtitles. The movie starts fast and exciting and it remains like that throughout. The characters of the three stories may have problems and not be very likeable but like it or not most of us have our imperfections and are not liked by all. The stories are very simple yet compelling. Specially the third one with 'El Chivo'. The violence maybe maybe too much for some but they have to realize that it is not at all exaggerated or glamourized. The fact that the director shows this violence doesn't mean he enjoys it. He is merely using it as the backdrop for our 'love stories' that show the bad aspects of love. The tag line 'If you don't see this movie, don't worry, you'll live it anyway' stands. Unlike some stupid dolt who posted a review here and took the tag line too literally, most of us can recognize the basic dilemas: loving someone else's partner, loving someone who will never love you, being in a superficial relationship, having to leave your family for something that you may know is wrong, trying to fix the world and realizing you can't. If some still don't believe such violence is real, and that people do fight dogs, people do rob banks, stab others, go to guerillas and shed blood by the bucket in fatal car accidents, then read the following example which is directly related to the movie. In an interview, the director told a story about how him and his crew were assaulted by a juvenile gang just outside the house where they held the dogfights who claimed they were filming in their territory. The crew decided to call in security guards who know how to talk to gangs because if they had called the cops, the gang would have killed them and the cops. In the end the guards found out that the gang claimed they where filming in their turf and that all they had to do was ask their permission. The crew asked and the gang granted it, no money down. Maybe in the US and Canada one is not as related with this type of behavior and may be led to believe that the director was just glamourizing. Well, I have lived in Mexico City and I have seen much worse things in the biggest and most violent city in the world. Back to the movie, the story is excellent, the characters may not be likeable but are entirely real, the acting is the best I've ever seen, specially by 'El Chivo', and the technique is superb. Forget comparisons to Pulp Fiction this movie stands on its own and it's more creative. If you haven't seen this movie, then go. If you have and didn't like it then just tell me this: most people liked it, thus the 8.5 rating (which I believe should be higher) do you, in your small little world, honestly think you are right and everybody else is wrong? Its okay if you don't like it but just think about it, go see it again and actually read the subtitles. P.S. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was much inferior to this movie and it didn't deserve to win the Oscar. Amores Perros all the way!!!! (like it or not.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a season of several mediocre movies, it's nice to have a movie like this lying around. Amores Perros, or "Love's a Bitch" (I though perros was dog in Spanish), is a excellent if sometimes unnerving foreign film that may have a not too original formula (the different stories is similar from Pulp Fiction, Traffic and Magnolia, not that those movies are mediocre) but is original with it's elements.It tells three stories- 1 of a guy who uses his brother's dog in dog fights and falls in love with his sister in law; a model gets in a car crash (the crash re-appears at times and is the end point for part 1) and has to recuperate and find her dog which falls under the floor boards; and 3, a story of an old hitman who will do one final job before seeking redemption. The characters sometimes pop up in each others stories, but this is in no way to make it conventional and the acting is superb to match. Sometimes hard to swallow (some animal lovers will find horror in the dog fight scenes), but overall a unique achievement in the new millenium of film, inparticular for Mexican film. Also, the best Mexican film I've seen since El Mariachi. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellently cast, superbly directed, and those fighting, wounded, or just wagging their tails after their masters, dogs also playing their hair-raising parts, this hell of a movie, which just pulls you like a ruthless ,unseen hand , through the storm of violent emotions , is simply an experience, which leaves you thinking seriously. Does Susana really love Octavio, or it's just passion, and yielding to his constant advances ? Does Ramiro love his wife and the kid, or it's just helplessness,to stay together, being threatened to get killed, by Octavio's hired killers ? Does El Chivo loves his daughter, or it's more the need for revenge , in retaliation to betrayal ? And why does Valeria love Daniel, a much married, middle-aged man, not very handsome either ? their love-hate relationship, after she is devastated by that car accident, in which she first becomes wheel chaired, and then with a major handicap, when her leg is amputated ? It's too complex a drama for getting simple answers ! Yes, we have seen movies like, Unfaithful, Perfect Murder, and so many others, on infidelity, adultery, and revenge, but nothing like this before ! At one point, the characters get down to the lowest level of mercilessly fighting dogs , to make their living, or even much more than that, by staking, assaulting, double-crossing, robbing banks, and evading law, on the other point, they give in to their basic instincts . The dogs too, snap the necks of each other, at the first opportunity. But when the dogs bleed, and are badly injured, just waiting to breathe their last, the humans are truly over-whelmed, desperately trying to save them, realizing their place in their lives ! Inarritu has put his heart and soul, while directing this drama, and unfolded, reunited ,all the stories together, doing a wonderful job of it all. It's really touching to see, almost all the characters, reduced to a pathetic state, yet clinging on to each other for some support. Some of the noteworthy scenes are, El Chivo transforming his persona, by shaving etc, and pasting his photo,along with his family, Valeria looking out of the window, after her leg is amputated, a desolate Mama Susana, after Octavio climbs the stair case ,by hurriedly pushing her past, on realizing that Susana has fled with his money.... Some how, Valeria and Daniel's story lacks the grip, and excitement, like the other ones, and that part of searching for Richie the pet dog , under the wooden flooring, as well as flashing her poster, Enchante, could have been edited, for better results. It's also not very convincing, Daniel saying good bye to his happy family, while he loves his daughters so dearly ? Even his wife seems to love him so, that she has almost forgiven him for his unfaithfulness, and wants him back ! Not one of those pop corn flicks, this movie makes you think about our basic principles in life, and the amazing hand of that unseen supernatural power, which creates ripples in our lives, reaching beyond our scope, as Inarritu believes ! Those street dogs will never be the same for me at least !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The antithesis of pretension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those who see the comment that states this is a "pretentious indie film" ... well this is the other side of that (bizarre) comment.Amores Perros is one of my top ten films. It shows a fragmented display of human kind in an apparent lawless section of society. It allows the viewer to get just close enough to some of the (flawed) characters, then wretches them away ... and submerges the viewer into another (flawed) story. There are obvious biblical themes (Cain and Abel) which will be apparent to viewers before the themes are (post modernly) announced by one of the stars. It is, perhaps, a validation and verbalization of what the viewer is thinking in watching this powerful example of love and tragedy.For those unaware of the structure of Amores Perros, it is an example of temporal distortion. This, however, doesn't distract from the deep relationships the viewer has with the characters. The flawed lovers, the scarred beauty, the family man who has fled his nest and the complex hit-man. The obvious motif - of canine relationship with man/woman - serves as a connection between seemingly unconnected characters and perhaps demonstrates the base level violence that the characters are a part of.Amores Perros is a complex film that rewards the viewer. In basic terms, it will make you cry and make you feel. It is not pretentious. It is, in fact, quite beautiful. Apologies for the pretentious nature of this review, but I figured the undereducated "pretentious indi film" review called for some of these comments! Basically, Amores Perros it is a great flick!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing intertwining story lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amores Perros is a Spanish film with a great reputation that I happened to have on DVD from the college library. I'd heard a lot of good things about Amores Perros, but I hadn't heard much about the plot, which was a good thing. Half the fun of this movie realizations that you get about the plot as the movie goes on. You get more and more information about each of the characters until right at the end it all makes sense. All I will say about the plot is that it has three separate story lines that meet at a car crash then go off on their own again. And all of them have to do with dogs. Beyond that, watch the movie for yourself. The movie's title is translated to "Love's a Bitch", and that is a very good representation of the themes in the movie. Love is involved in each storyline, and in each one it goes sour, or has dire consequences on the character. In the end, no one is satisfied, and pretty much everyone ends up worse off than they were at the beginning. This is absolutely brutal film-making, and it will make you wonder about the absolute futility of life portrayed here. There is very good acting all around, and all of the characters are believable. The camera-work, although it doesn't the stylish techniques that contributed so much to Requiem For A Dream, is very sturdy and never boring, although action movie fans may not like its artful touches and close-ups. In fact, action movie fans won't like this movie at all. Despite dog fighting scenes, this is definitely not an action-oriented film. However, it is a very powerful, if depressing, story, with loads of originality, film-making skill, and good acting. In Spanish with subtitles. -DenBez</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care if they compare it to Pulp Fiction but Alejandro didn't try to imitate Quentin at all. If you listen to the commentary track you'll hear the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga say that he saw Reservoir Dogs when Amores Perros was being filmed and the film is based on a poem which I can't recall right now but listen to the commentary and you will know and understand the movie ALOT more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got to see this film while it was in the theatres. I was always so busy and anyway, the talk of dog fighting put me off. But after hearing so many glowing recommendations, I finally got around to renting it on DVD.Set in Mexico and focusing on three separate yet interwoven stories, the film uses a terrible car crash as a jumping off point.In the first segment a young man, Octavio, (played by the superb Gael Garcia) is in love with his abusive brother's wife. He wants to raise enough money for them to run away together so he uses his beloved dog 'Cofi' and gets involved in the violent world of dog fighting. The second act tells the tale of a supermodel whose lover leaves his wife and daughters to set up home with her. She is devoted to her terrior 'Richie' and is devastated when he disappears through a hole in the floor and doesn't return. Throughout both of these segments we catch glimpses of a transient, scruffy character who is perpetually surrounded by a pack of adoring dogs, and we finally learn his story in the third and final act. At three hours, the structure of the film is impressive, especially as it begins at a frenetic pace and then slows down somewhat - but it leads us to a satisfying conclusion. The soundtrack in particular is brilliant, as is the acting, writing, photography and design.'Amores Perros' is as the title states, a film about love, and all types of love. Blind love, foolish love, familial love, co-dependant love, unrequited love, parental love, thwarted love, sexual love - it's all there and played out through the love the principal characters have for their pet dogs. In one way the film examines the human 'animal instinct', the human capacity for violence and our deep seated need for survival. It is a huge, sprawling piece which is exhilarating, visceral, violent, heartbreaking, funny, passionate, vibrant and urgent. Films like this don't come along very often. You really should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, when a foreigner director (Latin, European, Asian, etc.) makes an original film in his homeland, Hollywood calls for him. He goes, gets much more money, but also has to deal with ambitious producers; therefore, his first American movie ends up dull and impersonal. That's commonplace.Now and then, however, the reverse happens. That's the case of Mexican director Alejandro González I?árritu. His directorial debut, "Amores Perros", is a curious, uneasy film, but nothing special - definitely not worthy of all that praise it got worldwide. I had high expectations about "Amores Perros", but when I finally watched it on TV last Saturday, I was disappointed. Gael García Bernal, as usual, was the best thing on show, but on the whole the film isn't that good.I?árritu's first American film, "21 Grams" (2003, featuring mesmerizing performances by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro), on the other hand, is far more interesting and disturbing. "21 Grams" is the proof that I?árritu is a director to be looked on, but "Amores Perros" is far from being a masterpiece. Let's wait and see his next films.My vote: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Drunks, killers, adulterers, bullies, liars, thieves and two timers. Not the sort of people I choose to spend my evening with. What is the point of three hours of thoroughly unlikeable and disreputable characters, most of whom fornicate graphically and frequently if ingraciously. I'm glad that my view of the world is neither so black nor so bleak. The acting is capable. The production is effective (if gloomy.) The juxtaposition of three stories around one car crash is an interesting (if unoriginal) concept. But the script is a morbid repudiation of the human race. There are more likeable characters in a Wagner opera. It probably is a good topic for discussion at film appreciation classes. But it is too dark, too morbid and too cynical to qualify as a great work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No. I mean, Inarritu has made sentimental, overly melodramatic films before, but he really goes overboard with this. It seems like his only intent is to tug our heartstrings and our anxiety and our thrills, and the first act just comes off incredibly contrived. The second act is better, with the couple, but it still is on-the-nose. The performances aren't the problem really (most of the time, sometimes some actors also overdo it, but one really needs to blame the material). The third act is by far the best and actually a pretty good, solid, effective piece of work with some great themes and the reason I don't entirely dislike the film. It was enough to not completely dismiss the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores perros (Love's a Bitch) is an important film for the 21st century as it launched the film careers of director Alejandro González I?árritu, writer Guillermo Arriaga, and composer Gustavo Santaolalla. All have become influential in the film industry over the past fourteen years. This film is the first in I?árritu's "Trilogy of Death" followed by 21 Grams and Babel, both of which Arriaga and Santaolalla would also collaborate on. The film follows several different main characters throughout Mexico City who are loosely connected by a car crash and the dogs they take care of. The film features a lot of dog fighting at the beginning, which was pretty disturbing and probably detracted from my enjoyment of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros - Love Dogs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very interesting Mexican movie, with English subtitles. The literal translation of the title is 'Love Dogs' and the subtitle on the DVD case says 'Love is a Bitch.' After watching it I might apply a slightly different title, "Love is for the Dogs." Perhaps some of the story line for the later American movie "Crash" was inspired by this one, where a car crash is seen several times during the movie, each time from a different angle and from a different character's perspective. As the story unfolds we gradually learn that there will be connections between characters that may not yet even know each other. Similar to what 'Crash' depicted. However the stories are totally different.It is a long movie, at almost 2 1/2 hours, and a very gritty movie. Prominent in the story line is the sport of dog fighting, often to the death of one, and much blood is depicted. In fact, the movie opens with a scene of a bleeding, dying dog in the back seat of the car that crashes.The theme of 'dogs' runs through the movie. One couple get together and the lady's pet dog gets lost under the floor of their new apartment, and the disagreement the two have over recovering the dog has tragic consequences.Another story line has two brothers competing for the same woman, all living in the same squalid apartment with the mother of the men. The one brother who has fathered their child is not very nice, and when not working as a store clerk robs banks. The other brother has fallen in love with her and wants her to run off with him. He figures out how to get lots of money by using his big black dog to fight, but never figures out that his brother's woman just doesn't love him.Love is for the dogs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was talking with someone a while ago, saying how Babel is a bland film which offers far too little for its length beyond schematic critique to a rather obvious conception of contemporary flaws. How 21 Grams overwhelmed me as too depressive for its own sake and had its own air of artificiality. I mean, that's an obvious problem you might get when trying to string together stories and embody them in an integral whole. The someone I mentioned above was quite dismissive of my thoughts, claiming the genius of Inarritu was indubitable in both films, and asked me the most obvious question of all: "Why do yo go to see Inarritu films if you dislike them so?". My answer was inevitably superficial, for I said "Because I like to believe".It's funny in a way, this feeling of going back int time; he remains absolutely the same, his work is just as loaded with bold, significant statements, but only in Amores perros have I encountered the authenticity I crave. Maybe it's got something to do with faces, with the fact that his last two movies employ famous faces to which I cannot relate the gritty realism which Inarritu tries to convey. Not that I'm saying Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Sean Penn or Benicio Del Toro are bad actors; it's just that their well known.Amores perros is a gritty, realistic and authentic film which dissects the sour, bi-polar reality of contemporary society. Segmented as all of Inarritu's films in several stories, it introduces each of them in similar style with the oh-so-beautifully- romanticized Hable Con Ella (2002), with a black screen bolstering two character names in large typeface. The three stories are vaguely interrelated, tangentially. They portray the fate of an impoverished, lower class working family in Mexico, a love story between a model and a magazine editor and the in-between tale starring a homeless assassin, ex-teacher, ex-rebel, ex-convict. Inarritu's social conviction of inequity and unfair distribution are quite obvious, but his view does not infer the well-being of the upper class. The dogs, central motive of the film in some regards, are used as a means to gain wealth in the ghettos of Mexico, while in the central districts they obsessively plague a distinctly alienated and paranoid layer of society.Inarritu's films are so pedantic in matters of style and structure, that they offer great ability of insight. I do not necessarily enjoy this, as it goes into an awkward level of schematic realism which I despise. While it is bearable in Amores perros, it is not in his second and third ventures. The Mexican director also has a rather morbid proclivity towards worst case scenarios, taking the already dim reality portrayed and bending it to extreme levels. Again, while I managed to live with it in Amores perros, I could not in Babel and 21 Grams. Straining reality too much does not make reality more real - on the contrary.There exist therefore several reasons why I shy away from Innaritu's approach to film-making. I like to avoid the overwhelming and insurmountable abstractions of class. Perhaps that's white privilege talking, but I'm not trying to deny the existence of social structures and challenges, just pointing out that their artistic representation treads a fine line between bleak and unbearably bleak - for its own sake and shock value, more so than any insightful commentary. Amores perros gets the balance right and I recommend it wholeheartedly to all cynics - for I was one myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amores Perros: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only in America would a gritty movie with tons of violence, sex, and language be allowed in but the foreign title must be used because the translated title is `Love's a Bitch'. While grittier films have come out of America, Mexico's Amores Perros still is something that I have never seen before. Although it has been called the Mexican Pulp Fiction, I fail to see the connection except that both deal with lowlifes and jump around with time. Other than that, there are no real similarities.Like Pulp Fiction, though, it's divided up into segments. The first deals with Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who is madly in love with his sister-in-law Susana (Vanessa Bauche) so he uses their dog Cofi to fight for money to run away with. Second is Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) whose marriage to model Valeria (Goya Toledo) is jeopardized when their dog Richie falls underneath their apartment. Last is former guerillia El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) who is assigned to murder someone, and also finds a wounded dog to take care of.All three stories are brought together by a car crash, each in a separate way. And all three stories show how important dogs are to people. In all of them, the owner of the dog is more concerned about the canine than other people. It could be showing the alienation of culture, but it could just be showing us three stories of people down on their luck in Mexico City.I am a big animal lover, and it was rather painful to watch so many dogfights and dogs in peril, but at least barely any of the fighting was shown. It seems at times like Amores Perros goes for shock value, with the sudden fights and the gritty feel and the strong animal gore, to make us choose how we feel. Also, the music sways us, although it's quite good. In the case of movies like this, sometimes the music can hurt it, but not here.Amores Perros is one of those movies that have you feeling all mixed up inside, like you don't know how to feel, but that feeling goes away soon after the movie is done. You think it will leave a lasting impression on you, but it doesn't. I wish I could write more on this movie, but it's one of those movies that's hard to really talk about. See it if you'd like to see something different, and maybe you'll have another impression of it than what I had.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence/gore, language and sexuality.</fullReview>

How do I have to see it? Inspired by Tarantino or the kind of movies that inspires Tarantino? Who knows but it certainly has the Tarantino-effect. What first looks like a mess (all different shoots that can't be combined at first) falls into one piece, the perfect puzzle and let me tell you this : most of the Hollywoodscenarists better watch some movies like these, they can learn a lot. It has no sense to tell the story, just see it as a modern fairy tale in where the rich and the poor find each other in a world of crime. Sole reason why I disliked the movie a bit was because of the many cruel views of bleeding dogs (dogfighting is a bit the focal point in here), but that apart I can say : what a brilliant movie, give us more of these!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, i have to appreciate the film makers for the trailer of this film which is seducing and much more meaningful than the movie itself. I don't think "Amores Perros" is a bad movie, but if you have high expectations, the result can be disappointing. The stories of which the movie consists are linked gloriously but somehow these stories are not so shocking. I don't want to spoil the movie by giving details here but bitter love stories are usually way more painful than these ("Chasing Amy" is a great example of this). For a film which is based on a brilliant idea of combined stories about love and dogs, i would expect more bitter stories but the only bitter thing was the dog corpses seen anytime on the movie. To conclude, it's a pity that "Amores Perros" is not capable of being a classic though it has the capacity to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second Mexican film I saw this week, the first being "y tu mama tambien". Reading other comments it seems that viewers seem to love the one and hate the other. Well, I posted my thoughts on "y tu mama tambien", so here's what I think of "amores perros".It's a movie with a story, or rather you get three stories for your money, loosley bound around a car crash and in each case a dog, or dogs. What ties them together is in the title, that "love is a bitch", and as has been pointed out elsewhere this is not a literal translation, and it looses something when it gets to English, but it's basically about three love stories that destroy the lovers and sometimes the loved. A better title might be "love stinks", but didn't Mel Brookes get the copyright on that one?The story lines are stong and powerful, and the acting and direction done in such a manner that as the director says, we don't really notice that they are there. Which is how it should be. I'd say that the makers set out to take a powerful story and to tell it simply and directly without sentiment, and in an unselfconscious way. Contrast this with the other Mexican film I saw this week, and you'll see what I mean.Much negative comment seems to come from the fact that "dogs were hurt in the making of the film". I've no proof they were not, but I hope all complainers are veggy. If you watch the "making of" on the DVD with care you'll see that in one of the dog fight scenes the dogs are released , Cofi springs at the other dog.... and starts to hump it! In the film there is a cut, just before this "sex scene" and some overdubbed growling while we see the faces of the spectators.All in all, I found it a gripping film, and it kept me watching for 2 hours.So, if you liked "et tu mama tambien", don't watch this, and if you didn't, then watch "amores perros", you'll be in for a treat.</fullReview>

Not a date movie, by any stretch, and some conservative points of view in moviemaking go out the window very soon in this movie.***VERY SMALL SPOILER*** ..I mean, a dog is bleeding badly in the very 30 seconds of this movie in the back of a car while said car is being pursued down the street maniacally by a menacing looking truck...if that doesn't rattle you, well...Enough of that: well acted, daring, challenging, engaging, with an intricate plot (maybe not original, but obviously worked on with a passion not seen in the hollywood machine -remember "Tomb Raider"(yuk)?- and yes, bleak, a tone reminiscent of another love or hate movie: REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. More importantly, it treats the audience as intelligent human beings. I hate being told 20 times that love conquers all, (NOTE TO ASPIRING FILMMAKERS: I can get your message, whisper it to me and don't bang it in my head, I can get it on my own, I already spent 8 dollars just to watch your movie, darn it!!!).Take a gamble and watch it.

And this is also why films often bother me: There's a cultural assumption out there that film is somehow "like real life" or representing history validly and this simply not so. And this film does not portray "love" as I understand it. Love to me is about nuturing and support. What I see portrayed in this film is people living out dysfunctional family patterns unconsciously and hurting each other in the process. True, this is "like real life", but hopefully we seek out support or help before we turn to some of the extremes that these characters do. All of the characters in this film inflict violence on themselves and others around them because they are unable to confront these deep patterns. I think I would have liked the film more (or at least empathized with some of the characters more) if at some point recognition of these dysfunctional patterns was made conscious. The director/writer never does this. I liked the ambient soundtrack. Similar to the Cliff Martinez stuff in Steven Soderbergh's films. The film was well shot. I cried in a few scenes. I didn't like the macho-ness of the male characters. Susanna's character also really bothered me. I got a little bored in some parts. Overall, an OK film. Not "outstanding", sorry to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Amores Perros" at a Philadelphia art theatre, and I haveto say that it improved my hopes about the future of Mexicancinema, especially in the quality of its actors, editors, andcinematographers. "Amores Perros" is a compelling series ofstories about lost souls in Mexico City, each of whose future isintimately connected to the fate of their dogs. Though this thematicconceit sounds ridiculous, this actually ends up working fine in thefilm. Octavio uses his dog Cofi to make himself rich and win thelove of Susana. Daniel and Valeria frantically search for their lostdog Richie under the floorboards of their polished new apartment,just as they seem to lose the picture-perfect love between the twoof them after Valeria's accident. Finally, El Chivo is made to re- examine his life after (PLOT SPOILER) all of his dogs aremurdered by the seemingly gentle killer dog he has adopted froman accident. I have to say though that the stories don't work nearly as well asthose of Tarantino. Though the first and last stories are eachabout conflicts between brothers and murderous instincts, thesecond story separates them so far that this link emerged me onlyas an afterthought. Just like Traffic, I think it is a question ofplacement. To have started off with the Valeria story and then theOctavio story would have been interesting, because thus eachwould have dealt with issues of imagined loves/infatuation andbetrayal. (Valeria isn't the beauty that Daniel imagined, whileSusana betrays Octavio.) Finally, we hit upon Octavio's attempt toreconnect with his daughter, as a more familial look at the themeof obsession with women. The strange placement here makessuch connections more difficult. However, again, what is incredible is that "Amores Perros" isInarritu's first move into feature filmmaking, and he has puttogether a damn solid and ambitious piece of work, well- performed, visually compelling, funny, and intense. Thetransformation of El Chivo in the end is simply astounding andgives you a sense of hope after all the senseless tragedy that hasoccurred up to that point. My only qualm: we hear Satisfaction. Wesee ads for French perfumes, but where is a sense of the setting? Why is this a distinctly Mexican film- couldn't this story have beentold as is in English in Los Angeles without losing a thing? Thelack of a sense of Mexico in "Amores Perros" makes me wonderwhether it just was never an issue for Inarritu, or if the setting hasdeliberately been simplified for international audiences. The same problem occurred in last year's acclaimedEcuadorean feature, Ratos, Ratones, y Rateros, (Mice, Rats, andRobbers) a crime thriller about two Ecuadorean thieves, thatplayed in festivals including last year's Philadelphia World Festival. I was disappointed in the feeling of universality given to the film,because the truth is that Ecuadorean culture presents quite adistinct reality to that of any merely rundown Hispanic ghetto in theUS, yet it often felt like the story could easily have been transportedhere. Where's the awareness of what makes that foreign film'ssetting alien to our audiences? I recommend seeing "Amores Perros" for its art, plot, andacting, but it's nothing that I would call the product of a distinctly"Mexican" cinema, though definitely a landmark achievement forthat country.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaggy Dog Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Macho melodrama of excess and extremes, hyper-reality that is somehow less than real, with everything in exaggeration right down to the oversaturated film stock. Shaggy dog story, literally, dogs amok, dogs a metaphor--gratuitous, empty, sophomoric, and self-serving--for uh ... the Animal in Man, his lusts, desires, drives, etc. The title translates as, take your pick: "Love's a Bitch" (on screen) or "Dastardly Love Affairs" (dictionary). (Maybe even a play on "pero": "Love But ....")CONTENT: Plot rich, but character poor: the event's the thing. Tripartite, 3 overlapping interlocking stories ? la Altman's " Short Cuts," with some nice storytelling tricks--withheld information and delayed realizations--but with less deft and not as intricately woven. Everyone, in their fashion, after sex, money, and what they think is love, from the lower to the middle classes. Dogs everywhere, an overdrawn theme, sinking under the weight of its own intention. It's a dog-eat-dog world, literally. We Americans, with our aseptic bland regularity and order, are bound to, intended to, vicariously thrill at this seamy Mexican carnal carnival ride (vide, "Traffic," "Touch of Evil," etc.).Part I: One brother lusts after the wife of another, Cain &amp; Abel; both grovel for money; dogfights parallel their own relationship. Part II: Man abandons family for super-model. Lapdog, representing uh ... their pampered "love," falls through hole in hardwood floor of their upscale apartment (an outright implausibility right there), succumbing to the mercy of rats, until the model forfeits all glamour (hint: "Take my arm, take my leg / O baby, don't you take my head"), at which time, voil?, dog, battered but alive, resurfaces, paralleling their love's redemption from selfishness and vanity. Part III: "Lower-Depths" "Ghost-Dog" assassin, former leftist revolutionary, wanders the streets, gathers and protects stray dogs, symbolizing, uh ... the poor and the dispossessed, and mourns the family he forfeited when he went underground years prior. He is hired to kill one brother by another, Cain &amp; Abel again. At heart, despite a surfeit of gratuitous sex and violence, the overall moral scheme is fundamentally conservative: his sentimental self-pitying paternal love is the only redemption in sight.Which is the problem. Everyone is despicable, mean, dishonest, vain, greedy, grubby, and stupid. It's hard to care about the film because it's impossible to care for its characters. It rings with the callous laughter of self-conscious adolescent bad-ass black humor. The film lacks the maturity and depth to depict real suffering. Its self-styled noirish pessimism, nowhere as neatly epitomized as at the end when the assassin is seen wandering off, a lone figure dwarfed by a parched blackened earth, is the grand empty gesture of a pretentious master manipulator and glutton for kicks, I?arritu.The film, rated R, works, works very well, on the level of cheap-thrills-and-spills-a-minute, which is Part I. It's "Pulp Fiction" and "Natural Born Killers," without their belabored, opaque, self-referential, Hollywood hype: noire, jumpy, in-your-face, physical (everybody does IT), with blood everywhere, but, of course, without uh ... the smell, stickiness, and difficulty of getting it off. (The film's budget for red food dye must have been huge.) However, once the pace lets up in Parts II &amp; III, the movie becomes very long, even longer than its 2 and a 1/2 hours.STYLE: the main attraction: The neurotic compaction/compulsion of time (anxiety of anxious times), of TV commercials and music videos, hand-held and quick-cut, vying for the heady rush of getting high: The visual media's "new" fangs, the emperor's new clothes, an excellent way to glamorize overpriced cars. At the least, a relief from the soporific dullness of equivalent Hollywood product (e.g., I've recently suffered through "Heartbreakers" and "The Tailor of Panama"). A flood of detail, of plot, pushed and force-fed, but meaning nowhere, none. Just the clothes we walked in with, the same old tired skins we'll carry out when it's over; we aren't given the time to take them off, see what's underneath, try on new ones.Cultural specificity: If "Yi Yi" is the tame soap-opera of repressed Asian nouveau middle-class angst, this is the lurid comic book of Latino hysteria, emotions tied in tight knots, the mechanical revolutions of The Wheel, desire and greed, endless cycle of hunger and satiety, told with the opulent indifference of a people who celebrate a Day of the Dead, who lavish precise and gruesome detail on the bloody wounds of the thousands of plaster Christ's hanging in their garishly gilded churches ("Crawl to The Virgin in Guadalajara on your knees till they bleed, sinner; She alone will make you walk again!"), turning their hearts to leather, turning against each other, but breaking down like lost fools in an uncontrolled diarrhea of maudlin self-pity. O, Mexico, America's sewer, where Christianity met, merged with, but never overcame the pagan."Amores Perros" is highly derivative of the neurotic inner unsteadiness of exploitive American commercial media, just another trick, another fad, rolling off the assembly line of up-and-coming smart-ass young things, catching the eye of the college crowd, succeeding the likes of "Run Lola Run" and "Being John Malkovitch," in other words, A HIT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ok. This is the real deal with this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It's really remarkable compared with a lot of crap that has been roaming around in Mexican cinema lately (like the unbearable Sexo, Pudor y Lágrimas). But i've been reading lots of stupid comments like: Better than Hollywood stuff, and that kind of crap. For most of it, this movie could have been made by a French, American or Southamerican director, no sweat. Just look at stuff from Alejandro Aménabar, Costa Gavras, or Mathieu Kassovitz - just to do some random picking. It's remarkable for the average mexican movie kind. But this is no way better than Taxi Driver. Scorsese did this kind of violence and reality-meets-movies thing way before these guys even dreamed of it. I interviewed Arriaga and Bauche, and i told them how much i liked the movie, and that it was a big step foward for movie-making in our country. But it only works in it's own universe. You can't compare it to Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Deer Hunter, Fight Club or Reservoir Dogs (to which it bears lots of resemblances), all of which are Hollywood pics just for the record.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first heard Alejandro Gonzalez I?arritu was making a movie i was surprised because he used to make radio (very good radio actually, he was practically the father of modern day youth-oriented radio in Mexico)then i found out the name of the movie was "Amores Perros" and was supposed to be shown in the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, that's when i thought ,wow, this should be interesting, then the film wins Cannes critic week's award and boom ! the propaganda is all over Mexico, on buses, on TV, on magazines , i mean everywhere , as you can imagine, i could hardly wait to see it....if i had only known !The film starts out fast, maybe too fast with a couple of kids in a car chase, then the movie becomes so disturbingly predictable that i found myself praying for it to end for the next 2 hours and a half. First of all how many more "several stories that come together in a strange twist of fate" movies do mexican film makers have to do before making a point? (see Midaq Alley). Second, either the dogs used in the film went to drama school (I?arritu should have) or they had them really fighting through the whole production, it is fair to point out that there are no laws in Mexico that specifically point out that no harm should be done to an animal on stage. That really bugged me. Last but not least I thought the editing was really bad and the plot was very inconsistent. For those who claim that this picture shows the reality of Mexican life should really get out of the bubble more often, and should be more careful, because such comments are exactly why stereotypes are created. A few posts back someone said something about this film "borrowing" ideas from directors like Tarantino or Kieslowski, well i'd say it was more like stealing their ideas, and that's NOT good film making. He should've stuck to radio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores Perros is an impressive, deep, brutal and bad-ass film. For some people (and I include myself in that category) consider it the best Mexican movie so far. Deeply disturbing and provocative. Amazing photography, magnificent performances and a brilliant screenplay.So, the plot says that an horrific car accident connects three stories, each involving characters dealing with loss, regret, and life's harsh realities, all in the name of love. This is one movie who has the exact ingredients to make a perfect film: 1.Death 2.Betrayal 3.Love 4.An horrific car accident and 5.It's provoking.Three chilling, dark and eerie tales. It really shocks you, mostly the car crash. I think that scene shocked the whole world. It shows you how life can be, no, how life is in the modern times. Just flawless. A sexy, stylish, dark, chilling, riveting, raw and provocative classic legendary tale. One movie for the record that deserves our attention. Brilliantly written and directed. I don't know why some people underrate this brilliant piece of art.Verdict: An instant classic. You really need to see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, this film is a lesson about Mexican culture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is about three very unique characters who all live in Mexico city. A tragic car accident connects these three stories together and teaches its audience a lesson about life, love and fate. Each of the three characters lives are from a different class, and show a different perception of life in Mexico.There is Octavio, a young James Dean like character who is desperate to run away with his sister-in-law. To raise the money he needs, he enters his dog Cofi into dogfighting championships, which is a very normal thing to do in Mexico. He gets involved with the wrong crowd and everything goes catastrophic. Octavio flees with his best friend and an injured Cofi and drives reaklessly through a red light (which causes the incident). Valeria experiences marriage problems after losing her leg in the crash. We also see her struggle to live life in a wheelchair, when her beloved dog 'Richie' goes missing. El Chivo is a homeless man, his care for stray dogs is the only thing that keeps him going. He happens to witness the fatal accident, and gets involved by saving Cofi's life.The film reminds me a lot of 'Lola Rent' (Run, Lola, Run) In the way it perceives love and fate together. I think its really interesting to see fate brought to life in a film like this because it puts you into perspective and makes you think a lot about your own life.Each of the stories involves a dog, and the owners relationship with that dog. I think only a dog owner can truly understand the love and joy that dogs bring. And this film just shows why they are known as mans best friend. I think for someone who lives in the UK (like myself) the dogfighting scenes are extremely unpleasant to watch. But i think these scenes are a powerful representation of the Mexican culture and the differences in how we treat our animals.Amores Perros translates literally as Loves a Bitch, which i think sums up this film as a whole. The three powerful stories each show a different scenario about the world of love, and each of them are heart wrenching. I think this film is a must-see, for entertainment and educational purposes as well. I give it a rating of 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is perfect in every possible way. Every scene and every moment of it is dramatic and heartbreaking at the same time, every story has something to tell and reflects a reality of life and the world, specially in the Mexican society for poor but also rich people. One crash changes the life of three different people that had nothing to do with each other but after the accident will be connected forever. In my opinion the first story is the one that has more power and impact, it talks mostly about obsession, how a guy can be so obsessed with his brother in law to the point of trying to her steal away from his brother. What i liked the most about this story was the different points of view from octavio and susana, she wanted to feel protected with her kid and understood or supported while octavio wanted to sleep with her and was more obsessed in kind of a physical and immature way. But at the end they don't end up together and thats when octavio really starts growing up and stops thinking as a child that wants his toy no matter what. The other story that had me crying was the one of el chivo that just wanted to be accepted and forgiven by his daughter in a cruel society when he was a murderer but decided to change to be better for the only person he had left. Finally, the story of daniel and valeria certainly was the most weak but necessary. Showing that also rich people can suffer and have problems. Here we find a supermodel, valeria that is happy with daniel, a man that recently left his wife but has a car accident and after wards neither her life or the life of his boyfriend is the same again. Her dog ritchie is trapped in the floor and the advertisement she worked for doesn't want her anymore because of her leg problem and daniel is thinking about going back to his wife and kids. One very strong scene is when we watch they are taking the poster of her from the building and shes crying while daniel takes her hand. That is hope, makes you think they will stay together no matter what. I agree with the poor treatment of dogs but it was necessary to show the message to the audience and impress them in such a way. This is by far the best movie of i?arritu and the best film in my list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Film. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I popped this in the DVD player at 1:30am without knowing anything about it, except that it was in Spanish. What followed was absolutely life-changing.From the first second of the movie, as the camera opens up on a passing black road as seen from a fast-moving car, I was subjected to a visual and narrative style of realism which I still have yet to see ever again. Nothing feels forced, every line and every expression fits, and no angle is wasted. The scenes are there, they're in your face, and they won't leave. It's frightening, and wonderfully intoxicating.It would seem an exaggeration to call this film perfection, but this is as close to my ideal movie as I have ever seen. "Running Scared" comes very close, but it had too much violence for the sake of violence, and "No Country for Old Men" (a recent favorite) is excellent, but fundamentally different. For me, nothing explodes with meaning and frustration like the problems which the characters attempt to wrench themselves out of.I dearly hope that one day I will see a film that can top the voice with which this movie speaks to me. But I do not anticipate that happening for a very long time. This movie is worth watching because I found that it changed the way I saw the world forever. You may not find that, of course, but I would at least give it a try: at the worst, you may find that they camera is "too shaky" or something. But that would be your loss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE: gratuitously bleak, pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amount of accolades received by this film by the critical community and many of the commentators here at IMDB only prove my long-held suspicion: That when there's a bandwagon rolling down your block, nobody wants to be left behind.. This has to be one of the most unoriginal, shamelessly trendy and over-rated indie films I've ever seen. It plays up all the right post-modern aesthetics while exploiting the audience and testing their endurance and patience. I am not averse to the dark or the bleak in film or any other art form -- In fact, on most days I consider myself a misanthrope. But there is a point where such heavy-handed morbidity becomes nothing short of gratuitous, and Amores Perros IS that point. Leaving aside for the moment the lack of any empathetic characters in the film (noted by quite a few others here), no one seems to have noticed the almost total lack of character development in this film. It's not that the characters are morally ambiguous that turns me off (y'know, it's all part of the 'realism' of it..), it's that our director Inaritu doesn't give us any reason to really give one damn about any of them. The sole exception is the character of El Chivo, played brilliantly by Emilio Echevarria -- and this says more about his acting skill than it does about Inaritu's direction. And if the whole 'over-lapping convoluted storyline' wasn't already a cliche, then Amores Perros effectively makes it into one. On the whole, I'm forced to say it seems like Inaritu is just trying too hard with this film, which I'd be willing to give him a break on because he is a 'new' director. I agree that much of the editing and cinematography was great, but hardly innovative or brilliant, in large part because it's just candy that doesn't serve the substance of the film... possibly because IT HAS NONE. Has the indie film community actually gotten to the point where is eschews substance and the basic elements of the craft in favor of flashy editing and heavy borrowing (some would say plagiarism) of directors like Robert Altman and Tarantino? And if so, how does that make films like this any different from the usual Hollywood smoke and mirrors? There were times while I watched this film that I laughed out loud -- inappropriately -- because the storyline had become downright ridiculous. I don't regret seeing this film, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone with any enthusiasm, and I'd have to agree with one of the other commentators here that ultimately it's a forgettable cinematic experience. In that sense, I feel it is a shame that it is being applauded as a kind of benchmark for Mexican cinema, because there are many other films that are more deserving of the attention Amores Perros has had lavished upon it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog Eats Dog, End of Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too many filmmakers seem to feel that a movie must be ugly and unpleasant in order to be realistic, and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is one of them. This movie is nearly unrelentingly grim, and left me just feeling bad--bad about people, bad about the world in which we live, bad about the human race in general. In the world of "Amores Perros," it's eat or be eaten, a message that maybe lends itself well to gritty, grungy stylistics but isn't much of a hook on which to hang a compelling narrative.However, this movie scores in the way it tells its story, cutting back and forth between three narratives that build on one another in surprising ways. It's the same approach Inarritu uses in his first English-language film, "21 Grams," and it's actually used to better effect there, but it works here as well. His narratives are tangled webs rather than straight paths from point A to point B, and its a storytelling device that seems appropriate for the Internet age and the complicated ways in which we now process information. However, Inarritu should be cautious, as this approach used solely for its own sake can seem gimmicky, and it will lose its novel appeal if he uses it for every movie he makes.Needless to say, I'm not a huge fan of this movie, but I think Inarritu is a young filmmaker to watch. "21 Grams" is more satisfying, and there's a pervading feeling of redemption to take away from that movie rather than the gloomy sense of doom "Amores Perros" offers, evidence that Inarritu is moving in the right direction.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dog/Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, but felt that it was too long and slow.There's the usual intermingling/interweaving backwards/forwards in the timeline of the three stories, as done in Pulp Fiction and in many films since. Here it doesn't seem to do it particularly well.The two main themes were dogs and love. The first story concerns a guy who uses dogfighting to get cash to try and convince his brother's wife to elope with him. He has quite a caring and generous character (one of the leads in Y Tu Madre Tambien?), in contrast to his brother who is a wife-beating criminal. However, for some reason the young mother ultimately feels loyal to her husband... The second story concerns a model who has finally gotten together with a family man she has been having an affair with, only to get involved in a horrible car accident. She then obsesses on the fact that her dog has gotten under the floorboards as she tries to come to terms with her injuries, in a quite well observed psychological breakdown which eventually results in her leg having to be amputated and her dreams of resuming her modelling career coming to an end. The third story is about a man who left his family to become a guerilla and was then locked up in jail for his terrorist activities. He has now become a tramp who is hired out as a hitman by a corrupt cop. His lack of morality towards humans is in stark contrast to his feeling s for stray dogs who he protects and looks after. When he takes in the fighting dog from the first story and it massacres his own dogs, it seemed to me that it symbolised who he was, i.e. someone that has become a cold-hearted killer without realising. He then decides to turn his life around by contacting his daughter and leaving her some of his ill-gotten gains.No character in this movie was ultimately likeable, the lovesick brother was pitiable in his desperation to be with his sister-in-law but his morals were lacking. The model shows no sympathy for the family she has wrecked, only self pity at her misfortunes. The tramp/guerilla has brought all of his troubles on himself and killed many people.This movie made me think but not change any of my ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am not very keen on dogs, I liked this film. The three stories were linked together right from the beginning, and yet developed separately and merged together. I liked the acting of the famous model, she was quite convincing. She could convey the psychological trauma very well. Octavio was such a cute guy that I simply wonder why the girl didn't run away with him.This is the second Spanish film that I saw with three stories merging into one. The other was 'Lucia y Sexo'. As you may guess, I like 'Lucia y Sexo' more because of the 'Sexo' part, but other than that 'Amores Perros' had more story in it, more visually attractive and better acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amores perros By Alan Beesby**Spoilers** The film opens with the car crash between Octavio and Valeria. Having been shown this we are then thrust back in time to tell us Octavio's entire story. The fact that we immediately know that the car crash is inevitable leaves the viewer with little to imagine. It does in fact show us the end then the beginning and ask us to joint the dots between the two with an obvious outcome. This in fact pretty much sums up the entire tone of the film. It's simple inadequacy to grip the audience is astounding just when you fell as if you are becoming moderately interested in what is going on the narrative changes to something else that you don't really care about. The affair between Daniel and Valeria seems pointless and nonsensical. The fact that we first see Daniel in the car with his family, and then are introduced to Valeria almost make his eventual dilemma seem like just deserts. The biggest problem with the film however seems to be the fact that all of the stories have no real relevance to each other. All three main characters are all involved some way or another in the car accident, so what! The film fails to show the relevance of the three stories. The film `borrows' incessantly from Tarrantino but unlike his film especially pulp fiction we are left with the feeling that one or more of the stories in Amores perros could just as easily been removed with no real bearing on the others. The fact that it's portrayed over 2 ? hours is a real punishment for the audience. Unlike other films such as magnolia which require length to get across the complexity of all of the different stories the detachment of Amores perros just leaves the viewer looking at their watch. The camerawork seems to develop over the course of the film. To begin with it feels like a bad student film with shaky camera techniques and pointless shots, but by the time we get into the third story this problem seems to have gone away or perhaps I had just succumbed to it by then. The use of music in the film is however one of the redeeming factors. The scene with El Chivo walking over the hill with his dogs and his enormous trolley worked brilliantly, but these moments are few and far between just as you start to feel that it may be about to get better it reverts to the boring spectacle that you have just been watching for the 2 hours. When it comes down to it Amores perros looks and feels like a low budget independent film but without the charm of the likes of El marriachi. The narrative tries to do to much and subsequently does nothing and becomes immensely confusing (and not in a good way!). but the color, mise en scene and the acting in parts do help to maintain some interest. So overall not to bad for what seems like a cheap Mexican pulp fiction.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Amores Perros" is a subtitled Mexican film which tells three stories, each on a collision course with the other. Although the film is well cast and artistically and technically excellent, it is somewhat overwrought and inclined to wear on the audience at it's dramatic tales are pounded into us as opposed to making us yearn for more. One question every auteur should be prepared to answer when asked by an audience is "why should we care?" "Amores..." works well on most levels but it's not likely Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is prepared to answer the question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made with an all-consuming, Goyaesque disgust, this epic triptych on life in Mexico City at the turn of the millennium runs as thoroughly on hate as any of the works of its spiritual godfather, Luis Bunuel. The director, Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, loves to jam the camera in panicked faces, car-crash rubble, pots of stinking food; he also loves moments when a bit of AM-radioish music blips in and out of the scene like the noise from a passing bus. Violence, un-privacy and confusion are the keynotes of the first part of this trilogy; and dogs, particularly dogs set in squares in empty swimming pools to bite each other to death, are the heavy-handed metaphor.The first section has a swirling, gristly energy that's so exciting it may take you past the fact that the stories being told here are utterly uninvolving. (It does not, however, take you past the fact that all the movie's performances are telenovela bad.) In the second story--a nightmare among Mexico City's bourgeois that combines the cruelty of Bunuel with the cruelty, and the flab-assed scene construction, of Lars Von Trier--a model and her older husband undergo a nightmare involving a dog, a wall-sized advert, and a shattered leg that can give you prolonged heebie-jeebies. (Innaritu makes no bones about wanting to excruciate his richie-rich characters.) The third section, about a scraggly homeless guy who is not what he seems, has, like the second, simple-storytelling charms, but it drags, and the movie's two and a half hours feel unduly long. The movie feels more running-on-fumes than epic.But for all that--particularly for the extreme handicap of the movie's performances--Innaritu impresses, big time. You might call him a pulpier Wong Kar-Wai, but there's a sociologist to Innaritu, a Balzacian large-canvas documentarian. It has become cliche to say this about promising first films, but I trust this will not be Innaritu's best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most over-rated Foreign film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why this film is so highly rated on IMDb and also on Rotten Tomatoes. This film was painfully boring and annoying. Three are three stories in this film, which are inadvertently connected to each other through an accident, that changes life of all the characters altogether.I liked the first story, but the downfall is that it was very lengthy. Second story was the most exasperating. Third was also too boring. I don't even want to discuss the stories. This film was 154 minutes long which is very long time. And, too top it all everything is quite predictable, the only difference is that it takes quite a time to watch on the screen what we already know.This is also one of the over-rated foreign movies, which doesn't live up to the high ratings. I'll recommend to skip it. But, anyways if you want to waste 150 minutes of your life,and you don't have anything to do that may worth your while, I can't stop you.</fullReview>

I don't know why cover says three stories. I think there were 9 stories and as many dogs. It's a shock that this film is supposed to be a cult. I didn't find anything interesting except for the accident and car chase scenes. I understand the story,characters and fractured narration but still can't figure out what is it about. Don't tell me its about three different classes from Mexico or anything of that sort. "Fantastic cinematography" or "first film by the director" don't make it interesting for me.

		<fullReview>Embarrassingly derivative of other works, Amores Perros had me wondering if perhaps the filmmakers name was not perhaps a pseudonym for Steven Soderbergh or Quentin Tarantino. Others may enjoy the director's technical proficiency, but they would have to have the capacity to ignore the hack-like vibe at this film's core. At times, the re-hashed vibrancy of the film had me hoping it might actually be a comment on the aforementioned filmmakers' tradition of stylized pomp, that it might pull away from its pure film-making pizazz -- but, no. Instead of substance, there lay another sequence of pure, exhilarating kinetic energy. The problem with that energy is that it focuses on characters so disagreeable, engaged in activities so repellent, that I simply could not are very much about them. However grim the outcome, the shallow characterizations made it difficult to tie any semblance of emotional commitment to them. The actors try, but ultimately fail, to flesh themselves out. The way the script functions, the inhabitants of this world are doomed to be seen as archetypes, rather than authentic humans, in instance after instance of harrowing circumstance. Then there's the overlong running time which the film struggles (and fails) to justify. Having to put up with the unrelentingly nihilistic subject matter is like repeated lashings in the face with a wet shoelace -- having to endure Amores Perros' length seems an excessive punishment to an already forgiving audience. Two-and-a- half-hours may be an acceptable running time for films that have the weight of history behind them, but this is ultimately a student exercise in how to use style to convey mood. For all its kinetic, stylized energy, this is just a one-note tragedy; a violent, expensive Spanish soap opera with an excessive running time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NO - not a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if there are spoilers herein but still don't wanna be blamed if there are.First: a little bit of PROs... the dialogues were in some points very peculiar and uncommon, and the movie is well acted. Now the CONs:I did not enjoy this movie. Right from the start, I found it disturbing, that can be good, because it would mean that the movie is able to stress you and keep you interested. Well, this one does not. It starts with violence, pours in a lot of dead dogs, mixes it up with sadness, adds up desperation and stirs it up with a nice car crash. Why? please tell me because I still don't get it. There's a lot of characters that behave badly, which can be interesting (like in Tarantino, Ritchie, Vaughn) but there is no real development in them, there's no reason why. This movie left with a strange "what did this all mean?" feeling i cannot get rid of. Did you, Alejandro Gomez Inarritu, mean to demonstrate this all had no meaning? well, you could do it with a shorter, less violent movie.I read comments about Amores Perros being "the Mexican Pulp Fiction"... forget it, all this movie takes from pulp fiction is a non-linear way of narrating the story. And that's done without a real reason, I don't see why it is so important to underline that the car crash is so relevant to all three stories, it is not, actually, two of the stories can go without it. The movie emulates Pulp Fiction. I would say Amores Perros is more "the Mexican Magnolia". OK, it's better than Magnolia. But Magnolia was awful...I have been watching violent movies all my life. I love Tarantino and that genre, my stomach is quite strong. but still after watching this movie, I could not sleep. I was struggling into asking myself why my girlfriend made me watch this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like foreign movies. I'm Finnish so I watch practically every movie with subtitles because we don't do dubbing in Finland. So this review isn't about that. I have seen movies from all around the world so I don't care about the language.Anyway, when I started to watch this movie I thought: "A Mexican movie, that's interesting!". Well, it turned out to be something else. When the first hour had passed I wished the movie was over. I felt like it's been two hours at least! The beginning was actually quite ok because of the action but then the pace slowed down and the movie got REALLY boring. The characters just kept on talking and talking and...aaargghh!!! The story went absolutely nowhere!In Amores Perros there's several stories told at the same time. I guess they tried to rip off the idea of Pulp Fiction but it just doesn't work. The stories have nothing to do with each other. And the beginning? Once again the same thing repeated: they show what happens later and then picture cuts back to a situation that happened earlier. A bit used idea don't you think?What is the basic idea of this film? It's a movie about dogs. It's a movie about people loving their pets. Who the hell wants to see a movie about dogs?! I don't! I can not comprehend why this movie gets an 8.2 rating from you!In conclusion, Amores Perros is WAY too long, WAY too slow and the plot is WAY too idiotic to raise my interest. 2/10 is my rating.</fullReview>

So I rented Amores Perros, and I was DEVASTATED! There was not a single character that I liked, and the whole movie upset my stomach. That it upset my stomach should say quite a bit, as I have watched "Last House on the Left" more times than I can count. The only redeeming feature of the film is its innovative storytelling. All the characters are doomed and unsympathetic. At no time did I truly understand the characters, nor did I want to. This has got to be the most joyless piece of cinema I have ever seen. In general I love foreign film, but not this tripe dressed up as art. I have read other's comments and find it shocking that this sort of ultraviolence and cruelty to animals is acceptable. I give it a 1 out of 10, only because of the narrative element I mentioned earlier.</fullReview>

For me however, if I want to watch something as meaningless as this movie I'd rather just be entertained by a bad Hollywood action movie. Watching Amores Perros is a chore to say the least. And as for the violence it is sparse and hardly anything for people to be shocked about. What is shocking is that people on here are actually posting that it is hard to watch because of the violence and crying about animal cruelty. Please, most of the scenes with the dogs only show them wrestling like 2 friendly puppies then cut to some staged scenes with fake blood. So, if you are one of those people considering getting this because of the violence just rent a National Geographic or pour some ketchup on the person next to you instead. My only guess as to why this is rated so high is that non-Spanish speakers are watching this without subtitles and just assuming it must be deep because, well, aren't all non-American films deep?</fullReview>

It tries to harrow us with sheer length (two and a half hours is a long time under the circumstances), and in this it succeeds: after the truly horrible bit (in part three - you know the scene I'm referring to), I found myself taking an interest in the story at last, perhaps from a lack of anything better to do. But it's too little, too late. The three stories have nothing to do with one another (they coincide spatially at one point - big deal), and they're simply laid before us, without art, like three uncut, rotting slabs of reality TV. If this film were a physical object there would be policemen standing around it saying, "Move along, nothing to see here." And they'd be right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may be a great film, but I simply could not stomach the dog fighting aspect of the story and had to stop watching after 30 min. This is really saying something since I have watched countless "bad" movies and read bad books, and always finish them despite not really enjoying the experience. Maybe if I could have held on, I would have been able to take something way from the movie in total, but as a dog owner who has lost dogs to natural causes, seeing cruelty towards dogs was too unsettling to permit me to continue watching.While the dog fighting is simulated and the director cuts away from it quickly, it is still very disturbing, especially in the impression it leaves. Having read the plot synopsis, the dog fighting plays a lesser role in the other 2 vignettes of the movie, but I would not recommend anyone with a dog to even try and watch this. Certainly dog fighting is a problem, and it is more culturally accepted outside of the USA. I don't need it depicted on the screen however, even as a vehicle to carry a different storyline. My suggestion, especially for anyone who loves animals, is to read a plot summary and not put yourself through the film. Maybe pick another of Alejandro González I?árritu's films as an alternative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that stands out in Mexico. What a surprise. I totally agree with it being an intelligent attempt to reach super production levels, of course, stealing ideas of Film Noir with no remorse. This comes as proof that Mexico, if attempting to ever reach a deeper level in cinema, have to rely in items that sell : Cruelty, blood, gore, etc... commercial items. nowhere good enough for a well-crafted story. "If you can't develop a good story, splash the screen with blood and gore and thee shall triumph" seems to be Inarritu's philosophy. He was great at radio, he should stick to that gift.Definitely it's a good movie compared with all the trash Mexico renders year after year, but this is also proof that if you are influential in the industry and have connections, it doesn't matter if you have a tad of talent, Inarritu is living proof.There are amazing talents in Mexico, but if they're stories are well crafted, it doesn't matter if they haven't sold their souls to our monopoly (people in mexico know who I'm talking about). For international movies, Amores perros is but another piece of film noir gore rendering tape.Sexo Pudor y lagrimas, another example but of a different kind. in general I don't think Mexico will ever acquire the level we once had with comedy films like those with Pedro Infante, Jorge Negrete, Joaquin Pardave, just to mention some. This is a shame, I'm twenty-six and can see that already.Mexico, wake up, we're still swimming in mud when it comes to film industry. Let's wait and see what other piece of c**p is rendered by our corrupted industry. Even more of a shame it s to acknowledge that this movie will become a school that will finish killing every instinct of a good movie with young filmmakers who get to break into Mexican cinema.Any objections, there you have my e-mail address so be my guest, I welcome all feedback.</fullReview>

It's overly long, there is way too much swearing without any purpose, too many gratuitous sex scenes, and too much violence. I love films with a lot more violence than Amores Perros, but in those movies it was appropriate and necessary, making for an interesting plot at least.

		<fullReview>What would you say if I told you that I watched a movie the other day where they tranquilized children and splattered them with fake blood while they tossed them around carelessly? Pretty damn twisted don't you think? So why was it acceptable to do that to the dogs in Amores perros? Dogs are very much like children they love and look up to their trusted caretakers. Yet the trusting dogs in this film are being abused for the entertainment of humans, not to mention their lives were at risk. How is this ethical for any living creature? "No animals were harmed in the making of this movie"? By whose definition? However dogs were in fact tranquilized for the death scenes. Although the dogs were "unharmed", tranquilization is not allowed under the AHA (American Humane Association)Guidelines for the Safety of All Animals in Filmed Media. AHA believes that tranquilization of an animal is a risk that they do not recommend for the purposes of film-making. Also, AHA's Guidelines are not utilized in Mexico. For these reasons, AHA has rated the film "Questionable". If this type of treatment is inappropriate for a human being (brutally being tossed around in the back seat of a car while tranquilized) it should not be done to animals either.</fullReview>
