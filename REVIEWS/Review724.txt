		<shortDescription>Pseudo-documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for an informative documentary on sleep paralysis, go somewhere else. The interviews in this film feel scripted and unbelievable, there is little to no scientific information or expert opinion on the phenomenon, and halfway through it begins focusing on the suggestion that these dreams could be caused by demons and can be stopped by prayer or by chanting Jesus' name.There is some decent cinematography and horror imagery though. It could have been a cool documentary if it had actually been a documentary. I was quite interested in the topic beforehand and came out of this film very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside the minds of the nightmare afflicted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleep paralysis is a variety of dream which can seize a person prisoner in a ghoulish and tactile hallucination. "The Nightmare" profiles a dozen such severely afflicted individuals and invites you into their brains.The recorded medical history of the disorder is touched upon in brief, only long enough to establish the subject's credibility. It's not a phenomenon that's been approached with much clinical discipline, and medical history is ostensibly not what this is a film about. It is instead fascinated with the experience itself, and the life these people lead. Mostly the movie plays out through vivid dramatizations of dreams recounted in voice-over. It gets hella scary as the volume of awful steadily rises. A common vocabulary of bad things runs through it all, which amounts to elemental nightmare fuel.This builds to the question of how his interviewees deal with their worsening condition. This film takes folks on an extreme of human experience and examines how they and then perceive their reality. What if sleeping meant you were attacked by demons? Would you explain it with cognitive science? Christianity? New age spiritualism? The film is patient enough to listen with interest and a sort of apathy to concrete answers.It isn't perfect. Particularly there's some intentional fourth wall breaking-behind the scenes that's labored and distracting. And there's one dream recreation technique of photo slide show that isn't as hot as the rest.But a unique experience of a documentary. Just watch it at night in the dark, don't be a chicken ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, I thought I was the only one... Very Very Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought was about the reasons people have sleep paralysis. I was watching out of sheer curiosity. I was a not expecting to hear the stories of unrelated people around the globe talking about the exact same things I've seen and experienced.The Shadow People peaked my interest. I turned to my friend and said, "I used to see those in my past up to a couple years ago, but the one I saw multiple times had a Quaker type of ha on his head". Right after my comment... guess who came up?Completely spellbound by these peoples recollections of their experiences. I shivered with goosebumps and the hair on my arms standing up... I thought I was all alone with these experiences.The film is presented in a typical documentary fashion but with great visuals of these horrific episodes. It sure held my interest.Because this documentary completely hit home with me, I give it my first EVER "10".Great job to the people behind this and thank you very much for making this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent documentation on a sleep disorder that is barely touched upon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nightmare comes from the directors of Room 237, the nutty theory filled documentary about Kubrick's The Shining. This time, however, they are focusing on a very real issue that plague a lot of people: sleep paralysis. A disorder that leaves a person awake, but the body is in full shutdown so they can't move or talk. This kind of disorder has brought upon many examples of frightening nightmares that seem to blur the line between dream and reality and it is a fascinating subject to learn about. However, despite a good presentation and creepy imagery, this documentary fails to enthrall and inform.Good: The movie has a sharp eye for creepy imagery. Every reenactment of the nightmares have a creepy atmosphere to them. Some of the shadow men were creepy and the scenarios can certainly prove to be quite frightful. It was interesting to hear how these people tried to avoid sleep paralysis and the various theories they had about what it meant.Bad: The documentary can get repetitive fast since the stories generally revolves around four types of nightmares. While it is not the fault of the people interviewed, it would have been nice to see a change up in the format. There was also a lack of true analysis of sleep analysis with the only information is talk about some sites and the personal experiences of the people interviewed which again didn't really bring much aside from the experiences. The movie also tends to rely on some cheap jump scares that I felt cheapened the movie a bit when the atmosphere was already enough to give out the creeps. The lackluster CG in some scenes also killed some of the vibes as well.Overall, it is an interesting documentary to watch if sleep paralysis is something that interests you or if it happens to you. Creepy imagery and interesting stories are plagued with a repetitive format and some cheap tactics, but it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed But Effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nightmare (2015) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Interesting documentary that caused quit the stir at the Sundance Film Festival. This documentary interviews eight different people from around the globe who all suffer from the same thing: sleep paralysis. Through their spoken words and re-enactments, we see their haunting visions as they go to sleep and find themselves unable to move and possibly be visited by demons.THE NIGHTMARE is yet another horror movie that has come along and has many calling it the scariest movie since (fill in the horror movie name). Director Rodney Ascher, who previously made the bizarre THE SHINING documentary ROOM 237, manages to bring his rather unique and original vision to this tale, which is part documentary and part horror movie. There's no question that the subject matter makes for a very interesting documentary and I found a lot of the stories to be fascinating. I mean, most people go to sleep to rest and find some sort of peace so just imagine if you dreaded going to sleep knowing that something terrifying and evil was about to visit you. Some of the stories told are pretty effective including one man who remembers as far back as being in a crib and seeing two figures standing over him.Shadow people are mentioned throughout the documentary as several of the people claim to have encountered them. They talk about these dark, shadow figures who approach them and of course the people are pretty much unable to move so there's nothing they can do to stop it. I think one of the flaws with the film is that we're really given no information on what this could be. There's a lot of speculation on what it exactly is but perhaps a sleep expert being interviewed would have helped.Another problem I had with the film is that the best stories are told right at the front when we're introduced to the character. After hearing their initial stories, what follows isn't nearly as effective and this is a 100-minute movie. Without any "outside" interviews, the stories become somewhat boring after a while so as a documentary it would have been nice throwing something else into the mix.With that said, THE NIGHTMARE is certainly worth watching once as there are some effective moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opinions, experiences, not necessary a traditional documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with interviews with people having sleeping disorders described as "Sleep paralysis", a subject studied but certainly not yet enough, or, perhaps, the knowledge is not substantial enough to very exactly what the therm, or condition, actually is.Where is the line to be drawn between "regular" nightmares, which can be truly terrifying, realistic and actually ruin peoples lives, and more "direct" experiences of attacks connected with sleeping stages and different peoples mental states, caused by stress, traumatic experiences (known or unknown)?Many opinions about this documentary, or what you prefer to label it, is "there's just a dude telling a dramatic story about seeing strange things when going to sleep, it's not real or scientific!" Well, take it for that then, and go in to this for what it is, in this case not a bunch of medical psychiatric professionals/professors stating what is actually possible or not, and not facts and proofs.It is well made though, compared to many other "documentaries" dealing with things not easy to scientifically prove. The people interviewed seems to give a true statement, as good as they can, of their experiences, and it's not accompanied by any dramatic narrator trying to push a certain theory as "THE Fact".It is actually quite scary hearing about these (real) peoples experiences, compared to plain fiction. I have friends who during stressful/painful episodes in their lives have experienced the very disturbing feeling of "dreaming while awake", so to speak, but that has always seemed purely connected to the fact that it is possible to have moments/lapses in rem-sleep, dreaming, and being completely awake. If you ask around, I'm sure many people can refer to some personal episode that's connected to this, and it is also how many medical professionals choose to describe it as. Several people I have talked with, having had complex heart surgery, for example, has had some of these kind of feelings afterwards. NOT, however, "beings" terrorizing them.Then there is the point "what you feed the mind with is what it will circulate around", and I mean certainly there is a connection in these kinds of experiences, as well as other strange happenings, that if you open your mind up to certain influences, it can affect you. That does not take a doctor to understand. I don't put a judgment in these particular cases concerning that.The scary parts in these stories is more related to actual strong perceptions of physical attacks from something, such as strong pain, voices, "beings" seemingly terrorizing/stalking them at night on such a regular basis. These experiences is not much commented by medical science (yet), because professionals studying it is very careful where to draw the line (not to ruin their careers, maybe...).For example, a leading professor can state that "there is probably multiple universes", but the same one would be careful to say "there is likely beings from other dimensions that can hurt you while you sleep".So, take it for what it is...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Documentary that Could've Been So Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who am I? I doubt you know me. For years I have struggled with the horrible experience of sleep paralysis. When I was around the age of 12, I had my first episode. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't even call my mom for help. I was fully aware. I had no control of my body. I was experiencing horrible hallucinations. I didn't know how to make it stop. Then, in an instant, it all just cleared.That next moment, I woke up my parents. It was around 3 am. I was squalling. I thought I had gotten a glimpse of hell. My mom didn't know what I was talking about. After that moment, I began doing some research on the phenomena and found out that it was, in fact, sleep paralysis. It terrified me and made me never want to sleep again. My mom never heard of the experience and though I just had a lucid nightmare. I didn't even sleep for the next night in fear of it happening again. It was, in a short explanation, absolutely terrifying.After a while, sleep deprivation had taken a toll on my body and I went to sleep afterward and the experience didn't happen again. I thought maybe it was just my imagination... But my consciousness during the situation said something else. It didn't happen again for a couple months. Now I, a 23 year old male, still have these experiences happen once every month or two; sometimes more often if I'm sleep deprived or really stressed. I have extreme fascination in these experiences and have delved into the interest of these experiences and others' reaction to them. My mom doesn't fully believe but after some of others' stories, she has become more open to the idea.Now I know that was a long, and possibly, unnecessary introduction to this review, but I feel it is vital to my rating because of the fact that I am so use to these experiences. I've become unafraid of them and when it happens I just brace myself and try to get myself to acknowledge these hallucinations are not real.So now, to the review. As I said earlier, I have a huge interest in this phenomenon and when I heard there was going to be a documentary about it, I couldn't wait to see it, especially with the great reviews it was receiving! I saw the trailer and almost messed my pants. It looked so similar to what I experienced and was so excited to hear others' recollections and what I was left with was a mediocre, pretentious, documentary that I was extremely disappointed with.Well, where to really start about this review? We begin with people talking about their experiences. There are several stories that are going on simultaneously, but it's never too busy, with some recalling the same shadow people I too experienced and caused me to lose sleep. The main problem with this movie you ask?Well the main problem and why I gave this a 4/10 is because this documentary is an hour and a half long. 45 minutes of this documentary is taken up by a guy that I doubt had a clue of what sleep paralysis is. He is recalling alien hallucinations he had as a BABY. Memories don't usually form until you have an understanding of your native language. Clearly he had no idea as a baby. Not to mention he clearly remembers what those aliens said to him. I'm not saying aliens don't speak English, but I highly doubt it, much less him remember it as a baby. It just seemed foolish and unbelievable. It kinda seemed like a mockery of this to me. Also, the other half of the movie was split between several people.. Why did he have such a huge time slot to himself with such a stupid recollection when there are several others who get probably 10-15 minutes of time a piece?Now the other half of the movie was pretty believable with some good, reliable, believable stories (even if they weren't, I still gave them credit for them). And it was effective in giving me chills by reliving my experiences every time I saw a shadow man on screen.So it should be a 5/10 right? No. I knocked off another point for the lack of a psychiatrist or a doctor specialized in the field of sleep disorders to discuss a scientific explanation on what exactly goes on during this state. This documentary seemed to have no credibility and it didn't help that it had a guy who remembered "tv fuzz aliens" as a baby, whom as I said, took up a majority of the screen time.In closing, let down is an understatement. This could've been my favorite documentary of all time, if not at least in a long time, and Rodney Ascher lets us down again like he did with Room 237. I guess I should've expected it, but he just solidified his place as a mediocre, pretentious, director. He made something scary and creepy as an experience that help give rise the horrifying Freddy Kruger into a dull, uninteresting, unbelievable documentary that had the potential, and yet, should've been so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part documentary, part horror movie, pretty entertaining and creepy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a little split on this one.. On one side, the stories, the experiences these people have had, some of them are downright chilling. 'Truth is stranger than fiction' really goes for this. You can't make this stuff up! (well, some probably could, but I doubt they have. Well, of course, it is the brain/subconscious of these people that are making it up. You know what I mean.. right?)On the other side, though, I found it to be slightly annoying that many of these people think that there is something paranormal going on. It's not. We know what sleep paralysis is. It's all in the mind. But most of the people that are interviewed, seems to think that they are seeing demons or aliens or something of the sort.So I was intrigued and entertained, then a little annoyed, then entertained again, and so on. Anyway!The visuals are great. There's some really creepy stuff. These people must have been terrified. I jumped pretty good at one scene, and I was creeped out a lot of times. It's not your usual documentary, it's a horror movie AND a documentary. It's made in a sort of playful way, and I was just entertained through out.Funny thing: I have this thing where I wake up at night and see some kind of hallucination for a couple of seconds, then it fades out. And the night I saw this I had one of those, it was some kind of creature lying besides me, opening it's mouth, the it faded away as it kind of slowly moved away and the mouth kept opening wider. But I'm used to seeing all kinds of weird stuff, so I immediately knew what it was. I also woke up several times during the night, being kind of confused. What I'm trying to say is: it made an impact on me.Conclusion: I liked it. Really creepy stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling but Uninformative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nightmare is a genuinely scary look into the real life experiences of people suffering with sleep paralysis. It's fascinating to hear first hand what it is that the victims are experiencing, particularly when you see how their stories overlap with shared or similar visions. The reconstructions that play also draw you into the experience yourself, so it almost plays out more like a horror film than a documentary.Therein lies my biggest gripe about this film, it's not really an examination of the phenomenon, just a retelling of a group of peoples night terrors. At no point is there a medical or scientific point of view on the subject; all the "evidence" presented is anecdotal. Not only this, the editing almost tries to lean toward a spiritual viewpoint, which is disappointing as instead of getting to learn about this condition it tends to feel more like a religious propaganda piece, going so far as to claim that the only defence against this particular nightmare is the word "jesus".Entertaining, but not overly useful if your hoping to learn something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly as much of a waste of time as Room 237.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's little here that's of any value by the end of the film. Waste of time, feels much longer than its stated runtime.I had hoped that the film makers would present the initial stories of the people suffering from sleep paralysis or night terrors or whatever they're experiencing before introducing a neurologist or researcher to explain more about the sleep cycle and what these people are going through. Instead, we're left with a wishy-washy bunch of unrelated and dissimilar ghost stories. It might have been interesting to hear about the history of night time visitations from monsters and demon and how those shifted into witches or aliens as time went on. No, instead we are told stories about how people claim to have contracted their nightmares from someone telling them them. We hear from a guy who claims that he and his girlfriend experienced a shared dream, and from people who were driven to Jesus by their demons. At least Room 237 made some pretence of trying to find outside "experts" to refer to .</fullReview>

The film has a lot of potential hidden in it but unfortunately the makers have failed to deliver the documentary that you can keep watching for a full 90 minutes. If you didn't understand my opinion by now then i will sum it up the easy way : The movie will get you bored a little more then 30 mins inside , i cant recommend it since it was made a little sloppy .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This documentary about sleep paralysis could have done with a bit more science</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This (horror-)documentary is about sleep paralysis, a phenomenon in which a person either during falling asleep or awakening, temporarily experiences an inability to move, speak, or react. A transitional state between wakefulness and sleep, characterized by muscle weakness, often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations and physical experiences. It's been a recognized part of human experience for centuries, but sleep scientists are only just beginning to understand the condition.'Room 237' director Rodney Ascher's documentary largely eschews hard science to focus on the emotional and psychological toll. He interviews eight sufferers whose lives have been upended by repeated bouts of nocturnal panic and vivid, inescapable hallucinations. 'The Nightmare' wants to be the first properly scary documentary, employing time-honored horror movie techniques in a concerted effort to spook the viewer. But it's here that Ascher slightly oversteps himself. While there is a well-maintained sense of lurking discomfort, the gotcha scenes feel a little cheap. In the end, a straight doc might have been more rewarding, but it entertained nevertheless.</fullReview>

I like horror movies and thrillers and so on, but this one gave me a few sleepless nights.The reason why I gave so poor rating is that this was not at all what I thought it was supposed to be. I was waiting for an informative documentary on sleep paralysis. Instead I got a bunch of scary stories on what sleep paralysis is for some people. And these were probably the worst cases. No scientific information what it is, no professional interviews etc. or solutions or anything good to show of this phenomenon. After watching a documentary I would like to know something more, now I know just that sleep paralysis is very very scary. This should have been marked as horror instead of documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing look into an understudied phenomenon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this documentary was very well put together. I liked the personal feel, it almost felt like you were along for the ride with the interviewer as he dug into these wild stories that were seemingly stranger than fiction. The editing was good as well in the way it hopped seamlessly back and forth through each interview to paint a larger picture of what sleep paralysis means to the sufferers and the commonality of their experiences. The theatrical reenactments were hokey overall but didn't detract from the main point of the film, set a spooky tone and made it slightly more watchable as it goes through the stories.As for the subject matter, I wish I could give this 10 stars! This was an incredible look into the anecdotal evidence that continues to support the enigma that is sleep paralysis. The director did a great job of portraying their belief of the significance of SP through the jarring stories recounted by actual SP sufferers. Some of the biggest hints revealed in this exploration is how SP seems to seed itself in others simply after sharing experiences verbally. I think this phenomenon would be well studied with a mimetic lens and would perhaps be aided by ideas from the fields of biofeedback and mindfulness. I think the way some interviewees describe the entity as consuming the substance of their fear is very powerful in portraying the mechanism of parasitism of certain types of memes. The experience of the interviewee named Forrest with the hippy girl and how he was given the message of not fearing the manifestations so as to not empower them supports the idea that somehow these manifestations consume fear or negative emotion. And perhaps more importantly it suggests a reason why humans all over this planet can be experiencing very similar details of their dreams (the colour red, red eyes, the shadow people). It is my belief that when you dream, your soul is activated by dmt that your brain produces and this allows the reduction of the conscious projection of reality. This allows you to receive information from the source. Some people would call this god or gaia, but to be clear it is the source of all consciousness and all beginnings stem from this point. In aboriginal cultures worldwide, there is the archetype of the "see-er". This is someone who is gifted with messages from realms between this one and the source and teaches humanity these messages and to "see" as well. I think that the people in this documentary are all "see-ers" to different extents and Forrest and the guy in plaid (sorry didn't catch your name!) are the most gifted. As for the message that is being received, I believe it is fairly clear. I think that first of all it should be realized that the powerful fear typified by these experiences is natural and very human but it is something that is meant to be overcome and not oppressing. This is proved when the shadow people are confronted they retreat immediately. So then why are SP suffers being constantly berated by such powerful themes of fear? Because it is meant to awaken them in their waking state and call reality into question. The guy in plaid said when he has these experiences, it doesn't make him want to go out and work a 9-5 (who would) obviously he isn't saying it makes him lazy but that he feels he doesn't ft into society anymore. So it seems axiomatic that these experiences are pushing us away from our modern construction of reality. It is my belief that the shadow people etc. are a manifestation of the illness that exists in human culture today and that is why each individual will attach a different narrative to the information they are receiving (i.e. the woman seeing a cat with red eyes and the guy in plaid seeing an 8' tall being with red eyes). Like the guy in plaid tried to explain, when they are in this sate they are receiving "raw data" as he put it, so the source information is always translated by the narrative of the individual. So a pretty heavy message overall but I think its actually a message of hope. and to me the fact that there is a place for this discussion in western media, albeit marginalized, is also very hopeful. I think the more we share stories like these, that really confront out beliefs about what dreams are and what reality is, the more room we have to grow scientifically and build a terminology of dreams. The next step I would suggest in studying this would be collecting severe SP sufferers on a broad scale and examining the egg results via machine learning and just see what kind of patterns come out. As well I think it would be wise to organize group therapy for SP sufferers with a base in mindfulness to raise awareness about these experiences internally and externally in the community.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Documentary it ain't. Where is the science?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had sleep paralysis (SP) for ages, since I was a boy. It is a recurrent thing for me. Yes, SP can be a terrifying experience. It can create a very vivid and a extremely intense feeling of dread and horror.But once one learns that SP is a sleep disorder, it is only one's brain playing tricks and that it is a benign experience (no one dies of it) and that it is not supernatural and there are no devils, evil spirits involved, it gets much easier to deal with it. But in this pseudo-documentary, the producers, writers decided to use a mystical, religious bias to describe and interpret SP. There is very little science, no actual effort is made to explain SP in scientific terms.This documentary is for the folks who do not believe in evolution and still think that Earth is flat, and that SP is related to alien abductions, spiritual events or all this new age mumbo-jumbo. The Wikipedia page about Sleep Paralysis is much, much better and more enlightening than this pseudo-documentary made, it seems, in the dark ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deeply unsettling exercise in empathy above all else - 'what does it feel like to suffer from sleep paralysis?' 'The Nightmare' uses the expressive possibilities and artifice of the medium to confront the viewer with a powerful insight into this terrifying phenomenon - otherwise closed off and utterly private. One of the participants mentions 'All the darkness looks alive' - a striking statement that somehow hits on the mood and ethos of the film. It captures something of the extra-temporal/spatial/personal weirdness of the experience, to which the film makers do an admirable job in bringing to 'life.' One can't help noticing that a lot of these reviews criticise the lack of a scientific perspective on top of the obviously dramatised nature of the interviews - in my opinion, kinda missing the point of the film. 'The Nightmare' doesn't try and be THAT kind of documentary; in part, it doesn't really ask us to understand, but to experience and feel, to get a flavour of sleep paralysis, expressible through the shadows and suggestion of fiction. You might also say that it acknowledges the kind of dream- logic that a lot of people tend to associate with cinema per se (traceable to the 'ghosts' and 'phantasms' of the earliest magic lantern shows) the perfect medium for such a subject. Anyway, this is very interesting and very scary stuff - just don't go expecting a PBS documentary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Big Picture of The Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nightmare follows eight people from around the world that are interviewed for questions on sleep paralysis. That, is what this documentary is. The Nightmare is a unique and eccentric horror/documentary that just creeps under your skin and can really make you shiver. The movie follows each of these people and from each one we are given a perception by the interviewee and how he/she has experienced sleep paralysis. This movie does exceedingly well in recreating the dreams and moments of paralysis as it's just incredibly creepy and freaky. I think the most notable part of this film if anything is in all the way it's been obligated and produced to provide great amounts of scary themes. It just works. And on top of that, the sleep paralysis topic is just great. It's so interesting to learn about something that only so many people will experience as sleep paralysis is barely touched on. But if you're looking for a strong and good documentary as well as a horror movie; The Nightmare gets the job done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and at times scary, but missing a side of the discussion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a documentary, yes, but it seems like its main goal is to be entertaining, not inform the audience about the science behind sleep paralysis (what little information there is out there, at least). While that's completely fine, I do think they should have at least had a mental health professional or sleep expert (or whatever they're called) weigh in at times. Once again, that it's fine that they kept the focus on the experiences of the subjects, but I do think that in the avoidance of including a professional and researched opinion, it does feel like they're giving some undue credibility to the "it could be paranormal" argument. They do interview some people who believe and explain the more rational side of things, but it still would have been nice to hear from a professional.I've had sleep paralysis a handful of times in my life, and once in particular it was absolutely terrifying and it did seem like there was something in the room with me. It actually took a few weeks for me to get over it, but it would have taken much longer to get over if I actually thought for a second that the experience was "real" in any way and not just an elaborate creation of my own mind. That's not to say that I think the documentary is in any way dangerous to those who are looking for an explanation, but I do think people should go in more expecting a horror movie, and less expecting an informative documentary. That being said, it is entertaining to hear all of these pretty terrifying stories acted out on screen. If that's your thing, you should give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The directing and editing on this documentary are very well done. Lots of really great horror imagery. I'm not sure if it's the people embellishing their stories or if the interviews are just scripted to begin with. But something feels incredibly fake about a lot of it. I really hate giving this a bad score. I was going to give a lower one but at least a 5 is average. Its a very well made movie, but some of the stories people were telling made me cringe with how made up they felt. Who knows, though. Maybe they did experience that. But for one reason or another, I didn't buy it. If you're interested in the topic of sleep paralysis, this is a decent watch. Check it out on Netflix. You might like it more than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those people who said that this film is scripted and unbelievable are the ones who have not experienced sleep paralysis. Only people with related experience can attest to the validity and truthfulness of this movie; and I'm one of those. Easier for other people to judge not until they experience it themselves. I experienced sleep paralysis when I was 23 years old. Followed when I was 25 years old. The last one, when I was pregnant and 30 years old. I kept it a secret because it's hard to tell anyone even your own family without them judging your state of mind. Only people who have the same experience can understand what I've been through. The evil like creepy shadows, hair-raising voice, temporarily inability to move or speak, body being paralyzed, evil presence, etc. are real. I'm thankful for this documentary knowing that I am not alone.</fullReview>

It makes one think of the possibilities that could explain this phenomena without dictating the explanation. Whitley Strieber never said he was visited by Ets but suggested dimensional beings or a brain issue may be his problem. This documentary has beautiful picture and sound and provokes the viewers' own answer. The people interviewed are genuine. The gentleman featured mostly has the most interesting story and no one there is happy with the experience. Perhaps our brains are developing or just being taken advantage of by physic tricksters. This movie made me ponder that. Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insult to the Very Idea of Documentaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From that particular synopsis, and the fact that IMDb and Wikipedia both confirm it, you might be thinking that this movie a documentary. Especially coming from "documentarian" Rodney Ascher (Room 237, which was bulls**t too by the way), it would be a reasonable expectation that The Nightmare would also be a documentary. Not just a documentary, but a documentary about something that is probably a truly terrifying experience: sleep paralysis.The film follows eight people suffering from sleep paralysis, night terrors and just your regular old run of the mill nightmares. With that being said, the word "paralysis" isn't spoken until 15 minutes into the movie, so many of the stories of these people's experiences are from when they were between 1 and 5 years old. I don't know about you, but my memories of my crib and infancy are hazy to say the least. Yet, these people have VIVID memories of being "visited" in their cribs and plenty of other things that I don't think fit into the things that are credible for a documentary.Also hurting this film's credibility is the complete absence of doctors, scientists, experts, or anyone who wasn't suffering from, and reading a lot into, these sleep disorders. There is absolutely no information provided about sleep paralysis or other sleep disorders from anyone's perspective but the 8 people who believe that there is more going on here than their doctors are telling them.Seriously, one of the subjects says "I don't believe the, like, medical explanation ?there has to be something more to it."All of the stories are presented as fact, complete with reenactments and there are absolutely no interviews with doctors, scientists or anyone who wasn't suffering from, and convinced of the reality of, sleep paralysis induced hallucinations. They even claim that melatonin is the chemical responsible for paralyzing you while you sleep, which is? completely untrue if my recollection of first year psychology serves me right. There is just nothing substantial enough to call this a documentary, not even in the open text of the film. There is just no real information given about sleep paralysis in reality. Just in the imagined horrors of these 8 people, and the director. The director ALSO suffers from sleep paralysis you guys, definitely no bias there.The documentary elements are just so absurd, one of the subjects compares sleep paralysis to an STD because he told a friend about it, and they started suffering from it. This is just what he says by the way, it's not proved at all.The one thing that I can say positively about this is that the reenactments actually do offer some satisfyingly creepy moments, and actually might have been a solid framework for a horror film. That could have worked, even presented as a mockumentary where everyone is up front about what the movie really is. That way you can work horror into the "documentary" parts of the film and created a really frightening experience. Instead, what we have is something you could call "a bunch of people talk about nightmares they had" more than a "documentary".The movie lacks all credibility, and where it might have succeeded as a piece of horror fiction, it completely and totally fails as a documentary. I know people have been saying "oh man, this was so f**ked man, it f**ked me up man" but you need to really think about it critically.This movie is bullsh*t, and that's really all I have to say about that.www.barleydoeshorror.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing that people with the fewest stars in the rating are the ones who watch this as a horror movie, and then call it cheap, scripted, etc...However if you are one of those people like me who have experienced sleep paralysis, it will most likely scare the hell out of you.I was bored out of my wits late at night and went through the few minutes of over a dozen shows and movies for about an hour until I came up with this. I was not in mood for horror or documentaries but after about 5 minutes, I ended up watching until about minute 55 and had to pause as it was already 3am, and I had no intention to sleep in the case I ended up with another episode of sleep paralysis. I read until sun up and watched the rest in the afternoon..Someone even mentioned it was scripted because someone decided to be a Christian because that's what saved them from the problem and so on, bla bla bla. I worked at halfway houses for 5 years while getting my bachelor's degree as well as my graduate degree, and I have seen there are many reasons simpler than that to take up religion, and if that person believes that it is reason enough to start believing in Christianity, then good for her. To me, she sounded sincere but then again, that is my opinion.It doesn't solve the problem, it doesn't really do much about it other than providing basic information (some details but there actually is nothing to provide except for the field of medicine labeling this as a generic "condition" and telling people to "change their lifestyles", that it's stress induced, etc...) while it describes the personal experiences of 8 individuals afflicted with sleep paralysis which I thought was very well incorporated into the documentary. It retains each individual story while cycling through all of them based on what is being described, and it focuses just enough on each story before moving to the next one so that you don't get too little or too much of any phase before you find yourself in the next person's shoes.For people like me who do have sleep paralysis, it is scarier than any high budget "original" horror flick mostly because you become aware of your own nightmares, and find yourself unsure as to whether just watching this will cause another episode. While some of the individuals' experiences were totally unfamiliar to my own, a few of them were almost identical to what I have been experiencing, and even though I really didn't want to be watching the whole thing (due to it freaking the hell out of me), I just kept watching in case there may be something to help me cope with my episodes better. Even though I have not found anything, it definitely helped me see that it is a more common occurrence than what I had thought (I only met 3 or 4 people in 50 years who have admitted to have experienced similar things), and got to see what others experience and how they try to cope (or not cope) with their own nightmares.I have been in wars while being in the army for longer than I should have, I live in the middle of nowhere by myself in 50+ acres (no reception for cell phone and a 1.5mb ADSL connection which basically is what I had in the early 90's until I moved to Eugene, Oregon that had a T1 in the whole town, and my 56.6k modems in the early 90's were more reliable than this connection), and if I do go out during the day (not just at night), I have to be armed since there are quite a few cougars, jackals, the occasional bear, and 1,000+ pound moose, and I am of course afraid of all of those as without any fear, the chances are that I wouldn't live too long. I simply fear them because they are dangerous and that is the smart thing to do, yet they don't scare me. The sleep paralysis though scares the crap out of me, and even though I have been experiencing it since the mid 1980's, I am as scared of one as I was during my first experience. The only thing I can be grateful for is that I don't have episodes as often as some of the people in the documentary, and mine seem relatively simple compared to some of their versions.If you are interested in learning about other people's experiences with sleep paralysis, I still think this is a well done documentary that is definitely not too superfluous, and that thankfully does not spend much time in the medical aspect of sleep paralysis since there is nothing medical about it other than having a medical diagnosis for it (since doctors don't even seem to have the slightest clue as to why it happens and how it can be controlled or cured, yet they had to go and label it with a diagnosis and even provide blanket statements to go with it). However if you are a sufferer of sleep paralysis, it most likely will scare the hell out of you and you may end up worrying about whether it will trigger an episode (hasn't in my case and it has been 4 days since I watched it), and it may be better not to watch it alone or after dark hehe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paralysed with Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Nightmare is a feature length docu-drama that examines the stories of people who experience chronic 'sleep paralysis', a condition in which one wakes up shortly after falling asleep only to find they can't move and are the subject of terrifying and realistic hallucinations.With imaginative and stylistically rich direction and composition we are taken on a journey, in the style of the classic tradition of a ghost story, into a realm that seems to blur the boundaries between the horrors of the screen and real life. In this way the film attempts to break down the fourth wall, emulating the way in which for the real life sufferer sleep paralysis destroys the boundaries between nightmares and real life.The genius of the concept is the fact that the director understands that the most terrifying horror films are those that we can believe on some level are real. By believing that it could happen to us (and the film makes no bones about suggesting it could) we are transported back to our childhood, where ghosts were real and the understanding that 'it's just a story' is of no comfort.But the film isn't just for thrills. There are indications that the director himself has experienced the condition, and the film succeeds in creating a sense of awareness for this real condition with sympathy, although that sympathy is mainly through scaring the crap out of the audience so we know what it feels like! There are also extremely interesting analogies drawn between sleep paralysis and the origin of beliefs such as alien abduction, demon possession and the notions of the spirit realm. One is left wondering whether or not this phenomena is the original horror story, the archetypal nightmare.Terrifying, beautifully constructed and thought provoking, The Nightmare certainly left me shaken and is not for the faint hearted.Best watched in the dark, and of course....in bed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like something out of the demonic realm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had sleep paralysis before, albeit a very mild and short lived version of what the interviewed members in this documentary have, and I didn't think it could be so traumatic and powerful for people.Apparently there are these shadow figures and different entities that could be present and haunt a person. And no one knows how to explain them or cure them. Which is pretty much what happened to me -- I started getting them when I was at a very difficult part in my life, and the weird thing is I would and currently only get them during the day. They are sexual in nature mostly, which is what one of the ladies in the movie said occurred to her (I wonder how much of this is tied to the Succubus and Incubus folklore), and my version of "shadow figures" are an old hag that watches me from a distance, or sits on top of my chest.Anyway, even going to a therapist gets you few solutions, if any. Sleep paralysis dreams seem almost unavoidable and solution-less.The way they reenacted the dreams in the movie were on queue though. They were genuinely terrifying and they almost had a fantastical quality to them, even though you realize that this is something people actually have to deal with mentally in their dreams. It's easy to see why some of these people go on to believing in some spiritual world, when they were previously secular.What was the scariest part about the whole thing was how even mentioning sleep paralysis to other people makes others start having it too. So it's almost like a mind virus that leaps from people to people just by words alone. Again, this sounds like something out of horror fiction, but sadly enough it happens in real life. I honestly hope I don't get any of these any time soon, but for what it's worth, the movie was pretty well rounded and informative about all of these different accounts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this movie not getting a higher score on IMDb? It is expertly crafted and hands down one of the most terrifying films I have seen in my lifetime. The only reason I can think of for people not liking it is that it scared them out of their wits and/or gave them their own nightmares. However, as the documentary makes clear, sleep paralysis is a terror far greater than an average nightmare. And many of the subjects in the film stated that the very act of describing their episodes to another person would set off a chain of events that reignited their affliction even after a period of dormancy.So, if you have ever suffered from sleep paralysis and wish not to conjure it up again, I would recommend skipping this title. Everyone else who is even remotely interested should definitely check it out. Undoubtedly, "The Nightmare" will give you a greater and more vivid understanding of the condition, while also providing a strong sense of empathy for the subjects featured in the film.

If you find this film scary, then save yourself some time and just type in "horror" into your Netflix or Amazon search box, and watch anything that pops up.Calling this film a documentary is a stretch, as there is zero professional medical info or research about the subject whatsoever.

		<fullReview>Ever had a bad nightmare? I dono, being chased by something, falling off a cliff or dreaming that something horrible has happened to you, we've more than likely all been there at some stage but whatever night terrors we've experienced, its highly likely they've got nothing on the subjects in Rodney Ascher's new documentary The Nightmare.Looking at a wide range of people who suffer from the mysterious yet undoubtedly creepy phenomenon known as sleep paralysis, Room 237 director Ascher mixes in interviews with sufferers of the condition and some suitably sinister re-enactments that try to convey what these unfortunate souls experience or have experienced in their sleeping lives.What strikes most vividly about these sufferers and subsequent re-enactments is the universal themes that run through their experiences. From similar figures, through to sounds and sensations there is too much comparable evidence to suggest that these people are just out right loons (even though some of them aren't what we'd call "normal").As we get deeper and deeper into these peoples stories and visions it becomes increasingly darker and Ascher evokes a consistent feeling of unease as the lines between dreams and out of body moments become more blurred but it's not enough to sustain the 80 minute runtime of the documentary.By the half way point it's hard to not feel as though everything that needed to be told has been told and without any real true effort to talk to professionals or seek to find out more about the history of this condition, Ascher's gimmick of recreating visions starts to wane and it's an unshakeable fact that the film could've worked a lot better in a shorter format or even a series of 4 or so episodes that each look at different aspects of sleep paralysis.At first intriguing and horrific, The Nightmare sadly descends into a repeated pattern that quickly becomes unfortunately uninteresting. One thing that the Nightmare does succeed in is in making us think twice about laying our head on the pillow for a good night's rest and for making us thankful we don't have hat wearing entities visit us on a regular basis come nap time.2 ? metal claws out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Documentary, Decent Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although 'The Nightmare' can be categorized as a documentary it does a very poor job at diving deeper in to material and exploring the given subject. No explanation or answers are given, instead the viewer will mostly be served "scary stories'' by 8 or so people suffering from sleep paralysis backed up by nightmarish visualizations and horror reenactments, jump-scares included. In other words, if you're looking for that late night goosebump fix you might get a kick out of this, otherwise steer clear, ESPECIALLY if you are prone to having sleep paralysis for this will only fuel it.Lastly my own views/thoughts on the subject are that sleep paralysis comes forth out of extreme fear. It has nothing to do with demons or ghosts or a dark figure with a bad fashion sense, it's just the mind losing control due to high levels of distress and fear. For the mind is a very powerful thing and therefor can be quite destructive and dangerous. So much so that we can't even comprehend the half of it. But that I do know is that I had recurring nightmares and night-terrors involving lamps when I was a kid, and once i hit puberty i stopped being scared because i started to feel older and stronger and having the feeling that i was able to beat the thing that scared me. Having these feelings, thinking this, makes you mentally stronger and therefor takes away fear which results in control. The people featured in this documentary seem to be doing the opposite and if they keep doing that they will never gain control over their fear. The only reason the (oriental) girl/woman at the end got out of it was by handing herself over to another powerful (and dangerous) mind set; religion. Who knows, if you she would have named another powerful individual like Superman instead of Jesus while being harassed by that "demon" she might have ended up religiously devouring comic books and getting in to cosplay. I'm just saying.</fullReview>

The (well-shot) nightmare imagery is fine, but the scare cords and screaming are unnecessary. It's hard to take this self-proclaimed documentary seriously when they use the same tactics a YouTube video would use (maybe sleep paralysis is just too scary to be treated in a dignified manner.) This is not supposed to be horror, these are supposed to be real experiences.Some of the interviewed people talk quieter than others, and with the jumpscares, you'll be constantly messing with the volume and note paying attention to the movie. I only heard half the dialog.As for the people complaining about the movie not being scientific, i don't see a problem with that. This movie obviously focuses on the experiences these people have, not the science behind it. That's what they set out to do, and they did it fine.I wish I could rate this movie higher.(Also, that YouTube video they showed was fake as hell.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling and entertaining, the monotony for its duration detracts as documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine: You are an adult. You rest your head on your pillow after a long day. Falling slowly to sleep, right at your most vulnerable, you catch movement out of the corner of your eye. In the doorway lurks a figure, a malevolently shrouded body leers toward you. You try to open your mouth to scream, but you can't. With all your might you try to will yourself out of bed away from harm, you can't. This is sleep paralysis, this is The Nightmare.When it comes to sleep disorders, most people have heard of night terrors, those dreams so beyond nightmares that people scream and convulse in their sleep. There is another, a lesser known disorder, a more sinisterly psychological sleep disorder. The Nightmare examines people afflicted with this malady, but not in your typical 'documentary' thematic. Instead, it delves deep into our greatest fears, springing to life those horrors that plague these souls, paralyzing them.This isn't your normal documentary, for though I've been put off by content or cringed at the realities of other documentaries, no other documentary has truly made me scared. There is something deeply unsettling about the individuals involved in telling their stories in The Nightmare. From all walks of life, with no connection to one another whatsoever, these people recount their experiences with striking similarity. This is where the horror of the documentary resides.The Nightmare doesn't pose its subject matter in a medical manner, it is with a horror aesthetic. While entertaining and disturbing, it is in this aspect that critics can comment on the negatives of the film. It doesn't follow the standard formula, so there is no true scope or comprehension of the disorder except through vignettes of personal accounts. It is easy to discredit these people as sick without the aid of experts, though the subjects relay pop culture aspects and obsessively research the historical reaches of their disease.The implicit conclusion of The Nightmare, drawn from the film's focus upon its subjects an how specifically and authentically they describe this horrific experience, is that sleep paralysis is perhaps not a medical malady but a greater, more malicious, occurrence. The documentary loses its strength with nothing to break it up, with Rodney Ascher's 90 minute film constantly and solely reliant upon the stories and their recreations and nothing else.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

SP visualization part is good, yet there are no scientific explanation given - just personal impressions of SP victims.Again it was interesting to listen to their interpretations, but due to lack of the scientific point of view, this film looks like one-sided argument based on victims' biased personal opinions.I'm sure it could add much more value (without making the film less spooky and suspenseful) if creators ask any medical expert in sleep disorder field to give his or her two cents on the subject.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much BOO! and not enough HOO?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've one sleep paralysis experience and I loved it. I understand that people who genuinely suffer may find this hard to believe! Yep, just one utterly fascinating example as an adult so I was very excited when I heard about this documentary and was thrilled to see that netflix had it available!Dropped everything to watch it. It would be dishonest to say I didn't enjoy, it did. It was creepy and generated plenty of goose bumps. However, it could have done all of that and still stuck to reality. All the talk of demons, aliens and other dimensions should have been counterpointed with the very extensive body of research that has been done on SP. This is the documentaries greatest failing and it is a substantial one; plenty of people who are genuine sufferers may mistakenly assume that the speculative opinion of these other sufferers reflects reality and that could be disastrous for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yawning disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was mostly hearing only good things about this one and it had a pretty good trailer and on paper it sounded like a riveting film to watch in the dark. Unfortunately, it was utter piece of garbage that I was barely able to get through. If you hate when people talk (bs- ing, if we're being honest here) about their dreams with too much excitement, this movie will aggravate the crap out of you. For me, it was like nails on a chalkboard for 90 minutes straight. In a sense, it was horror, just not the one I expected.Now, I watched some less or more disappointing movies this year, but none of those actually had me so much disappointed, "ugh" and "agh- ing" and face palming like this one. It's apparently a real documentary, but in a way that most of the people here are talking, they sound a bit scripted and the whole thing just looks like a fake documentary. But then again, there is that vlog from that girl on YouTube that's actually 3 years old, so who knows. Take whatever you want from that. But that's actually not the point.The point is that all the stories and people telling them are just not that likable. A bunch of people telling some cheesy stories about dreaming, sleep paralysis and all of them imbued with some implied (or outright spoken) supernatural woo was just a cup too much for me. Whole movie lacks some main narrative and it's just too long for something like this. Stories, oh, and the stories. Man, those were just the worst. Most of the, let's call it a "script" (even if the movie would like to call it "authentic spoken dialogue and monologue") is like it was written by a teenager.What I want to say, none of this sounds convincing, authentic and scary. I do find sleep paralysis a very interesting and scary concept in theory but it lacks some "oomph" in practice and I'm almost certain that this movie doesn't give it justice at all. Not only that, but a lack of any experts, scientists or at least some "credible" guests, it just looks like a bunch of people talking about their lame-ass dreams in repetitive manner, while trying to look cool, authentic, mystical aaaand - connected. Yes, one of the themes here is also that there are other people accompanying main characters on their waking dream quests, able to perceive other person's dream. Which is just naive, lame and dumb.Now, to give it at least some credit where the credit is due, movie did have some production value, looks nice and it actually had few really cool and scary visuals. But very few, very, very few... maybe like three... and one jump scare.To wrap it up, I was disappointed in this movie because I was expecting something scary, a bit educational and a bit cool, as it was promised in the trailer. But all I got was a bunch of adult people talking about their scary dreams shrouded in some mystical bull-crap and how it all means something, something supernatural. Then there is all that other matter of talking about someone's dreams is an uncool harrowing experience for a lot of people, me being included.They do reference a bunch of actually cool movies in here, like - Natural Born Killers, Nightmare on the Elm Street, Communion, etc. Watching any of those is a time better spent than watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than some fictional "horror"-stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed fine to start out with, but it quickly turned into a bunch of people re-telling all their different dreams and trying to make it seems like some demonic force is causing this, when it's nothing more than realistic dreams.So it's not a documentary about a sleeping disorder, it's just a bunch of people sharing like 100s of different weird dreams.No science, documented stuff, no nothing. It reminds me of "Goosegumps, where they all sit beside a fireplace and tell scary stories." And the dialogues, is seriously badly script.Bad documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It had potential, but it was not what I was expecting, so I found it dull.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I went to go see this movie because of another review I read that said it was similar to a movie called the BaBadook. It really is not. The movie is a documentary about sleep paralysis, and it interviews eight people with the condition, and goes over their shared experiences with it. It seems likes an interesting topic, although the Nightmare makes it seem that there was not enough info on the subject other than the experiences of the people who have it, which is most likely the reason why this doc overuses dramatizations overlapped with the people telling stories. The dramatizations were used to show how scary the experience was to the subjects. Each having a shared "dream" of shadowmen haunting them as they try to sleep. The dramatizations did not succeed in making we scared, however. It's definitely no The BaBadook.As a documentary, I'll give the filmmakers credit with being even with all the subjects. I could tell that the filmmakers were indifferent with one of the subjects, but they stayed fair with the material. The filmmakers also tired to film each subject's story within a narrative that they created, but this actually made some of the stories uninteresting due to lack of info. I like the subject matter, but I found the movie boring, and I wished I really liked it better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pineal Gland -- N,N-Dimethyltryptamin (short DMT)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't believe nobody mentioned this yet.There is a Substance out there called Dimethyltryptamin, or short DMT. It's consumed by indigenous Amazonian Amerindian cultures through the consumption of "Ayahuasca" for divinatory and healing purposes.People using Ayahuasca have the same experiences that are described in this Docu... its kinda like a Door into the Spiritworld, which is inhabited by light and dark beings. If you don't believe me, go to Youtube right now, and search for "DMT Trip Report"...there are thousands of them.And now it gets really crazy.You got a Part in your Brain (the Pineal Gland) that creates Dimethyltryptamin every Night when you sleep. It is an endogenous substance! It's in all of us, and it's the Stuff the Dreams are made off. You also get a very large Dose when you're born, and when you're about to expire. Check out what people say about Near Death Experiences. Floating above your Body, watching yourself etc... its the same Experience.You can even have a massive DMT-Trip without even taking the Substance. I had that happen to me around 2 Years ago in a moment of very deep sadness. When i began, it was a feeling like a Laserbeam from the Sky hit me right in the Face. I was paralized for a Short While, and then all those weird Patterns, Shapes and Formulas appeared. Voices and Whispers forced me to start writing a book (i never wrote anything in my life, and i can't really make much sense out of it today). I never had so much Clarity of Mind in my Life. It was a Feeling like God himself put the Blueprint of the Galaxy right in front of my Face. That whole experience lasted 10 Days, and it didn't happen again since then.I don't do Drugs btw, living Straight Edge, without any Substance at all.I found out when you don't fight it, like the People in this Docu did...if you use the Experience without Fear, and try to learn, more Doors will open, and you see more. Until it all stops.Its Duality, good and bad Stuff happen all the Time. If you lock one Side out, you will most likely suffer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very good made documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The nightmare is the one of few documentaries made on very important global phenomena, sleep paralysis. It includes the story of 8 real persons having this problem and their sleep paralysis experiences. It felt so real and scary. The documentary was very well made, great audio and visual effects. It showed a lot about this phenomena and it is very different from traditional approach, but still didn't explained much about sleep paralysis. Not recommended for children, or accompanied by children and people who live alone due to horrifying illustrations of this real world phenomenon. I really liked this documentary and I hope the director will make more about this issue. I give it 8/10. A must watch film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like repeating myself here but for this one it looks like I have to, and that's what hurts more then pain is disappointment and that disappointment is what I had for this documentary.The Nightmares is a documentary-horror film exploring the phenomenon of 'Sleep Paralysis' through the eyes of eight very different people. These people often find themselves trapped between the sleeping and waking worlds, totally unable to move but aware of their surroundings while being subject to frequently disturbing sights and sounds. A strange element to these visions is that despite the fact that they know nothing of one another, many see similar ghostly 'shadow men'.Every since I sawed the teaser trailer for The Nightmare I straight away was looking forward to seeing it as it's a documentary about nightmares and people's experience with it and documentary are normally interesting with the right tone and facts. The trailer scared the living crap out of me by it's scary looking creators that these people sawed in they dream and in the documentary they re- create those nightmares and they do look scary. Now after seeing and I got to tell you that it's...the most disappointing thing since Particle Fever.The Nightmare isn't a terrible documentary, it has it's scary and interesting scenes that will probably haunt you or get you listening more then scared. Some scenes that are really effective and that's to do with the re-creating the monsters, ghost or demons that these people dream about. I can see some people may like and find this documentary more interesting and scary and I got to admit I did in a couple of scenes. But I think most of the positive things I said sadly ends here as these such problems and a lot of things that could have been improved to make it more effective.Now for the problems and there's a lot: The one that kept taking me out of the documentary and made me question the whole thing is the fact that when these people who experience they worse nightmares ever and in the documentary they re-create it to show you as the audience what they experience, but here's the thing every single person in the interview who talks about they nightmare it's always them laying in the bed seeing this thing hover over them or slowly opening the door and walking towards them, after a while it got old really fast and I wanted something new like if they were getting chased by the creature or anything scary then just laying in bed as these something in your room, I mean is that what people dream of laying in they beds.The re-creation for the most part was really well done, but maybe too well done for it's own good. What I mean is that I noticed is that it's always darkly lit even when it's in a dark room you still can see everything in the room. I thought it will be more scary if it was pitch black and when you see this thing in the darkness it's more terrifying as it will put you in the same spot as this guy was experiencing it and I thought that may made it effective, but that's just me giving out ideas.A couple of times while watching the documentary I got a bit bored and started to get uninterested at some parts, because it was the same thing over and over again delivering nothing new just the same repeated pattern used way too many times. Not even the scary dream re- creations could scare me anymore.Overall The Nightmare was a huge disappointment and the documentary was kind of a dull mess and that's what upset's me more. Some people can watch this and maybe like it more then me and if you do like this then good for you, but for me it totally didn't live up to my expectation.</fullReview>
