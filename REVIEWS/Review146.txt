		<shortDescription>The Typical Unoriginal Hollywood Narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a totally fictional story that starts off with the phrase "inspired by true events". It's about as true as Forest Gump. The writing &amp; thought put into this movie was extremely lazy &amp; lackluster.As others have mentioned, the FBI agent seems to gain the trust of people with virtually no effort, apparently his smile just makes the "white supremacists" hearts melt. Being that Europe &amp; America are being flooded &amp; forcibly assimilated with the 3rd world en-masse at present, I think the anti-white director/writers/financiers felt the need to speed up the process &amp; get this anti-white propaganda out as fast as possible. As the whole program is getting exposed more and more day after day and they have to continue the narrative that opposing it means you're a NAZI! KLAN! RACIST! This expedited production could explain why it was so poorly written &amp; not very well thought out.The movie ends with a totally silly idea that someone who was extreme in NOT hating his race finally realizes that the genocide of his race isn't such a bad idea after-all.This movie is ridiculous &amp; will be put away in the evidence vault for future anti-white convictions</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassment for everybody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one's gonna leave a brown stain on Radcliff's resume. It's so bad, it's embarrassing to watch at times. Earlier, ericnottelling says that "was this written by a 3rd grader" - It's actually even worst. A 3rd grader could debunk this movie. The plot is so ludicrous, that it makes Harry Potter feel like a believable piece of reported documentary. Like Eric said, everybody loves that young scrawny punk for no reason - have a chamomile tea (lmfao) with the nazi leader, and suddenly the dude is going to tell you his secret master world domination cunning plan and includes you in the A-team because you got a liking in classical music. Radcliff really struggles with his role, and I can't totally blame him, the script is a disaster. In opposition of movies like American History X, that put Radcliff in the junior league compared to Ed Norton, the Bieber one. Although, I can understand at some extend Justin Bieb having fans,but I could not fathom if somebody comes with something positive about this pathetic flick... Don't waste your time or money with this - even free, this is still a waste of electricity and time you never could get back. Cringe level 10. Hogwarts Wizard ain't no KKK Imperial Wizard.The only thing that is not disappointing with this movie is the constant way it's falling apart. From a seemingly promising beginning, it goes there on a downward slope to an ending that is the one of a Scooby Doo cartoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea for a movie, but poorly written, directed, and acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a film about a conflicted FBI agent infiltrating a modern day white supremacist revolutionary group, seek out the far superior 1988 Costa-Gavras film "Betrayed"The script follows a basic Screen writing 101 format. Toni Collette, as a cliché seasoned FBI agent bucks the system and all her superiors who stubbornly dismiss her ideas, and she recruits an inexperienced young agent, played by Daniel Radcliffe, to infiltrate local white supremacists on the hunch that, just maybe, they are responsible for missing weapons grade radioactive material.Fine... I'll swallow this premise if they can make it somehow realistic and interesting. Nope. The film makers not only showed almost no understanding of how the FBI operates, what these organized white supremacists actually do, but also little regard for common sense. This inexperienced FBI agent manages, not only to infiltrate a group of thuggish skinheads, but also to rapidly rise up and infiltrate an organized separatist militia, but an inner circle of careful planning terrorists... all very quickly and easily, simply because the film makers were too lazy to write realistically and just wanted to move things along.Radcliffe's undercover FBI agent character, for some insane reasoning of the writer, uses his real name and identity to infiltrate, and does not use any documentation to support his phony backstory of military experience. It also seems as if the only direction he was given was to constantly fidget and look nervous and scared at all times... as though this constant erratic guilty behavior wouldn't worry even the dumbest of people he was trying to fool. It is lazy storytelling wherein events unfold and problems are resolved with great ease, because showing the difficulty of infiltrating and investigating would require the film makers to actually think through their story.Yes, the subject matter is important and the threat of homegrown separatist groups is a serious threat... far more serious than this movie even seems to understand.Important subject matter is no reason to overlook bad film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Radcliffe is just too nice to fit the role...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never heard of the story that this film was inspired by, it's really difficult to trust the writers, even though that one of the writers is the narratives subject.Nate Foster, a young, idealistic FBI agent, goes undercover to take down a radical right- wing terrorist group. The up-and-coming agent must confront the challenge of sticking to a new identity while maintaining his real principles as he delves Depp into the underworld of white supremacy......I mentioned not having heard of the story simply because I'm unsure of exactly when the events in question happened. And this is where the big problem lies, Radcliffe is woefully miscast as Nate, he's just too nice, and there are times in the film where he gives the game away several times. I'm no expert on undercover police work, but to come out of character several times in criminal company is both dangerous and unprofessional.If the true events happened 10-15 years ago, then Bale would have been perfect for the role. Radcliffe is a wonderful actor, and he's overcome that difficult task of ridding himself of Potters ghost with other works, but here, he never shows the menace, the anger, or the fear that his Nate should have.And in turn, the films message, and the acts committed by the extremist groups just seem worthless.It should be a tough watch, a compelling film, with a dangerous streak running through the narrative, but instead, your yelling at Radcliffe to act less like a rabbit in the headlight, and more of a professional F.B.I agent.The film had potential, but the casting is terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. After reading the many other hateful opinionated white reviews I can only think one thing, all these stupid people believe everything they see on TV. Scared by the people who's job it is to make us feel safe and taken care of. Forget about what you think of the acting and focus on the problem it illuminates. Hate and fear only brings about more of the same. All races kill each other for one reason or another. Justified by religion or race or any other reason that helps them sleep at night. Put down your smart phones and look up. Hold the door for someone. Smile and say hello to anyone you meet. Say please and thank you. So many people feel entitled to everything. We all want the same thing. Until we start realizing we are one of many, this hate and pain will never end. There has always and been, and always will be, people of different colors and dialects. Fix yourself before you start judging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I understand the negative reactions, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed it. For various reasons: 1. It's inspired by the writer of the movie, Michael German, who is the retired FBI agent that did live as an undercover agent. 2. Daniel Radcliffe handled his role well. It seems the young yet experienced actor is attempting to step away from the Harry Potter image, not in a desperate attempt, but more so to show his ability as an actor. 3. The roles other actors played are very convincing. Handled the parts they planned and kept up with everyone else's role.Only side note I have is it's the director's first full length feature. The story seems rushed because it's a short movie and there are no time line markers to help express the time going by. Just remember, this story is in a longer period of time. Events happen that aren't on screen. He doesn't gain the trust of the group after three sit downs. There's a line in the movie "After all that I've gone through" while Daniel is talking to Toni's character, which helps entail there is time passing that we aren't fully aware of. It's low budgeted, yes, but it was done well for his first. I'm sure as time goes on, we will see more and better movies from the director. Best hopes and wishes. I always love watching directors make their first and then come off the game strong. Good job, excellent even. I'll be looking out for your next feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Victimhood - a little spoliery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should have been a bit better than it is - it's not bad, not bad at all - but it's just not quite as impact-full as it should be.Some of the dialogue is quite deep and the films message is pertinent - hint, it's not really about neo nazi skinheads, well it is, but it's not really. It's about the true heart of fascism, beyond the history, myths and conspiracy.What is interesting is that it makes you realise that victims are more likely fascists than bullies - that any group that claims to be the 'victim' is probably nurturing some level of fascism.It's interesting food for thought but, as I mentioned, isn't quite as powerful as it could have been - just needed that little bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperium is a powerful drama that will interest those who follow domestic terrorism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Radcliffe at first might seem like a poor choice to be cast as a skin head/Nazi, but in fact his characteristics make perfect sense in the film. Radcliffe is a young FBI agent that is chosen to infiltrate a local white power movement to prevent a credible domestic terror threat a la the Oklahoma City bombing from the 90s. This is not an action film with brawls and fire fights; this is a drama that tries to honestly show those involved in the white power movement. Overall this film is engaging and engrossing on its own, but also challenges itself by giving these social villains some screen time.It is a very standard film in terms of plot, this is not a film to watch and expect twists and turns. But it tells a very compelling story through character. Each white power figure we see has their own ideas, goals and as the story progresses it shows us not only about white power, but racism and any type of extremism as well. Sam Trammell, Chris Sullivan and Tracy Letts are all brilliant in pulling us into their lives and succeeding in avoiding the obvious stereotypes that all too easily could happen. The scenes of Edward Norton trashing convenience stores and killing from American History X are left out, these are men with families, family/financial problems, hopes, dreams and its fascinating to see how their sometimes noble goals are corrupted into extreme racism.The weak point is the ending, and everything has to be knotted up in a 2 hour film. This has the feel of the first 2 episodes of an HBO mini-series. I was left only somewhat satisfied, and genuinely curious about what would happen to each character next ? and I guess that is good film making.Eye opening and well directed. If you are looking for a drama with almost no action, that mostly avoids cliché pitfalls (other than the obvious but well enough done ending) then this is your flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really great film. I enjoyed it a lot. Though I must say I was kinda shaken ( which I am sure is the intention of the ones who made it) by all the imagery of Nazis and neoNazis in the film. Daniel was really good. I must say I did not watch the movies he is most famous for or everyone knows him for but less known ones where he is always on very different roles ( psychopath, killer etc) and this role suits him just fine. All other actors did a great job too.As for the film - it is interesting, not boring a minute, greatly paced. It relies more on the psychological frame of 'suspects' which is a good thing. No unnecessary action / violence which I also liked. The twists ( two, three minor ones) were good and I must say that nothing was predictable for me - which is great.Maybe a good soundtrack to the film would add to it to be even better.Minor minus is that we don't know what happened to all the other 'suspects' that he first joined and later with that camp leader. The film does have an end, but I felt that those people were somehow forgotten in the end and they were a big part of the film.All in all, nine from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is really only one essential ingredient to fascism: It's victimhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My advice to anyone intending to watch this movie is to throw away your racial lens altogether. I know it's bloody tempting not to what with the war of social ideals raging on in...not just American society, but societies around the world in general. I went into this film thinking it would be a thought-provoking, intense social commentary. 10 minutes in I was convinced it was just more dime-a- dozen, race-baiting regressive drivel. By the end, I realised the film carries much more weight if you ignore the racial aspect altogether. This realisation was confirmed after my second watch - yeah, I'd recommend a second watch (as long as your personal tastes don't detest the film as a whole).Daniel Radcliffe plays Nate Foster, an FBI agent tasked with infiltrating a white-supremacist group suspected of plotting a domestic terrorist attack. Right off the bat I am personally a fan of Radcliffe and while I'll acknowledge he wouldn't be the first I would cast in the role, I enjoyed his performance. As for whether the character he plays would have held his own in a real-life infiltration scenario...well, that's not so convincing. I think the criticism of the character being too likable as well as the ease at which he is brought into the fold is well founded. I'd attribute this more to the writing than Radcliffe's performance although I do have a bias there.In terms of general storyline and plot it's fairly formulaic so don't be expecting many twists and turns. The suspense is there but it's also relatively tame considering the situation Nate is put in. Supporting cast performances were all good, despite their characters being somewhat generic, although I did particularly like Sam Trammel's character and the conflicting opinions he engenders every time he has a scene with Radcliffe; He's a loving dad who likes listening to classical music right up until the point where he slaps you in the face with a swastika.If you didn't take my advice and kept your race-tinted glasses on throughout the entire film, let me explain why (I feel) you missed out. At the end of the film we see the potential Hitler youth character reformed in his way. The way I see it, this kid isn't reformed of his whiteness - he's reformed of his supremacy. This film is about the dangers of extremism and fundamentalism, period. If you think this film is just more anti-white propaganda, try not to deny reality and claim these fundamentalist groups don't exist. Similarly, If you adore this film for the way it "exposes" white hatred domestic terrorism - I'd implore you to consider one of the closing quoteables in this film and one that in my view really makes this film particularly relevant - "There is really only one essential ingredient to fascism: It's victimhood." Remember it next time you watch the news because those of us with our heads screwed on straight know for whom the victim complexes are the greatest. Perhaps some food for thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a white man myself and having some of the same beliefs as the supremacists being portrayed in this movie... i was deeply ashamed of myself after watching this.But i decided to change my ways and not play the victim role any longer! Just like the example given near the end of this movie. So i went through my whole house with the purpose of getting rid of all my Nazi material, all the outlawed books and hate mongering movies and the swastika's and... i couldn't find any of those items... who stole them?!?Then i remembered, wait a minute i thought, I'm no supremacist 'mud people hating' guy... what's going on here...?I then realized i was brainwashed by the stereotyping and oversimplification of all the serious topics in this movie. I had made some serious wrong associations between my own beliefs and what the movie shows. Luckily i recovered after i engaged my brain again. It seems to have been shut off during the entertainment movie watching time.For this i have to give the movie 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intense, Volatile &amp; Provocative Crime Thriller, Ruined By An Uninspiring Finale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the most part, Imperium was going amazingly well. Palpably tense &amp; featuring a provocative premise, it is a shame that when it was time to detonate the bomb which had been on the verge of explosion for a while, it decides to cop-out and takes a detour instead, thus ruining the entire journey its audience invested in.Imperium tells the story of a young FBI agent who decides to go undercover to find leads on some missing cans of a radioactive material when a connection appears between its disappearance and a white supremacist group. But in order to foil whatever it is that those fanatics had been planning, he needs to immerse himself into the spiteful culture.Written &amp; directed by Daniel Ragussis, Imperium marks his feature film debut and it would've been such a terrific start to his career had he managed to finish things off with a better climax because, considering everything that came before it, the ending is just not worth the wait, and finishes this tale on a rather uninteresting &amp; underwhelming note.Nevertheless, to give credit where credit is due, Ragussis expertly demonstrates that he isn't just capable of creating a nail-bitingly tense atmosphere but can sustain it too for as long as required. His direction is brilliant but his screenplay feels like it is missing the final chapter. The themes are disturbing but it is addressed in a very sensible &amp; calculated manner.The movie offers quite an insight into the white supremacists' culture &amp; activities, and tries to illustrate it from the inside out. Despite what its charged ambiance may suggest, there isn't much violence in the film but a number of scenes are inflammatory. And all of it is further fuelled by is its kinetic camera-work, taut editing &amp; a surprisingly intense leading performance from Daniel Radcliffe.On an overall scale, Imperium is a highly gripping, thoroughly engaging &amp; often unnerving cinema that is crafted with confidence and remains volatile for the majority of its 109 minutes runtime but is unfortunately marred by a weak finale. Still, it is a hopeful start for the new filmmaker in town &amp; is possibly an indication of better things to come and solely for Radcliffe's strong input, this crime thriller warrants a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I think the people who say Radcliffe isn't right for this role missed the point entirely. In my opinion, the movie wasn't to get deep in the "undercover" police work of the main character, it seems like the movie is to show you some of the logical beliefs of white supremacist groups. It seems the show you different positions of characters who you can relate to in the real world. There are times in the movie that you are watching and say to yourself, I see where he is coming from with that view. It humanizes people who we look at as animals. That was his role as an undercover agent. It wasn't to be an extreme skinhead who hated other races, it was to be a logical individual who wanted what he thought was best for his race and he portrayed that aspect well. I do feel as if he asked a lot of questions upfront that I think would have hurt his cover BUT, for what he was bringing to them in the movie, it is plausible</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperium is spectacular!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imperium is a suspenseful thriller of a movie that thrills you to the edge of your seat before you realize you're so close to the edge of almost falling off. It takes into account that the people depicted in the film are humans and the main character, FBI agent Nate Foster (played by the very talented Daniel Radcliffe), has to infiltrate and humanize them in order to get closer to them to stop a dirty bomb. The events in the movie are relevant to what's going on in today's society throughout the world. Even though the general public focuses on foreign terrorism when they think of the word "terrorism," the film emphasizes that foreign terrorists are not the only ones that are a threat.The story line is flowing through the growth of Nate and shows the compelling side of what it is like to go undercover to infiltrate the white supremacists group and the emotional/psychological toll it took on Daniel's character. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast as the main character. Everyone thinks of people like Matt Damon, Pierce Brosnan, or Christian Bale to be an undercover agent in a movie, but Daniel brings it closer to reality with his portrayal. Daniel's Nate Foster looks like someone that is your neighbor, an everyday normal guy with a life you have no idea would include working as an undercover agent for the FBI. His height plays a metaphorically physical factor of emphasis of how dangerous the task at hand is, how much he has to take on in order to get the job done, and to make the white supremacists take Nate's word for it and believe what he says. For that, it is the perfect match for Daniel to have been hired for this role.The movie is doing just what the director wanted, getting people to talk about their views and perspectives about the topic of domestic terrorism, which for some could be hard to discuss. Everyone is entitled to his or her own thoughts/opinions on the film. This is another form of art and whatever you get from watching the film, go for it. If you are looking for a thriller movie full of entertainment and possibly a bit of enlightenment either on the possible difficult topic shown in the film or enlightenment towards how awesome and far Daniel has come since his Potter days, this is the film for you. I have seen it twice so far and plan on purchasing this film when it becomes available for purchase through online distributors.</fullReview>

The script follows a classic "hero's journey" and yet does so skillfully enough that it doesn't feel contrived.

This is a great theme for a movie but they just didn't ever give the viewer the idea of just how incredibly dangerous and insane these people are. Most of the neo-Nazi crowd are morons, in fact all of them are morons but they have one advantage over normal human beings and that is the fact that they aren't really human. We don't really see this in the film.The pacing is dreadfully slow throughout and a few gratuitously violent scenes would have helped in this department. When they finally make the arrests it's such an anti-climax that you hardly understand that this is the end of the line. So a very slow burn leading up to a very minor event just doesn't add up to a memorable movie.</fullReview>

The shooting style immerses you into the scene and never ceases to make you care, even sometimes uncomfortable. This isn't an easy or one-sided topic to take on in a film, and I can see why it would cause controversy.

The movie lacks any real tension, any climax, any action and any reason to root for the "good guy" It is bland and has the feel like it was written by a 3rd grader as none of it connects in any interesting way.

This film will takes you on a ride that does not let up from the opening scene all the way to the end. It explores incredibly timely issues and themes that are relevant to both U.S. and global political and societal events.If you like intelligent thrillers that takes you on an exciting and challenging journey this film is absolutely for you. The topic of domestic terrorism is rarely explored by the media or in film or TV. Imperium takes us into the dark corners of a current American reality that everyone should be aware of. Go see it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much action for an action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, before I start this review I must stress that I have never been a MAJOR Daniel Radcliffe fan. I must also say that this is my 2nd or 3rd ever movie review as I'm generally too lazy to type reviews haha.I saw the trailer to this and thought " Wow, Seems like a good movie full of action and against terrorism which,unfortunately is over the news almost daily" I'm not a huge action movie fan (my fav genre is thriller/horror) but I am a big fan of movies like "Olympus has fallen" and "London has fallen" , just to name the latest.This film dragged on a bit and I kept waiting for the action. Where are the bombs going off ? Where's the police chase down town ?. I think it was a let down and it's a shame as the story line had plenty of potential!Hope you enjoyed my review, I just don't want many others to waste their precious time :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unabashed Anti-White Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the first few minutes of this film, there's a scene where FBI agents are talking about how Islamic terrorism is a minor thing, not really a problem, while then suggesting that white terrorists are the real threat. They even suggested that white skinheads wanted to create a radioactive dirty bomb to kill thousands of people. LOL, you can't make this stuff up...well, Hollywood apparently can! Walked out after about 15 minutes and got my money back. It's amazing how much anti-white trash is released on film and TV nowadays. The leftists, Hollywood, and the media are doing everything they can to insult and denigrate white people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10/10 in my book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie buff myself, I'm not going to lie I've downloaded almost every blockbuster as well as some better B+ movies since in I was 18, I'm now 26. I have reputable job as an Information Technology Specialist for the U.S. Army but that doesn't sway my beliefs or opinions either or. This movie I believe should be compared to classics like, "American History X", the facts and opinions portrayed in this movie gave me a sense of self belief and concluded a lot of my thoughts on the racial tendencies we have today. In some way or another it gave me some closure to the opinions I've had with the most current racial events. This movie really opened my eyes to the world we live in and what goes on. So my 10/10 stands strong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eye opening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've been waiting for this kind of movie which is not only suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, Its relevant in this time in the US, UK and other parts of the world. What I love about this movie is that fact that it teaches not to judge at first sight and also tells us to look beyond what we see. "Just because you are not looking at something, doesn't mean its not there". What a powerful phrase! America needs this and will definitely see what they've been blind to. Powerful movie. Daniel Radcliffe also gives us a part of him that I think many haven't seen so we're excited to see him taking on different roles like this one! Definitely an eye opening film and will definitely be watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely abysmal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why Hollywood continues to give Harry Potter (sorry, Daniel Radcliffe) money and starring roles is beyond me. He's Harry Potter in every role, as wooden as Pinocchio before the fairy godmother got all creative. This film sucks. The story line is weak, the acting is on par with the good ladies and gentlemen of Sunset Beach and everything else, the direction, the music, the costume department - atrocious. The only good thing I can say about Imperium is... nope, I've got nothing. Kinda reminded me of Green Street but that's an insult to Green Street. I hear Swiss Army Man is good, probably cos HP is dead throughout, maybe he'll be typecast in every role following Swiss Army Man. Once can only hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incorrect Display of Events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting that a movie based on "true events" can be so horribly wrong. A quick research into some of the events and things that took place (Such as Timothy McVeigh) proves that the movie is blatantly lying. Is there a reason why they're attempting to push the liberal agenda of demonizing the KKK while downplaying the actual issue of Islamic Terrorism worldwide?Extremely disappointed with all the actors, director and writers for this. They could have taken the truth and portrayed that on-screen however they decide to take the opposite route and ruin what could have been a decent movie.</fullReview>
