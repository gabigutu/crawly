		<shortDescription>So entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American western seems to be slowly making a comeback in recent years. With films such as The Rover, Slow West and True Grit there have been some interesting and unique approaches to this old genre. Hell or High Water fits right in with these mentioned films by containing a lot of comedy, engaging characters, and no holds barred violence. Chris Pine and Ben Foster as the bank-robbing brothers share great chemistry and draw sympathy from the audience with compelling performances. Jeff Bridges stands out however as the hardened cop tasked to track down the brothers. His racist slurs and aggravated man persona works perfectly with his gravely, yet genuine voice and he finds perfect timing in his comedic delivery. The music, done by Nick Cave is also perfect. After crafting one of the greatest scores with Assassination of Jesse James, he gets pretty close to that here with very foreboding and meditative music. Especially right before the big showdown. And when it all goes down, the film will have you on the edge of your seat. It doesn't hold anything back and people die out of nowhere. It's very realistic and is worth the tension filed build up.Hell or High Water is a surprisingly great American western. Hell or High Water (2016) Directed by: David Mackenzie Screenplay by: Taylor Sheridan Starring: Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster Run Time: 1 hour 42 minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and Engaging - Great Addition to the Crime Drama Genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Taylor Sheridan as the writer and David MacKenzie at the helm, I had high hopes for this movie. Both of their last respective projects (Sheridan - Sicario, MacKenzie - Starred Up) were gritty, violent, and engaging. All of those hold true for Hell or High Water.The main characters, Chris Pine and Ben Foster turn in great performances. Ben Foster plays the ex-con brother. And as usual, he turns in what I think was the best performance of the movie. He has a knack for playing a top notch supporting role, and often times gets overlooked. Chris Pine also nails it as the more straight laced brother. For a pretty boy of Hollywood, his portrayal is authentic. Jeff Bridges also compliments these two well as the older, sort of jaded officer. Both him and Foster even provide a good amount of laughs, but neither overdo it.The setting of the movie really sets it above others in the genre. I would say this movie is more crime/drama or heist film than Western, but it definitely has a Western vibe due to its northwest Texas setting. The area has been hit hard by the recession, a failing farm industry, and big oil. It all makes the recklessness and danger Foster and Pine engage in that much more enjoyable, and even sort of relatable. The audience can at least sympathize with them as they do what they think is right. Overall, this film is well worth a watch. It can be put in a league with more recent films like The Town, Drive, and The Place Beyond the Pines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You need to see this movie. That could be this entire review, but I think I should describe how amazing this film is. Unlike most summer movies, the writing is fantastic, keeping me and the rest of the people watching with me attached to the movie and its characters even when they are just talking in a diner or something. Also unlike most other summer movies, the movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or stupid action scenes, it creates tension in the form of dialogue and sometimes in the form of brilliantly filmed action. It should be noted that the cinematography in this film is truly amazing. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the movie is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this movie. The writing of this film is where it really shines. The writing is captivating and it is so natural, for the area. The banter between both pairs of characters (the brothers and the rangers) is very entertaining in that you can almost feel their relationship and the history of it. Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, who are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. Also, the acting is definitely some of the best I have seen, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges both really shine in the film because of their stunning acting. The acting helps in that when Chris Pine and Ben Foster are mid- heist you can really feel the stress when they get into situations that one or both of them are not comfortable with. In closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing, everything. This film is just beautiful and you really need to see it, like yesterday, it is easily the best film this year and a major contender for Best Picture, Best Director, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing like a real great modern day western movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look at Chris Pine trying to prove he's not just a pretty face doing these small films that show his range, and show how he can do accents, but seriously, Pine was totally in his element here.Jeff bridges gave a great performance that matches his cowboy ethics in True Grit, playing a very old school Texas Ranger hunting down Pine and Ben Foster who play brothers robbing banks. A little in the Archie Bunker Territory when dealing with his Mexican, Native American partner, but all the way likable.Ben Foster was fantastic as well,as the bad apple big brother looking for redemption. Very dynamic acting, by all three main actors.The music really adds to the cool western feel, putting me in the cowboy mode. I thought it was interesting that they had one scene in the movie in which real life cowboys herding cattle appear, in a movie about the movie style cowboys, and it's some real cowboy stuff going on here.It's very macho without turning off the indi crowd that would love this film. There's a scene in the movie when Jeff Daniels Character confronts one of the bank robbers and it was like Eastwood and Wayne back in the day, man. It just wraps up the whole vibe of the movie in one swoop. I feel like it's the type of movie everyone in Texas should love.And it's very Texas (or rather what I expect from Texas): every dinner only sells streak, It's hard to be a armed bank robber because at least two people in the bank carry a gun. The film does use Texas as a perfect pocket for all American life with the bank robbers having a bigger agenda to save the land they own and secure a future for their family, screwing over the bank that's screwing them.It has the same appeal of the Timber when it comes to today's Westerns, but it's setting in contemporary times but with that old fashion tone gives it an edge.http://cinemagardens.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly original, brilliantly acted, thoughtful western/crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a summer (or should that be year or decade) of vapid sequels, remakes, and overblown superhero catastrophes, who would have expected an entertaining, intelligent, well-crafted, suspenseful, character- driven, modern-day western with a brain. Riding on Taylor Sheridan's razor-sharp script and David Mackenzie's nuanced direction, Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and (especially) Ben Foster (along with everyone else who appears on the screen) inhabit this film as wryly humorous, heartfelt, vicious, painfully tragic, and realistic members of a society reaping the fruits it has tragically sown. Best film so far this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Mackenzie's 'Hell or High Water' is A Terrific Movie, that turns out to be an unexpected delight of the Summer. With underwhelming superhero movies or reboots doing the rounds, this Heist/Crime Motion-Picture offers a Solid Story, that is Sharply Written, Expertly Directed &amp; Very Strongly Acted. 'Hell or High Water' Synopsis: A divorced dad and his ex-con brother resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's farm in West Texas.'Hell or High Water' is a story of family &amp; crime. You watch the 2 brothers rob banks, as they are tired of being poor &amp; they indulge in aggression. And then you have Two Texas Rangers, after them, because they're wearing a uniform &amp; they serve for the protection of the people. Its the difference of dynamics between its characters that make 'Hell or High Water' a solid watch. I wan engrossed by the camaraderie of the 4 characters, they are interesting to watch &amp; hear. 'Hell or High Water' is perfectly paced, as the narrative hits the nail &amp; culminates in a crisp 101-minutes. The film begins with a punch &amp; ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story &amp; how well it progressed. Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is Sharp. His Writing is tops, allowing us to get into the story &amp; have an interesting experience. David Mackenzie's Direction is expertly done. He's handled the film, with command. Giles Nuttgens' Cinematography is fantastic. West Texas has been captured beautifully. Jake Roberts' Editing is crisp. Art &amp; Costume Design are perfect. Nick Cave &amp; Warren Ellis's Score is good. Action-Sequences are well-done, as well. Performance-Wise: 'Hell or High Water' is filled with superior performances. Jeff Bridges steals the show as the senior Texas ranger, who's sly sense of humor with his Indian partner (a fabulous Gil Birmingham) &amp; skill to put things together &amp; get to the criminals, is delightful. Bridges gets his character spot-on &amp; proves once again, that he's among the Greatest we've ever had. As the 2-brothers who go on bank-robbing spree, Chris Pine &amp; Ben Foster are in top-form. Pine is a revelation, delivering a mature, restrained performance, while Foster, an actor who's potential isn't new to know, continues to astonish, with his enviable talent for playing unpredictable, unlikable characters. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Pine &amp; Foster, appears real &amp; affecting.On the whole, 'Hell or High Water' is a Winner! Don't Miss It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless bank robbers vs Texas Rangers action-drama and characters study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hell or High Water" (2016 release; 105 min.) brings the story of two brothers, Toby and Tanner. As the movie opens, we see them rob two Texas Midlands Bank branches in rapid succession. It's only later that we learn why. After the second heist, the Texas Rangers are informed, and Marcus, who is going to retire in three weeks, wants to do one final case before going off into the sunset. At this point, we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Scottish director David Mackenzie, and here he brings to the big screen the outstanding script by former actor Taylor Sheridan, who blew us away last year with "Sicario", my No.1 movie of the year in 2015. Here the story focuses on the two brothers, one a divorced dad and the other just released after a 7 year prison stint. The brothers are played by Chris Pine (MILES away from the recent Star Trek Beyond) and Ben Foster. But the best performance comes from Jeff Bridges as good ol' Marcus, always short on breath and "sitting on the porch, practicing my future", when his partner asks him why he is sitting outside his hotel room. Bridges has gotten many acclaims over his career, and I don't know that this one tops them all, but it sure comes close. Add in the beautiful landscape of the southwest (New Mexico standing in for Western Texas), plus a gorgeous soundtrack fro Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, and it all comes together like a perfect cocktail. I'm trying to think of any flaws in this movie, but I can't think of any, hence my rating of 5 stars (which I rarely give).The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, and I bet you with outstanding word-of-mouth a guarantee, this movie will gain strength at the box office in the weeks to come. Pretty sure this will pick up a lot of attention come the awards season at the end of the year. "Hell or High Water" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bonnie and Clyde for the Old Ranger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. A good guy doing bad things for a good reason. A bad guy doing bad things for a good reason. A good guy whose make-up doesn't allow for bad things by anyone for any reason. Director David MacKenzie (Starred Up) and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) serve up a quasi-western featuring a crusty old Texas Ranger doggedly pursuing two bank robbing brothers. If not for the numerous destroy-the-flow screaming political statements, this could have been a near instant classic ? just a tick below No Country for Old Men.Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard. Details eek out slowly about each ? most importantly that Toby is a divorced dad and Tanner is an ex-con. Toby has meticulously planned out their bank robbery spree. The goal is to save his family ranch so his boys can escape the "disease" of poverty. Tanner is along to support his brother ? and probably because he enjoys the adrenaline rush.Soon enough, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail of the boys, and his highly developed instincts and gut feelings annoy his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) almost as much as Marcus' incessant and insensitive racial teases ? a reminder of the days when buddies would verbally jab each other without the risk of class action lawsuits.The performances are all excellent. Pine is the quiet guy resigned to a life without happiness, but refusing to give up on his boys. Foster is the wide-eyed trouble-maker who long ago realized he would always be one careless moment from the end. Bridges literally becomes the Ranger being forced into retirement (age) but intent on remaining somewhat relevant. Additional support work is also quite colorful in a west Texas kind of way. The wonderful Dale Dickey gets an early sequence with the boys, the great Buck Taylor is always a pleasant presence, Margaret Bowman adds yet another memorable character to her resume as the T-Bone waitress, and Katy Mixon ("Eastbound and Down") gets to stand up for the little people.West Texas is a character unto itself with massive poverty, oil pumps on the horizon, dusty streets, rickety fences, and gun-toting citizens everywhere. Each of these elements is beautifully captured by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (Dom Hemingway), as are the actual bank robberies and the quiet moments between brothers and Rangers partners. To cap it off, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis add a nice score and even better soundtrack ? the best of which is an opening song from Townes Van Zandt.Mixed in with the impending gloom are some terrifically witty exchanges and some downright funny moments. Exceptional acting, a spot on setting, wonderful photography, and superb music are only slightly offset by the previously mentioned obnoxious and too obvious shots taken at big banks and oil companies. Sometimes a good story can be just that ? and not a political statement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie worth seeing for many reasons. 1. Jeff Bridge - The role fits his style perfectly. His dialogue is spot on and just a joy to watch and listen to. 2. Chris Pine - This movies helps shed Capt. Kirk big time. I didn't think he was much of an actor before this but I have a new found appreciating. 3. Ben Foster - His usual strong, a bit crazy, witty dialogue, edgy performance. So much fun to watch! 4. West Texas - I have to defer to those that know West Texas but if this is how the people are like out there with their guns, hometown values and dialogue, I love it! 5. Perfect Crime? - I don't want to spoil it but please keep in mind the bank dynamics. 6. Supporting Cast - Again, I don't want to spoil it but whoever did the casting did a fantastic job, assuming this is what West Texas is like. (see #4. above).It's not perfect since there are a few slow moments but there are other interesting nuances that will remind you of twists in other movies. It's so hard to write this accurately and completely and not make reference to spoilers. Suffice to say that you should see this movie for any of the reasons above.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film worth seeking out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Hell or High Water' is a bit of an odd duck. Mainly because it got a wide release. This is the only great film that has released in 2016 that got a wide release. I mean, there are only four or five films that I thought have been really great and all of them have either got basically no theater release or a limited viewing. I truly hope that this spurs more films like it though. More well crafted movies that actually have characters you can get invested in. There have been so many films this year that have completely failed due to poor character writing. Now, this film isn't perfect. So lets just get the negatives out of the way before we get into what makes this great.There aren't many problems here. The only big issue for me lies in the films story. It's really not that good. Once you step back to examine it, it's actually pretty by the numbers. If you've seen any heist movie ever than you probably know where this film is going. It follows a very standard formula that rarely deviates from it's by the numbers approach.But it wasn't until I took a step back that I noticed it. That's due to how well executed it is. It's one of those films that's so finely crafted that you don't really notice it's issues. That's what I loved about the film. It has such great characters that the familiar beats it hits actually feel genuine. Because you get to know these people and you feel like their choices matter to what's happening on screen.Which came as a breath of fresh air in a time when films have become so predictable and convenient. Our three main characters are played by Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster. Who were all at their very best for this movie. Foster was the weakest of all but when acting across from Bridges, is hard to really stand out. Yet, that is exactly what Chris Pine does. I have never seen him give this kind of performance.I'm glad to see him taking on nuanced roles that legitimately show his range. It felt almost like his performance in 'Z for Zachariah' but he's far more compelling to watch here. Which really adds to his character. He is the one that you have to feel for most. And his sad yet determined personality really pushed you through the film.On the other end, Ben fosters character introduced the most conflict to the film. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into his character much but the film respected him enough to not make him the bad guy. It's so easy to make a character like that the films bad guy but he never becomes that person. It respects its characters enough to make them humans with problems instead of saying this guys the bad one and this guy is the good one.And it's all shot and directed with the utter most care and effort. With nearly every shot you can feel the attention to detail and the work put into making this the way it is. It may not be Alejandro Inarritu levels of ingenuity but I loved seeing effort being put into making the film. It's very rare to see great directing and inventive cinematography in wide release films like this.'Hell or High Water' is rare breed. It's a great film that got a wide release. There is a lot of love and care put into this and it shows. It's well shot, directed nicely, has a solid score, is brilliantly acted, and offers excellent characters. This is definitely worth going out and seeing. That being said, It falls just short of being amazing. The story is pretty by the numbers and it's ending doesn't really seem to know what it wants to do. However, it remains a great film and is definitely worth supporting in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely the type of simple film that many might dismiss when first hearing about it or seeing the promotional footage of it. What's really surprising about it is the amount of emotional and dramatic weight that it carries. It's not primarily interested in gun fights or car chases. Instead, it's interested in exploring the dynamics of race and culture, and in depicting everyone as flawed individuals who you still feel empathy for. It gives you a portrayal of what poverty and the economy can do, even when never attempting to justify the horrible behavior on display or trying to make excuses for its characters. It's filled with wonderful, thoughtful dialogue while also playing out like a realistic morality tale. The three leads are also fantastic, especially Ben Foster, who deserves to get more roles as the talented character-actor he is. This is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed Hell or High Water.A modern day western of sorts, it masterfully mixes American folklore with the realities of today. Set in present-day Texas, this movie follows the brothers Toby and Tanner as they rob a number to banks, laundering the money at a casino to eventually pay off the existing debt on their family ranch, recently identified as containing rich oil beneath. The landscape is barren, and the only real colour is the billboards along the roads advertising debt refinancing and bank services. Even when the brothers succeed in robbing several banks, many civilians applaud them, or refuse to give a description to the investigating Texas Rangers, because they side with these men over the heartless banking corporations.These Rangers, Marcus and Alberto, follow the robberies with a cynical eye, doing their best to anticipate the brothers' next move. They are the modern day Lone Ranger and his sidekick Tonto to the Jesse and Frank James robbers of Toby and Tanner. Every resident, waitress, cattle rancher or otherwise bemoans his or her station in life, granting sympathy or respect to these brothers who, as it is eventually revealed, want to secure the ranch for Toby's sons. In one scene, Toby (Chris Pine) admits to his elder son that his own actions shouldn't be emulated, but that he wants his son to create a new path in life. Alberto expresses his derision of how his people (Native and Mexican Americans) had been marginalized and forgotten, and now, thanks to banking greed, most Americans face the same fate. Toby sees his destructive looting as a way to finally move his own family out of financial hell and into new freedom. The ethical waters become quite muddy as violence increases with each robbery, but both brothers stay the course.As with any idealistic plan, things don't end quite so happily. The Lone Ranger, days away from retiring, loses his steadfast partner, Tonto, in a shoot-out. Tanner, the more reckless of the James Brothers sits atop a desert cliff for once feeling he is king of the plains, like a Comanche, only to catch a bullet through his temple. Toby grinds onward, securing the ranch home for his sons and estranged wife, while Marcus knows he is complicit in the carnage left behind the robberies and shooting deaths. There are no easy answers in this film. Where is the country financially and how do people get out of the hell they are in? How does a cattle farmer still have to deal with wildfires in the 21st century? This anachronism is as out of place and time as Jesse James and the Lone Ranger are, and yet it is a reality. There is no pretty bow to wrap things up completely, but the story, brought to life with wonderful performances by Pine, Foster, Bridges and Birmingham, is well worth the ticket price.</fullReview>

Excellent neo-Western about a pair of down-on-their-luck siblings (Pine - eerily resembling Tom Selleck - and Foster, both superbly low-key) who embark upon a string of bank robberies to finance their late mother's outstanding debts results in a give-and-take with a Texas ranger on the cusp of mandatory retirement (a canny, wily, crusty and flat-out wonderful Bridges) and his Native American/Mexican-American partner (Birmingham) one step behind them in pursuit. A lean, taut and smart screenplay by Taylor Sheridan lays down the right rhythms for filmmaker David McKenzie to take his time in each beat setting up the plot, character development and action with nimble skill. Giles Nuttgens' cinematography evokes the best of Terrence Malick films - beautiful and elegiac. One of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5 )THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A very good but familiar crime film that boasts some great acting.GRADE: A-SYNOPSIS: In order to save the farm, two brother run afoul of the lawJIM'S REVIEW: The anti-hero, a staple of the 70's culture wars, is back with a vengeance in David Mackenzie's modern-day crime drama, Hell or High Water. Its tale, of two brothers who break the law in order to survive poverty and foreclosure, reeks of the anger and frustration facing the middle class families across America today.Tanner (Chris Pine), son of the recently deceased Mrs. Howard, cooks up an illegal scheme to fight the banks from taking the family's land. (You see, there's Texas gold in them hills). Bringing aboard Toby (Ben Foster) his hot-headed ex-con brother, the two siblings rob from the rich (the banks) and give to the poor (themselves). As these outlaws commit more and more robberies and start to acquire a real nest age to help pay off their mortgage and living expenses, the odds of diminishing returns becomes more and more evident. It's 60 / 39 % against these modern day Bonnie and Clyde wannabes' success rate, especially with a wise ole sage of a sheriff, Marcus (Jeff Bridges), and a "mixed breed" partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), tracking down this robbing band of brothers. (I excluded those powerful 1% fat cats into the equation.) After all, the family that steals together deals together...and deal they must with the consequences of breaking the law. One knows, amid the gunfire and violence, that the cost of living in the fast lane is past due.English director David Mackenzie effectively captures the desperation of America's poor with his stark images of a Texas wasteland. Large billboards about mortgages and loans dot the dry rural landscapes, nicely filmed by Giles Nuttgens. Mr. Mackenzie's film is a poetic mood piece with intricate plotting and a narrative structure that keeps one riveted to the characters and their actions. He also casts his film with actors that are perfectly suited to their roles from the wonderful lead actors already mentioned down to the smaller roles of waitresses and tellers. (Katy Mixon, Margaret Bowman, and Dale Dickey are standouts.)Taylor Sheridan has created fully drawn characters and his dialog is concise and insightful. Their conversations are totally natural and bring a gritty realism to the story. Yes, the plot is predictable, the set-up contrived, and the film is a tad too leisurely told from the outset. But the haunting images and true-to-life characters are heartfelt and linger long after the film ends thanks to a terrific script, taut direction, and some of the best acting one will see all year.The quartet of lead actors are wonderful. Jeff Bridges is custom-fitted for this role. His grizzly worn-out Texas Ranger is no stranger to this actor's repertoire, but he wisely downplays the outlandish nature of this country trooper and makes him human and believable. Both the character and the actor blend so effortlessly. His consummate acting prowess throughout the film is remarkable. Chris Pine, downplays his good looks and shows a troubled loner, out-of- touch with life but barely hanging on to his humanity. It is one of his best performances in an impressive list of film roles that the actor continues to add to his resume. Ben Foster excels as his deranged brother who loves the dark side as much as he loves his sensitive brother. He makes his character resonate with a flair for danger that attracts and repels simultaneously. As Marcus' partner, Gil Birmingham brings a droll sense of humor and fondness to his sidekick role.The film builds to its tragic conclusion...what else could there be! Hell or High Water is an excellent crime film that makes the ordinary extraordinary. It is well worth a visit.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You boys robbin' the bank?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comparisons to 2007's "No Country For Old Men" are probably inevitable. Both films feature aging Texas lawmen near the end of their careers, who contemplate the passing of a more rational era in which they came up through the ranks. There's also the principal villains, but whereas Anton Chigurh was a Terminator-like, unrelenting and vicious assassin, his counterpart here, Tanner Howard is just plain old Texas locoweed crazy. You have to credit Ben Foster in the role of older brother Tanner to Chris Pine's Toby, his characterization is just off the wall insane.As for Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, Jeff Bridges is simply astounding in his portrayal. One thing you have to give him credit for, now that he knows his matinée idol days are long gone and over with, he has no qualms about letting it all hang out. I'm thinking about that scene in the hotel room when he took off his shirt and his big old gut is just hanging out there like a poster child for obesity research. Just when you think he can't get any better as an actor after "Crazy Heart" and "True Grit", he nails it once again and it's a wonder to behold. I wonder if he had marbles in his mouth when he spoke, his dialog was especially Texas drawl effective.The story itself puts the film in action/adventure territory with more than a hint of crime drama, so one's classification of the picture with the Western genre is probably more so by association with it's West Texas and Oklahoma locations than the cowboy roots of the principals. The same could be said of "No Country For Old Men", so there's another likely comparison.And finally there's the way the picture ended, leaving open the question of whether Toby Howard would ever be brought to justice. Leaving things off that way left a lot more question marks than the showdown that never was between Marcus and Tanner Howard. But at least it was a more satisfying conclusion than having Anton Chigurh wandering around with a bone sticking out of his arm and no resolution to his fate. But then again, life can be just like that sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Sure Don't Make Them Like This Anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people that populate the world of Hell or High Water seem to stand at attention and out of time. They sit at the corner booth of their favorite diner sporting white gallon hats and speed through one horse towns on the way to the only profitable business; the local liquor store. It's a solemn austere existence; one reminiscent of Sam the Lion's in The Last Picture Show (1971). Yet there is no false hope to be had here. The ghosts of the past are long gone. The only thing left amid the boarded up downtowns and clearing fires is the possibility of bequeathal.That is the basic idea brothers Toby (Pine) and Tanner Howard (Foster) have when they first don their ski masks and head for the nearest Midland Bank. Their scheme is remarkable in its simplicity; steal only from the cashier drawers, $20's, $50's, loose change; whatever they collect, they launder through the nearby Comanche Reservation Casino. The ultimate goal is to save their family farm. Seems ever since oil has been discovered on their turf, the bank has been just itching to foreclose and with the death of their mother, the second mortgage has become unsurmountable.Much of the film was shot in and around the panhandle plains of west Texas. The camera's fixation on big sky and barren grazing land appeals to our inner-cowpoke. Yet Hell or High Water is closer in spirit to Hud (1963) or Lonely Are the Brave (1962) than the high stake and higher implausibilities of The Searchers (1956). The stark small town blight litters the plains like pools of runoff and while the people talk the Big Jake talk, they mostly come across like the townsfolk of Cold Turkey (1971).Even Toby seems inclined to cut and run at the first sign of trouble. Every tension building chance of capture brings with it the possibility that Toby may just loose his cool, just may catch himself in a lie, just may fold. Yet something keeps him there, shotgun loaded, robbing banks with his older brother. Call it a moral imperative, his family is on their last legs financially and he has two sons to support, but in a sense he's also keeping the spirit of Texas alive by acting like Billy the Kid.Yet every Billy the Kid must have a Pat Garrett and for that we have the ambulant and ever jaded Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Bridges). Set to retire wrapped around a leather Barcalounger, Hamilton jumps at a chance to hunt "them two boys down," going so far as to stake out a bank they're fated to hit. Jeff Bridges brings all the gravitas an actor of his caliber does to this remarkably modest film. He brings unexpected mirth to Hamilton whose shrewd investigations and causal bigotry have a ring of west Texas authenticity and twangy cheer.If ever there was an actor best suited for this film however it's Ben Foster as the older, more criminal minded Tanner. He blissfully antagonizes everyone he meets, fancying himself a Comanche: lord of the plains and enemy to all. The only person he shows love for is his brother which proves his most enigmatic quality. Living his life in and out of prison can harden a man, even to the embrace of long suffering family. Yet when asked "why did you agree to do this with me then?" Tanner responds "Because you asked me to little brother," without skipping a beat.Hell or High Water is a modest, under-the-radar crime drama told confidently and brilliantly by director David Mackenzie. It is at once a composite of Robin Hood crime drama and elegy westerns and an example of seamless top-to-bottom storytelling. While Hell or High Water comes from well-worn traditions, it is exceedingly rare to see a film of this caliber. Like the people who populate the film, it simply stands out of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping tale of modern-day desperadoes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Mackenzie's latest film, Hell or High Water, feels like one of those movies that could've been made at any point in cinema's existence. It is a simple meat-and-potatoes tale of bank heists and blood brothers, the sort of story that great directors from Kubrick and Altman to Arthur Penn and Tarantino have made their staple at one time or another. And though it's set against the woeful landscape of an America in the throes of the most recent economic downtown, you could easily see it taking place in the Dust Bowl era of Bonnie &amp; Clyde. Working from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (scribe of last year's superior Sicario), Mackenzie sets his film in the Texas midlands, the last frontier against "progress," as the few scattered denizens would call the encroaching destruction of their old-fashioned way of life. Gone are the desperadoes, the Gary Coopers and Jesse Jameses of old, and all that's left are a few dying embers of what had once been the great American dream. Three such embers are at the heart of Hell or High Water, and it's these three that set the desert fields ablaze in a trail of blood and violence. Two of these three are a pair of brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard?rough country boys who are at once peas in a pod and yet polar opposites. Toby (a sufficiently grunged-up Chris Pine, playing a stoic Southern loner role that somehow bypassed Josh Brolin, who usually corners the market on such parts) is quiet but decent, eking out a hardscrabble existence in a desperate attempt to keep his family ranch from foreclosure. His big brother Tanner is far more erratic and intense, which makes the casting of Ben Foster a no-brainer. Tanner's antics seem downright Tremor Brother-esque; a hard-living ex-jailbird with no compunction against brutality if required. The brothers have cooked up a scheme to save the family farm as well as get revenge on the faceless banks that have f_cked them over: by pulling a string of penny-ante heists at each branch, taking only cashiers' trays of loose bills (to prevent ink-pack bursts and access to traceable currency). It's a smart play, but also one that requires several jobs in rapid succession. And sooner or later, their luck will inevitably run out. This is where the third ember comes into play: Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton. Played as a prickly amalgamation of Rooster Cogburn and Columbo, Jeff Bridges's soon-to-retire lawman decides to pursue the bank job investigation as one final hurrah before he turns in his star. Paired with Gil Birmingham's stalwart, snarky Alberto (who also bears the brunt of his partner's deliberately un- P.C. ribbing), Marcus shrewdly assesses that the thieves are working towards a goal and accurately calculates the locations they'd need to hit in order to meet their quota. But as with every single heist film since the days of old, something goes wrong. There is a grim edge to Hell or High Water, but it refuses to wallow in it. Instead, it is bleakly funny, fraught with little character foibles sure to get a chuckle or two out of any audience. Even in the tensest moments (and there are more than a few, be forewarned), there is a nevertheless a laid- back undercurrent. In large part, it's due to how easy the three leads slip into their characters and convey decades' worth of life and experience in their performances. Bridges impresses the most, at least for me?there are several moments in the film where he is as good as he ever has been, even as the Dude?and you could almost see yearly spin-offs built around the character on cable TV. Pine, who usually sings best playing zany sorts like in his Carnahan collaborations, nevertheless is very striking as a low-key working joe who nevertheless has a depth of insight far exceeding his rough-hewn appearance. And then there's Foster, who is never anything but riveting when he's on-screen and whose mercurial talents continue to cement him as one of the peak actors around. Hell or High Water also cements Sheridan as a writer to watch out for. His last two scripts have been perfectly methodical, like a chemist's precise formula, almost perfectly calibrated. He has an ear for dialogue, both ruminating (at one point, a cowpoke laments that the way the country's going, no wonder his kids don't want to raise cattle for a living) and snappy ("Only assh_les drink Mr. Pibb." "Drink up."). Aided by a plaintive score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis?as if there could be any better pick?Sheridan's voice is powerful enough that it almost seems like Mackenzie hardly has to do any heavy lifting at all. And though he doesn't set up high-octane thrills like Denis Villeneuve did with Sicario, he instead presents a sober, soulful threnody to the dying myth of the American outlaw. (On a final note, I agree with Tanner: only assh_les drink Mr. Pibb.)</fullReview>

Now the debt is left of how to live and pay the banks off on the debt left on the dried up and worn ranch that the family has. Now that plan involves the brothers robbing banks to make it and these guys are due as they have been poor and born losers all their life! Now enter the hero the tough as nails twang Texas drawl talking Ranger named Marc Hamilton(in a spot on and near perfect role for the great Jeff Bridges)who's outspoken and a guy who will do what it takes to bring justice for the small town and the film becomes a chase of cat and mouse games with bullets and blood now need I say more "Hell or High Water" is a movie I love it's a showcase of justice the old style way all while showcasing vigilantism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, engaging story, confused plot. Excellent movie overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff Bridges does it again. Another outstanding performance from one of the great actors of our era. Ben Foster is quickly becoming one of the best supporting actors in the business. Chris Pine delivers what I would consider the best performance of his career. The plot revolves around Pine's attempt to divert an endless cycle of poor, West Texans who seem to work their whole lives in a small, blue collar town with nothing to show for their hard work other than a slow, painful death after 50 years of struggle. Pine's character is driven by his love for his two sons and will do anything to keep them from having to work the dehydrated farms that are now a burden to those who own them. This scenario is called out in a great interaction between Bridges and a local rancher herding his cattle during a brush fire. Ben Foster creates a character so deep that you are able to both sympathize with him and yet loathe his actions at the same time. This polarizing performance is full of genuine passion that could have only been garnered by someone who feels true empathy for the character he portrays. The setting in West Texas plays a key role in the movie. The townspeople keep to themselves and support their local boys against big business much like you would see in the Irish communities of movies based in Boston or the African American communities in movies around Detroit, Baltimore, or the deep south. When the brothers start stirring up trouble, the old-timers just keep to themselves and gives the local Texas Rangers the cold shoulder. There are three points that bring this movie down from a 10/10 to a 7/10. First, there is a lack of plot commitment. There are several sub-themes for the movie without one taking the leading line. On the surface level this movie is about a young man trying to do the best for his sons. Sub-plots consist of the relationship between Bridges and his Ranger partner, the relationship between Pine and Foster, small town vs. big banks, and then of course the common crime dramas and westerns. The second part that took this down a point was how the movie spends a lot of time building empathy for certain characters and then forces you to turn on your opinions. When I watch a movie or show, I don't want to feel betrayed by my emotions for characters. Finally, I felt the ending came up short of being definitive. I understand it was left for somewhat of interpretation, but it didn't need to end there. I really hope this wasn't a re- write to allow for a sequel. I think this movie could have easily been a 10-12 episode show on your favorite streaming website. Overall, great acting, a solid story and some great action scenes give us a breath of fresh air during a summer of sequels and remakes. We should all enjoy performances from Jeff Bridges while he is in his prime and revel in watching Foster continue his consistent, solid performances. Pine delivers his breakthrough performance while transitioning from heartthrob eye-candy to a solid, leading man. This is one of the best movies of the summer of 2016.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think just by looking at the box office numbers, it's proved that it's near impossible to put out a western that has broad range appeal. Hell or High Water takes the genre into modern day gracefully and gives us easily one of the top 5 films of the year to date.I always try and find the time to go see the next western to be released because Hollywood rarely spends the time or money towards making them, so when they do they are usually pretty decent. Hell or High Water is more than decent, it's magnificent. The screenplay comes from the brilliant mind behind last year's Sicario, Taylor Sheridan. And just like Sicario, all of the characters are well realized and established from the word go.Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Gil Birmingham all give well-crafted performances and largely against type as well. Director David Mackenzie speaks out against typecasting actors and he does a good job of not doing that here. Bridges and Birmingham play a funny buddy cup duo who have been through more than one rodeo together with a love-hate relationship. Their banter back and forth makes for some of the best comedy moments of the film, but it's not just there for kicks and giggles, every line adds weight to the characters so that you care when the final showdown begins.That duo is nicely complemented by the duo of Pine and Foster, who play brothers who rob banks in order to save their family's ranch. Just as Bridges plays the quick witted, Foster plays the unhinged and unpredictable brother, Tanner, to Pine's more subtle and reserved turn as Toby. The screenplay itself never asks the actors to do anything too crazy or stunning, which is what makes the performances all the more special. The ability for these four men to do so much with their eyes and unspoken actions makes it some of the best work they have all done.I also loved how patient and subtle the film itself was. It doesn't push bloody gun battles or massive twists in your face, it relies on great acting and a good directing job by David Mackenzie. I was immensely impressed by this film and I can't recommend it enough. I hope we hear about this film come award season.+Pine and Foster's best work to date+Bridges banter with Birmingham+Subtle and patient+Characters are well thought out by Sheridan9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie for its emotional courage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fiction is said to reach more truth by ignoring logic than the reverse. Not sure I agree but this movie is a strong argument in favor of that idea. There's a financial dilemma at this movie's core that I didn't really think made sense, but it quickly becomes beside the point.Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers who have little reason to obey the law. Their family is losing the farm though there's a good chance there's oil there. Their bank wants to foreclose on the family to get the oil and the brothers think they can get the money to forestall the transfer by robbing small banks. Jeff Bridges is the Texas Ranger looking for retirement who wants one last notch on his belt.For me this played like an acting contest between Bridges and Pine, with Jeff perhaps just squeaking ahead of Chris near the end. This is no small feat, Bridges is masterful and Pine is just beginning his career. But both are excellent here. They both believe in this project and evoke West Texas types that ring true on several levels. It made me wish I had been born back there and it will make you long for that kind of life too.</fullReview>

Very well acted. I would especially recommend this movie to law enforcement. One heck of a ride. The interaction between Marcus and Roberto are classic. There are many great moments in this movie. The T-Bone steak house scene with the salty waitress is classic. The sassy waitress at the diner is another classic moment. The movie depicts what would probably happen in a small town in Texas when one of the banks get robbed and the locals decide to get involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Day Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Hell or High Water", starring Jeff Bridges-Seventh Son, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot; Chris Pine-The Finest Hours, Blind Date, and FYI: He is playing Steve Trevor in the 2017 Wonder Woman; Ben Foster- Warcraft, The Finest Hours; Katy Mixon-Mike &amp; Molly_tv, Blind Date and Gil Birmingham-The Lone Ranger_2013, The Twilight movies.This is a modern day western. It's about 2 good old boys, Chris &amp; Ben, robbing banks and being chased by the Texas Rangers, Jeff &amp; Gil. Of course the good old boys have a good reason for stealing the money; It's a recession and the Midland Banks are foreclosing on their home &amp; land. Chris comes up with a plan to steal the money he needs for his mortgage from the bank that is trying to take his property and then use the money to pay off his debt-he does launder the money in a casino first. Ben has just gotten out of prison and is a little more energetic about robbing the banks than his little brother, Chris. Chris doesn't want to hurt anyone but Ben likes the excitement and doesn't care who gets hurt. Katy plays a waitress that lucks out when she happens to wait on the boys. Jeff is the lead investigator and just about ready to retire when the boys start their shenanigans. Gil is Jeff's partner that he loves to insult. There is a lot of humor in the movie-wait to you see the waitress at the T-Bone Cafe that waits on Jeff &amp; Gil. If I had one complaint, it would be the music. Most people will probably enjoy it but country music is not one of my pleasures. During the credits I remember seeing songs by Billy Jo Shaver, Ray Wiley Hubbard and Chris Stappleton and forgive me if I misspelled any of their names because...Well, I did mention that I am not a country fan. It's rated "R" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 42 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

I live in ny, so I only know Texas from the news and movies. it's the last picture show, 45 years later, which I guess is why bridges took the role. it is a very good movie, not to be missed, just don't expect to be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted, atmospheric film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Pine was determined to find a film and a role that was as far away from Captain Kirk and Star Trek as he could find. In the role of Toby Howard in David Mackenzie's wonderful HELL OR HIGH WATER, Pine certainly has found that role.Reminiscent of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (but not on that, esteemed, level) HELL OR HIGH WATER tells the tale of two brothers (Pine and Ben Foster) who rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on the mortgage of the ranch they inherited from their mother, in order to pay the bank back with their own money. They are pursued by a Texas Ranger (Jeff Bridges). As written by Taylor Sheridan and directed by Mackenzie, the movie is much, much more than the plot. It is about relationships and character and mood and setting...And...it is one terrific film.Start with the mood. Mackenzie imbues this film with the feeling of a lazy "dog days of August" atmosphere. Some will take that as slow - there is much, much dialogue and scene setting shots - but I took it as wonderful. It immersed you in the world of these people and the filmmakers took their time showing you this world.The dialogue is terrific, writer Sheridan also wrote the screen play to the terrific Sicario, so I'm looking forward to what he does next. In the hands of lesser actors than Pine (the smart brother) and Foster (the wild brother), this dialogue - and these brothers - could have been one note. But they are not. They are nuanced and multi-faceted and fascinating to watch.But they don't hold a candle to the performance that Bridges brings to the table.Jeff Bridges has been nominted 6 times for an Academy Award (winning the Best Actor Oscar for Crazy Heart) and he just might be in line for his 7th nomination (and 2nd win) here. His Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, is just one fascinating, wonderful character. Much like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country, Bridges is playing a Texas Ranger that is nearing the end of his career. But, unlike Jones' character, Bridges is keeping up with today's "modern" criminal, but he's not keeping up with father time. I will start the campaign for an Oscar for Bridges for this role right now - that's how much I enjoyed it. Come for the acting, stay for the atmosphere - Hell or High Water is well worth the journey.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly atmospheric bank robber yarn undermined by questionable moral stance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hell or High Water has garnered a magisterial 88 on Metacritic with just about every critic fawning over this tale of two West Texas bank robbers determined to save the family farm from the big bad bankers about to foreclose on their property. Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's dilemma was how far should he go in humanizing his anti-heroes without ending up glorifying them. To my mind, he went a little too far. Perhaps there are shades here of Arthur Penn's sleek hagiography, Bonnie and Clyde, that placed two odious Depression era criminals on an undeserving pedestal.Director David Mackenzie along with Sheridan have set their tale of the two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), in a contemporary milieu. Tanner is the "real" criminal here, having spent significant time in the slammer and is properly depicted as what the general public would probably refer to as "scary." Nonetheless, the film's scenarists are not averse at also depicting Tanner as somewhat noble, especially when he sacrifices himself during a high speed chase and subsequent shootout with the police, in order to save his brother.Toby, on the other hand, has no criminal record, but allegedly has an excuse for planning the bank robberies and joining his brother in these nefarious acts, which ends in the death of a bank guard and armed citizen, during the last holdup. It seems that the Texas Midlands bank won't give Toby a break and is about to foreclose on his farm, which is now worth a lot more since oil has been found on the property. Good guy Toby wants to leave the farm to his children since he has known nothing but poverty growing up.The twist here is the way in which Toby plans his robberies. The brothers only steal cash from the cashier's drawers, avoiding exploding dye packs and serial numbers which can be traced. The getaway vehicles are buried at the farm and the cash is laundered at an Indian casino, exchanged first for poker chips and then re-cashed for new currency.If there's any doubt that the film's scenarists have unjustifiably turned Toby into a "noble savage" of sorts, his underlying brute nature is highlighted in a fight against a miscreant at a gas station. But note Toby (unlike Tanner who shoots innocent people), only fights creeps who deserve a good whipping. There is a sub-plot here which involves the Texas Rangers who are chasing the so-called bad guys. Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton, partnered with Alberto Parker, his half Mexican, Native-American deputy. Most of their interactions consists of Marcus making bigoted jokes at Alberto's expense but his easy-going partner plays along since he knows that his boss is really a good guy at heart. Sympathy for the bad guys becomes more apparent when a waitress at a diner rebuffs the lawmen when she refuses to allow them to examine the large cash tip Toby left for her minutes before he left.Marcus and Alberto really don't have much to do until the end of Act 2 where Tanner flees on foot on top of a mountainside, where he engages in a gunfight with the Rangers. Tanner shoots Alberto dead and Marcus in turns finishes off Tanner. Only some of the earlier bank robbery scenes rival the climactic scene with Tanner in terms of gripping action. The rest of Hell or High Water primarily consists of a series of moderately interesting but lugubrious conversations, highlighting the anti-capitalist themes.The denouement features one further disappointing conversation where Marcus seeks to uncover Toby's motivations for getting involved in criminal activities. Since we've already found out what was motivating Toby, his explanation to Marcus is rather anti-climactic. Despite Toby's harsh circumstances growing up, nothing seems to justify his decision to rob the banks where innocent people are killed. But if you listen to Mackenzie and Sheridan, Toby gets a free pass and is now permitted to deed the family farm to his children, far clear from the bar of justice. Hell or High Water is highly atmospheric featuring good performances from all involved, but the overarching moral stance has much to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Hell Or High Water is just a slight indication of what I hope to expect in regards to the quality of films I expect to see for the remainder of 2016..I will be really impressed.A modern take on the western. Two Texas brothers on a bank robbing spree with Texas rangers and other law enforcement in pursuit. There are a few things that make this film stand out from other modern crime films. The motives of the protagonists are unique. They have a plan and a time limit. The locale FEELS authentic.The Production Design and Cinematography (Tom Duffield &amp; Giles Nuttgens, respectively) are GREAT. I was immersed in the story and the world that was displayed on the movie screen. Also...I have to give credit to Nick Cave for the music. I'm not a Country music fan by any means. But all of the music choices worked seamlessly.This movie balances action, tension and drama quite well. There is a pace. And at times, unfortunately, a bit of a languid pace. Especially in the middle of the film. This didn't bother me too much as this gave room for the characters to develop. I cared for all of them. From the major leads to the minor ones who walked in and out of the story. All of them felt real. When the action does pick up again for the climax, was quite impressed.Hell or High Water is on my Top Ten list for 2016. No doubt whatsoever. Excellent acting by the leads (Pine, Foster, Bridges and Birmingham), a great tension-filled story (with an ALMOST perfect ending), an immersive soundtrack and beautiful cinematography. A definite recommend. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dusty Drama In The Heat Of The Texas Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hell or High Water" is a buddy film. In fact, it contains two sets of buddies. The first is a pair of brothers, who have been estranged due to the older one's (Ben Foster) incarceration. In his absence, the younger brother (Chris Pine) had to deal with the failing health of their mother and a myriad of financial burdens. Reunited, they put a plan into action that has a high risk/reward profile. In the process, they become closer.The other buddies are a pair of Texas Rangers who set out to intercept a pair of amateurish bank robbers. Jeff Bridges is the older ranger with only three weeks to go before retirement. Gil Birmingham is his partner of Comanche heritage. Their friendship is hidden behind a façade of insults and teasing, but they share a strong bond.The story takes place in Texas beneath the unforgiving summer sun amid the ubiquitous dust. It's a stark environment for a deadly game of hide and seek.So much of the film is about fate. The paths of the two pairs are fated to intersect just as the older brother is fated to always return to crime. In their conversations, a heavy fatalism hangs over them like the layers of dust that coat every surface.Seeing Chris Pine out of a Starfleet uniform may be eye-opening for some viewers. Sadness and grittiness are ever present in his characterization of a young man who resented always having to be responsible because his older brother failed to assume the mantle.Jeff Bridges turns in one of his finest performances. It's a meaty role with layers of depth, perfectly portrayed.The story is nearly universal. Toby, the younger brother, could be an absentee father in Detroit, where his kids rarely see him, struggling to make ends meet in an economy that is faltering and an older brother who turned to crime. It is not clear who the film blames for the victimization of the struggling local economy, but we know who the characters blame. Whether they are right or wrong, they clearly represent a tragic segment of American culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly funny crime drama about a pair of brothers who commit a series of bank robberies, of only a few thousands of dollars each time (to keep it under the feds' radar) to get their family ranch out of foreclosure, with Jeff Bridges (looking like a latter day Nick Nolte) the local cop whose job it is to solve the crimes. Beautifully filmed in the vast, open spaces of New Mexico, it gives a good look at small town life, and makes a bit of a statement about the lengths some will go for money, and what they need the money for (and not just the two lead characters) Story also has a lot of intentional humour, which caught me by surprise, and top notch acting all throughout. Marred only by a bit of unexpectedly violent changes in tone in the climactic scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually went to see this with my brother and we both thoroughly enjoyed this film. It probably helped that we're both Texans and have spent some time in West Texas so combine that with the brother narrative and it really made for a fun, nostalgic ride. Similar to Fargo and No Country for Old Men, this film completely nails the landscape (although filmed in similarly looking New Mexico), along with the charm of its people, albeit sometimes sarcastic charm. I loved Sicario, so being penned by the same writer, he deserves some tangible credit as both are solid, captivating, character driven films. I actually laughed a lot and didn't really expect it watching the trailer. There are so many original and heartfelt funny scenes in the film that don't feel forced or contrived, but truly genuine. ALL the actors were perfectly cast and did an outstanding job. Katy Mixon and Gil Birmingham really stole the show for me. Some of the pacing was a little off at times, and the backstory could have been a little more fleshed out, but overall, this was a beautifully shot, beautifully acted and original film that should be seen and remembered...especially considering the endless dross that's stained the retinas of late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Burn With Powerhouse Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>his movie is definitely a slow burn. It keeps building and building until it amounts to something at the end. It puts the emphasis on the characters, their dynamics, and putting that to the test. Sure, the bank robbery scenes are adrenaline rushing, but the core of this movie is really the relationship between two brothers and their ideological differences. Chris Pine plays the straight arrow who has more of an ethical reason for what he's doing, even though he knows its wrong. Whereas Ben Foster plays an ex-con who's just looking for a thrill. But regardless of the difference in ideologies, you see an inherent bond between these two brothers that transcends the events of the film, and that was something great to see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate "anti sjw" film for many men. Shows deeper relationship between two sets of men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film for men by men. It's sensitive yet tough. The relationships between the two sets of men are amazing because it's so realistic to the way "country" and less refined men talk with one another. The plot is great. The story is well thought out. The most amazing part for me was the whole "non-sjw" aspect of it. The way the men insult each other (the way many str8 men relate and bond) is something rarely seen in films. The racial insults between one pair of men is amazing and something that women and sensitive types don't get. You can see how much they care for each other in this "politically incorrect language." It shows men being vulnerable emotionally yet not emasculated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of character driven movies. If you can relate or have a sense for what drives the characters in a movie then the movie is that much more interesting and relevant. Hell or High Water definitely falls into this category. The plot holds your attention. The acting is exceptional. Jeff Bridges gives one of the finest performances of his career. Rivals his performance in True Grit. His performance is definitely Oscar worthy. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are outstanding as well. Chris Pine shows that he is definitely a serious actor. Ben Foster is excellent as well. The movie is well paced and edited. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a movie worth watching in the summer of 2016. Screenwriter, Actor Taylor Sheridan who previously wrote the intense movie Sicario is a marvelous writer. His story of two brothers who take matters into their own hands with an ironic twist has themes everyone can recognize. Family, economic despair, well-drawn characters who live with the consequences of being flawed human beings and a stellar cast which elevates every scene. Even the sound track adds context. All the buzz regarding this movie is dead on. If you're a fan of great writing, a plot which slowly reveals and wonderful acting you won't be disappointed. Pine, Foster and Bridges are superb. This is an adult film not suitable for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell No!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the time I saw it, IMDb had this rated at 8.3!?!?? Damn few movies get that high of a rating, so I was prepared to be entertained by a well-crafted plot. What I got was a slow moving, meandering bank robbery crime spree yarn, which turns totally senseless and absurd when we finally find out what the overall "plan" was, and what the motivation for doing it all was - $50K heisted, three innocent people dead plus the planned (!) self-sacrifice of one of the bank-robbing protagonists: It's all done for the two kids of our divorced loser "hero," "so they don't have to be poor." REALLY??? What-a-bunch-of CRAP. It's the obligatory evil bankers vs. the self-pitying mortgagor, who can only think of using today's all to familiar problem solving solution: violence. Plot holes and absurdities absolutely abound along the way crafted with the hopes that viewers will be as simple minded as the story being told.With the exception of the all too brief appearance of the delightfully gruff T Bone Café waitress, who gave the best delivery of lines in the movie, the "acting" was a wasteland (unless you're into watching the camera pan Chris Pine posing). Poor Jeff Bridges, who has given us so many memorable performances, was little more than a sad, mumbling caricature of himself. On the plus side, the visual portrayal of West Texas as starkly and hopelessly bleak was well done.P.S. FACT CHECK: There are many (most?) reviewers who have willingly (eagerly?) bought into the the totally false central premise of the plot that the bank was going to own/acquire the ranch upon foreclosure, and was therefore the evil "Bad Guy," deserving of being robbed repeatedly (and their guard murdered). WRONG! Foreclosures are governed by law which results in a advertised Public Auction with the property going to the highest public bidder, with any money received over the loan amount owed plus expenses going back to the Mortgagor.Also, the evil "Bad Guy" bank officer whose portrayal was demonized in the movie HAD to pay the delinquent property taxes on the property to prevent it from being sold at public auction by the Tax Collector.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was exciting and even adrenaline rushing at some points, but it does not take an asset manager, banker, or anyone else working in the financial world to know that as soon as oil was discovered on that land the oil companies would have paid very well in order to buy the land, or perhaps even just lease it in order to siphon the oil. Hell, even a small time investor would have sunk the 40k into paying off the back taxes so long as you tripled his return (which could have been done in less than 3 months considering that the movie states that they're making 50k a month off of the oil) In the end, the plot of this film is just a very cheap excuse to promote very real and very serious issues that many people are facing in this country. I just wish they had been as hell bent on making the plot as believable as they were in trying to get their political points across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment for me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly worth seeing for the acting and the atmosphere but that's not enough to overcome the plot deficiencies. Caution for those that have not seen the movie as there are spoilers that follow.If I were a Texas Ranger I would be flabbergasted at the portrayal of their inability to solve the case and find the second bank robber. Here are some pretty obvious clues for the clueless Rangers. Knowing the entire family history, how could the Rangers not stumble on the fact that the family farm was in foreclosure? Foreclosure would have required all sorts of public filings readily available to anyone who looked. Even the Midland Bank officer comments on the timely last minute payoff of the loan and back taxes. One look at the check from the casino, made out to the bank, would have solved the crime as there are countless camera in casinos, particularly at the cashier windows.In the shootout with the townies, Tanner strolls down the middle of the road firing an automatic weapon that rips into the townie vehicles. There are at least 10 armed men who never get off even a shot despite Tanner taking the time to drop his clip and reload, twice. The townies are shown running around their vehicles instead of taking cover and returning fire. What an insult to the armed gun loving males of Texas. Ballsy enough to give chase but so inept in the use of their weapons as to lack any credence.While chasing Tanner, is it possible that all the townies and all the cops didn't get the license plate of the getaway truck before it explodes in flames? That piece of info would have led the Rangers to the used car lot where Toby takes the truck for a test drive linking him to the crimes.And finally, the Rangers KNOW that a waitress in the diner just prior to the 2nd robbery and a table of three men can identify Toby while he was in the diner. One of the men even describes what Toby looked like (cowboy-like) to Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) . Hello? The plot is so incredible that it compromises the ridiculous ending to a slow moving character study of some of the dumbest characters in the history of westerns.And before you get all misty about the amazing West Texas scenery, not a single shot of the movie was filmed in Texas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just So-So</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anticipating this movie given the high rating on many review sites but unfortunately came away quite disappointed. It's an okay movie with a decent story and good acting. The story: I found myself thinking too much of "No Country for Old Men" while watching this movie. Old part of Texas that still seems like the wild west, bad guy being chased by an old aging lawman. It also had a feel of a western version of "The Town". They start out robbing banks and doing it in such a way to keep from getting caught but over time they make mistakes that brings the law down upon them heavily. The movie starts out quite good going right into the action. But it takes forever into the movie for the characters to develop or to get a full understanding of what is happening and why. I've read in other reviews about the great performances by the two main actors that play brothers, but for me they go a bit too heavy on the Texan accents. Chris Pine is barely understandable much of the time and Ben Foster plays the same character he did in "Alpha Dog" (Jake Mazursky). I had to guess at the plot throughout much of the movie and there were characters introduced that you never saw again but played a key role... The old lawman (Jeff Bridges) who goes chasing after him with his sidekick reminded me of the relationship between Hank Schrader and Steve Gomez of "Breaking Bad" which also has kind of a wild west feel to it. All in all, these characters were not very original and the story line seemed too familiar. There were certainly some good lines and scenes in the movie. But the movie really left me wanting for more. I tried reading all the rave reviews trying to figure out what I had missed and I just don't see this movie as a cinematic great. I've read all the reviews about how it goes into detail of life in middle America that have suffered through this depression and the moral dilemmas when trying to take care of your family. Just an okay movie that I would have preferred to have waited to see at home rather than spend the money to go to the theater and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it weren't for a predictable plot "Hell or High Water" would be a truly exceptional film. The acting is uniformly excellent, and the location shooting, costumes, and music are so good they are characters themselves. The basic core of the film is the pair of relationships ? between two partners (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) and two brothers (Ben Foster and Chris Pine) as they move toward the inevitable clash and the predictable outcome. The background is a small Texas community that has suffered economic depression and then the coming of the vultures (ie., Banks) who pick over the bones.The film is as much a violent film as it is a sociological study of the impact of poverty and despair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated yet solid picture, with an languid middle half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Mackenzie directs some pretty shots. There a lot of moments in this film that are truly beautiful, one moment comes to mind in which Jeff Bridges, restless, gets up out of bed, wraps a blanket around his shoulders, and walks out into the windy road with the blanket fluttering behind him like a cape. It is a stunning image.And this film is full of stunning images. The overall package is satisfying, but there is a lot missing. Too many shots linger on characters as they narrow their eyes in thousand yard stares. It seems like Chris Pine does more posing in this film than a model, while the camera lingers on him and Ben Foster as they say nothing. There is a lot of nothing happening, and that's where the films narrative fat comes from. This is not an exceptional genre picture, there are two interesting set-pieces but not much more in the way of thrills (anyone who tells you this is a suspense movie is exaggerating). But I don't think this is an exceptional drama film either. The characters are paper thin, what resonates more is their interactions, but that has as much weight as quippy dialogue in a buddy cop movie. Even the films message is underwhelming and has been done so much during this decade. Just last year we go 99 Homes and The Big Short. It seems to me that this is the type of movies that critics love. The slow burn genre film with political commentary. They distinguish this kinda thing from regular thrillers, which they dismiss as meaningless fun, by commenting on the fact that these types of films transcend the genre that it is in. For the most part, films that "transcend genre" tend to be slower paced, have more artful shots, and have an obvious message like, 'violence is bad.'This film doesn't say anything new about predatory lending, or the death of small towns and small town industries, it just uses them as set dressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hero vs. Anti-hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Pine plays Toby Howard who is an impoverished man who has made a lot of bad choices but very much wants to do right by his sons. A West Texas bank has taken advantage of Howard's family and is foreclosing on land owned by Toby that it turns out is sitting atop of an oil field. Toby Howard robs banks to raise money to prevent the foreclosure and in the process individuals are murdered with Toby pulling the trigger vis-?-vis one murder. Toby Howard is the anti-hero. Toby's brother who robs banks with Toby is an outright villain.The Usual Show these days has a large apparently all encompassing plot (here the mysterious ways of the banks) that basically makes no sense, with the lack of sense compensated for by a small group drama, with the Usual Show possessing male anti heroes who only act via personal codes and always act outside the law with revenge and protecting family basically the only goals of such anti heroes. Toby Howard is basically the antihero in the Usual Show. Toby Howard though somewhat sympathetic deserves a sentence of life in prison. Anti-heroes being accepted in society is, of course, horrible. Sympathy in prison yes. Connected up to a prison chaplain, yes. Wary admiration and grudging acceptance in society, no.Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton who is a Texas Ranger. Marcus Hamilton plays the hero though a very un-politically correct hero. The racist comments of Marcus Hamilton were not even remotely charming though otherwise Marcus Hamilton appeared to be a good cop.The villain is gunned down. This isn't a battle between hero and villain. This is a battle between hero and anti-hero. 'Hell or High Water' leaves open who wins between hero and anti-hero.Anti-hero clearly has won in Hollywood. Hardly a movie can be made where the main characters don't act in various totally unacceptable ways. Is there an eagerness for anti-heroes or are the Powers that Be in Hollywood pushing anti-heroes on the movie going public? The later. People are attracted to horror movies and though more money could be made with edgy movies with heroes or ordinary guys rising to the occasion the Powers That Be in Hollywood can make enough money pushing horror movies with the anti-hero genre a horror genre. That the Powers That Be in Hollywood could make more money in other genres is not to the point. The fourth house is just a hassle. In Texas today Toby Howard would be on death row. Toby Howard is the obvious suspect. How an investigation even mildly inconveniences the bank is not clear. Texas Rangers letting the murder of Texas Ranger go unpunished is very unlikely. There could be no conceivable reason for doing so. Texans admiring and protecting a man who gunned down Texans while robbing banks - not likely. The main difficulty with the movie is that it purports to be a movie about West Texas when the movie is actually is a murky commentary on movies made in Hollywood. A point should be made vis-?-vis Hollywood horror movies. They don't reveal any larger plot vis-?-vis society. Horror is pushed for the sake of horror. There are numerous silos in Hollywood which the Powers That Be vis-a-vis Hollywood totally allow. Amidst such silos individuals are encouraged to hold that such individuals are making cultural contributions vis-?-vis a group with whatever is believed okay as long as horror movies are made. Different silos consult with various academics and critics who to put the matter bluntly pull the wool over the eyes of individuals who consult such individuals. Actually the academics and critics are the drivers as Hollywood execs are lost at sea as to how to shape the culture and desperately want advice, know that that there are criticism cults of all sorts that must be navigated and these academics seem somewhat sensible. Horror does sell after all. Academics who are pleasant, erudite, softly spoken apparently warm can be even more terrible than an impossible Hollywood director or an impossible actor. The Powers that Be are always very, very reasonable sorts. Along in with the pushing of horror on the US there is an attempt by the Powers that Be to nurture antiheroes in 3D but the Powers that Be are totally okay with poor people being ripped off by banks. What the Powers That Be are looking for is people like Stephen Bannon of Breitbart a totally amoral individual who will do anything to push a 'Common Good' which is now vis-?-vis the Powers That Be a populism that is an attack on the separation of Powers, an attack on the Executive branch and an attack on the Judicial Branch. Vis-?-vis the goal of attempting to nurture individuals who are totally amoral vis-a--vis a 'Common Good' movies with antiheroes who gun down bank guards etc are given the greenlight by the Powers that Be in Hollywood. The main point vis-?-vis the Powers That Be is that individuals must be willing to act amorally vis-?-vis some 'Common Good'. The generation of horror and the attempt to nurture people who are totally amoral vis-?-vis the gaining of some 'Common Good' is now what Hollywood is about. The Iraqi FUBAR of George Bush is an example of what the Powers That Be have achieved and are capable of. Popular entertainment dominated by horror makes various political policies more easily pushed. For example, with Hollywood movies filling the screens with horror the need to 'Make our Nation Great Again' seems sensible to some. 'Hell or High Water' then is a murky, horrible movie.</fullReview>

He exits. And there he is standing, having a casual conversation with his brother. No blood dripping, etc.Then, he's stopped by the cops. By now, there should be blood on the seat, on the clothing, on his hands -- all visible by the officer. He sits calmly while the officer checks his ID, which had not an ounce of blood on it. He sits there, in no distress ? even though he has a gunshot wound.This was just plain stupid and insults filmgoers' intelligence.Otherwise, the film was reasonably entertaining.</fullReview>
