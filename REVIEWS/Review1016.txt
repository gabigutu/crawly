		<shortDescription>Problematic in presentation, gender relations, and believability - your average Nicholas Sparks film adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Nicholas Sparks' film adaptations go, Ross Katz's "The Choice" is a better film than the bland "Longest Ride" we got last year and certainly miles past the perplexing and downright unbelievable "Safe Haven" in 2013. With that being said, it's still burdened by the same kind of misguided tropes and cloying incredulity that makes each of these films a chore to sit through. These films come decorated in the same kind of clothing as the next, as they're built from the ground up on impossibly romantic circumstances, characters that always look beautiful no matter what, a truly tragic plot device played up perfectly to engineer an emotional reaction rather than naturally warrant one, and a slew of "perfect moments" to make your relationship with your significant other look like a slog. And, specific to this one, seriously questionable treatment of its female character. Happy Valentine's Day.This time, we focus on Travis Parker (Benjamin Walker), a veterinarian working with his father (Tom Wilkinson) at his practice, living in the small coastal town of Beaufort, North Carolina. Travis lives on his own and enjoys the peacefulness brought on by cold beer, his beach chair, and his dog, until his quietness is disrupted by his new neighbor Gabby Holland (Teresa Palmer). Gabby is a med student, who is currently dating a fellow doctor, but her playfully stubborn aura makes her all the more attractive to Travis.When her boyfriend leaves for a medical retreat for several weeks, the two succumb to intense emotional desires, have sex, and begin to that thing that so many young people do nowadays where they act like they're dating to others, have sex and sleep together like they are, but really aren't together. When her boyfriend gets back, Gabby immediately wants things to go back to the way things were before he left, leaving Travis out to dry, and making them both look like immature, stupid people who can't appropriately handle or discuss their own baggage. Nonetheless, Gabby winds up breaking up with him and her and Travis wind up getting married and starting a family of their own.This may sound like I just went through the entire film's plot, but that wouldn't make sense since I never addressed the core "choice" this film and its two lead characters love to talk about through narration. Well, "the choice" comes towards the end, when a catastrophic accident occurs and leaves one of the parties with a big decision. However, Katz (who directed "Adult Beginners" two years ago) and screenwriter Bryan Sipe rush through this whole circumstance at the end like it's a big afterthought. The fundamental "choice" of the film isn't introduced until far too late in the picture, where it can't develop, and as a result, feels like a tacked on conclusion."The Choice" is a tad more forgivable than many other Sparks-branded pictures because at least one of our leads has an ounce of personality this time around. Benjamin Walker's, who already looks and talks like a young Colin Firth, Travis is a very snarky character throughout the picture, which at least makes him an interesting personality rather than a plastic presence. Teresa Palmer's Gabby is a blander, more ordinary female lead, but her ability to handle the more dramatic scenes with competence makes up for her lack of character development.I think the most problematic thing about "The Choice" as a whole is the strange way it tries to pass off unromantic instance as romantic, and, if we're going to be completely critical of the film's ideology here, almost makes a case for "no means yes" misogyny that has plagued women for decades. Consider the scene when Travis drives all the way out to Gabby's parents' home, where she is staying for the weekend, to ask her parents for her hand in marriage. Gabby is clearly horrified by this entire circumstance, yet her mother and father are in awe of Travis's conviction of wanting to marry her. Though she repeatedly says "no" a good dozen times, her mother and father keep insisting that this is what's best for her, going as far to say this is what she wants, and even encourage Travis by giving him a ring with which to propose. The next scene, they're happily married in a church. What a strange, uncomfortable scene that illustrates the least romantic circumstance that basically tells Gabby's character, "stop resisting, smile, and accept the ring, you ingrate." Getting all riled up about the gender relations in the latest Nicholas Sparks' film is a losing battle in and of itself because these films are so contrived and detrimental not only to men and women but romantic expectations in general that pervasive analysis only warrants a headache. This is another loser in the long line of these mediocre, incredulous films that perpetuate false ideas of romance with the same narrative structure and emotional manipulation so much so that the white flag I've been waving at these films for the last few years, in utter defeat and contempt, has long been discolored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a movie you can zone out during this is the one for you! The Choice once again delivered Nicholas Sparks tried-and-tested formula, full of Hallmark moments oh and not forgetting a basket full of puppies!! Only this time it felt a bit like a check list. Boy meets girl &#x2713; Girl is not interested in boy &#x2713; Boy and girl get together &#x2713; Boy takes girl out in a rowing boat &#x2713; Boy and girl split up &#x2713; Boy and girl get back together &#x2713; etc etc etcThe problem is whilst the screen writer and director are ticking off the list they forgot to make it credible. (I felt incredibly sorry for Gabby's dog who gives birth to puppies who look about 8 weeks old OUCH!!) I will say that in the cinema there were a group of girls around 14 years old all ahhing, laughing, crying and clapping so I guess I now know which audience this movie is aimed at. Would I recommend my friends go see this movie? No but I would tell them to watch it on TV if they were looking for something to watch and fill time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. When the word formulaic is used to describe a movie or book, it's typically meant as a disparagement. We must admit, however, that if the formula works, it only makes sense (and dollars) to stick with it. Most Hollywood blockbuster franchises are built around a basic formula ? superheroes, romantic-comedies, alien invasions, etc. Author Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook) has taken his tragic-romance novel formula and turned it into big screen gold. This is the eleventh film developed from his writing, and it's likely to be another successful entry into the Sparks canon.Director Ross Katz (Adult Beginners, 2015) is at the helm of the screenplay by Bryan Sipe (upcoming Demolition) and many of the familiar Sparks features are present. First off, the key players are all exceedingly attractive ? Ralph Lauren model attractive. Secondly, there is a will they/won't they romance that will of course happen and then may fall apart, but probably won't. And third, some type of tragedy will occur that will kick off a stream of tears from a certain segment of the audience.This one begins with a narrator's humble-brag promising to tell us the "secret of life". That narrator is Travis, played with an over-flowing abundance of southern charm by Benjamin Walker (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, 2012). His main vices are a tendency to use "damn" to the point of overkill in most every conversation, and his natural ability to attract the ladies. Oh, and he has a rescue dog and a lake house and he is a veterinarian. See, in the Sparks universe, everyone is beautiful and successful. Travis has his eye on his new neighbor, who is pretending to be annoyed but mostly admits to playing a game of hard-to-get. This is Gabby (Teresa Palmer, Warm Bodies 2013), and she is beautiful and a doctor-to-be. Gabby's current boyfriend is, of course, a handsome doctor. Ryan is played by Tom Welling (a bit heftier than his days as Clark Kent/Superman in "Smallville").The beautiful Maggie Grace (Taken) plays Travis' sister, and Alexandra Daddario (San Andreas) plays Monica ? she is not only beautiful, but she is also the nicest, most understanding and supportive "other" woman ever seen on screen. Tom Wilkinson plays Travis' veterinarian dad, and Sharon Blackwood plays the wise-cracking and match-making assistant Cora. If that's not enough beauty and success for you, we also get "puppies in a basket"! Come for the chuckles and tears ? just not twists or surprises. Fans of this genre will get exactly what they want. It's a romantic fantasy set in the somewhat realistic world of doctors, veterinarians, and equestrians. The faces are perfect. The dialogue is snappy without being demanding (even in the God discussion). Many scenes feature loyal dogs, or a serene lake, or the "moon and stars". Even the difficult parts of life ? raising kids, health issues, etc ? are given the "yada, yada, yada" treatment. While Travis claims over and over that Gabby "bothers him", it's the kind of bother that creates a cryfest in the theatre ? whether things go right or wrong. It's also the reason that all eleven Sparks films feature a couple of lovers on the poster. Just remember, if that formula works ?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Textbook Romantic Drama ? whatever that's suppose to mean.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Nicholas Sparks' (The Notebook) novel adapted for the screen where there's some love, some sadness, some happiness and a dash of mystery. 'The Notebook' was such a captivating love story that it cemented Mr sparks word on romance as the only word. The many mediocre stories that followed proved otherwise. Perhaps it's in the medium and the storyteller's ability to take the novel and turn it into a successful screenplay? But 'The Last Song', where Mr Sparks flexed his screenplay talents, is without a doubt the worst of the bunch.Neighbours, Travis and Gabby, meet as most annoying neighbours meet, in a heated engagement over noise, which quickly turns from outrage to mild intrigue to full on schoolyard-smitten. She's a doctor to be from a wealthy family and he a vet from modest upbringings ? complete with a southern accent even though neither his sister nor father shares this accent. How peculiar. Was Benjamin Walker merely flexing his craft for accents or was it that nobody wants to hear Tom Wilkinson attempt a southern accent? And then how does one make the creative decision, do we remove the southern charm or remove Tom Wilkinson? You remove neither and pretend no one will notice, which, as you can see, totally worked. Smooth transition, my foreign soul totally couldn't tell that the Parks family don't share a familial speech pattern. But major digression there.So, the doctor to be and the wild and crazy animal doctor ? I know right, a wild and crazy vet because that's so common to find ? more digression.So, they flirt over a litter of puppies and with a few smooth moves are engulfed in the intoxication of the other. Things seem to be moving on swimmingly until things stop moving along swimmingly. Mainly because it gets a little boring. Or a lot boring, depending on the type of person you are. But the boredom is there, how much you want to drink up is entirely up to you. I personally could have had fifteen per cent less and a tad more T&amp;A but apparently there's more romance in the awkward middle than the sexy beginning.Give or take a few captivating moments, 'The Choice' is not as moving as 'The Notebook', nor is it as sexy as "The Longest Ride" but it is nowhere near as brain-dead as "The Last Song" ? take that for what its worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, welcome to the assembly line. Where the pick-up/proposal line of the day is 'Bother me all my life, come be my wife'. I did ask for it, heading to this one on the big screen in this season, but then, perhaps not, since Sparks has had decent flicks to his credit, not the least being 'Message in a bottle', or 'The notebook' (even 'A walk to remember' had its moments, to be fair). First, the good parts, which barely pass muster: a good-looking lead pair (Walker, hot off 'In the heart of the sea' and our very own 'Abe Lincoln: Vampire hunter'n and Kristen Stewart stand-in Teresa Palmer), lush visuals and locations, across the Carolinas (or what stands in for those) albeit low-rent to a T, supporting actors slumming for their paychecks (Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Grace...) propping this up a few notches, from its deserved status as a made- for-TLC movie (in hindsight, perhaps they shouldn't have signed on?)....and some of the background score is passable too....And I confess, Palmer and Daddario are easy on the eyes, while there's something about Grace.....(more on that below)The bad parts? Everything else. From the predictability of the plot, to the very badly written lines (how did the actors keep a straight face for most of it...I'm sure there's a blooper reel in there someplace), to the entire 3d act, which almost makes a case for how not to make your flick/novel/plot/screenplay/story predictable/by- the-numbers, and reflecting on the bad days that Smallville's Tom Welling is having to see after the demise of his TV series. Ben Walker and Tessa Palmer can survive this, so can Wilkinson, but can Welling? Now, Maggie Grace. Won't deny she's got talent, or a frigging good agent. There's something about the time she spends on the screen that just....makes one want (right since she was 'Lost', and then, ahem, 'Taken' thrice) to close your eyes and shut your ears, while shuddering all the time. This outing of her's is no different. In spite of the decent parts described above, this one's predominantly a complete waste of time, effort and money.....but there's an audience for such cinema, for sure.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Nicholas Sparks film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I had the opportunity to win screening tickets to "The Choice". Having seen several Nicholas Sparks book-to-movies before I knew what I was signing up for. "The Choice" follows Travis (described as a "ladies man" but not, in my opinion, a devout "ladies man"- more like a guy who makes poor relationship choices) and medical student Gabby, whose lives as next- door neighbors eventually lead to something more. The first half of the movie was slow and rather bland, with stilted dialogue, characters who remained devoid of any development, and wooden acting on the part of Teresa Palmer. She grated on my nerves for most of the film until I realized her speaking style was the same as many young women throughout the USA. The real star of the film, however, was Benjamin Walker. His authenticity and easygoing attitude shone through every scene he had. The second half of the movie picked up the pace, the tugging at the heartstrings, the laughs, and was thoroughly more enjoyable; At that point, it seemed as though the movie wasn't trying so hard to impress the audience.Like I said, once you've seen a Nicholas Sparks movie, you sorta know what to expect. There were a few highly memorable scenes where the dialogue and acting surpassed the tropes and formulas- namely the kitchen scene, and the confrontation at the dockside restaurant.Overall, it was an enjoyable movie if you want a love-story that you know will do its best to make you tear up. Keep an eye out for Benjamin Walker; I hope to see him in more projects.Oh, one more thing: Chihuahuas are not at all similar to Golden Retrievers. As someone who worked in the animal field, I don't understand how the director and crew didn't make more of an effort when the dogs and veterinarians figured so prominently in the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was, to me, the best of all the movies made from his books. The characters were actually real and believable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Every path you take leads to another choice. Some choices change everything." Travis (Walker) is a confirmed bachelor who loves being single and doing what he wants. When his new neighbor Gabby (Palmer) shows up at his house everything in him changes. Now Travis will stop at nothing to be with her. After all his pursuits he finally wins her over, but when the unthinkable happens Travis must once again make a choice that will affect both of their lives forever. Going in to this I was not excited at all. I know 99% of women love the Nicholas Sparks movies, but for me they are just too ridiculous. In the Notebook the main guy builds the woman he is obsessed with a house. In The Lucky One within a week of meeting the girl he fixes her car, boat and teaches her son to play baseball. It is hard for me to get past the perfect man image that is portrayed and they really lose me. Again, being a guy I am not the target audience for these movies. All that said this was, to me, the best of all the movies made from his books. The characters were actually real and believable. There were no over the top scenes and I was actually into this movie more than I expected. Without ruining anything, the ending did get over the top cheesy for me and lost me a little, but since this is a chick flick that is to be expected. Overall, it could have been because of my expectations but this was not a bad movie at all and is a date night movie women will love and men will be able to watch without too much pain. I surprisingly, extremely surprisingly, give this an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Presented with "The Choice", I'd rather just watch "The Notebook" again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a scale of 1 to 10, "The Choice" (PG-13, 1:51) is an 11 ? and that's a fact. Hmmm. Maybe I should clarify. It's a fact this is the 11th Nicholas Sparks book to come to the big screen and that's significant. Although the most popular Sparks adaptation is 2004's "The Notebook", the author's big-screen streak started at the end of the last century with the Kevin Costner starrer "Message in a Bottle". The film that rounds out Sparks' first cinematic decathlon is 2015's "The Longest Ride". On one hand, movie adaptations of his books have made a lot of money ? an average of nearly 2 ? times what they cost to make (and that's in U.S. box office receipts alone)! On the other hand, only one Sparks film ("The Notebook") garnered over 50% positive critical reviews as counted by Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. But who listens to the critics, right? I like to think you're reading this review because the Movie Fan FB page is run by movie fans and for movie fans. But (big but)? in this case? we agree with the critics. We've enjoyed the Nicholas Sparks movies that we've seen (to varying degrees, of course) ? including "The Longest Ride" (his last one before this one) but "The Choice"? Not so much. Allow me to explain? Travis Parker (Benjamin Walker) is a free-wheeling bachelor who lives in a big house on the waters of (what some people have taken to calling) the "Inner Banks" of North Carolina. He has a boat, he's handy with a hammer and he loves animals so much that he became a veterinarian. (Are you swooning yet?) He's also handsome and charming ? and he knows it. In fact, he uses his positives to flirt shamelessly and sometimes dates steadily? but never really commits. His new neighbor is Gabby Holland (Teresa Palmer). (Naturally, she lives right next door. All the better for Travis and Gabby to eyeball each other.) Gabby is pretty and has a killer bod. She's smart enough to be a medical student, assertive enough to complain when the noise level next door interrupts her studying and she's a fairly deep, spiritual person. She also loves animals. She and Travis each have big dogs, a female for Gabby and a male for Travis. Other than their pets, they have very little in common and their personalities often clash. Their first encounter includes Gabby yelling at Travis and Travis telling Gabby that she bothers him. In spite of (or maybe because of) all that, of course, they fall in love. (And if you think that's a spoiler, then you probably don't know who Nicholas Sparks is and probably wouldn't be going to see this movie anyway.) It also won't come as a surprise to most Movie Fans that Travis and Gabby's romance quickly becomes more complicated than simply some differences in temperament and the way they see the world. For starters, they're both already in relationships with other people. Gabby is practically engaged to the kind and handsome young Dr. Ryan McCarthy (Tom Welling) and Travis is "off-and-on" with the beautiful and devoted Monica (Alexandra Daddario). But that doesn't stop Travis or Gabby from flirting with each other and spending time together privately, and doing? other stuff, when Ryan is out of town and when Monica isn't around. Meanwhile, Travis is being encouraged by his sister, Stephanie (Maggie Grace) and his father, Dr. Shep (Tom Wilkinson), who owns the veterinary practice where Travis works. Of course, sooner or later, Monica is going to come around again and Ryan is going to come back home. In the interest of avoiding actual spoilers, I won't tell you how those inevitable encounters go and I won't tell you about "the choice" referenced in the movie's title? even though the first scene strongly hints at it."The Choice" is predictable, overly formulaic and not very romantic. The movie emphasizes the cute over the cuddly. The cute scenes are a mixture of kind of cute and mildly annoying, while the romantic scenes need more? Sparks. The problems start with Sparks' over reliance on an increasingly tired formula, Bryan Sipe's unrealistic, immoral (with all that cheating and deception) and sometimes silly script and Ross Katz' uninspired direction, but the biggest problem is the two romantic leads. Walker seems to be borrowing too heavily from the Matthew McConaughey Book of Southern Charm, and, especially at certain angles, Walker looks distractingly like a young Liam Neeson (a perception just reinforced by seeing his character's sister played by the same young woman who played Neeson's daughter in the "Taken" films). For her part, Palmer doesn't do anything to make herself more alluring when her character starts to show interest in Walker's character ? or even make any effort to seem likable. Their acting is barely passable and, even worse, they have about as much on-screen chemistry as a couple of empty test tubes. As bad as all that is, the portion of the movie after the film's titular dilemma is revealed, but before THE choice is actually made is interminable. Hard-core Nicholas Sparks fans may like this movie, but presented with? the choice, I'd suggest just watching "The Notebook" again. My choice is to give this unromantic romance a "D+", while hoping that the next two Sparks adaptations ("At First Sight" and "True Believer") manage to be more touching? or, at least tolerable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Nicholas Sparks, You either like these things or you don't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm about half way on the Nicholas Sparks Love ? Hate scale. I feel roughly the same when it comes to all of these movies. I sit there, counting down the clichés and thinking about how it's the same god damn thing, but I'm not tearing my eyes out. I'm not going to attack people for liking it, demand my money back after seeing it or try to call Nicholas Sparks mean names. I mean hell, he's made eleven movies out of this gig, I guess he's doing something right. And yes The Choice feels the same, and it's not really anything new.Nicholas Sparks based movies tend to not be too strongly centred around the actual story, but the characters. The world doesn't change around them, and the events effect nobody but the protagonists, but the relationship is why people bother in the first place. The Choice is no different and this is no surprise.The movie tells the story of a girl who moves in next door to a guy, they annoy each other and initially sort-of dislike each other, then time goes on and eventually end up loving each other? Then some other stuff happens. Look the actual story is nothing new. Have you seen Safe Haven? The Last Song? Countless other movies in this genre? Then you've seen this. The difference in these movies are the actual characters, however trivial or gimmicky these differences may be. Travis is a formulaic easy going guy with a southern accent and a cowboy attitude, he is loud and obnoxious and annoys the girl next door; Gabby, she's an intelligent woman who's interning to be a doctor? with some obligatory drama added in, these characters interact and we see their relationship grow throughout the film. This is used as an obligatory comparison between the two protagonists, as he's introduced partying and listening to rock and roll. There are also some side characters in the film who are simply not people in any sense of the word. They play along as 'Friend Number 1,' 'Friend number 2,' and 'friend 1's wife' and so on. They also seem have all of the free time in the world, can ditch their children whenever it's convenient and look like they're auditioning to advertise picnics on the cover of some magazine as they all smile for eternity and are nothing but absolutely perfect at having fun and partying. I'll keep my complaints here limited, as this isn't too big of a deal considering that they are side characters. Some other side characters with more depth however appear in the film too; Gabby's boyfriend from the beginning of the film Ryan is a doctor whose parents own the hospital where she and he work. (They all have relationships that are super complicated to explain in these movies!) He's predictably played off as some 'Villain' character even though he actually doesn't do anything wrong? The morals regarding this part of the story I personally find to be pretty messy? If anything, Gabby is the villain? Travis' family including his father and sister are also present. His sister doesn't really have a story of her own but acts as a catalyst for dialogue. His father has a sad and cute little story of his own thrown in for good measure as well. The movie uses many open shots of lakes, beaches, stars and so on to romanticize everything in the film from something as prominent as the protagonists' relationship to even minor details. Everything looks perfect. This movie is like an advertisement. It glorifies its' settings, praises its' characters and unrealistically portrays a life of? perfectness. It's an advertisement. You want to have a relationship like this, you want to live in a place like this and you want to be as happy as all of the perfect people in the movie. Anything that does go wrong is soon shown as a good thing because it showed how much characters loved each other or it helped in some way that wasn't obvious at first. The dialogue is cheesy, but the actors are competent enough and do sell the emotion. Especially on Benjamin Walker's part playing Travis, I admit he turned out to be pretty likable even after being initially unlikable. I even felt a little for him in the final act. Whether they are phoning it in or not, I believe that the actors do a good job here. Nothing ground-breaking in terms of film acting but nothing illusion breaking either. The writing does feel is lazy, as we fall back into elements taken straight out of the ten previous installments of this 'franchise.' It's also extremely unbalanced. There is a part in the film where I could have sworn that could have been the ending and it would have been fine? But it just kept going? But if you just sit back and watch, it's a cute little film to see on (or around) valentine's day. Being predictable, full of exaggerated emotion and attempting to be as romantic as can possible be, The Choice is a hit or miss. See it or not. If you don't see it you're certainly not missing out too much, but if you want to see it, then by all means see it and you'll get what you expect. It's better than Safe Haven and not as good as The Notebook. But honestly that's just splitting hairs. You've seen this before, but if it's your type of film, you'll probably enjoy it. Over all, I personally found the story to be somewhat lacking in originality, but the characters to be somewhat likable and the third act to be somewhat emotional despite being predictable and rushed. This movie's no masterpiece, but it's not offensive either. It's fine. And hey! This one has dogs! I like dogs! 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very romantic and enjoyable film. A lot of people will hate it because of the lack of computer graphics. For my money the leading lady in a bikini is a testament again to the fact God creates much greater beauty than anything man can dream up. I have enjoyed most of the Sparks films. They are laid back and stress love. What people don't like about that is hard to figure. Maybe if the neighbor had been wonder woman or transgender or whatever it would have gotten rave reviews. I watched it with my daughter and I almost teared up. The scenery is grand too, makes you want to move south (dont forget the heat tho, its brutal) OK, I liked it and you will too if you have a heart inside your chest or you are a guy who digs extremely pretty females Like I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Veterinarian Travis Shaw (Benjamin Walker) falls in love with his new neighbor and medical student Gabby (Teresa Palmer). They marry, have kids and there is an accident and one of them has to make a life and death Choice. Hey, you did see the title of this, right?Just like you need - from time to time - a really good, tasty cheeseburger you also need ? from time to time- to watch a really good love story to let you know there is more to life than that really good, tasty cheeseburger. (stop already, I'm getting hungry) Having relative newcomers star in this makes everything seem more real than having seasoned actors star because we are not sure what the newcomers are going to do next. This goes along at a good pace as the relationship builds with good flirty dialogues and really good serious dialogues later on. If truth be told we see that the serious dialogues prove to be the real winners in here. Also, the intensity in Travis' eyes from time to time when he looks at Gabby reminded me of the intensity of Bubba Watson's (pro golfer) eyes as he contemplates his next shot. And it is here we see something more real than was anticipated. And, of course, because Gabby is very pretty, the chemistry between them is spot on. (you falling in love again?)Notables: It was nice to see Tom Welling as Ryan, the boyfriend before Travis. I hardly recognized him as he had bulked up to such a degree he could now play Superman (he played a young Clark Kent in the TV Smallville series). And Tom Wilkinson as Shep, Travis' doctor father. This is very enjoyable and yet, we know an accident will happen later on and someone has to make a choice and everything is intensified. Keep a box of Kleenex handy as you are going to need it. This movie is on par with THE BEST OF ME, by the same author Nicholas Sparks. (9/10)Violence: Yes, the accident. And Ryan does punch Travis. Sex: Yes, but nothing graphic. Nudity: No. Language: No.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Nicholas Sparks Movies so Far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all but 2 of his movies A night in rodanthe and message in a bottle. Which I plan on watching them soon. And I have to say this is the best one I think. I loved it. I would definitely watch it again. And I would recommend others to watch it. Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors. I love how Travis tells Gabby to come bother him again. Instead of the normal just come back to me. The choice is a different take on a love story. Most love story are the same but this one has some twists in it. Good twists though. Love love love it. I can not wait to go buy this movie on DVD. And until Nicholas Sparks next book or movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't write reviews, but this movie was fantastic. The movie pulled at your heart throughout the entire movie. Its funny, sexy, and sad with a case of real life thrown in for good measure. The characters are fantastic, and the setting on the coast if beautiful. Did you ever have that real love in your live, and you could feel it slipping away, well this is the movie for you. What did you do to get it back, or to try and get it back? Did you walk away and say it wasn't meant to be, or did you fight for it? Did you give it your all? Well, take a watch of this one, and see what happens. You will be glad you went for a spin. Be prepared for a roller coaster for ups and downs on the emotional scale. In the end, can you make The Choice?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but No Surprises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cheesy, corny, formulaic romantic comedy. This is no problem as long as the viewers know going in what to expect. Everything is in here. Both leads are young, good looking, educated, professional, have good jobs and make good money. She is a doctor and he is a veterinarian. Both have houses on the Atlantic Coast (Carolina), waterfront properties with views of the water, oak trees with moss hanging from them and sea birds flying around. They both have dogs. She has a Golden Retriever. He has a Saint Bernard. He has a boat. They both like their jobs. He is a ladies' man who could have any woman he wanted. She is dating the young good looking doctor at her hospital. They both fall madly in love with each other, get married, have two beautiful kids. Their dogs snuggle together. Everything is warm and fuzzy.Then one night, they are supposed to meet for a romantic dinner. He was late for the last one because he is dedicated to his job and patients. He is just getting ready to go when another patient with a pet emergency comes into his clinic. So, he is late again. She is annoyed and disappointed. She leaves the restaurant in a driving rainstorm when tragedy strikes. We already know it is a romantic comedy, not a romantic tragedy. So, we know everything is going to work out. So, no surprises there. I think the first thirty minutes are too talky. Normal people don't act like that. Especially young people. And she is supposed to be feisty and independent minded. But she comes across as argumentative, disagreeable and annoying. But that is supposed to be okay because she smiles and giggles a lot. Some people say the acting is bad but, I don't agree. The writing is bad. The actors need to read their lines and play their parts. I think the acting is just fine.I think the movie is good (not great) if you want a cheesy, corny formulaic romantic comedy. Obviously there is a market for this. Sometimes people just want a light-hearted, feel good movie. They don't want a heavy drama filled with stress or angst. This movie will do it, if that is what you are looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fair Nicholas Sparks Novel Film Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So how does this compare to the films like The Notebook,Dear John,A Message To A Bottle,A Walk To Remember and many other Nicholas Sparks film adaptation that we are familiar with? Before I answer that,I would like to make a few presentation of what The Choice is all about.This movie is based on Sparks' novel of the same name about two engaged neighbors who fell in love and later faced tragedy during their married life. It stars Benjamin Walker and Teresa Palmer as Travis Shaw and Gabby Holland as the neighbors who are in a relationship that fell for each other and decided to abandon their present commitments in order to pursue their love for each other.Later,they decided to get married and a tragedy fell on them when Gabby met an accident and was left in a coma confined to the hospital.Will Travis feel enormous pain and be affected severely by it? Will Gabby wake up from her comatose state to the delight of her husband and children? Well,the one who is reading this review already knows the answer to that.Apparently,the film capitalizes on it being a Nicholas Sparks story and the fact that eleven of the prior film adaptation of his novels have delighted millions of people worldwide.Too bad that alone isn't enough to at least make this film at par with the said films.This definitely was purely clichéd,predictable and melodramatic.Anyone who have witnessed stories like this will not find anything new.Added to that,the lead stars - Walker and Palmer - fail to make their characters interesting that viewers will neither care nor cheer for them as their story unfold as film progresses.It simply fails to entertain which made it basically a fair film adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Least Surprising of the Nicholas Sparks Books-to-film Adaptations...but still worth watching thanks to the two leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forgive me for saying this, but I'm a sucker for love stories. I'm more familiar with the Nicholas Sparks brand because I remember the first time I actually got involved with his stories and that was "A Walk to Remember". It's been 14 years since that wonderful movie and 17 years since his first book-to-film being "Message in a Bottle" and it seems that the Sparks brand is still going and so far, he has written 18 books with one more coming out later this year and 11 of his books has been translated to the screen. The 11th is the more recent one and that is "The Choice". Now, I'll be honest. We know where this stuff is going, we know that it's predictable and we know where the twists are at. Still, "The Choice" is an impressive movie and what made me chose this movie are the two stars that made me smile and care as two characters who have two separate choices to make in their lives. After she made a terrific lead turn in one of my favorite surprises of 2013, "Warm Bodies", the always luminous Teresa Palmer keeps that star shining even brighter as Gabby Holland, a young nurse who moves to North Carolina and is the next-door neighbor of Travis Shaw (Benjamin Walker), a veterinarian who is a fun-loving party animal who hangs out with his friends and loves to drive girls crazy. Their friendship immediately starts off on the wrong foot when Gabby's dog gets pregnant and she blames him for letting his dog impregnate her. He asks her out, she rebuffs him. Mainly that's because she has a boyfriend in Dr. Ryan McCarthy (Tom Welling), who goes out of town. Also Travis gets blind-sighted by Monica (Alexandra Daddario), the girl his friends call "the boomerang". Anyway, he takes a liking to her, even though she "bothers" him, and then their friendship turns into something more than that. Then, in the tradition of Sparks, a tragedy happens and Travis and Gabby has to make two different choices. For Gabby, which man does she want to wake up with the next morning. For Travis, it's something a little more personal that I can't reveal. Usually, I stick around for the third-act of any Sparks movies to find out what happens next, but the third-act of "The Choice" is very obvious and somewhat dry. Like I said, we know what happens throughout the story, even if the final effect turns out to be something a little different. But what saves the movie and that last act are the magnetic chemistry of Palmer and Walker. Even though they may not match the magic of Noah &amp; Allie, Landon &amp; Jamie, Luke &amp; Sophia, John &amp; Savannah....and so on, Travis &amp; Gabby are appealing, flawed and earnest people. They do argue with one another most of the time, but there is a lot of love there for the rest of the time. These two actors have it, especially Walker (remember him as "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"?), who shows a lot of emotions that shows up right in the final act. The movie also gets some solid support from Maggie Grace as Travis's sister, Stephanie and Tom Wilkinson, still superb as always as Dr. Shep, who is Travis's dad and also a veterinarian. It's also not afraid to show some humor in there too. Whether you think it's intentional or unintentional, well, that's your choice. I like the movie and the actors, so that's my opinion. However, I think that Mr. Sparks should try something a little more original and unpredictable. I know there's a reason why he's called the master of romance because he does appeal to the women as well as the hopeless romantics. He does produces some lavishing productions, though. I'm only hoping for it and I'm just saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . so naturally there's nothing but good things to say about Nicholas Sparks' latest flick, THE CHOICE. This film has all the hallmarks that fans have come to expect from a Sparks yarn. A family of veterinarians mixed up with TWO families of doctors! A womanizing atheist preacher's son! Class conflict, in which the Poor People's Pawn owns a half million dollar speed boat, a private island, scenic beach-front property, a professional degree, and a piece of the family business! The threat of second-generation widowers and second-generation kids Shorn of a parent! A main character's car suddenly T-boned with NO WARNING AT ALL on a dark, stormy night! Sex on the kitchen table! An approaching hurricane which may decide to "pull the plug" when no one else can! A snapshot from Yesteryear which may change everything! Free Will versus PreDetermination! Fiances and fiancées dumping like flies! Pets bringing people together! Quirks of Fate which open Family Size cans of "What If's."

		<shortDescription>The worst. or best.. compilation of romantic clichés ever. Spoiler alert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the misfortune to have this as the in flight 'entertainment' on my last vacation, and although I admit that I started to watch in an optimistic fashion it soon became very much like the fascinating spectacle of watching a snake swallow a rodent. You really don't want to watch but you just can't help it. Romantic cliché after cliché followed like beads on a rosary... OK you get my drift... simile after simile.. same old same old. OK spoiler alert.. but do I really need one? They MEET CUTE... are involved with OTHER PEOPLE...but just CAN'T RESIST. There are MISUNDERSTANDINGS. Of COURSE they get together... YES she winds up in a coma... he is TORN about taking her off life support.... MIRACULOUSLY she wakes up looking BEAUTIFUL... and they live happily every after.. barf barf. I played Farm Heroes Saga through 90% of this, but as I said, morbid fascination kept me checking in to see what trite plot 'twist' would come up next. Don't waste your time on this! I'm just glad it was free on the plane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***For me this movie is successful in contrast that it is noted that he by a formulary something and with negative reviews would be laden, although I do not know the previous work of Nicholas Sparks i have been fascinated by the film and slightly emotional undergone certainly toward the end.*** -The Choice is a 2016 American romantic drama film directed by Ross Katz and written by Bryan Sipe, based on Nicholas Sparks' 2007 novel of the same name about two neighbors who fall in love at their first meeting. The film stars Benjamin Walker, Teresa Palmer, Maggie Grace, Alexandra Daddario, Tom Welling, and Tom Wilkinson.-Principal photography began on October 13, 2014, in Wilmington, North Carolina. Lionsgate released the film on February 5, 2016.--Critical response: -The Choice has received negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 8%, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Like the 10 Nicholas Sparks movies before it, The Choice finds tragedy striking star-crossed lovers in the sun-dappled South ? yet even for those who loved its predecessors, this gauzy melodrama may feel painfully formulaic." Metacritic reports a score of 26 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.-Frank Schenk of the Hollywood Reporter criticized the film as being "the cinematic equivalent of staring at a Hallmark Card for two hours." A. A. Down of the A.V. Club called it "a formulaic mush". Moira Macdonald of the Seattle Times wrote the film "moves inexorably to its inevitable tear-jerky end." Andrew Barker of Variety describes the film as "beginning as a merely mediocre retread of standard Sparksian tropes, veering off into self-parody around the hour-mark, and finally concluding with one of the most brazenly cynical climaxes recently committed to film." Devan Coggan of Entertainment Weekly concluded that the film was a "predictable, recycled mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholas Sparks most disappointing film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched all and read most of his stories, I consider myself a big Nicholas Sparks fan. Give me cheese ball romance any day of the week! I've never been disappointed in his book to film adaptations! Opening day, I was ready and excited to watch Gabby and Travis' cinematic love story after not being able to put the book down. Well somebody (or everybody) slaughtered this film. Theresa Palmer lacked.. Everything. Her acting was awful 80% of the time.. While I feel like I warmed to Benjamin Walker as Travis.. I think it's only because I had already loved him from the novel.. The actors had no chemistry.. Their relationship felt rushed and odd. The scene at the diner..... What was that??? I felt like Travis was almost being portrayed as dangerous.. Or a bit of a psycho.. Which he certainly isn't. The relationship with Travis &amp; his father was another odd and confusing one - something Nicholas Sparks is usually great at. And all I could think about when Travis' sister was on screen was how bad her wig was...The actual choice (which may I add is supposed to be the premise of the movie.. Hence the title.. "The Choice") is barely touched on. It's a pretty huge, deep and powerful aspect in the book but they brushed past it very quick.. Much like most of the movie. I went to see this with my mother who has not read the book. She had no expectations.. Just the knowledge that she enjoyed every other Sparks movie. She hated it too. It had so much potential but something went very very wrong..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The girl next door and the bad boy on the spot, fall in love and are swept on a dreamy journey of their own through the moon and the stars and the soppy details of a birthing romance that will only be the greatest story ever to unfold just for the two of them. The thing about love is that its only as great as the two of you. Its almost as I have seen this movie before! How different can this one be? Especially considering the fact that this is the 11th Nicolas Spark novel to be made into a movie. His system works for some reason. It brings in the attention of the production houses and his ideas manage to pull in decent dollars. So why mess with a system that works? Lets just go ahead and make the pictures.Travis (Benjamin Walker); the Casanova, the ladies man, the village veterinarian lives the life we all dream of in terms of a summer holiday. A home by the water, beautiful garden overlooking a crystal blue lake, a BBQ grill, the solitary tree besides which his lawn chair sits, that makes the sunsets just magical to soak in with a beer in hand with his trusty canine to the side. Picturesque! Typical Nicolas Sparks "Bad Boy" Protagonist?. Check! Across the fence a dream catcher chimes in the wind. Introducing the Gabby (Teresa Palmer), short tempered of sorts, beautiful golden hair, alluring eyes, fragile smile, no make up and sweat pants. The picture is complete with this. Here we are given the standard Nicolas Sparks "Girl Next Door" ?. Check!Any guesses on what will happen next? I think you know. A flirtatious, sensual 111 minutes of how Travis and Gabby composes their own little story that has been told one too many times. With no intricacy to the characters of any sorts to build upon Walker and Palmer pull off exceptional acting capturing the innocence of any budding romance. Director Ross Katz indeed is a man with a vision. He knew exactly what he is doing and the leads new how to hit the nail on the head. I was moved ? momentarily of course. The screenplay is too disconnected for the rest of the cast to matter on any level except for the character of Steph (Maggie Grace) the sister, who is used as a launching pad for Palmer to find her footing in the picture.A must-watch if you have not seen any of the Nicolas Sparks adaptations (Only reason being ? you need to have watched at least one Nicolas Sparks adaptation- I would recommend A WALK TO REMEMBER). If you have seen one, you have seen it all. Isolated brilliance in performance and direction based on a texture-less screen play.TITLE: THE CHOICE DIRECTED BY: ROSS KATZ STARRING: Benjamin Walker, Teresa Palmer, Maggie Grace &amp; Tom Wilkinson RATED:PG13 RATING: 04/10 RUNTIME: 111 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie. Not for crabby, self-centered depressoids who want everything dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is beautifully filmed, powerfully themed and is a fun movie for us "great unwashed" who like a feel-good movie. It is not about people in hopeless poverty, or kafkaesque losers who try to beat the mafia. Set in stunningly beautiful North Carolina, it is the story of a lonely, ladies man who meets "the one". She is his neighbor who is a type AA and obviously, they clash. Over the course of time a complex, beautiful relationship develops. I know that's box office poison, anymore, because people try to think they're more intellectual if they like subtle, nuanced depressing movies.Travis and Gabby get through courting's vicissitudes and make a beautiful life together. Travis learns to be monogamous and Gabby learns to enjoy life. They get married, have children and then the sky falls in. Travis is crushed, because he has been running from God. He has to solidify shaky relations with his believing Father and make The Choice. Yes it has a happy ending. Yes it makes you laugh and cry. Is that really so bad, or so plebeian? I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not happening on this planet, actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was attracted to this movie by Teresa Palmer - she showed good acting skills, was gorgeous in some previous movies. And usually I like romantic movies. Sadly this was really not romantic, Teresa Palmer is now little old to play some medical student - she looks great, but 30 years is pretty obvious. Funny thing is that I liked now much more Alexandra Daddario (30 years too) and hers character. The setup of main characters (to say so) is just too "they are perfect" - both in medicine, well situated, good looking, having girl/boyfriend etc. Ah, forgot main thing - they have big, but cute dogs :-) This reminded me on movie "Must Love Dogs" . Is Teresa Palmer new Diana Lane ? I don't think so, after this movie certainly not. Title is Choice, there is some narration/philosophy about it at start and later, so let see what choices main characters did in this movie ? They met, had some silly talk what turned into flirting. Then met couple times again,and for me it was only good moment in this - when Gaby said "no", and 20 minutes after that invited him to dinner. To not spoil more, just to say that weakest part was after they legalized their relationship (ops. - OK, you have been warned :-) ) . Everything was just way too perfect. Then very cliché bad happening. And same cliché happy end. All choice here was to run after her to hers home and kneel - seen plenty times, although it was still better part. Main actors were not much inspired, and I can not blame them. Direction was just to tell the, hmm. story. What was of course way too predictable. Nothing here from real life problems, all problem was that they needed to get rid of former partners. Honestly, I feel sorry for such people - and don't know anyone actually. Maybe I was born on wrong planet ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Travis and Gabby. I love the way they are connected how they are met but I think the plot is too fast. I'm not be swept off feet. So, Travis and Gabby are in one neighborhood but Gabby its a newcomer. Gabby felt Travis always disturbing by playing out loud music by night because Gabby have to studied for her exam. Finally, Gabby bear herself to shout out her neighbor, Travis. But, I'm agree with Gabby that he annoying. And her dog, Molly just got pregnant by Travis's dog, Moby. One day Gabby took Molly to hospital and the pet's doctor is Travis. After that, Gabby and Travis go to the beach with friends and Gabby be welcoming to Travis. And actually Travis felt in love with Gabby, but Gabby has a boyfriend and they want to get married. Accidentally, Gabby felt in love too with Travis. Finally, Travis marrying Gabby. Because Gabby can't lie her feeling with her fiancé. She broke up with Ryan and married with Travis. Gabby got pregnant and they have two kids. One day, they planned a dinner (just two of them, Travis and Gabby). But, Travis late because he have to service his patience, cat. And because this is not the first time Travis late, Gabby decide to going home. When she drove she got car's accident and coma for almost 90 days, and doctor said after 3 month, chance of life is descend one percent by day. Travis cant do anything. He tried to built a gazebo in his island. Place when Gabby holding his hand and said to live here forever beneath the sky full of stars. And suddenly his instinct said that he have to run to hospital and see her wife, Gabby. And suddenly, in magical way, Gabby still a life! And she awake. And happily ever after~ It should be emotionally when Gabby in coma but I think its just too fast so I'm not crying when watching the movie. Unfortunately, but i still enjoyed the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again, Nicholas Sparks provides a tried-and-true formula for grand romance in a novel/film."The Choice" offers all of the predictable elements: an idyllic setting in the lap of nature; love at first sight; conflicts to overcome, especially in an extremely tall and muscular rival to whom the woman is engaged; the desperate marriage proposal on bended knee; the perfect nuclear family; the tragic auto accident, leading to a coma; the miraculous recovery; the tear-jerking ending; the final frame of the beautiful sunset.The two leading actors are winsome and have good chemistry, and there was some beautiful footage in the Southern coastal states. The dogs were especially adorable, including a basket of puppies.The film only misfired in the development of its title theme of "the choice." It is true that choices have outcomes, and chance occurrences often play a role in the outcomes of our choices. But the film did not offer profound insights into this reality of life.Still, this was a film that fulfilled all of the expectations we have come to appreciate from the sentimental vision of Nicholas Sparks. What more could one ask for high-caliber escapist filmmaking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK flick if you like Nicholas Sparks adaptations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.I think people and especially critics were a little bit to harsh on "The Choice" (2016). While it as usually has many, many, many eye rolling moments (and did i say many?), predictable plot "twists", meet- cute love, some descent photography of beautiful sight seeings of the most romantic and beautiful place on Earth (accoring to Nicholas Sparks) - North Carolina - this flick isn't bad. It has more then OK acting by both leads and OK performance by a great Tom Wilkinson, some very nice pacing (at running time 1 h 44 min this movie barely drags) and ... that's pretty much it about good things. Overall - this is corny as hell and far from the best or even good Nicholas Sparks adaptations, still this is not a bad movie to see it once, if you know what are you getting into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Choice", starring Benjamin Walker-In the Heart of the Sea, Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter; Teresa Palmer-Point Break_2015, Take Me Home Tonight; Alexandra Daddario-San Andreas, White Collar_tv; Tom Welling-Smallville_tv, The Fog_2015 and Maggie Grace-The Taken movies, The Fog_2015.This is a good date night movie to take your wife or girlfriend to. It is written and produced by Nicholas Sparks-if you don't recognize that name, you probably should not be seeing this movie-and it is the 11th movie that has been based on one of his books-You have heard of 'The Notebook', right? Anyway, Benjamin plays a veterinarian with Alexandra as his present girlfriend. Teresa is studying to be a doctor with Tom as her present boyfriend. Maggie is Benjamin's sister. Teresa moves next door to Benjamin and the sparks fly; more from him at first but you can tell she likes him, too. Only problem is they are both in relationships with other people-remember Tom &amp; Alexandra? What a dilemma! But don't worry, Mr Sparks knows a thing or two about relationship movies-he should, after 11 books-made-into-movies! I guess Mr Sparks will not be writing any super hero movies anytime soon. And be sure to bring a hanky for your date-or yourself-because there are some tears near the end. It's rated "PG-13" for some sexual content-no nudity-and some thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 51 minutes. Like I said, it's not a bad date movie-I have seen worse. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

Lurching over that place most people languish deep in dreams of yore or a surreal foretaste to requite beyond the horizon of concupiscence, I was borne, transfigured, and transcended. Poised high on a solitary perch, by and by, I lurched with quickened pulse, pitched to manumit my hitherto tethered heart and descended headlong toppling down into an abyss hand in hand with this really sweet script, tickled by all sweet Southern charm one can swallow. I know I fell cause when it was all over and the dust settled, not only my bruised achy bum achy, but my head and my lil' heart as well. Bleeding gooey aches of sappy love all over my bloody heart - I realized: 'Dang It, It Bothered me.' Really cute flix, really adorable, I did not read the novel, I just hope the adaptation was formidable to proper novel probity. But either way, as a tale in this medium, it played out really nicely, every scene plucking harder and tugging faster at an already achy breaky heart.</fullReview>

It really is a chick flick with great music and a few surprises.While watching it I thought it reminded me a little of the Notebook which I also love, it is basically a love story with a few "choices" and a happy ending. The title suited the film, and I would be happy to see it again.The soundtrack to the movie is great too, in fact we have just downloaded it in the car we loved it so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excess Unlikeability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the good parts of the movie: Maggie Grace and Tom Welling. Although their parts were relatively small, they consistently provided bright spots when they appeared and showed that they are still very likable people.Next, the bad parts of the movie (also referred to as "everything else"). To quickly sum up Travis and Gabby: they are two unlikeable characters portrayed by two unlikeable actors (at least in this movie). From the start, there was no way to care about either one of these people or the forthcoming tragedy that all Nicholas Sparks' films deliver. Everything about their relationship was just too unbelievable to take seriously. Needless to say, this was a very disappointing Sparks story for me and I wish I had waited for the DVD so I could have hit the fast forward button.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringe worthy movie (Spoiler altert!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst Sparksian film adaptations. I watched it with no expectations and it still let me down. I did not read the book either. I was in the mood for a romantic drama and believe me, I have seen a lot of these films. I have seen almost every Nicholas Sparks films. So, it begins. The same overused type of guy from almost every romantic drama film: tall, handsome, smart, rich, charming, never been in love (until now), player and of course, single. The girl: obviously hot, pretty, smart, playing hard to get, but irresistible. In the beginning they do not like each other, but eventually they fall truly, madly, deeply in love. The plot was extremely cheesy, but I expected that, so it did not really bother me that much. What really bothered me was the awkward acting and cringe-worthy lines. I have no idea how those actors managed to keep a straight face while delivering such awful lines. I caught myself blushing and feeling embarrassed at some point. And do not even get me started on those puppies! I almost felt offended! Did they really think the audience was so stupid? I mean, what normal person would believe that a few minutes old dogs are so big? They had their eyes open and they were newborns. Really?! And they looked like chihuahuas, even though the mother was a big dog (a Labrador or a Golden Retriever, cannot remember exactly). Oh, and the lizard scene! It was so obvious the lizard was a plastic one, like those reptile toys. They do not even try! It was a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terribly sappy and overtrodden, "The Choice" is a movie that begins with a bit of promise, but does nothing. It's a failure in both writing and direction - and a labor and terrible bore to watch. As the movie continues it gets more and more clichéd. Here's in excerpt off memory: "Because life just keeps happening and unfolding, if you sit still it may just pass you by." Romantic melodramas often have a hard time, and this thing doesn't even get off the ground. Its music was supremely manufactured. It was maudlin, cheap, and phony. It is an emotional fraud simple to see through reduced to sitcom level Hallmark writing. "Dear John" was fairly poor, and this was worse. 4/10 and mot recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambition to feel fresh but unfortunately it doesn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time for Nicholas Sparks' next film The Choice. I've previously here on Filmografen, ranked Sparks' films from best to worst and did then exclude this film because I hadn't seen it yet. The Choice is about Travis, a charming womanizer from the southern parts of USA. He lives by the sea and approach life in an easy manner. Gabby, a studying doctor, moves in next door and they immediately start to annoy each other. But what at first seems as dislike soon turns into interest and they begin a romance. But life isn't always a dance on roses and of course problems and dilemmas awaits around the corner.The Choice is a very typical Nicholas Sparks film and it contains most elements associated with his films. Questions about religion, a past incident or a memory that's been repressed and also somebody that died. I actually think that it starts out pretty good and it feels typical but still new. Drama and problems are not as enhanced as they usually are and their relationship feels normal. Usually there are extreme events such as a soldier saved by a woman from a photo or some other girl running away from a weird man, straight into the arms of a troubled one. The introduction sort of gives a clue of what to come, but at the same time we are offered a little twist near the end.I am both half happy and disappointed after having seen The Choice. I think they've been sloppy at times with the cinematography and despite the stunning locations, they often go with close-ups on the actors faces. Perhaps to hide the fact that they are shooting in a studio and if not, pity with such great outside locations. I don't think I can expect fresh new stuff from Mr Sparks in the near future and that's a shame. Perhaps many of his films are in fact on the same level but the more the concept and the story are used over and over again, the less interesting the film gets. I still think though, compared to for example The Longest Ride or The Lucky One, that here there was an ambition to create more realism and credibility, at least for the first 30 ? 45 minutes. Then it sort of dies out and at the end I just feel, well that was that, and what really was the meaning of that. The Choice could have been made better, the opportunity was thereDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Locations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie uses many open shots of lakes, beaches, stars and so on to romanticize everything in the film from something as prominent as the protagonists' relationship to even minor details. Everything looks perfect. This movie is like an advertisement. It glorifies its' settings, praises its' characters and unrealistically portrays a life of? perfectness. It's an advertisement. You want to have a relationship like this, you want to live in a place like this and you want to be as happy as all of the perfect people in the movie. Anything that does go wrong is soon shown as a good thing because it showed how much characters loved each other or it helped in some way that wasn't obvious at first. The dialogue is cheesy, but the actors are competent enough and do sell the emotion. Especially on Benjamin Walker's part playing Travis, I admit he turned out to be pretty likable even after being initially unlikable. I even felt a little for him in the final act. Whether they are phoning it in or not, I believe that the actors do a good job here. Nothing ground-breaking in terms of film acting but nothing illusion breaking either</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie. I did not love it, but I liked it, enough to rate it with a seven. I loved almost all of Nicholas Sparks movies so I've been eager to see this title and it did not let me down.It's a classical plot by Nicholas Sparks, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with the girl, everything is great for a while, and then there is the down low moment, after which all is right in the world. For a while there I was hoping I was wrong and it won't be predictable but it was as predictable as ever, and despite all that it was everything I expected after seeing the trailer.The movie plot was a little slow in the beginning, and then in a minute it started to speed up, and years went flying by. I even shed a tear in one moment although I knew everything was going to be okay, but that's the deal with Nicholas Sparks and his movies, you love them or hate them, and you feel everything or don't care. And I guess I'm the former.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lackluster Romantics . . . Even By Sparks' Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eleventh film to emerge from a Nicholas Sparks bestseller, "The Choice" is rather lightweight even as Sparks' movies go. Typically, a Sparks' book yields a doomed romance, and "Adult Beginners" director Ross Katz and "Demolition" scenarist Brian Sipe deliver in this respect, but the stakes are hopelessly low in this mediocre film. If you have seen the best of the Sparks' books, you will no doubt rate "The Notebook," "Nights in Rodante," "Message in a Bottle," "A Walk to Remember," and "The Best of Me" far above the lackluster "The Choice." After a romantic couple pair up and become intractably one, tragedy usually strikes and leaves the audience weeping. Kevin Costner sacrificed this life to save a seafaring couple after he found love in the arms of Robin Wright in "Message in a Bottle." Never-do-well teen Shane West reformed once he laid eyes on Mandy Moore in "A Walk to Remember," and then he discovered that she was doomed to die. Richard Gere and Diane Lane thought that they were beyond love when they discovered each other, and then Gere's doctor character went off to South America and died nobly in a landslide trying to use his medical expertise to help people who were suffering. Former high school lovers-- James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan?learn some twenty years later that each other is alive and resume their romance in "The Best of Me." Two lovers separated by a gap in social standing and economic class manage to wed and then the wife suffers from Alzheimer's Disease, and their love is doomed. Nevertheless, the husband refuses to leave his wife and romances her in a nursing home. Sappy as all get out, each of these love stories had high stakes. Nothing as catastrophic as any of these plots occurs in the fairly straightforward saga where opposites again attract and one is suddenly injured in a car accident and lies in a coma while the husband visits her everyday and refuses to abandon his love for her. Benjamin Walker and Teresa Palmer are beautiful people, but the melodrama in "The Choice" is just as fragile as a tissue from a Kleenex box. Altogether harmless and often amusingly flirtatious, "The Choice" leaves little to your imagination as Katz and Sipe chronicle the usual obstacles. The Palmer heroine breaks up with her boyfriend after she succumbs to Walker's charms. They have two charming children and then tragedy strikes. Of course, the girl survives the wreck and our lovers are reunited. "The Choice" is a pleasant movie, a date movie that raises the specter of disaster and then withdraws it in the last quarter. The least of Nicholas Sparks' romantic novels, it looks as if it were written before the others because it lacks the sophistication and drama of the best Sparks' sagas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good movie (spoiler included)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mostly liked this movie but it had some things in it that made it hard to believe. The film was filmed in Wilmington NC which I love. The whole accident scene and what came after it was not realistic.If Travis made one call to his wife saying to stay put and he's running late the accident would have never happened. I guess tragedy is just part of these types of movies. Also if someone has been on breathing tube for over 90 days they just don't recover totally like Gabi did. There is always a recovery period and Rehab.Also I wish the father's story would have been covered more as well.This film is a tear jerker and I basically liked it. I just wish hospital scenes were more realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ChoiceThe hardest part of having a loved one in a coma is knowing when to pull the plug on their cable subscription.However, the hopeful husband in this romance hasn't called DirecTV just yet.Adversaries from the get-go, Gabby (Teresa Palmer) deplores her new neighbour Travis (Benjamin Walker). But with her boyfriend (Tom Welling) overseas, she begins to see Travis in a new light after learning he's the town's vet alongside his father (Tom Wilkinson).When Gabby and Travis marry, an accident leaves her in a vegetative state, and him with the choice of terminating her life support.With its laughable dialogue, elongated exposition and ham-fisted leads, this latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation is one of the worst. In fact, the religious undertones of the ending are nothing but an idealistic cop out to this complex issue.As for the best way to rouse your comatose wife: bring your mistress 'round the hospital.

		<shortDescription>The Choice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend anyone who likes or doesn't like love stories to see this. I am not a big "love movie" type of person and i loved the movie it was amazing. The character were amazing and also extremely attractive.I give this movie 10 stars. and i would go see it again. The setting was beautiful and it didn't have a horrible ending like most movies. You can see this movie with anyone. I went to see this movie with my best friend and it was still so good. and you could see it with your boyfriend and it would be awkward at all. Nicolas sparks is one of the writer so it was bound to be a great movie. The love story wasn't the typical love story it was like more real life and thats why i loved this movie so much.</fullReview>
