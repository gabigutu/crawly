		<shortDescription>It Borrows From the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands of Stone is a rise, fall and rise again story of famed Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran (Ramirez) who leapt into notoriety in the 70's after his first controversial appearance at Madison Square Gardens. By the time of his retirement in 2002 at the age of 50, he had 199 fights under his belt with 103 wins and four titles as a light weight, welter weight, light middle weight and middle weight. The film however focuses on his relationship with legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel (De Niro) whose own exploits in the boxing world made him the first trainer to be inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame.Doing a movie of this nature, a couple of questions arise. How do you accurately and intimately make a film about the life and times of Roberto Duran who in addition to being a legend was also a legendary pre-fight s**t talker? How can one best encapsulate the real life of a man who at one point was the guiding light of an entire nation yet had enough of an ego to name all of his male heirs Roberto? Finally, how do you do make that movie great while siphoning off of cues and themes from inspirations like Rocky (1976) and Raging Bull (1980)?The answer is of course you can't; but you can make a half-way decent film out of everything. And that's basically what director Jonathan Jakubowicz and Bob and Harvey Weinstein have done. It plods its course, steadily paces itself, jab at the appropriate emotional moments and ducks from the energy-sucking minutia that episodic plot-lines tend to have in abundance. Robert De Niro is fine as Ray Arcel giving a spry, worthwhile performance in the same ballpark as Billy Sunday in Men of Honor (2000). Likewise Edgar Ramirez hits all the right notes as our beleaguered hero giving the screenplay a much better performance than it honestly deserves. Ana de Armas, Usher Raymond, Ruben Blades, Oscar Jaenada and Ellen Barkin are all very good with Reg E. Cathey giving a very small but showstopping performance as infamous boxing promoter Don King. Heck even the balance of languages (English and Spanish) is respectfully and organically done. If a great film is three great scenes and no bad ones, then Hands of Stone is 50% of the way there.Yet much like the underrated Southpaw (2015), it also has no pivotal, never forget scenes or iconic lines. The brightly colored barrios of Panama City and the glitzy sparkle of Las Vegas, not to mention the atmospherics of locker rooms inexplicably filled with smoke, don't really leave an impact. Neither do the stakes of Duran's life which, much like Billy Hope's, was and probably still is filled with conflict, inner-turmoil and a pride that manifests in nationalistic fervor. It's a shame too because if the film decided to explore that aspect of Duran's life, i.e. his relationship to Panama and its people, it could have been unique enough to recommend strongly.Yet instead, the film doubles down on the "success is ruination" themes picked up by Raging Bull, while kneading out the supposed nobility of a sport in which two grown men beat the crap out of each other. Yet while watching Hands of Stone, I kept hoping they would change up the kinetic, fast-paced editing of the fight sequences with moments that were, say a little more poetic. For those of you who know what I'm insinuating, congratulations you've seen a "great" scene from a "great" movie about boxing.The best that can be said about Hands of Stone is it does what it does predictably and well, like a cover band that's been around for years. It's energetic, it's fun to watch, it certainly has talented people who put their heart and soul into the project and it plays all the hits...yet it's not the real thing. Oh well, a tin star still shines, a discount belt still buckles and Hands of Stone is still good. Watch it if you must, otherwise watch Rocky again instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get into the ring with this elevated boxing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caracas, Venezuela, born Director/Writer/Producer Jonathan Jakubowicz (Secuestro express - 2005), along with producing wife Claudine (Epicentral Studios) leap from the Latin film arena to tell the true story of the raise/fall and raise again of showy Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran, portrayed by the outstanding Edgar Ramirez (Zero Dark Thirty). With childhood sweetheart Felicidad (Ana de Armas - War Dogs) by his side, Duran (known as "Manos de Piedra" Hands of Stone) claims the WBC welterweight title in 1980 over state-side favorite Sugar Ray Leonard (well portrayed by the at times too pretty Usher - The Voice), only to later utter the words "No mas" (no more), walking away from a rematch. Superbly guiding Duran through his life/career is training great Ray Arcel (the always terrific Robert De Niro), money man Carlos (Ruben Blades - Safe House) and childhood funny man Chaplain (Oscar Jaenada - Cantinflas). While several side stories are briefly presented, they help Jakubowicz elevate the film from just a boxing movie. Music by Angelo Mili, cinematography (Miguel Loann Litton Menz), costumes (Bina Daigeler) and set decoration by Denise Camargo and Amy Williams (especially the Disco scene) bring the film to life. Reg E. Cathey (Don King) and the younger Duran (David Arosemena) have nice smaller roles, as does one of my all time favorites Ellen Barkin (Animal Kingdom) as Ray's wife. "Get into the ring" with this elevated boxing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen better movies on boxing, but a cool portrait of Roberto Duran</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not exactly what I was expecting at first from a sports movie but in the end it turned out to have the heart I expect from a sports film.Based on the story of Roberto Duran, a poor street kid from Panama who became that country's symbol of greatest as a boxing champion. It follows his career from his glory days to how his ego caused his fall to his surprising comeback.Edger Ramirez was fantastic as Duran and Usher Raymond as Sugar Ray Lenard was perfect casting for me hands down.Also like the connection that Ramirez made with DiNiro who played Ray Arcel. It was very natural them bouncing off one another. But not the best boxing movie I every seen. Though Ramereiz and Raymond look ready for combat the ring fights could have been better.Maybe not the point for the film makers as the film documents the rise and fall of a boxing champion that closely mirrors all the other stories of how success corrupts you but if you have the heart and the mindset deep within you you can come back.Plus the film focus on how Duran's career ran parallel to the state his country was in. Overall, as a sports movie goes it did not draw me in like they usually do but the outcome was still the same as it plays with my heart to see a man come back from his very worst.http://cinemagardens.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Great But Descent Boxing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Hands of Stone", starring Edgar Ramirez-Joy, The Bourne Ultimatum; Robert De Niro-Joy, Grudge Match; Usher Raymond IV-Muppets Most Wanted, Moesha_tv; Ana De Armas-War Dogs, Knock Knock and Ruben Blades-Fear The Walking Dead_tv, Predator 2.This is a boxing movie. Not a great one but a fairly descent one. The title refers to the nickname given to boxer Roberto Duran-his hands were like stone because he punched so hard. This is the story of Roberto and how he rose to fame. He started fighting as a kid around 8 years old. He fought professionally at 16-this was in 1968. He grew up in Panama where he grew to hate America. Mainly, because of how they treated the Panamanian citizens but also because his father was an American that deserted him and his mother and went back to the States. Edgar plays Roberto. Ruben plays Edgar's trainer. Robert plays a famous boxing trainer that Ruben gets to help train Edgar-whom Edgar hates, by the way, because he is an American. Ana plays the love interest that becomes Edgar's wife and Usher plays Sugar Ray Leonard. The movie covers the 1980's fights between Edgar and Usher, including how one boxer got out of fighting shape between their fights, causing him to lose the match. As the end credits start, they tell you what happened to the people and what they are doing now-if they are still alive. It's rated "R" for language, violence and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 45 minutes. It's not a great boxing movie-it seems like I've seen a lot of this stuff in other boxing movies-but it is descent. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visit in time through boxing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hands of Stone is a pleasant surprise for those willing to regress in time to experience the heights of boxing. Way before internet, there was a time and a place when events like boxing happened, specially when Roberto Duran fought, Panama would come to a stand still. Everyone was tuned into their television for the occasion. When he won, you would hear the country erupt in glee of victory with people sounding their pots &amp; pans. The film showcases those days in an adequate manner. Yes there is the usual clichés happening, but the film's energy transcends those usual predictable story plot point to keep you engage enough to care for the characters. The time capsule through the production design and soundtrack made this film a delight to watch. There is a vast array of subliminal messages from the director, Well come to think of it, its not so subliminal as you see in the ring corners advertising to "Invest in Venezuela". Im sure this obvious product placement was a plea by the director and/or the Venezuelan team working on the film for the audience to take notice of the current situation Venezuelans are living. This strategy has been duly noted. The international cast serves the film well and brings the essence of Duran journey to life. Ruben Blades vintage soundtracks adds an unequal energy to the scenes boosting the film above your usual boxing flick. Hands of Stone is better served watching it on the big screen to truly appreciate the scope of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid I would watch boxing matches with my grandfather. I remember asking him; "Do they ever just quit?" He went on to tell me the story of a man this film is based on. Hands Of Stone chronicles the chaotic life and career of former Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran, as seen through the eyes of his trainer. While it is visually similar to most boxing movies, it's about real people who lived very real lives, that happen to revolve around boxing. At times it plays like a documentary. Taking the viewer on an emotional roller coaster ride with it. There is limited time for character development. The cuts are quick and the story moves right along, much like the rounds of a boxing match.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A history lesson disguised as a boxing movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971, Roberto Duran (Edgar Ramirez) fights at Madison Square Garden - an incredible accomplishment at a notable venue, considering Duran's humble origins. The eventual lightweight champion's story is narrated by his legendary trainer, Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro), a man who helped thousands of boxers master the sport, and who now must teach the kid strategy and discipline to become a true winner. And taking into account De Niro's own expertise with boxing movies, it's difficult not to trust everything he says about the up-and-comer. But despite star power, a respectable budget, and suitable performances, the film is an utter failure when it comes to visual style, technical execution, and storytelling.The first problem is the narrative, which alternates between the past and the present, hoping to shed some light on the traumatic events that shaped each player. But it goes too far, wasting time on Arcel's personal drama (including estrangement from a daughter) while also focusing pointlessly on the supporting characters that interact with him. This should be Duran's story, but quite routinely, it pays unnecessary attention to Arcel, promoter Carlos Eleta (Ruben Blades), wiseguy Frankie Carbo (John Turturro), childhood pal Chaflan (Oscar Jaenada), and even the primary opponent, Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher Raymond). This is especially detrimental when Duran inevitably falls from grace; it allows the audience to lose interest in - and concern for - the antihero at the heart of it all, since there are so many other characters to follow. Even Roberto's wife Felicidad (Ana de Armas) is more sympathetic and believable (she's also featured in the only amusing scene, involving pleasurable intercourse that shifts into torturous childbirth).All of the cutting back and forth in the timeline is dreadfully commonplace - as well as irritating - lending to the feeling that this biographical yarn is so familiar and clichéd that twisting up its chronology must surely confuse audiences into thinking that it's modern and fresh. This leads into the second problem: "Hands of Stone" quickly becomes a history lesson disguised as a boxing movie.The 1964 Panama Canal Zone rioting was a significant, potent piece of a longstanding territorial conflict, but it just doesn't fit seamlessly into a film about Duran's rise and fall in the ring. The idea of fighting his whole life becomes comically downplayed when he's shown to literally begin streetfighting as a preteen on the poverty-ridden streets of El Chorrillo, before receiving more formal training by a coach at a local gym. And then there's time for a love story, which follows the typical course of recklessness with wealth and eventually drunken abuse.It's not enough to be an inspirational sports drama anymore - and definitely not when it comes to boxing, which has seen a tremendous quantity of theatrical efforts in the last few years alone. Just like Duran's immoral choices when it comes to psychological warfare and his motives for controversially (and famously) stopping his rematch against Leonard (depicted here to involve unscrupulous actions by a greedy agent and a mental defeat rather than overconfident slacking), "Hands of Stone" seems to have been made for all the wrong reasons. At times it's a bit of patriotic propaganda for Panama (it regularly resembles advertising or promotion instead of entertainment); at others it's an account of a detestable athlete, incapable of handling riches and celebrity - and certainly written poorly enough that he's irredeemable as a hero (a penultimate redemption bout is portrayed to be painfully trivial). Audiences are also supposed to believe (inconceivably) that this hotheaded brute used superior intelligence to distract his nemesis, rather than merely spitting out insults in the heat of the moment.In its hastiness to chronicle the singular Panamanian star, the film also can't be bothered with acceptable editing and structuring techniques; fades, cuts, fight choreography, and transitions betray severely amateurish efforts. Sequences are included out of expectation, not creativity; training montages, the segueing of rounds, and even sex/nudity appear because the filmmakers think these moments are anticipated - or required. For viewers unaware of the 1980 "Brawl in Montreal" and the rematch that followed later in the same year, "Hands of Stone" at least presents an unexpected (though not entirely satisfying) third option to that age-old dilemma of any pugilist showdown: the protagonist can only win or lose, and both choices have been previously, repeatedly committed to celluloid.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands Of Stone and Hearts of Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roberto Duran's (Edgar Ramirez) story goes beyond his rise, fall and comeback to the ring. Its shaped by the political turmoil in Panama during the 70's and the early 80's so when he confronts Sugar Ray Leonard (Usher), his stakes are as high as to carry along his nation's pride with him. His trainer Ray Arcel (DeNiro), shapes him from a bully in search for revenge, into a Champion who's at his best after he realizes dignity is much more than just winning the belt. Many have won fights but few fighters have won the respect of their foes as did Duran and Sugar Ray back in the days. True heroes with Hands Of Stone and Hearts of Gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film! But with 1 caveat, and follows a distracting trend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love boxing films, and this one was especially good in my opinion. Pros: same epic pros of every good boxing film. Aside from that, it was more real, more grits, less shiny, when compared to Hope (2015), for example. Also, the acting of the male lead, Ramirez, was tremendous. I loved this guy. He is an extraordinary actor. Cons: one, I was so disappointed with the two extremely gratuitous sex scenes, which were outright pornographic, X rated. It does absolutely nothing to add to a film, but does much to subtract from it. As an actor, I would never do such a scene, as it brings into Cinema that which is only meant for porn. If that meant no film career, so be it. The other con is that it followed the usual trend in film nowadays .... and since I'm seeing this is the news standard in film now, I am going to acres it here.This is the trend of choosing a script intentionally written for the 3rd world, so production costs will be as low as possible. All the jobs are then given to people in another country, except for a few core people (director, producer, etc) and that one famous lead (DeNiro in this case) who is put in the film to increase sales, and then the product is sold back to America - which got none of the income from the hundreds of jobs involved in making the film. Not only is this extremely unethical and destructive to the American economy, but it also makes for a painfully disingenuous film. A story in film not made for the sake of telling the story, but instead selected and created for whatever country they filmed it in to fulfill the focus of cutting costs.The film industry has become a globalist Walmart, and the U.S. is the red-headed step child and is being leeched in the process. The Netflix is like the giant cargo ship carrying the Chinese made junk from China where we have a 4X trade deficit, the reason for our shockingly high unemployment and crashing economy. The movie theater is the Walmart store, the distribution center where money is leeched from a society which those manufacturing the product give nothing back to at all - as all the jobs involved in manufacturing the product are in China. The film itself, the product purchased, is the stuff made in a Chinese slave factory. When I go to a movie, I don't want to be overwhelmed with an unwanted confrontation with the suck of leeching globalist economics. But it's gotten so bad now that states in the US are paying production companies as much as 35% of production costs to get them to make the film in their state. It's a complete abomination. And guess what - meanwhile in the process of filming abroad for the past 20 years, all the trade secrets developed through nearly a century of blood, sweat, and tears have been given away! .... And so now even the major theater chains are full of films made by China, in China. Argentina, etc. And sold to us for 12-14 dollars a ticket. Those productions companies made their profits and had fun doing it. They don't care that they contributed to the destruction of the American economy, and the sad decline of the film industry and the profession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but unfocused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the last half an hour mark of Hands of Stone, I was thinking about my grocery list. By the last ten minutes, I was checking my watch to see how much longer it would be until I could use the restroom. As I watched this movie, I was sure of what the film was going for. It was trying to be a typical inspirational sports movie about the little guy who starts out with a big ego and nothing but the clothes on his back who becomes somebody that the kiddies can look up to. What I was unsure of was how the film chose to get there. This is the cinematic equivalent of a Pinball game. Story starts here, goes over there for a few seconds, shoots to the top for a second, falls down to the bottom in a flash, while there is little aim or consistency in the game-play.The film starts as famous boxer trainer, Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro), walks into the sepia-lit boxing ring of Madison Square Garden. He is there to observe Panamanian competitor Roberto Duran (Edgar Ramirez) at the request of his manager. Arcel is there to make Roberto a "champion" as Roberto is described as "wild" and in need of direction. He is a highly skilled boxer, but is somehow not champ material for reasons that we ironically do not see until later. Why ironically? Because the whole reason Ray Arcel is supposed to train him is to get Roberto's career on track, yet somehow causes his social-thereby professional-decline as the movie goes on. I have seen plenty of biopics where at some point the lead character falls on hard times and needs reassurance to never give up (half the time, that's why they have a lead love interest). But I have never seen a biopic where the character falls into that state because of the very reason that is supposed to make him better and inspirational to the audience. From my point of view, that makes Hands of Stone fairly pointless. Maybe even more like the plot to an episode of South Park than to a Hollywood sports movie.But back to the game of Pinball. Let me preface this little analysis by acknowledging that the screenwriter/director Jonathan Jakubowicz evidently knew a great deal about the lives of these characters out of passion for their stories. The problem was either he was attempting to put focus on too many little aspects that he in the long run he should have cut or he started with a longer, more flowing narrative and cut too much of what he should have kept in order to shorten the running time. Instead of a story propelled by the relationship of Duran and Arcel, we got maybe five scenes of the two of them during Duran's training and a hundred other scenes that did not add up to anything.Case in point, in the beginning of Duran's training with Arcel, Arcel takes the time to explain the difference between technique and strategy. As Arcel describes it, technique is the name for how you implement strategy and strategy is the overall battle plan for the fight. In a later scene, we see a little bit of what Arcel is talking about. During their first fight as a team, Duran goes to the corner of the ring to take a break and get coached like any other boxer. But right before he continues the fight, Arcel always combs back Duran's hair. Why is this? We find out later that it's to make Duran look like he "just got out of the shower"; if he looks "fresh" during a fight, it will drive the other fighter crazy every time. "Ahh strategy" Duran replies impressed.These are the kinds of scenes and moments that the film should have spent more time with. Instead, we got the obligatory love interest, an out-of-nowhere hospital scene, an unnecessary death scene, a sub-conflict with the mafia, a meeting of the long-lost father scene, and hundreds of other moments that added up to nothing substantial leaving for a confused and boring product.If I were to watch this movie again, it would be for one reason; the boxing scenes. Here is where the direction and cinematography truly shine. The pacing, the editing, and the acting are all exactly appropriate to reflect Duran's frame of mind during each individual fight. In the beginning when he is confident (bordering on conceited) of his ability, the pacing is quick yet the shots are observant. And when Duran hits his lowest professional point, the shots are longer, slower, but still carrying the same level of intensity. I would love to put this movie on again for those scenes alone, I would just keep the fast forward button nearby.For more movie reviews, check out my blog, Art Scene State at the following link http://cinemasmarts.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the question is Robert De Nero and the theme is boxing this is a ordinary movie with a very confusing story line......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert De Nero is one of my favorite actors and he is a great actor. He already won two Oscars and nominated for at least 5 times. This movie's theme is boxing and this a biography movie. So my expectation was very high and for me, it is a highly anticipated movie because Robert de Nero starring Raging bull is also a boxing- themed movie which's success is known by all. But this movie is pathetic. Total mess and very poor performance by all the lead cast. I think the biggest flaw of this movie is the script. very poorly written and may be not researched well by its contents. It is a biography movie and there are lots of opportunities to show plots and subplots with interesting incidents. You have to choose the best true incidents with transparent history, not the fantasy. But there are no such things in this movie which will be interesting or transparent. The most important thing of a sports biography movie is its twist or the turning points which are completely missing in this movie. The story writer surely missed the opportunities to show the actual suspense and the originality. This is the story of Roberto Durán Samaniego (born June 16, 1951), he is a Panamanian former professional boxer regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time his nickname is "Manos de Piedra" ("Hands of Stone"). He won many historic matches and in these matches, there are lots of thrill and suspense. At least 15 incidents in his life are happened which are turning points of his career and for his life also. I cannot spoil this and cannot reveal for the known reason. The script and the screenplay are written in a very lazy way and they missed these incidents. The direction is not up to the mark and the director completely failed to maintain the pace which is very important for a biographical drama movie. The script is poorly written and at least 5-6 times I failed to follow the subplot. Content could have been better and the theme is very confusing for realizing and several subplots created over the top impacts.Watch at your own risk and It will be good if you expect nothing from this biographical drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hands of Stoneis not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi businessis of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an "A+" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10...</fullReview>
