		<shortDescription>Fairly tense thriller with unexpected laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering this is a pretty intense movie about a desperate guy threatening to shoot and blow up people, this movie had moments of unexpected humour. The whole cinema was laughing at various points. Which was very cleverly done by director, Jodie Foster. The movie is well scripted and well acted. Clooney and Roberts clearly enjoy working together (just don't remind me of Ocean's 12). I agree with the other reviewer who said the movie should have just stopped with the return to the foosball table, and not gone for the schmaltzy hospital scene. Not the greatest movie of the year and not Oscar-worthy, but well worth the price of the movie ticket. Can't understand why it's only got a rating of 6.8 on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT!!!! Part of the appeal of this sort of a movie is to see the REAL bad guy get his comeuppance. The real bad guy was of course - Gates. Even more so than Camby and certainly not Kyle (he's just a whiny "Never been told I'm wrong" Y-Gen loser) Gates is a ring master at a freak show. The decadence of Wall Street and reality TV show meets game show of the Money Monster is atrocious. I needed the climax to be that Camby was exposed but it all got watered down and the consolation prize to our emotions was to see Kyle gunned down. It cheated me - not Kyle.The movie was OK but Clooney - I dunno. He's not an action star, not a comedian, what the hell is he? For me the most overrated actor in a generation. Speaking of overrated - Ms Roberts takes the cake. So the choice was more about box office appeal than substance.I'm sure the NYPD would have plenty to say about the way police procedures were portrayed. While I'm watching it I'm thinking 'it's just a movie. It was so 'staged'. Zero character development. Zero empathy for anyone other than maybe Kyle (a bit) and what the hell was that scene with the girlfriend?? Was it comedy relief? They would have cut her off with the first sentence. That, by the way, would have been more artistic and funnier.I'd have liked the relationship between Clooney and Roberts to have mirrored Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Whozis from "The Abyss" but that would have taken time this film didn't seem to have.Love you Jodie - maybe better next time. This was average at best and tragically, could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid and engaging thriller with a timely topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of few real time films -meaning the flow of events matches the duration of the film- that is quite successful in keeping the viewer's attention all along, and Jodie Foster is very efficient as a director presenting what seems initially a daunting technical subject (how a computer "glitch" causes an 800 Million Dollar loss to shareholders in a public traded company) as a dramatic thriller that never looses pace.The cast is excellent, Julia Roberts as the ever conscious producer calculating how each camera angle is best to follow on the unfolding live drama, George Clooney in one of his finest roles as the careless theatrical advice giver of the money program who gradually comes to realize how damaging his show is to the masses (in one particular touching scene he is in the street in NY and sees on-lookers imitating his dance moves on the show, and he becomes aware of what a buffoon he is), and finally Jack O'Connel who is very convincing as the candid investor who really wants to know how "the system" works (casting him was an inspired choice, he is not a well-known actor so he adds more credibility to the character he plays, a simple man from the street who looses all his money in Wall Street). None of the main or even secondary characters in the film are one dimensional, they have their problems (like lonely dinners for some) and concerns and values, whether it is the camera man or the public relations lady officer reporting to the big CEO, or even the main police officers in charge, all are multi-dimensional characters and their human aspects are not ignored. Even though the film deals with a serious subject, an eye opener leading one to wonder about the real money monsters out there, it remains an excellent thriller with top class actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the years I spent watching Jim Cramer and his bombastic yet highly entertaining financial advice show, Mad Money (which I think George Clooney's character, Lee Gates and his financial show in the film entitled, Money Monster is clearly a satirical stab at), I always wondered while I watched Cramer give advice on certain stocks, or even recommending some as a must buy, or a do not sell, or do not buy, I always wondered whether anyone was really out anything by listening to Cramer and his advice. Did anyone ever listen to one of his stock tips that ended up being devastatingly wrong and perhaps lost a lot of money, or maybe even more collateral than that listening to his advice on a risky stock tip? Yes, at the end of each Mad Money program, or really any financial program, there is always a disclaimer at the end of these shows telling the viewers to consult a professional financial accountant, or broker before making any rash decisions regarding your funds and investments and in a sense the shows in question tried to take no responsibility if someone ever was to lose a lot because of these programs and their hosts on the air. What if a situation like what happens in Money Monster, were to really happen? A blue collar worker invests every cent they have based on a stock that was highly recommended on said program only to have it go belly up and end up losing everything in the process. I think we can all understandably say we would be furious and looking for someone to blame after everything was gone. But who is to blame? Is it the host of the television program who is trying to entice you with a lot of bells and whistles and fancy jargon over buying a stock? Or perhaps the station and the people who put the program on the air? Are they to blame? Or does it go even deeper than that and in fact involves shady business dealings with the actual companies themselves, who may have more stake and more involved in a company's win, or loss than you might expect? Are they the ones who should handle the blame and take on the responsibility of those who are out nearly everything buying, or selling one of their stocks? These questions and more is what the new film, Money Monster tries to answer in what is a very captivating, thrilling and entertaining 98 minutes of a movie. George Clooney plays the obnoxious Lee Gates, who is the host of Money Monster and Clooney as in typical fashion, is really good at playing suave, somewhat sophisticated and arrogant characters such as Gates and here he is totally believable in the performance and does a great job. That is one of the film's really strong points which is the acting, whether it be from pros such as Clooney, or Julia Roberts to newcomer Jack O'Connell, all deliver exceptional performances and really keep the film going. This type of a film needs three main things to keep it's momentum and audience interested and that is truly capable actors who can handle the material they are given, but also who fascinate us as viewers and want us to keep watching them and see where and what happens to their characters. Also we need a script that has a plausible yet fascinating beginning, middle and final act with just the right amount of things to thrill the audience, keep us guessing and wanting to see what happens at the end and also a certain message to drive home to the viewers to leave some food for thought after you have left the theatre and to truly keep the film fresh in your mind. The direction also has to know how to keep the scenes in question lively and fast paced, but also allowing us in it's brief running time to have a certain connectedness to it's protagonists and make us believe in what is happening and also exciting and giving us reason to be angry at what is going on not only in the film, but in real life as well. The film passes all these check points and exceeds abundantly in each of these areas. Money Monster is one of the most entertaining thrill rides of the year, but it is not an empty movie. It is filled with good thoughts and questions that need to be asked and will rally any individual who has ever been questioned, or burned, or just plain angry about the things mentioned earlier in the review. The film has great and sharp dialogue and not just one dimensional characters, but very interesting characters who are great pawns in this giant chess game of a film. The film has a strong message and will leave you thinking about it's message, but will keep you riveted while doing so. One of the best times at the films so far this year and I look forward to seeing more of Foster as a director and hope Clooney and cast continue to shine in other films because they are all on the top of their game here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disagree with the Ending, but Otherwise Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster is about a financial talk show host becoming a hostage on national television. Kyle (Jack O'Connell) straps a bomb to Lee Gates's (George Clooney) chest and forces the producer Patty (Julia Roberts) to keep rolling. He wants to learn how a company could lose so much money (including his $60,000) without a better explanation than "computer glitch", and he's going to use the media's financial adviser to figure it out.Let me start by saying I do not understand economics enough to know how well this movie did in portraying that, but what I can tell you is that I thought the cast was great. The three leads were very strong and worked well together. Then again, Clooney and Roberts have done at least three other films together (The Ocean's Eleven trilogy), but this O'Connell fellow?who I don't think I've seen in anything before?was also very strong. Strong acting mixed with a strong script tends to create a strong film.The film is only 98 minutes and so it seems to be fairly fast-paced so that I was never bored. Even the supporting cast was funny with scenes like when Lee, Kyle, and the cameraman Larry are in the elevator and the camera is rolling on Kyle holding the gun and detonator with Lee wearing the bomb; and then Kyle asks Larry if he's alright. Larry's response is "I don't like elevators". It's a simple scene, but add several of those throughout and we get the bits of comedy needed to break the tension that continues to build as Lee/Kyle/Patty continue to figure out where the money went.To be honest, my largest critique is that I think they should have ended the film a bit earlier, and cut out the final scene. I'm going to try to explain what I mean without spoiling too much. The film ends with a hospital scene, which I actually think they shouldn't have done. I will not tell you who lives and who dies, but I will tell you that Kyle finds Walt Camby (Dominic West) the CEO who "lost" the money, and he does get the answer he wanted. As soon as that happens the film cuts to people in a bar who've been watching and these guys go back to playing their foosball game. Then it cuts to the hospital scene.In my opinion, as an avid moviegoer, reader, and storyteller I feel the film should have ended with the people playing foosball, because that shows how society just goes back to their lives like nothing has happened. Like they haven't just spent the day watching a celebrity with a bomb to his chest. They were all glued to the television when there was a potential crisis, but the minute the crisis is over they shrug their shoulders and wash their hands. They go back to not caring about the money, which is one of Kyle's main points. I think that would have been a stronger ending to show just how screwed up our system is and I feel it is unfortunately very realistic. Therefore, to me, the hospital scene at the end weakens that powerful message.Other than that, I found the movie to be an overall success. It was suspenseful, had good acting, a consistent script, and an interesting plot. So I guess you have to ask yourself how important is the ending to you? And more importantly, understanding the balance between learning the truth and then actually doing something about it?which I think is the key to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing and not original critique of Wall Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The causes of the global financial crisis of 2008-2010 and the mechanisms that speculators use are complicated and thus not easily packaged into a 90-minute movie. But movies such as "Margin Call", "Arbitrage", "Wall Street" and especially the documentary "Inside Job" do a much better job of explaining them than "Money Monster". Producer- actor George Clooney is known for his anti-establishment movies, and ones such as "Ides of March" are excellent. But on this occasion he and director Jodie Foster try to do too much: denunciation of Wall Street, financial markets, crooked bankers and the news media. Clooney's character is akin to that of well-known financial network program hosts, and thus not original. His banter with Robert's character is at times funny and in my view only saving grace of "Money Monster". But many parts of the plot are a stretch: lack of security at a major financial news network and police restraint. The corrupt banker's investment is in the same sector as in "Arbitrage". Globalization has many discontents. Movies and the media should be cautious about coming close to justifying violent reactions, especially as copycat behavior has been proved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but a pretty descent thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lee Gates(George Clooney) an over the top T.V. host of the show called Money Monster, in which he helps people make and save money, is suddenly having a dog day afternoon when he and his studio is taken hostage by Kyle(Jack O'Connell) cause he went broke over bad advice he took from the show. A bomb is put on Lee, with the help of his producer(Julia Roberts), we wonder if Lee will get out of this alive?George Clooney is awesome here, for the most part is being himself, but then he really gives it his all. Julia Roberts is also great, she does pretty well for someone who is stuck in one area, she plays it so real. Jack O'Connell is quite intense here, you don't know weather to like or dislike him. Jodie Fosters direction is good in spots, but the other parts it gets quite lazy, there are funny moments, but they come in at the wrong time, and Kyle has a pregnant girlfriend, thinking she is gonna become a big part of the film, nope she is introduced and is gotten rid of pretty quickly, no follow up nothing. And the way this movie ends is also very lazy, it's like the writers didn't really know how to end this.But still a pretty good thriller, like a puzzle you are trying to put together, and when those scenes happen, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Clooney and O' Connell work pretty well together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a common theme in films that Wall Street is largely corrupt. We've seen it played out countless times. Especially lately. And many of these films mesh together to become indistinguishable from each other. Money Monster may feel different. But is it maybe due to the ridiculously large ad campaign or because it says things that the others don't?The former is most likely true, but it doesn't mean this film should be tossed aside. There's a lot to like about it.George Clooney plays Lee Gates, the host of a stock market show where he advises people on what to stocks to buy and sell. In one situation, he advises everyone to buy shares of a specific company, saying it's a surefire bet. So many viewers do, but when the company's stock plummets, costing investors $800 million, everyone wants answers.Most specifically, a young man named Kyle (Jack O'Connell), who sneaks onto the show's set and threatens everyone. Flailing a gun around and strapping a bomb around Gates' chest, he goes into a rant about losing his entire $60,000 life savings on the company because of Gates' advice.Kyle and the script have a lot to say, but never quite hit the nail on the head in a grand way. It's well thought out, but doesn't play as so, instead giving us popcorn thrills and adrenaline rushes. Which, by no means, is a bad thing.Bordering on transparent and cheesy a few times, its wittiness jumps back out of it quickly--and fortunately. At a little over 90 minutes, the film is paced well. It keeps us awake on the edge of our seats pretty much the whole time, which is interesting considering almost the whole thing takes place on a television set with just a couple of people.This may have to do with the fact that the point of view is all over the place--an odd decision for a thriller. We see what the filmmakers conveniently need us to see--not always what makes sense for us to.Though not as big or impactful as it wants to be, it stands as a microcosm of the financial stresses most of the country is constantly going through. It's an important movie, but there are others that are slightly more important. Although, it doesn't hurt to watch this one and be thoroughly entertained in the process.Twizard Rating: 86</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Money Monster" (2016) is a pretty good, fast paced thriller, drama. Story is not bag at all, and acting from all involved was very solid, though no big awards will shine in here. I liked the movie, although by the end it become less and less believable. Nevertheless good directing by Jodie Foster makes this very well paced flick work.Overall, "Money Monster" isn't about finances, nor its a really thrilling thriller, but solid directing of nice script and solid acting by two superstars in a lead roles carries it and makes it a pretty nice flick overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Increasingly preposterous, but still a fairly rattling thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Lee Gates (George Clooney) is the brash, arrogant presenter of financial show the Money Monster, which offers advice on how best to invest your savings. Aided by his forthright producer Patty (Julia Roberts), he starts the day with a typically extroverted show-until an uninvited intruder named Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) hijacks the show, and demands Gates be held to account for some bad advice he offered that resulted in Budwell losing all his money. As the hostage situation intensifies, the two men find the cause of both their problems may be events happening much further down the chain.Jodie Foster steps back behind the camera for this timely tale, involving corporate greed and the fallout. Setting the themes of monetary hardship and retribution against the template of a standard real time thriller, of the type they used to make really well in the '90s, Money Monster has a fairly genuine air of suspense about it, and plays out in a manner you may not expect it to, although it's still fairly flawed as a film , and is certainly not as much in this vein as it could be.It's all going rather swimmingly, playing out in a fairly standard, connect the dots manner from one hostage situation cliché to another, almost as if it's coming from the rule book for such films, but nonetheless keeping you on the seat edge wondering how it's going to play out. Then as there seems to be some resolution, it all goes pear shaped and descends into an overblown and fairly nonsensical final showdown with CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) and his cohort Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe) that loses it some credibility.Performances wise, as the leading man, Clooney assumes the older statesman role, looking older and greyer than his heartthrob days, but gaining a little more conviction as a result. Meanwhile, as the protagonist, O'Connell manages a fairly good Queens accent and is a pleasing coy to Clooney. With a support cast of the likes of Roberts, West and Lester, you certainly have star power, and about the same script power too, until the end. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Stakes at it's finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster is set presumably in real time. Lee Gates (George Clooney) is the host of "Money Monster", a show on which Lee advises his viewers how to buy stock. A week after an alleged computer glitch that cost investors $800,000,000, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) one of those investors takes over the studio and holds Lee hostage, as he demands to know who is responsible for the "glitch." The production team headed by director Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) try to negotiate the situation with Kyle while at the same time trying to discover who is behind the scam. Money Monster keeps the stakes high all throughout. Rarely ever does it let up. Clooney is great as Lee, and O'Connell is amazing as the unpredictable and borderline psychotic Kyle. The acting is beyond excellent and the story never cuts the tension. There were times that I actually remember gasping. If you like thrillers, Money Monster should be a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast and story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to the movie expecting to be entertained, and I wasn't disappointed. Dramatic, with a little humor, a perfect combination. I loved the plot twists, and was sad that the inevitable happened. I loved the character Kyle, and I think many of the movie's audience are going to be sympathetic to him, given the state of the economy since 2008 (I know it's getting better, but it's been a slow recovery.) I loved Kyle's girl friend's response to the situation he was in, and it wasn't at all what I expected, but was filled with honesty and emotion. Julia Roberts and George Clooney were both very good. I also liked seeing all the character actors that I've enjoyed on television shows (Breaking Bad, Blue Bloods to name two) as part of the police department officers. I was a little disappointed that the character Camby didn't get more of a punishment for what he did (which of course is just like the banks and mortgage companies getting away with what they did). Showing the people who were watching the live hostage situation from all over the world was a great addition, and of course returning to the Foosball game was exactly what would happen. Very entertaining movie, fun for a weekend afternoon. I think both George Clooney and Jack O'Connell should both at least get Oscar nominations.</fullReview>

I love Clooney and Roberts, but I would have liked to see different cast in the roles. The bad guy is pretty typical bad guy, not much going on.It has a sense of urgency from the get go, which is good suspense, although I think perhaps we could have used some more backstory so I could understand the characters better.Overall it's worth a watch, but nothing groundbreaking. Cinematography starts off interesting with some longer shots, but then the shots start to remain static.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begins brilliantly, but loses steam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Money Monster" begins brilliantly. The opening scenes set in a television studio seem authentic on a very detailed level. The pace is frantic and various characters and subplots are introduced organically. The direction is assured, acting is superb and production values are excellent. The first act offers every assurance this will be a compelling drama, if not an instant classic. But then it loses momentum. The hostage/revenge plot is too boneheaded to maintain interest for long and the underlying defalcation makes no sense at all. An average Joe invests $60M in the stock of a company that loses $800MM in a single day, causing its stock to lose about 85% of its value. The guy then complains that he's lost everything he had. Granted, he took a huge beating, but he should still have stock worth about $10M, unless he purchased on margin, but we don't know. Then we learn the company has a fleet of corporate jets, at least one of which is a Lear Jet 85 with a base sticker price of $20.8MM. If the company is large enough to have perhaps $75-150MM invested in jets, one wouldn't expect even a $800MM loss to have such a devastating effect. But why is this average Joe buying equity shares? Wouldn't he ordinarily invest in some investment fund or pool managed by the company? There is another scheme to artificially depress another company's stock in order to earn billions on the defalcated $800MM. But for this to work, that company would need to lose about 75% of its market value and then rebound. The mechanics, timing and scale make no sense at all and there is no way the villain could expect to pull it off without getting caught. He would have done better trying to smuggle cocaine on his Lear. But DeLorean already tried something like that and it didn't turn out well. But maybe it doesn't need to make sense. After all the recent financial scandals, the burst of the housing bubble, Greece, Brexit, the precarious state of pension funds and the imminent bankruptcy of the Social Security trust fund, perhaps movie audiences don't need much evidence to assume some slick financial type is a villain. At one point, Clooney's Gates character tells the villain that his scheme isn't complicated. That's the problem. The plot needs a brilliant scheme that requires Gates's unique skills and efforts to unravel. Instead, it is a rather obvious plot that Roberts's Fenn unravels behind the scenes with the assistance of a character turned whistle-blower for reasons that aren't explored sufficiently to make them credible, with the assistance of a group of hackers who are able to find an obscure bit of evidence on a surveillance camera that would be zoomed in at nothing but an empty patch of ground if a couple of people hadn't decided to frame themselves perfectly while one of them incriminated himself. The police involvement seems authentic initially, but stretches credibility during a bizarre sort of chase scene and culminates in an inexplicable act of violence against an individual who has gained widespread sympathy while recorded on live television. The story would have been stronger if the average Joe had invested money that he had earned and saved, rather than life insurance proceeds ? perhaps an accumulated pension from working at a company for a long time and then being laid off due to economic circumstances. The taste of death moment seems contrived. Gates lacks a character arc. He recommended an investment that turned sour in part because an executive at the company proved to be disreputable and in part because nobody seems to know what the company actually does, other than deliver impressive profits. It turns out that the company doesn't know what they do either, as their much- touted trading algorithm was actually developed by a Korean programmer. In the final scene, Gates asks Fenn what they will do for the next program and neither one knows. His question may have been intended as humorous, as in how to top the drama of that day's events, but also reveals that he hasn't learned anything. He made a poor choice that cost the investors who relied upon his advice a lot of money. Tomorrow, he needs to make another recommendation, but he hasn't learned anything to guide him. Despite various implications that the system is rigged against the little guy, everything Gates has learned only applies to this one company. He was fooled and the public was defrauded. But nothing has happened to provide the public with better protection or to enable Gates to make better choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film that says allot about society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have wanted to see this film ever since I saw the trailer and I got my chance today and I really do think this is a great film. The premise sees a host of a financial expert show get held by gunpoint by an investor with a grudge. George clooney plays the host lee gates and does a great job in this film. He is his usual charismatic self in this film but there is also depth to him in this film as he tries to live and tries to truly find out what is going on. Julia Roberts plays the director in his ear who is trying to calm the situation down and she does a great job too because you learn allot about her character from this situation that she has been put in and her chemistry with clooney is really good especially since they don't actually share allot of screen time. Jack o connell plays kyle the antagonist in the film and he is probably the most surprising performance because he is fantastic in this film. You see the anger pouring out of him because of one bad decision he made but you feel sorry for him because he is human and everybody makes mistakes and even though he is probably doing the wrong thing you kind of understand why he is doing it. All the other supporting characters do a decent but unspectacular job in their roles. The story of the conflict between clooney and o connell really drives this film and you feel the intensity of the situation just build and build as the film grows. However, the film spends a decent amount of its time focused on events outside the tense situation and it just doesn't feel as important or thrilling especially as the characters just aren't as interesting. The script has great dramatic moments and dialogue involved in it which sells it as this intense thriller. It also has some fun humour in the film that surprisingly works for the film. The style of the main story is great with the right amount of intensity mixed with humour and character development. However, the pacing is a little off with the other plot lines where you end up not caring about a quarter of the movie. Overall this is a great film that if your a fan of thrillers you owe yourself to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A motion picture that comes with some contemplation about economics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Inroducing George Clooney as the news reader that clearly states the massive change in economics during the past decades. From saving for a gold brick to just electronic both devices and systems.Sadly, Gearoge is over acting like crazy when things is getting into place. Nice production otherwise... when Mr. Clooney tries to act scared and overwhelmed I see Mel Gibson all over again in "Ransom"; overacted and weird.To me, there is a sense that the whole production team went down on financials or that big stars turned down the minor roles in "Money Monster". There could have been excellent actors that should have been a major filling part for this motion picture. Sure, Chris Bauer is a good actor (even so in 8MM with Nicholas Cage) and there is other good actors too. Besides that, I stand my point. Take a look at the office director at Ibis when searching for Walt Camby; the expressions, the hair down to the body language... it screams Al Pacino. Look about 32 minutes into the movie; the guy smoking a water pipe looking so much David Arquette. These little actor similar faces that low budget movies use as an argument to sell movies is just... so very dull and amateur. And that placed in this film...? One word...no, four words; "why" and "come on"!I breath in and I breath out. I think about this and all that comes to mind is a just about approved movie. One scene is over-explicit; Kyle (Jack O'Connell) is shooting a TV monitor. First out, the lady looking out of the monitor is dodging...why!? Second out, the theatrical and dramatic music that comes into place to convey that this is a serious situation and we all (the viewers) should know that this is exciting. He shot a monitor, and the whole atmosphere is similar as if somebody was killed in a terrible way... strange and a little amateur wise.The movie grows a little the further we go into the story. George Clooney and Julia Roberts carries the whole thing on their shoulders. Only with them, this movie is maybe worth a view.Line of the movie. Multiple police officers and other agents is surrounding the environment. Walt Camby is being hit by Lee Gates (George Clooney). Walt Camby says: "See that!? He assaulted me!" The police officer of NYPD returns the communication in a calm way: "Call a cop."At the end; a major plot hole. From the escape, they talk about protecting the exploding vest from the snipers. Lee Gates (George Clooney) tell Walt Camby to always have the front of himself to the snipers, otherwise the snipers will shoot. Then... look at about 1 hour 25 minutes; Walt turns around even so and everybody is just handling it as written in the script. Does any sniper shoot despite very clear and green shots? No. A plot hole so big that I just crawled right through it, and I am kind of a big guy.Heard the story before, seen the story before. I am sorry George Clooney and Julia Roberts; you should have turned this down. No, I'm just going to watch this now and quit writing.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Despite some plot holes and errors here and there, an approved American production. - The actors : Jodie Foster, the director. Can I ask you something? With the experience from "The Silence Of The Lambs" and other motion pictures, where is the professional aspects and the deliverance of a great directing? Sadly, you lean too much on Mr. Clooney and Julia Roberts. Otherwise... this is approved... could with a better overall intension and production have hit the rate of 6. Jack o'Connell (yes, his name is Jack for real; everybody is named Jack) is exclaiming and gasping for air around his own ability to perform, similar to Jonathan Tucker in the film "Hostage"; watch the aggressive sides, the screams and the over acting. - Entertainment : Some entertainment. The walk from the studio to the other site is quite exciting. Otherwise... as written before; seen and heard it before. - Age : 115,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie takes us back to 1998....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And it's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just that these high concept thrillers that supposedly deal with serious issues, are nothing more than big bloated popcorn churning anomalies, that always feature a climatic ending, and them a joke between the two,stars.The only difference is that if this were made in 1998, it would've been one of the years biggest films and would still star Clooney and Roberts.Lee Gates is a Wall Street guru who picks hot stocks as host of the titular television show During a live broadcast, unfortunate investor Kyle Budwell storms onto the set and takes Gates hostage. He tells him that he lost everything, thanks to one of his tips. As Gates tries to plead with Kyle, he's using an earpiece to communicate with his producer in the control room. Together, they must figure out a way to defuse the situation and disarm the bomb that Kyle has attached to Gates.The reason why I'm referring the year 1998 is because this film really reminded me of The Negotiator, which Starred Spacey and Jackson. Now both films have a different subject matter, but the essence of the chemistry between Clooney and O'Connell and that of Spacey's and Jackson's, feels very similar.Clooney can do this smug guy with a heart in his sleep, and Roberts does nothing more than narrate what is happening via an earpiece, I'm guessing if their star power wasn't involved, I very much doubt this would've been green lighted.O'Connell is wonderful, playing unhinged within an inch of sanity, and the final third, when it switches from The Negotiator to Mad City (also from 1998), his wrath turns into panic, and it makes the film just that little but better than it should be.The ending is rather predictable, the big end of level boss gets his come up prance, and all the rich people feel for the less fortunate.....for a few seconds.Not bad, but nothing to write home about, unless it was eighteen years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster did a good job directing this movie. The actors were good even if they can act way beyond this. The plot is quite simple but still OK. If the movie wanted better than a 5 they should go deeper in the story, make it more up to date news with more realism and a boost on the acting skills. This turned out to be an OK Friday movie that shows the Stockholm Syndrome (google it!) on it's point.The movie contains a bunch of flaws but which movie doesn't? Just ride with the flow and enjoy an all American TV reality show that goes south.Looking forward to see what Jodie Foster do in the future.Get rich or die trying'/Jeff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off as a good thriller but gradually slithers into its bizarre grubbiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BREAKING DOWN MONEY MONSTER Jodie Foster's thriller is based upon big organizations stripping people off of their money, and getting away with it, until one ballsy guy decides to come up with a gun in his hand to get some real answers. The movie is continuously and narrowly saved by its contemporary feel, occasional humour and the way it boldly scales some uncharted territories which seems both stupid and plausible at times.What the Money Monster profusely lacks is the lustre of a good drama, where we fail to read the thoughts of its characters. Even though George Clooney and Julia Roberts were a fair fit for their roles, Jack O' Connell doesn't reek of an apparent tension. He misses out on portraying emotions of a guy with nowhere to go. There isn't a grave flair to his act, presence of which might have helped us to put a pin on him as a disturbed soul.Money Monster fares well in the plot enclave, where things keep escalating at every juncture. The gravity of the situation however goes for a toss when a weird role reversal happens, which was supposed to be the high point of the movie. Jodie Foster fails to properly depict why Kyle becomes all of a sudden so important to Lee. Confused? Spoilers follow below: SPOILER MONSTERS AHEAD So it all starts off really well. With Clooney in the front page, Julia Roberts in his ears, with a show that was as flashy as the theatrics people need to get lured towards the stock business. In comes Jack O'Connell as Kyle Budwell, a guy who invested everything he had by listening to Clooney's banter of why investing in IBIS, a promising budding company, was a great idea. With a bigger player pulling the company's strings, Walt Camby (Dominic West), the real culprit behind IBIS plummeting goes hiding. What follows is a guy looking for answers and a seemingly empty Lee Gates (George Clooney) forgetting all about a formidable bomb wrapped around his chest, also about the psychotic guy with a trigger to his fate, trying to help him out get one. He is willing to do anything in order to get to Camby to get some real answers instead of the word 'glitch', and that could include even standing behind the perpetrator to save him, the guy who was threatening to take his life some minutes ago.Things go down those impalpable roads from where there is no return, the moment Lee Gates starts worrying about Kyle and tries to help him instead, pulling the cameraman Lenny into the stream as well. Police-thoughts get lost in the short sojourn that Lee decides to take with Kyle. However, the intrusion of the world on the roads was very credible, and brilliantly shot.Overall things in Money Monster sieve in like a fair story, and how the world behaves to an outbreak like that, which is justly shown. Editing is on a roll. Screenplay quite average. THE FINAL VERDICT Money Monster is a good thrilling flick which does really well when it comes to entertaining. You just wish a little profundity and digestible material to have lingered there, and it would have fared even better.You can read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money Monster is a thriller in which an investor takes over the studio of a show called Money Monster hosted by Lee Gates.He forces Gates to wear a suicide vest.Him and Patty must work against the clock to uncover a conspiracy and get Kyle his answers.Well,this movie is good,it is gripping and Clooney and Roberts' presence go a long way towards making this thriller compelling.The story is actually quite well-written and is well thought out,the ending seemed perfect and I didn't see any other alternative anyway.This was the perfect time to make such a film,given the current controversies involving Wall Street and the stock market.On the downside,the attack on Wall Street is not as strong as they probably intended.The villains motivation is quite implausible and childish,even though he lost his money,why blame Gates? Even though he gave a tip for the investment,he isn't the one to blame,is he? But this movie overcomes it's flaws to become a gripping thriller and will play a big part in Jodie Foster's career as a director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster directs her fourth major feature, an interesting thriller about a man who hi-jacks a money trading show after losing his small fortune following the advice of George Clooney's Lee Gates AKA Money Monster. But there's a lot more to this movie than a Broadcast takeover and carries an intriguing point that many of us choose to ignore. The real subject matter being about fraudulent corporations who work unnoticed changing the face of the financial world whilst the rest of us work on. It's a topic I feel strongly about and this film has a special meaning to myself. (Don't worry, I'm not gonna hold up a gocompare.com commercial, though I could probably shoot the moustached freak.)Jack O'Connell doesn't seem to stop impressing me, first with Starred Up (2013) then in both Unbroken and '71 in 2014. The man is sheer talent. Can you imagine what it must be like for him to star up against George Clooney and Julia Roberts under the direction of Jodie Foster? He so deserves every part of it. O'Connell plays Kyle, the chap who loses his money along with his mind and goes the great distance of taking over the show. George Clooney is the fast-talking, larger-than-life TV host who does some pretty outrageous scenes. At one stage, I was thinking the film was an elaborate wind-up to get Clooney to do these silly things. He's known for being a big prankster both on and off set. The siege quickly becomes one of those 'where were you watching when..." kind of moment when the whole world tunes in to watch, people are suckers for reality TV. We the audience get to place our bets as the tables turn and the conspiracy unfolds. Roberts is simply amazing as the calm and controlled director, frantically ordering her team, troubleshooting at every turn. You can't help but love her demanding, confident character as the middle-person who's striving to keep the balance between psycho-gunman, egotistical TV host, and the police wanting to intervene and shoot someone, anyone; whilst trying to unravel the truth AND all live on worldwide TV. We don't see much of Dominic West on the big screen but when we do, he's plays that turn- coat, slimy, smug bastard so well. I think of his Theron in Zack Snyder's 300. Also noticed the stunning Caitriona Balfe, will be looking out for her in the future. Watching the relationship between Kyle and Gates is entertaining, seeing both having internal struggles about who they really are and finding their place in the world as they both collide and eventual form a coalition to seek truth and not money. It's superbly edited and doesn't lose paced but falls a little flat at the end, even though slightly unpredictable it becomes quite anticlimactic with the rest world quickly going back to their normal everyday life. Which is probably a realistic and sad reaction. I also feel the script could have been better, given the cast capabilities, even though it was a blacklist script of 2014, maybe that was why. Lenny the cameraman periodically muttering "balls" was probably my favourite clever bits. Dominic Lewis does a prefect score, reminding me a little of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' work or something I would expect from Harry Gregson-Williams. It's great at setting the tension and empowering the scenes. It's like an action version of The Big Short. This is what happens when someone snaps after their money has been stolen by a corporate banker. *coughs* not saying it's unbelievable, it could happen yes? However I don't think the police would respond like they do, who knows? I'm sure there's a mention of Terry Benedict in there too!

		<shortDescription>Money Monster Well Worth The Money - Only 6.8 on IMDb ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this expecting a predictable and therefore mediocre film. Directed by Jodie Foster, it really shows her directing skills. Yes it is, in many ways, predictable. A story of the rich get richer and the poor peasants get shafted. A story of the big company CEO who lies and cheats, costs 'ordinary' people millions in the value of shares. What makes this film stand out is how it gets there. A number of times just as you think you know what happens next, it surprises you! Clooney is the tacky host of 'Money Monster' TV show, where he advises in brash style, live on TV, which shares in which companies, to buy or sell. Making it crass entertainment for the masses. Kyle is one of the ordinary people, a not particularly bright van driver, with a pregnant young wife. His mother recently died leaving Kyle an inheritance of $60,000. He takes the TV 'advice' he buys shares in the company IBIS 'safer than a savings account' (as recommended by Clooney). When a computer 'glitch' wipes $800 million of the value of IBIS shares overnight, Kyle has lost everything, no explanation other than a 'glitch'. Clooney is due to interview Walt Camby (chairman of IBIS) live on air on Money Monster. Kyle turns up at the studio with a gun and bomb vests intending to strap them to Clooney and Camby and demand answers. However, Camby cancelled at the last minute so he straps a bomb vest to Clooney and holds him hostage demanding explanations live on TV What unfolds 'live' on TV is what makes this film. Yes the overall story is predictable. The rich CEO lied and cheated which cost Kyle and thousands of other ordinary people so much. Whilst the likes of Clooney just make it all tacky entertainment. However, how it gets there is not predictable. It really shows Jodie Foster and the script writers flair. Clooney offers to reimburse kyle's $60k out of his pocket. Kyle refuses. Clooney tries to 'entertain' his way out by getting the share prices back up. Live on air he asks the public 'whats a life worth' to buy the IBIS shares which in turn will get Kyle his money back. The shares start to rise and then slump back even lower. Amidst the human tragedy there is a surprising number of laughs in this film.As the story unearths Julia Roberts (clooneys directory) begins to use the studio resources to probe and find answers The end is predictable but this film tells a story so well that you are absorbed to the finish. I'm loosing confidence in IMDb, this film I would say is a worthy 8/10 yet it has only 6.8 ?? Yet so many distincly mediocre films of late have glowing 8+/10 ??? I thoroughly recommend this film as well worth a watch and certainly deserves much higher than 6.8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above-Average But Superficial Hostage Yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The George Clooney &amp; Julia Roberts hostage yarn "Money Monster" turns up the heat on Wall Street, but its uneven shifts between comedy and drama make it difficult to take seriously. Mind you, any movie that skewers the financial services industry is welcome because these opaque institutions need more transparency than they have offered for their enigmatic machinations. One day, perhaps, we may know what the money brokers are actually doing with our hard earned dollars. Meantime, Wall Street has always struck me as a crap shoot. Either you run huge risks to reap huge rewards or your audacity pays off in dirt rather than pay dirt. "Home for the Holidays" director Jodie Foster and scenarists Jamie Lindon of "Dear John," Alan DiFiore of TV's "Grimm," and Jim Kouf of "National Treasure" make this problem a glaring point in "Money Monster." Unfortunately, most of us already know this because we've watched either Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" (1987) or his belated sequel "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps" (201o). As for the claustrophobic hostage crisis that unfolds for three-fourths of "Money Monster" in the studio of a financial news network before the plot propels the characters out into actual New York City streets, you've seen it covered in more compelling movies like Sidney Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" (1975) or Spike Lee's "Inside Man" (2006). Superficial, uneven, but above-average, two-time Oscar-winning actress Jodie Foster's fourth film as a director suffers primarily because the male characters are anemic. For a change, the guys qualify as airheads, while the gals are pretty astute. George Clooney, Jack O'Connell, Giancarlo Esposito, and Dominic West amount to nothing less than nitwits. None of the guys have an inkling about anything, but the women know what to do. At fade-out, the dames rise above the dudes. Neither the Wall Street skullduggery nor the logistics of outsmarting an unstable, naive gunman furnish any surprises. Indeed, the hostage drama is more compelling than the lackluster Wall Street mystery that triggers the gunman into action. If you missed the Oscar-nominated movie "The Big Short," it details real-life Wall Street chicanery, but it is a far more complicated film to follow. Nevertheless, despite its toothless nature, "Money Monster" emerges as a suspenseful saga, until certain revelations undercut the tension in the third act.Lee Gates (George Clooney of "Gravity") is a cynical Financial News Network commentator, reminiscent of CNBC's "Mad Money" pundit Jim Cramer, and he cavorts about his studio like a carnival barker. Meanwhile, Lee's veteran producer &amp; director, Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts of "Erin Brockovich"), orchestrates the colorful graphics that enliven his on-camera antics as he dispenses stock tips for investors. Basically, Lee relies on his savvy insights to make educated guesses about monetary matters. Sadly, Lee's expertise about all things Wall Street backfires on him. Before he realizes what has happened, Lee finds himself eye-to-eye with a pugnacious goon poking a pistol in his face. This intruder, who slipped stealthily past distracted security guards and invaded the FNN studio while the show was 'live' on-the-air, demands to know why Lee gave him such appalling information. Just about everybody in this 98 minute, R-rated thriller gets caught off guard at one point or another. A discontented, blue-collar, delivery man from Queens, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell of "Unbroken"), knows zilch about the financial industry except what Lee Gates predicts. He prompts Lee at gunpoint to don a vest packed with enough explosives to flatten a city block. Kyle brandishes the detonator in his other fist and warns everything about the consequences if he loses his grip. The only individual in the studio with a clue about what to do is Patty. She produces and directs Lee's stock tips show. She gives Lee his cues and instructs the crew where they must be whether they are operating cameras or loading graphics. Patty galvanizes not only Lee, but also her crew into action to contend with Kyle as the N.Y.P.D. swarms into the studio with their sniper response unit. Eventually, Patty convinces Lee that he should play along with Kyle. Lee sheds his anxiety and struggles to mollify Kyle. Poor Kyle, it seems, squandered his late mother's entire nest egg?some $60-thousand?and invested it in Ibis Clear Capital stock. Lee had hyped Ibis with such enthusiasm that Kyle sank every penny into it. According to Ibis, a computer glitch occurred, and the company lost $800 million, cleaning Kyle out. Kyle throws a temper tantrum and threatens to shoot anybody and then possibly blow Lee to smithereens while Lee and Patty scramble to unravel the secret behind Ibis' meltdown. Unfortunately, nothing that Lee does satisfies Kyle. At the same time, the rest of the world has tuned into Lee's show and is savoring the 'live' showdown.If Kyle weren't enough of a nuisance for Lee and Patty, the N.Y.P.D. poses another problem that generates white-knuckled suspense. When the police aren't quietly evacuating the FNN staff, they are sneaking into position to end the confrontation with their snipers. As it turns out, beleaguered Captain Powell (Giancarlo Esposito of "The Scorch Trials") is stunned when his men want to shoot at the bomb vest that Lee is wearing rather than at Kyle! The snipers assure Powell that they have an 80 percent chance of success at blasting the detonator off the bomb. Eventually, word reaches Lee, and he wields Kyle as a shield. Powell rejects their strategy as outrageous. Meantime, the globe-trotting, duplicitous, Ibis CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West of "300") makes the foolish mistake of flying into New York to present his side of the story. During this chaos, the N.Y.D.P. coaxes Kyle's wife Molly (Emily Meade of "Trepass") on-camera in the hope that she will persuade Kyle to put down his pistol. Instead, an irate Molly berates Kyle without mercy for being asinine. Altogether, while "Money Monster" provides nothing new about Wall Street's treachery, but Foster compensates with taut suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat. .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money Monster (spoiler free)**** (4 out of 5) Director: Jodie FosterCast: George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell with Dominic West and Caitriona Balfe.Plot: Financial TV host Lee Gates (Clooney) and his producer Patty (Roberts) are put in an extreme situation when an irate investor (O'Connell) takes over their studio.Financial thrillers are becoming ever so popular and this is just another addition to the ever expanding genre though this is a very different financial thriller because it adds intense action into the mix.Money Monster is the name of the TV show in which Lee Gates (Clooney) hosts along with his director Patty (Roberts), this TV show is basically used as a daily insight into the financial market. This film is very informative and is very gripping even when furious investor Kyle Budwell (O'Connell) comes in.This is possibly the best film by director Jodie Foster mainly because it's a very intellectual thriller, it has a mix of intense action and incisive intellect last seen in Sicario (2015, not connected). Here are some points on this is a must financial film: Intellectual plot: This film has a very intellectual plot which won't be understood by everyone there is a lot of thinking that has to be done. Just because it has an intellectual plot it doesn't mean it's boring it mainly shows the financial market and how much of colossal mess it really is and that's basically the entire well just about.Intense Thrills: This film will keep you on the edge of you seat with the amount of thrills it has, especially the main thrill involving IBIS CEO Walt Camby (West) who tries convince to Gates that he is the good guy. It's very suspenseful and literally a monster of a film. The thrills will literally blow your mind.Performances: All the performances showed in the film are out of this world in my personal opinion they are the best performances from both Clooney and Roberts. The main standout performance though comes from BAFTA Rising Star winner Jack O'Connell* his performance as Kyle Budwell, is very explosive with his epic performance that literally takes over the show.The bad point about this film is George Clooney's dancing that is very off putting, but other than that an interesting take on the financial genre and definitely not one to be missed.Hope that Jodie Foster directs another feature because this is just one film that shows that she knows exactly what she is doing. The director is basically the head of the film in a sense, and she leads Clooney, Roberts and O'Connell just perfectly a tremendous achievement.Verdict: Captivating, thrilling and and the most intense financial thriller ever made. 8/10 excellent.*2015 BAFTA Awards EE Rising Star Award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money Monster is an undeniably taut and thrilling film, moving along at a sharp pace that keeps audiences engaged enough to glance over the issues with theme and the message of the film. The three key players are all strong additions and their chemistry and communication helps audience's care for them (more than the first 15 minutes would have you believe, at least). Jodie Foster has crafted an intense film that looks at politics and economics in a far more interesting and fun way than it is usually handled (and in a FAR superior way to previous Wall Street-based film, The Big Short). You can't help but will the film to take more risks and step outside of conventions and formulas, but it is interesting enough to glance over these issues.FULL REVIEW: http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/money-monster-2016- review.html?m=1 - let me know what you thought of the film and be sure to share my review! &#x1f60a;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A failure of a man working a dead-end job that pays $14/hr looses all of his money on a stock tip given by a cheesy TV show and decides the smartest thing to do is to buy a gun and shoot people. The director expects you to sympathize with this terrorist. Do you? If yes -&gt; go and see this movie. If no -&gt; go and see something else.George Clooney is good. Julia Roberts is also good. The story line is somewhere between absurd trying to be funny and anarchist trying to incite a riot. The best performance is given by the actress Emily Meade, it might be worth seeing this movie just because the character she plays is so good. The script is not well written, there are very few memorable lines. The camera and lighting feels more like a TV show than a movie. The costumes are standard and the extras are mildly funny.Overall, if you are a failure in life and fantasize about shooting people more successful than you because they are smarter and worked harder, then you will certainly love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a common theme in films that Wall Street is largely corrupt. We've seen it played out countless times. Especially lately. And many of these films mesh together to become indistinguishable from each other. Money Monster may feel different. But is it maybe due to the ridiculously large ad campaign or because it says things that the others don't?The former is most likely true, but it doesn't mean this film should be tossed aside. There's a lot to like about it.George Clooney plays Lee Gates, the host of a stock market show where he advises people on what to stocks to buy and sell. In one situation, he advises everyone to buy shares of a specific company, saying it's a surefire bet. So many viewers do, but when the company's stock plummets, costing investors $800 million, everyone wants answers.Most specifically, a young man named Kyle (Jack O'Connell), who sneaks onto the show's set and threatens everyone. Flailing a gun around and strapping a bomb around Gates' chest, he goes into a rant about losing his entire $60,000 life savings on the company because of Gates' advice.Kyle and the script have a lot to say, but never quite hit the nail on the head in a grand way. It's well thought out, but doesn't play as so, instead giving us popcorn thrills and adrenaline rushes. Which, by no means, is a bad thing.Bordering on transparent and cheesy a few times, its wittiness jumps back out of it quickly--and fortunately. At a little over 90 minutes, the film is paced well. It keeps us awake on the edge of our seats pretty much the whole time, which is interesting considering almost the whole thing takes place on a television set with just a couple of people.This may have to do with the fact that the point of view is all over the place--an odd decision for a thriller. We see what the filmmakers conveniently need us to see--not always what makes sense for us to.Though not as big or impactful as it wants to be, it stands as a microcosm of the financial stresses most of the country is constantly going through. It's an important movie, but there are others that are slightly more important. Although, it doesn't hurt to watch this one and be thoroughly entertained in the process.Twizard Rating: 86</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money Monster features George Clooney as one those loud obnoxious Finance TV hosts. It also features Julia Roberts as the shows director. However, when an angry investor played by Jack O'Connell, breaks into the studio and holds George Clooney hostage till he gets some answers, George Clooney has to do anything he can to stay alive. I originally went into this movie with relatively low expectations. I thought the plot was going to be predictable and boring, but overall, I found it to be very entertaining. The Good: The performances. You can always expect a good performance from George Clooney And you can honestly say the same thing about Julia Roberts. That being said this is the 3rd movie that features Jack O'Connell in a leading role and let me just say that he is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. At this point, I think he can do no wrong. The next thing I liked were the clichés in the movie. This movie reminded me a lot of John Q in that it is a normal person standing up for something he knows is right, even though the means might not have been the best. That being said, even though many of the hostage clichés that you get in movies like John Q, the Negotiator, and The Inside Man, are still here? the result of the clichés took a completely different turn. So although I thought they were going to be cliché, they actually turned out to be completely unique. Money Monster was also surprisingly funny. Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't call it a comedy by any stretch of the imagination because there were moments that were roll-you-eyes obnoxious, most of which came from the TV shows production, but there were definitely moments where I found myself laughing out loud. The Ehh: As I said already I liked how the movie would start a plot point with a cliché and then completely turn it on it's head. I only wish the same thing could be said about the ending. I figured out roughly how the movie was going to end by about 5 minutes into the movie. It was pretty obvious where they were going, but it was still refreshing how they ended up getting there. The Bad: The dang TV show that George Clooney's character hosted. I can't stand shows like Mad Money, and Money Monster is an extreme version of that. Luckily the main story line started pretty quickly so I didn't have to see too much of it. Recommendation: Even though Money Monster is your typical hostage thriller with a predictable ending, the great acting and surprising twists keep you guessing and at the edge of your seat. For those reasons I recommend that this movie should be seen in theaters. Visit Unpopped Review for more movie review from a movie lover, not a movie critic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie that George Clooney was ever part of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about Wall Street. The ostentatious hedge fund guys wearing 1000$ suits, traveling in their G-5s and at the same time fooling the public and robbing their money by employing "High Frequency Trading".The premise of this story is entirely laughable. There is a "Black Swan" event in the financial markets. People lose a lot of their money and one disgruntled nincompoop, amateur investor goes bonkers and takes financial studio hostage. Stitching together complicated terms such as High Frequency Trading, Dark pools, mathematical anomalies etc. this film gives an entirely inaccurate view of how money is lost in the stock markets, I'm no expert myself but this isn't how that works. The story line is just full of holes, plain banal and just regurgitates popular sentiment about how Wall Street or hedge funds dupe money out of investors.The acting is sadly isn't that great. Would've expected more out of Clooney and Roberts. On top of it the story line doesn't help their case as well. I actually am writing this review with the movie playing in the background. I just want to get it over with, my earphones are on and am simultaneously writing this scathing review. The only thing worth watching in this movie is - Caitriona Balfe. Real pretty and easy on the eyes. Nothing much apart from her.I highly recommend that you don't watch this bullshit and save yourself the trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To be honest, this is the first time Mr. George Clooney disappoints me so badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney's performance drops down to a historical low level, perhaps because he has got too many scandals recently due to his hypocritical behaviors and other distractions?I really was questioning if the people responsible for the film had any knowledge of police procedures. ARABS BOUGHT GEORGE CLOONEY AS CHATTEL.A family of HAMAS financing Islamist Arabs bought passive-aggressive box office liability George Clooney... And he cannot stand them. Has never even slept with ugly Amal. Mr. Clooney, if you don't have the commitment to produce a full featured movie, then release it to TV where it belongs.Some other "glitch": Also, Clooney said he wanted to "triple" the stock to make the hostage taker whole but really that would have only gotten the stock back into the $20's, far from where he he bought the stock at $75K. The lack of attention to detail drove this viewer crazy!I hope he can come back to the right track again someday, until that day's coming I wouldn't recommend anybody to watch his movies any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney's pursuit of his political agenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is clearly Clooney's pursuit of his democratic and left political agenda. It clearly states that Muslims or Chinese are not the problem but the west with their rigged system. Even with some plot-holes, in general the acting and direction was OK. The attack on wall street was not very effective. The motivation and execution of the hostage strategy was childish, ambiguous and weak. Why should Gates get the blame? it doesn't make sense. There are other character contradictions as well. but i have issue with the underlying message and the timing of the release of this movie. This is released just before the US elections to support the democratic cause. Clooney is getting more political with every passing day. This was helped by his partner as well. He is a great actor and would get more respect if he stays so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I simply cannot believe the positive reviews on this movie. It was in a word....terrible. The theme was important-that the (financial) system is "rigged" and perhaps that was what attracted a big name like George Clooney to it. I think the only redeeming quality of the movie was George Clooneys acting, which he seems to do so effortlessly.But the execution of this movie was laughable. There are simply too many ridiculous and non believable actions by humans in this movie to list here, and I've forgotten more ridiculous things than I have remembered. But, it ruined the movie.First, the obvious one that has been mentioned before. There is simply NO WAY a producer would decide to keep a hostage taker live on the air like the way she did. The hostage taker was obviously an idiot with no understanding of the technicalities of a TV show production, and would have not known whether he was live on the air or not. The movie lost most of its credibility within a very short time after it began because of this.A few things other things that I do remember were especially comical. The movie seemed to be written by someone who has ZERO understanding of the financial markets/investment industry. That would be OK, except that the whole movie was focused on this industry. The fact that the writers/director didn't care to do their homework is representative of the laziness and lack of detail that you see over and over again in this film. For instance, the term "algo" was used countless times with seemingly no understanding of what an algo does or its potential ability to move a stock price for an extended period of time (and none of the people who were supposedly in the investment industry seemed to know in the movie either). So many math problems too! The hostage taker in the movie supposedly bought the stock of IBIS Pharma at $75/share (mentioned by Clooney), and the companys stock price during the hostage taking (after an "algo attack") dropped it $8/share where is was during the film. Clooney mentioned that the hostage taker lost 60% on the stock, but this would have been an almost 90% drop. The hostage taker said he "lost $60K" with the stock drop, and at a later time the detectives learned that the hostage taker had gotten $60K exactly from his mother which he put all in this stock. Well, he would have then lost 60% or 90% of the $60K right? And he only would have lost that money if he had actually sold the stock, but based on what happened in the movie (when Clooney was trying to get the public to buy the stock to make him whole again) he was still holding the stock. Also, Clooney said he wanted to "triple" the stock to make the hostage taker whole but really that would have only gotten the stock back into the $20's, far from where he he bought the stock at $75K. The lack of attention to detail drove this viewer crazy!There was a mention in the movie that the company in the middle of the whole controversy "had all of its pensions depleted", as if the stock price of this specific company had any affect on the value of its pensions (which would be diversified in any corporation into bonds/stocks, etc, NOT invested solely in its own company stock!). Furthermore it seemed to be the case that IBIS's OWN algo was responsible was its stock price dipping 90%, as if IBIS would be in the business of controlling its own stock with an algo, which is highly illegal (and impossible for an extended period of time). No one in the industry seemed to think this was an usual thing. Later in the movie there was some Asian genius that appeared for a minute that seemed to know all about the algo, and made some seemingly profound statement like "its just math" and said there was no way an algo could be completely responsible for dropping a stock price 90% for an extended period of time. He said this as if 100% of the people in the investment industry would not have known this already.You also had a hostage taker walking the streets of NY with a gun and a bomb and a hostage, and the NYPD seemed to think it was OK to allow pedestrians withing spitting distance from the man, and when the man opened fire on the crowd, the police said "dont shoot" (at the hostage taker)? Are you kidding me?It was an F.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is SO VERY familiar , so many similar stories have been done before, often as a success, this is far from that.SO not one to remember fondly. Other than being so slow and ultimately very predictable, acting from most of the lead actors overall is at best okay, some scenes were actually unintentionally silly, But the support actors especially the studio crews, the cameramen etc. were all totally so unbelievable, so limp. The police pathetic SO this meant no surprises, no wow, no make us think , no interesting scenes , even if good at start of scene, was to often leaving me with a feeling of emptiness, did I fall asleep, blink to long ,as no punchlines , no drama, no fear, a waste of a good moment, a waste of a good point etc. , no drama, no emotion , no anything. What may of seemed a good idea to someone, shows how even a group of people so experienced and more than qualified took the money and went on holiday, not for a rest, as they all did that , very well already. This seems like a low budget 70s T.V movie. waste of money and actors time..AND MINE. Director must of been on holiday while filming as got nothing out of story or actors, so nothing to give us the fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney &amp; Roberts Really Gel Here...An Excellent Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crime is attracted to money. This seems to be unarguably correct. Wherever the money masses, therefore, it follows the two will be in close proximity. What comes to mind first is, for most folks, Wall Street. Wall Street is a huge umbrella which, of course, includes the major financial institutions we commonly call "banks". Since both Wall Street and "the banks" are so crucial they have to be regulated. This brings in our own sense of protecting our rights we refer to as "government". These parties are suppose to work together to protect every citizen of the United States as well as any investor. What if its all so broken as it favors a few who have the knowledge and power to compromise the entire system in their favor? Well, that would be a pretty good story for a movie?.would it not?Money Monster is such a timely movie that cashes in on many financial events of the last decade. It comes at a time when disillusionment in the backbone of the economy, Wall Street, and the institution to oversee it, our government, are seen as being co-conspirators in massive failures, cover-ups, and bail-outs that defy the trust of investors and citizens alike. I'd say in this regard, outside of the entertainment factor of the movie, it strikes a real sore-spot in the whole of our society's trust in exactly what constitutes our entire system of commerce and banking. That, actually, makes this movie more than entertainment, it's an indictment.Money Monster is a solid movie. It moves fast and doesn't allow boredom. It feeds into a paranoia which, sadly, the average American can relate to. It creates a lot of tension as two very dis-similar worlds, the dreamers/have-nots and the insiders/the privileged, suddenly collide in a real-time standoff. George Clooney hits a sweet spot in his ability to create a character in the host of gonzo stock adviser whose shoe Money Monster is loosely based around Jim Cramer's Mad Money concept. It shows the danger as a desperate individual puts too much credibility in a person whose job is actually split between being an entertainer and stock market guru. Clooney pulls this off with aplomb. The story gets a real shot in the arm from his director played with intensity, yet some restraint, by Julia Roberts. The luckless investor turned terrorist is spot-on these people are often totally under the radar and average until being set off.Is Money Monster so good as to not mis-step? Is it meant to be patterned after something real. The answer is no on both I must say. Many things here probably wouldn't and haven't actually happened and there is plenty of artistic license as well as few clunker turns (and dialogue) that would likely never play out as in this movie. It does, however, include a very real current paranoia joined to some things with enough degree of possibly to dance around the smell test. In this it, in spite of most likely not trying to, it makes a bold statement. The institutions that were suppose to be by and for the public are, sadly, best left to the privileged few. That's a pretty powerful take-away from something served up as entertainment. The index probably went down a point, or so, the day this was released. Hum, humble entertainment just became a mirror of something much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Not such a money monster'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster tells the story of Lee Gates (George Clooney); the charismatic host of the financial TV show; Money Monster. After Gates tells his viewers to invest in IBIS Clear Capital, the company experiences a 'glitch' in its logarithm and its stocks plummet; costing shareholders $800 million. But not everyone is satisfied with this explanation. Holding Gates responsible, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) sneaks onto the live show's set and holds Gates hostage; armed with a gun and a bomb vest strapped to Lee. He invested his entire life savings in IBIS and he wants an explanation for his loss. All broadcasted to the world on Live TV, Lee and his director Patty (Julia Roberts) must get to the bottom of the financial crisis before the gunman completes the unthinkable. Espionage, danger, and corruption ensues as everyone does their best to deal with this delicate situation before it's too late...I know some of you will be turned off watching this movie due to the financial jargon, and while it would be beneficial to have knowledge of such jargon before you watch this movie, it isn't compulsory to still gain some enjoyment from this film. It beautifully captures the outrage of a stock market collapse combined with the delicacy and tactics of a hostage situation. However, I feel as though Clooney's natural charisma and lighthearted disposition takes away from this delicate situation a little, appearing somewhat too calm under pressure and therefore lowered the stakes. There's also a reveal about 2 thirds into the movie that decreases tension as well, but from the exterior stays the same. What works best for a movie like this is the tense ambiance that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, and sometimes it went astray from this central ideal. That was where the plot lost me. But when it does have those tense sequences, boy do they do it well... There were also some moments when the plot moved a little slow. This could've been fixed.The main cast was few but quality; George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell, Caitriona Balfe, Dominic West, and Giancarlo Esposito were among those involved. Julia Roberts was PERFECTION. By far the stand-out in this one. She had the perfect manner for someone who would have been dealing with a situation like this in a role like hers if it were to happen in 'real life'. Fantastic. The others all performed, I think, to their expected standards. Clooney, to his credit, expanded his repertoire for this role, but you can definitely see the normal Clooney shining through. I appreciate the effort by Director Foster to blend together differing genres of Comedy and Drama/ mystery. But unfortunately, unlike the unusual blend of Comedy and Horror in The Visit, it didn't work in this form. It degraded the dramatic appeal of the film which was stellar at times.The script, soundtrack, and cinematography were all very good and contributed to that tense and dramatic ambiance that audiences feed off of. With some luck there will be some award nominations- it certainly deserves a few. To improve, less focus on trying to maintain a lighthearted ambiance within a very serious situation, and try to invent more fresh plot twists to invigorate the drama and keep the plot moving quickly. The movie's underlying purpose I feel was to send a message about financial decisions to the target audiences while blending it into an engaging storyline. This was successful, I walked away from this movie knowing that corruption is everywhere and that I should spend my money wisely.To finish, I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had some fantastic elements and strengths, but the biggest thing for me as I've already stated that brings down this movie is the attempt to forcefully blend wildly contrasting genres and their moods into this film. Some characters were nonchalant while others were deadly serious. This movie needed to focus all its energy on its strength; dramatic tension.See more reviews like this at chrisbreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some nice and funny thoughts/observations on human behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a middle-aged show host gets taken hostage while broadcasting live by a young man, things start going the wrong way. It's a mess. But, in that mess, people's masks and inhibitions get out of the way, thus we get several nice and/or funny thoughts and observations on human behavior and relations(hips).That's kind of the theme of the movie. To point out some things, most of them are kind of silly and speak of the "not so nice" in people. While, if you're old enough, you probably saw all of that yourself, maybe you just didn't look at it the same way. Like how do age, marriage duration and divorce costs relate to each other? Clooney has a funny, but, sadly, oh-so-true observation. Or why don't people talk about important things, yet spend a lot of time talking rumors? The host (Clooney) and his director (Roberts) care for each other, but, have grown tired and she's leaving to another network, he knows it ("people talk"), but they don't talk about it themselves - until the mess they fall into forces them.The story, acting, directing, all have issues, it's far from a perfect movie. For example, the whole sub-plot of the female PR executive seems to serve no purpose but to show a "good and strong woman getting out of toxic relationship with a bad and powerful man and making him pay", which goes with the trend of overt feminism in the movies. It's content is highly unrealistic, while the rest of the movie is just a little unrealistic. It doesn't provide any "nuggets of wisdom", while the rest of the movie is quite full of them. It's rather badly written, acted and directed, while the rest of the movie is mostly OK in those regards. It feels forced, while the rest of the movie moves a long smoothly, at least until the final act.Probably the biggest problem the movie has is in making a meaningful final act, like most modern movies, but, it does that job better than most of them. The final scene with Clooney and Roberts helps a lot there.All things considered, if you look at the whole thing as a "frame" to put those "nuggets of wisdom" into, it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster stars George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Jack O'Connell, and its a story about a show (Money Monster) and its main host is Lee Gates. He talks about stocks and money, but one day an irate takes the whole crew hostage on the air. So they need to figure out a way to escape this situation. The performances in the movie are great, but especially Jack O'Connell, he is fantastic. I really cared for that character because i did understand him, and his motivations were clear. He is also a broken man with no money left for him. I also liked the originality and the uniqueness of the movie as it is really original and refreshing to see since we are having sequels after prequels after reboots, etc. The biggest problem i had with this film is when we step outside of the set of Money Monster, and we learn about the stock market and many things like that. That basically derailed the movie for me because i really don't care about the stock market. A film that really did make me care about the stock market was The Wolf of Wall Street, and that film was fantastic because it did base its story on the stock market but was directed in a way in which you are always entertained. This film was sometimes entertaining but only when Jack O'Connell and George Clooney were in the same room. The film was funny when it needs to be funny and the film is dramatic when it needs to be. 7.5/10</fullReview>

Direction from Jody Foster matured in delivering her first profitable film. There was a simple set mimicking a news production studio, so the script was important instead of exotic set scenery as from the Ocean's series. Action was missing though there was plenty of drama, suspense, and irony! George's character, the anchor of a financial new spot, vindicated himself ironically with the help of his capture. The capture took George's character hostage and persuaded him and his team, including Julia's character, to uncover a missing $800 million!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 years after the worldwide financial crisis, I think we have already seen all the possible cinematographic denounces against the dirty machinations of Wall Street, the amoral bankers and the "hotshots" who got rich while the rest of the world was suffering. Among the "financial" movies I liked very much, I would mention The Big Short, Margin Call and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Unfortunately, Money Monster is nowhere near the level of those films. The main problem of Money Monster is that it's developed on an extremely monotonous way, and with insipid characters which don't wake the slightest interest on the audience, despite the competent performances from George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Jack O'Connell. The screenplay consists on the same routine of screams and threats over and over again, until reaching an improbable and too predictable ending. The surprises don't surprise, and we need to swallow many clichés to reach the final lesson: the rich ones get richer, and the poor ones, poorer. I could have learnt that watching five minutes of the news; or having a look at my bank account. Comparing Money Monster with other films about hostages, I would place it on par with John Q (equally monotonous and boring, despite Denzel Washington's brilliant performance) and below The Negotiator (a bit predictable, but entertaining) or, of course, Inside Man (hugely more ingenious and exciting... and which had curiously included Jodie Foster -the director of Money Monster- in its cast). So, in conclusion, I don't recommend "investing" on Money Monster (hahaha), because I found it tedious and unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, I will keep having faith in Foster as a director; I hope that, in her next projects, she will find screenplays more suitable with her simultaneously warm and analytical vision.</fullReview>

Sometimes I think half of the movies in Hollywood are made by kids in junior school with a task to make a script over night basing it on machine generated random set of story points. Yes, it is so bad. Money Monster has no suspense, no story, no characters, no ideas, no artistism in picture of any kind. Plot is more then weak. Not a single action of any character in this movie makes any sense. Just another cliché parade produsced by LA movie conveyor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fast-paced and exciting to watch. Because of the fast nature of the film, there is a lot of information being portrayed to us, and as such, time feels like it has passed by quickly. The suspenseful atmosphere that lurks behind the tone of the film makes it easy to lose yourself in.The acting is superb, and Roberts especially gives a compelling portrayal. The professional personality of her character shines in the film, even as she is faced with the threat of being blown to pieces. Clooney too, does a good job with his character. His character's arrogant act doesn't help in pacifying the gunman. Speaking of which, O'Connell gives a very raw performance. His overt anger and the way you can see his face get red from frustration is quite impressive. Caitriona Balfe as Diane Lester is also quite an interesting character. However, her boss, Camby (played by West) joins the party late and maybe it is because his character isn't likable, but I felt that he is a bit awkward. Jodie Foster does a great job at directing this film. It was easily engaging and kept my attention. The soundtrack, voice effects, and settings all aid to create this suspenseful tone. Supporting actors and actresses like Christopher Denham, Giancarlo Esposito, Condola Rashad and Aaron Yoo are great additions to the film as well. The cinematography and editing is great because it helps us to see the point of view from the various perspectives. Because of the sensitive nature of the event, a lot of people are involved in the case. Therefore, the film repeatedly jumps from each different cluster of people, from the studio room, to the police outside, to the other company involved and so on. This cutting from here to there is done in a way that is not disorienting or confusing. Also, I appreciate that they had shots of people watching from public spaces. I as well liked how, at first, characters who would later be involved in the case are introduced as just casual people watching the news. Overall, an exciting film that is sure to entertain. However, there is quite a bit of swearing in this that does not seem so necessary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it fair to criticise a movie for not being what it could have been? Some critics have pointed out that Money Monster (2016) does not go far enough in attacking the root causes of recent global financial meltdowns. But this is only one movie with one voice, and it was made for entertainment. If you want to see the shape of a movie-led subversive campaign you need to join the dots between recent films like 99 Homes (2014), The Big Short (2015), and believe it or not, Captain America: Civil War (2016). They all address issues of political and corporate accountability which have become the major cinematic themes of our time. All of them ask the same question: who guards the guardians in the bastions of capitalism and in the home of the free?The film Money Monster is framed around a TV studio hostage scenario where a deranged bomb- laden amateur investor demands on-air answers about an $800 million IBIS stock-market crash. Lee Gates (George Clooney) has been targeted as the prancing celebrity Wall Street guru whose popularity rests on picking stock market winners. Crazed Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) sneaks into the studio and demands to know why the system is rigged so that shmucks like him can lose everything they own. The drama unfolds on-air under the cool control of executive producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) but panic escalates when Kyle's pregnant girlfriend publicly abuses him as a loser. The siege moves to a street walk lined with police and hero-worshippers who also want answers, leading to Gates and Budwell confronting the IBIS CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) in a live feed watched by millions.Money Monster is a tautly directed hostage thriller with an outstanding cast, a gripping real-time storyline, and enough probing insight into the greed industry to have some social value. Clooney's performance anchors the film as he traverses emotions from arrogance to terror, to being a vigilante for the truth. If Clooney is the anchor then Roberts is the ship itself, playing steely calm balanced with enough glimpses of emotion to make her the warm heart of the story. O'Connell plays escalating desperation so well that his performance sets the tension graph for the whole film. The camera-work feels like a live on-air take and the story unfolds with edge-of-your-seat pacing and enough surprises to keep you guessing how this will turn out. The street walk could have been tightened by ten minutes, but otherwise it is outstanding entertainment that also asks important social questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'MONEY MONSTER': Four Stars (Out of Five)A political thriller flick, from director Jodie Foster! The story revolves around a financial adviser 'TV personalty'; that's taken hostage, in the middle of his show, by an angry viewer looking for revenge. The film stars George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Jack O'Connell (who also starred in 'UNBROKEN'; which was also directed by another female movie star, turned director, Angelina Jolie). It was written by Alan Di Fiore, Jim Kouf and Jamie Linden. The movie has received mediocre reviews from critics, and it's also been a disappointment at the Box Office (especially considering it's high- profile cast), but I really enjoyed it.Kyle Budwell (O'Connell) invested his entire life savings, $60,000, in IBIS Global Capital's stock; based on the advice of a TV financial guru, named Lee Gates (Clooney). Due to an unexpected glitch, in a trading algorithm, the stock crashed (costing all investors over $800 million). Budwell blames Gates, for his major financial loss. With a kid on the way, he decides to sneak into Gates' show (while it's filming), and take him hostage. The thriller plays out in real time, as Gates desperately tries to come up with answers, for Budwell, with the help of his show's director (Roberts).The movie seems like a pretty routine thriller, at first, but then it has some amazingly compassionate moments, of realism, and some great political insight; into the world we now live in. That's thanks (in large part) to a clever script, some really good performances (from all three of it's leads) and some pretty impressive film direction (from Foster). Foster is an amazingly talented entertainer, and it seems like she's a really compassionate, and truly inspiring, human being as well. Almost every film she does is going to be worth seeing; whether she's behind the camera, or in front of it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Jack O'Connell area great in the lead roles that take place happening in real time.George is Leo the arrogant Jim Cramer show of the title movie. As it is just an ordinary show until Jack O'Connell, the young English actor putting on a Brooklyn accent, as Kyle barges into the studio.Kyle is not a bad person despite strapping a bomb on Leo and having a gun. He is just an angry investor who lost $60,000 of his life savings and personal problems.Julia is Patty the producer who has to put up with Leo. And has to be cool, calm, collective, and voice of reason. In order to make sure nobody gets killed since Leo has a bomb and everybody could be at risk.It is very suspenseful and directed by Jodie Foster, who only directs. It happens in real time. Which I love about a movie if it were to take place in real life.But still, very suspenseful and reacts to the real world of money and how investors lost it like in the real life Ponzi or Madoff scheme. It is about trust issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a really enjoyable movie, few clear steps heading to reveal the ending. Even from beginning it is easy to figure out the ending, but the clear partition of the movie made me love it, the kidnapping, the act, the rescuing, investigation, the tragedy ending. I just love the tension and acting of the movie, one of the good movie I see this year. The action of Geoge Cloony and Julia Robots are good, and also few of the funny part was good. 98 minutes movie contains the similar length story in the movie, few lines simultaneously developing: TV show, IBIS company, the kidnapper, the investigation, the reaction of public, the police. Each line meet in some point. But the tension building doesn't make you forget breathing, but still a good movie to see, entertaining. I definitely will go back to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a film directed by Jodi Foster, featuring George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Jack O'Connell, it's pretty hard to go wrong. As egotistical TV stock market Host Lee Gates, Clooney awkwardly does his best hamming it up CNBC Jim Crammer style, while series producer Patty (Roberts') calmly attempts to reel him in. However, it is not until O'Connell's frustrated invested "Kyle Budwell," and his wild girlfriend Molly (Emily Meade "That Awkward Moment"), appear does the film kick into a believability. Unfortunately, several secondary characters dialogue (Captian Powell, Ron Sprecher, Avery Goodloe, Bree -the Assistant) are at times wordy and cheesy, continually pulling the film back from reality. Dominic West (TV's "The Affair") does a nice job playing the target of Kyle's woes. However, Clooney's final "On-Air" broadcast is just out of place, and the YouTube gag-snippets (which are funny) just push the films believability to far. While Foster continues to prove her worth as a director, the films screenplay writers (Jamie Linden and Alan DiFiore) could have helped her more. If you're tired of all the comic book films now making the rounds, you find ample satisfaction in "Money Monster".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney's TV star is forced to take stock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are patient enough to sit through end titles you might notice that the MPAA certificate number at the end of films has now passed 50,000 (if you are curious, number 50,000 was actually a non-entity of a film called "Chloe and Theo", with "Steve Jobs" missing it by one!). With all those movie plots you would think that there was no new story under the sun. But here comes "Money Monster"- a hostage TV studio drama that I certainly haven't seen filmed before. For that reason, the writing team (Jamie Linden, Alan DiFiore and Jim Kouf) should be congratulated.George Clooney plays Lee Gates, the smug and self-satisfied star of 'Money Monster', a finance-focused TV slot which tries to sex up stocks and shares with some pretty girls and dance routines. Julie Roberts is Patty Fenn, his long-suffering director who is impressed and exasperated by Gates in equal measure. Enter (quietly, stage right) truck driver Kyle Budwell (English-born Jack O'Connell, "Unbroken") who has a bone to pick with Gates' financial advice. His bone picking technique involves a loaded handgun and a couple of Semtex-loaded vests. Dragged into the drama is the boss of the stock in question, Walt Camby (Dominic West, "Pride") and his communications director Diane Lester (Caitrione Balfe). There is always a frisson of excitement when the Hollywood royalty of George Clooney and Julia Roberts bat together, and here they don't disappoint. Both deserve their star billing. Clooney in particular is excellent when he realizes his personal collateral with his remote audience is worth less than $8 per head: a man devastated. But this is a great ensemble cast performance, with Christopher Denham ("Argo") providing 'stiff' competition (LOL) for the comedy part and Lenny Venito being effective as Lenny, the last cameraman standing. Irish actress Balfe is also particularly watchable and this exposure should do her career good.But its O'Connell that has the greatest acting challenge walking a fine line between a despicable terrorist and a pitiable loser. And its a tightrope that is well-walked leading to a touching and effective finale.The movie is directed by Jodie Foster, last seen in acting mode in Elysium in 2013. And, now with a number of films and TV shows in her directing bag over the last few years, its a role she seems comfortable in.It's an enjoyable and engaging little film (it never feels like making it to an A-grade blockbuster) and while the 'all bankers are b*stards' line has been well mined recently (most impressively in "The Big Short") this manages a novel twist on the theme. The film starts in highly gripping fashion with the studio scenes, although the story wanders off somewhat towards the end and assumes an unrealistic tone (there is surely no way the police forces wouldn't intervene to limit the potential casualties!). A good cinema outing, with star performers at the helm. Recommended. (But avoid the standard trailer - a 'redux' spoiler-free version is viewable from my web site at http://bob-the-movie-man.com).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clooney still has it, movie isn't' up to him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta admit that I have had a "man crush" on George Clooney for quite some time - probably dating back to his days on ER. &nbsp;I loved his screen "coming out party" OUT OF SIGHT (an under-rated gem, check it out). &nbsp;I thought he was terrific in THE PERFECT STORM, said&nbsp;he should have won the Oscar for MICHAEL CLAYTON and was glad to float around space with him and Sandra Bullock in GRAVITY. &nbsp;However, I have been disappointed in him lately from 2014's MONUMENTS MEN to 2015's TOMORROWLAND to the worst movie of 2016&nbsp;HAIL, CAESAR, I began to wonder if he was "losing it".I'm happy to report that MONEY MONSTER shows that he still has it. &nbsp;Starring as Cable Money Show host Lee Gates, Clooney is the perfect embodiment of the "empty suit with a smile" on TV spouting clichés and loud attention grabbing snippets while really saying, essentially, nothing. &nbsp;It is the perfect role for him. &nbsp;The story centers around a disgruntled worker (UNBROKEN'S Jack O'Connell)&nbsp;who took Gates at his word and invested his entire life savings in one of his investment suggestions. &nbsp;When that investment tanks, Gates gets taken hostage live on the air. &nbsp;Aided by his intrepid producer (Julia Roberts), Gates needs to "get real" to get out of this situation.Sounds like a good premise, right? &nbsp;And it is and as performed by Clooney, Gates and Roberts (more on her later), this had the makings of an interesting hostage drama with a cautionary tale of our voyeuristic tendencies of watching tragedy unfold on live TV. &nbsp;Unfortunately, MONEY MONSTER isn't that interested in that story. &nbsp;It tacks on a conspiracy plot by the tanking company led by a smiling, well-coiffed CEO that has "nothing to hide" that just screams "I HAVE EVERYTHING TO HIDE". &nbsp;As played by Dominic West, all this CEO was missing was tying the girl to the train tracks and twirling his mustache.Professionally directed by Jodie Foster, I was excited for this movie and the scenes in the studios between Clooney and Roberts (reunited for the first time since OCEAN'S 11 and 12). &nbsp;The scenes between these two&nbsp;had a spark in them that I haven't seen from Clooney&nbsp;in a long time - I credit Roberts (and Foster) for enabling Clooney to bring his A (or maybe his A-) game. &nbsp;As far as Roberts is concerned, I think she is having a career renaissance (check out her work in last year's THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES). &nbsp;It was fun to watch these two veterans chew the scenery with each other.&nbsp; These two are surrounded by some fun&nbsp;characters in the TV studio, especially "that guy" character actor Lenny Venito as the lead cameraman and Christopher Dehnham as a beleaguered producer who is given all the "crap" jobs to do. &nbsp;The interplay between them all are fun and it sets up&nbsp;an interesting world that I want to spend time in. &nbsp;And when the gunman crashes the party, I was interested.Unfortunately, where this movie doesn't succeed is when it decides to move away from the studio and it's interesting characters and focus on a generic Corporation with generic characters that is hiding a generic&nbsp;conspiracy. &nbsp;And that's too bad,&nbsp;&nbsp;for Director Foster and Writer Jamie Linden waste some really good talent - most notably the Police Captain played by Giancarlo Esposito and a corporate flunky played by the always slimy Dennis Boutsikaris who all but disappears from this film after the 1/3 portion. &nbsp;They had the makings of a really good, really interesting film, but, instead turned it into a decent and watchable entertainment that shows us what true&nbsp;"MOVIE STARS" George Clooney and Julia Roberts still are.6 1/2 &nbsp;(out of 10) stars, but I'll tack on 1/2&nbsp;more stars for the re-emergence of Clooney and Roberts, so "officially" a 7 (out of 10) starred movie and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some elements of the Sidney Lumet's Oscar winning "Network" (1976) in Money Monster both concerning television broadcasting. Yet what director Jodie Foster attempts to direct is more challenging. The tone of her movie is off balanced between dramatic and humor and by the end, she has somehow transformed the climatic scenes into both despair and gladness. Most of the camera shots are confined to the broadcast station itself, offering little in the way for the primary characters to move and confront a wider-ranging environment. In some ways, they are literally live on stage performing before a huge television audience.Jodie has her actors play it quite straight and serious along with a shifting perspective on the hostage taker. There is an amazing scene where the hostage taker is confronted by a close intimate friend of his. It's difficult to imagine that most audience members will leave the theater completely satisfied feeling something was either missing or directed or scripted in ways that the American audience didn't pay to see. Jodie is directing to her own drum beats and offering up a different action drama for the public. In short this movie may be disturbing and under-rated, but actually good as a reminder of the toll our society takes on its citizens.</fullReview>

But I liked Clooney in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"(2000), "Solaris"(2002), "The Men Who Stare at Goats"(2009). "Money Monster"(2016) is the best so far(he's one of the producers too). I liked Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman"(1990) but I like her even more in "Money Monster", she makes a very sensitive role. I discover Jack O'Connell just now, in "Money Monster" and he is convincing. In conclusion, a very smart film, with suspense, directed by the multi-talented Jodie Foster, which I appreciate very much as an actress, especially for her roles in "Taxi Driver"(1976), "Bugsy Malone"(1976), "The Silence of the Lambs"(1991) and as an actress and director in and for "Little Man Tate"(1991).

		<fullReview>It's a common theme in films that Wall Street is largely corrupt. We've seen it played out countless times. Especially lately. And many of these films mesh together to become indistinguishable from each other. Money Monster may feel different. But is it maybe due to the ridiculously large ad campaign or because it says things that the others don't?The former is most likely true, but it doesn't mean this film should be tossed aside. There's a lot to like about it.George Clooney plays Lee Gates, the host of a stock market show where he advises people on what to stocks to buy and sell. In one situation, he advises everyone to buy shares of a specific company, saying it's a surefire bet. So many viewers do, but when the company's stock plummets, costing investors $800 million, everyone wants answers.Most specifically, a young man named Kyle (Jack O'Connell), who sneaks onto the show's set and threatens everyone. Flailing a gun around and strapping a bomb around Gates' chest, he goes into a rant about losing his entire $60,000 life savings on the company because of Gates' advice.Kyle and the script have a lot to say, but never quite hit the nail on the head in a grand way. It's well thought out, but doesn't play as so, instead giving us popcorn thrills and adrenaline rushes. Which, by no means, is a bad thing.Bordering on transparent and cheesy a few times, its wittiness jumps back out of it quickly--and fortunately. At a little over 90 minutes, the film is paced well. It keeps us awake on the edge of our seats pretty much the whole time, which is interesting considering almost the whole thing takes place on a television set with just a couple of people.This may have to do with the fact that the point of view is all over the place--an odd decision for a thriller. We see what the filmmakers conveniently need us to see--not always what makes sense for us to.Though not as big or impactful as it wants to be, it stands as a microcosm of the financial stresses most of the country is constantly going through. It's an important movie, but there are others that are slightly more important. Although, it doesn't hurt to watch this one and be thoroughly entertained in the process.Twizard Rating: 86</fullReview>

Now, it is up to Lee Gates &amp; Patty Fenn, to comply with Kyle Budwell's demands or, it is dire consequences for everyone involved with the TV show, Money Monster. Money Monster is a superb film. It is thrilling &amp; dramatically intense, at the same time. Director Jodie Foster has done a masterful job, in maintaining the suspense &amp; building the tension, throughout the film. Foster's directorial skills, are as good as her supreme acting ability. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat &amp; keeps you guessing as to what's going to happen next, right till its shocking climax. The reason this film is so good, is due to its unforgettable performances. George Clooney is outstanding as Lee Gates. Clooney portrays his character's growing anxiety &amp; fear, flawlessly. Julia Roberts is spectacular as Patty Fenn. This role, is another feather in Roberts' cap. Jack O'Connell's portrayal of Kyle Budwell, is the highlight of the movie. O'Connell showcases a variety of emotions in quick succession, in his portrayal of this conflicted character. Dominic West is great as Walt Camby. Caitriona Balfe is impressive as Diane Lester. Giancarlo Esposito is awesome as Captain Powell. Christopher Denham &amp; Lenny Venito are excellent as Ron Sprecher &amp; Lenny(The Cameraman), respectively. Emily Meade is amazing in her small but significant role, as Molly. The supporting cast, is effective as well. Money Monster is a must watch, for everyone who loves edge of the seat entertainment.</fullReview>

"Roll VT on screen 1." Patty is ever the professional ? "He's shadowed, move in," - entirely under-utilised and loyal to a fault; Roberts does a great job of walking the line between being the cool-cucumber of reason and expletive-espousing problem solver. O'Connell makes Kyle ? the star of the show ? feel suitably unhinged but slightly opaque; a somewhat unconvincing martyr with a half open gob, quivering lip in tow. Unlike the Money Monster show and set, the IBIS gimmick feels under-developed with casting choices that contribute to it's flat-feel; the NYPD contingent survives the former but is damaged by the latter and generally uninspired writing. The result is a by the numbers (pardon the pun) shallow hostage thriller with few twists; however, having said that and despite its predictability, the film's setting made it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MONEY MONSTER Jodie Foster directs this suspenseful hostage drama set in a live-to-air television studio. George Clooney's Lee Gates is the flippant host of a tacky infotainment show for Wall Street watchers. Soon after the morning show goes to air a disgruntled young shareholder, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell), bursts into the studio and threatens to blow up Lee who had recently spruiked an investment company whose share price had plummeted.Under threats from the gunman the producer, Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts), orders the film crew to continue filming, and to contain the situation, she fits out Kyle with a collar mic "so people can hear you properly", effectively giving him a voice as the show beams into bars and cafés across Manhattan. The film cleverly juggles the fear of a loose canon with the growing sympathy for Kyle, the battler who has a legitimate grievance, who lost his savings through the legal greed of Wall Street bankers.To buy time, the producer investigates the claims made by Kyle and the film develops into an on air "real time" investigation into the background of the company's $80 million loss. It is probably the first time the show has ever produced journalism of any worth in its glitzy life and it now has an audience of millions watching. The movie concerns itself with the reveal of those investigations.Along the way of the film we learn a little about algorithms of high frequency trading, share price basics, the kind of outrageous speculations bankers make with investors' money; and a whole lot of the baloney of the medium of low production infotainment.It is a fast paced, intense drama. The tone of this movie, particularly the tension of the full barrelled police response, is strongly reminiscent of Spike Lee's heist drama "Inside Man" (2006) in which Foster played a pivotal character. Clooney is well cast as the superficial TV presenter but the transformation of his character is a bit hollow. Julia Roberts gives a strong performance which is refreshingly free of the sexual objectification that has characterised her Hollywood career. If Jodie Foster has a special directorial quality it very well could be the recasting of female representation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Money Monster, George Clooney plays a TV presenter who is taken hostage live on camera by a desperate young man played by the brilliant Jack O'Connell. I really enjoyed this film; finding it thrilling and well paced throughout. However, it falls short of being completely satisfying. Six months ago, The Big Short - a far superior film - attempted to tackle the full complexity of the 2008 financial crisis and its causes and did so in a way that was both enlightening and entertaining. Money Monster is more like Phone Booth. In this movie the credit crunch is merely the setting for a tense thrill ride; which is OK except it feels like it's aiming to be more substantial.I've heard Jodie Foster, the director, say that the seventies will always be her favourite era because movies took such risks back then. Her key influences here are clearly Network and Dog Day Afternoon. Perhaps this is the problem. It feels like a 1970s style take on a 21st Century issue. Thanks in part to other recent movies we already have a more sophisticated appreciation of the reality of the financial sector. But I still really enjoyed Money Monster. George Clooney strikes the right balance as the likable scoundrel who just needs a gun to the head in order to realise how far down the wrong path he has travelled. And Jack O'Connell is probably my favourite actor of this decade. Just as he did in Starred Up or Eden Lake, this young man threatens to break though the screen and grab hold of you. Electrifying.In the end I see this film as a fable and a romp. It is lots of fun. The ending just seemed a bit Hollywood. If you want to see a film that explores the impact that the financial crisis had on regular people I highly recommend the underrated 99 Homes.</fullReview>

Again, Hollywood portrays the police as uncaring and bordering on brutal, which adds to the overall ambiance but does not detract from the main theme. This movie would have been just as successful with only 3 on screen actors with all the others playing bit roles to the 3 main characters.

In this movie, a bad tip by a stock adviser loses a young man his entire wealth. Although the issue of fraud and financial incompetency isn't handled as well as, say, The Big Short, it is a bit of a thrill ride.Clooney and Roberts are perfect for their roles here as TV host and director. Their relationship is well formed, and you get a sense of their history as they bicker like a married couple. The true star though is relative newcomer Jack O'Connell, who has previously impressed in Starred Up, '71 and Unbroken. For the first time here he's up against some huge Hollywood heavyweights, and he certainly holds his own. His character arc is complex and moving, and you get a real sense of his desperation (and ultimately end up rooting for him).Where the film is let down slightly is the secondary characters; the policemen felt almost undirected, and some of their dialogue is awfully clunky and clichéd - the typical thriller stuff. Particularly at start of the TV hijacking, the movie feels strangely unprofessional and unrealistic: surely there would be procedures for them to follow, negotiation would begin almost immediately, wouldn't it?For all its flaws though, Foster's created undeniably strong tension pretty much consistently. We know Kyle is a loose cannon, and when he's flinging around his gun and bomb trigger, anything could happen. Each time there's a new development in the story (eg. introducing his girlfriend), the apprehension was through the roof, I was genuinely terrified of what his reaction might be! This is in part due to Lewis's mellow but menacing score lying underneath, which subtly shifts the emotion around.I think Foster still needs to find her directing feet, but she's done well to create a thriller that's more tense than most horrors and more emotional than most dramas. Great performances by the central three, just needed to be a little more edgy. Definitely worth a watch - if only the one time.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TV showman is shaken by irate customer's siege</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Spotlight, Money Monster revives the lost ideal of responsible, investigative journalism. Lee Gates (George Clooney) is a TV showman who does vaudeville acts to flog his financial coverage. "We don't even do journalism," his sharp producer (Julia Roberts) admits. Gates initially embodies the modern media's ? like the government's ? sellout to corporate America. Then his cocooned complacency is upset by the invasion by a threatening bomber outraged that Gates's glib recommendation caused the man's ? and many other helpless schnooks' ? financial ruin.As the world watches Kyle Budwell's siege their stunned sympathy catches the frustration and rage that fuel the Sanders and Trump revolutions. The corrupt business executive Walt Camby steals north of $80,000,000 to finance an African adventure while his trusting shareholders are left broke an broken. In a comic replay of the citizens' impotence, a staffer tests a new erectile cream ? but is prematurely rushed away on assignment. For the showman, of course, courage in investing is imaged as impressive balls.As his name suggests Gates proves to be a pathway. He develops some sympathy for his attacker, especially after the boy's pregnant girlfriend rages at him instead of pleading for his survival. The showbiz team turns serious when a friendly network of hackers exposes Camby's lies and fraud. Gates is determined to get Kyle some answers, to justify his campaign. In the end he does, but he can't save the lad's life. The film operates on several levels of reversal. As the financial "journalist" plays showbiz the usual array of real newsmen, like the ubiquitous Wolf Blitzer, show up as themselves. Apparently no one has told them that if they play fictional versions of themselves in Hollywood fictions they squander whatever credibility they may have had on their own news shows. The very casting proves the film's starting thesis: Americans are merely entertained where they need to be informed. The reversal of the pregnant girl's usually sentimental appeal to her man parallels the film's overall sense of an America in which normal loyalties have been lost to rabid self-interest. The casting plays a romantic twist on this. Clooney and Roberts in a movie, that promises scenes of electric romance. But no, in the bulk of their scenes they aren't even together, just shot and framed separately as she communicates from the production booth to his earpiece. They connect but are separated, an emblem of a fractured union, a fractured country. Only at the end do they meet. She abandons her new job after he admitted his need for her. That adds a romantic tinge to the illusion of justice restored.And it is just an illusion. Villain Camby will be investigated but as he says, he didn't break any law when he exploited the corrupt system. Remembering how all the real-life villains behind the mortgage calamity went scot-free, we have little hope he will suffer proper punishment here. And after a montage of saddened faces, the representative citizens shaken by the boy's needless killing, the normal life of games and anodynes resumes: a guy resumes his bar game of fusball. Emotions give way to an automaton.The film delights in reversals. When Gates twigs to the fact that the FBI are trying to shoot him, he uses the terrorist as his shield to get from the studio to the Camby interview. In that irony we're reminded you can't tell the good guys from the bad any more. Trump is counting on that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though the stocks aren't high when trying to be game changing, Money Monster still works as a gripping thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's anything that Millennials are more focused on these days is money. It's not necessarily the goal for all of us to be wealthy, but after the financial downturn and recession that started in 2007, young people are really concerned with getting by. I myself don't want to see the country make the same mistakes that it did that led us into the Great Recession. My father, who has a college education in finance, has coached me for years to always pay my bills on time and to maintain some kind of budget. While nothing's perfect, I do feel like that there is a wise way to maintain a living.If personal wealth isn't enough, Millennials have also sought to try and steer the economy away from the big corporations. Websites like Redbubble.com and Etsy.com have paved the way for independent businesses, and putting some fear into the big box stores that would have carried these items years ago. The only ones that are still in the past are a couple of the big financial companies like Trump, HBSC, and CITGO. They have used loopholes and crocked methods to stay open. One company gets challenged by a gunman in Money Monster. Lee Gates (played by George Clooney) is a cable TV personality who hosts an entertaining financial whiz show called Money Monster, a parody of the real life Mad Money. His frequent changes to the scripts and arrogant attitude have been something of an annoyance to show director Patty Fenn (played by Julia Roberts). The show that day focuses on a company called IBIS and a recent glitch that caused a loss of $800 million of investor money. This proved to be too much for a deliveryman who managed to sneak into the studio and appear on live TV with a gun.This gunman is a working class laborer Kyle Budwell (played by Jack O'Connell) who holds Lee Gates responsible for making him lose sixty thousand when told that IBIS would be a solid investment. With no choice, Money Monster continues to air live as Gates is forced to wear a vest with a bomb on it. Budwell forces Lee to try and find out what happened with the supposed "glitch". As Fenn and Lee dig deeper, they start to see some suspicious activity with IBIS's CEO Walt Camby starting with an undocumented trip to Africa. Time is ticking as a bomb could be going off and Lee reconsiders what he said before.Money Monster is a movie that really tries to get us to think about what's been going on with Wall Street. While it's a good ambition, it had to come out after films like The Big Short, which felt more unapologetic, along with 99 Homes. Even then, the Wall Street talk is fine, but it's not as "game changing" as some of them.Is there a point to Money Monster? Yes, as the overall movie still makes for a gripping thriller. As the time passes, you really get to know our three people Budwell, Fenn, and Lee. They're all well casted by their actors. In fact, had the movie taken place within their point of view, I would have even claimed it as one of my favorites. That's because whenever it goes outside the studio, what we get is standard villains and characters that are not as interesting. Director Jodie Foster at least knows how to create intriguing main characters, as the movie makes it clear that our gunman is not that bright. But when you hear his story, you really start to throw your own anger on this company that screwed him.I'll give this seven TV show buzzers out of ten. Money Monster still makes for a suspenseful thriller even if it's attempts to attack Wall Street aren't as strong as it wants to be. I'd say to give Money Monster a chance, and try to find something out of it to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take It As A Thriller As Opposed To A Documentary, It's Decent For What It Wants To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a couple of pretty informative films lately when it comes to the financial industry (Inside Job and The Big Short). Both movies found a way to boil things down so you could understand even if you weren't well versed in Wall Street terminology. I went in to Money Monster knowing it was mean to be entertaining. With the cast it has (George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell and Giancarlo Esposito), a strong trailer and the social justice concept, I was interested to see where it would go. I think managing expectations is key Money Monster, if you go in expecting an insightful look into finance or an Oscar calibre drama, you'll be disappointed. It's a thriller and if you accept it, I think you'll have a good time.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Lee Gates (George Clooney) hosts the show Money Monster. Lee is arrogant and mouthy, he has a lot of bravado and isn't afraid to step on other people's toes. The recent financial story is the downfall of IBIS who lost $800 million dollars overnight. CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) explained it was due to a technical glitch. Gates is a staunch Camby supporter and claims the stock will bounce back. Before the show the next day, Gates is preparing for the show. Most of his interactions are with his director Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) who seems like more of a friend than his boss. She puts up with his juvenile behaviour and they get ready to do the show. Gates begins with some posturing but gradually gets into rhythm and is leading up to his interview with Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe) who is the chief communication officer for IBIS. After a while, Patty sees a delivery boy slowly moving closer and closer to Gates (he will eventually be named as Kyle Budwell played by Jack O'Connell). He pulls out a pistol and fires it in the air. He instructs him to put on a bomb vest and to answer his questions about the IBIS crash.I would again like to point out that Money Monster isn't meant to sit you down and teach a lesson. It's a fictional drama and for a hostage thriller, it does it's job well. The movie offers some twists and turns that I didn't see coming, even playing on a couple of stereotypes that commonly take place in these type of movies (calling in the next of kin for the hostage taker/terrorist was really different). But on the other hand, while Money Monster accomplishes what it sets out to, it's disappointing because it has the opportunity to dive into some darker aspects of Wall Street and it completely moves away from it. Two of the shadier practices in Wall Street are mentioned but play significant roles (dark pools and high frequency trading) but instead of looking into how these areas are barely monitored, they create a greedy and evil CEO to point the finger at. It isn't wrong that they did that but it felt like they chose the easy path to entertain instead of diving into real problems in high finance.The cast of Money Monster is large but the movie largely focuses on 3 people. Luckily, they got the right people to play those parts. I was most impressed with Julia Roberts. Her character is the the most sympathetic, she's saddled with the man-child who she has to look after yet produce a quality show. Julia helps humanize not only her character but the other two leads, she's playing a more down-to-earth character and she's does it really well. I've only seen Jack O'Connell in Unbroken but I can see why he's on the rise. He did a really good job playing Kyle in a way where he's not the good guy but you understand where he's coming from and he's not necessarily the villain you think he would be watching the trailer. George Clooney is the star of the show and I thought he got better as the movie went on. In the start of the movie, he's rapping and dancing all over the place and it didn't seem to gel. But as things get more serious, the more the movie moves into his wheelhouse and he becomes more believable. I liked Giancarlo Stanton as the police commissioner and even though I didn't like the direction they took his character, Dominic West was good as Walt Camby.I would just take this movie at face value. Kyle's plan doesn't really hold up and Money Monster is not wearing it's message on it's sleeve. Also Money Monster is being dismissed by some as liberal propaganda and I don't think that's accurate. One of the other things I liked about Money Monster is that it's unclear who the villain is until the end. Kyle is the gunman and he deserves to be punished for his actions but he's questioning the system that seems to ignore the rules and suppresses anything that they don't want us to see. Lee is an ignorant prick but does he deserve to die for that? Of course not. This is a world of mixed morals and minus Patty all the characters do not line up as black or white but as a shade of grey. It's refreshing to see that and it's a little closer to what we really see in the world.I liked this movie when I left the theatre. The more and more I thought about it, I started to pick out things. It's far from a bad movie, it has a good cast, complicated characters and enough twists and turns to hold your interest. But it's not great either, it bypasses some really interesting aspects for an easier resolution and it didn't live up to it's trailer. It's one of those movies where you have to split the difference and although I might have been disappointed, it deserves credit for accomplishing what it set out to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: At times preposterous but always engaging, the film succeeds in making its talented cast work overtime to hide its glitches. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: An angry gunman takes over a television studio and wants answers. JIM'S REVIEW: In 1976, director Sidney Lumet and writer Paddy Chayefsky's Academy-Award winning satire, Network, skewered television with his unique view on capitalism, political unrest, and corporate greed. At that time, the film bemoaned our national obsession with celebrity worship, commentary substituting as news, the fine line between scripted and reality shows, and actual violence seen on the tube. Back then, these mad-as-hell events seemed too absurd and improbable to occur, but the film became a self-fulfilling prophesy of our chaotic world. Also back then came a film by another Sidney, Lumet that is, who created a terrific thriller about a desperate man whose botched robbery attempt soon becomes a media circus. Al Pacino stars and gives a great performance in this based on a true event police drama entitled Dog Day Afternoon. (By the way, if you haven't seen this two 70's films, make it a point to do so.)Which takes us to director Jodie Foster's Money Monster, a film hybrid that never touches the brilliant observances of Network or the realistic excitement of Dog Day Afternoon but still uses some of their concepts in a more conventional yet effective way. Perhaps the screenplay-by- committee team of Jamie Linden, Alan DiFlore, and Jim Kouf distilled too many ideas in honoring those films, as the film starts off so promisingly before it settles into a standard crime drama. Money Monster goes about its business and has a nice tension between the three principle actors, but at about the halfway mark, it descends into pure melodrama and lets predictability be its guide. The plot begins to strain credibility with its images of this instant televised coverage unfolding as a global event and especially with Kyle's desperate get-rich scheme to try to diffuse the crisis, a true glitch in the film's narrative structure.George Clooney, in a strong performance, plays Lee Gates, a Jim Cramer clone whose rapid fire television advice and colorful patter on his financial information show has unhinged Kyle Budwell, a madder-than-hell follower and investor (Jack O'Connell) who now has lost everything in the stock market and is literally looking for payback. Seeing this crisis unfold is Lee's producer, Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts). As she tries to contain this explosive hostage situation, we watch both captor and captive interact and bond.Ms. Foster's direction is assured and solid. She taps into today's anger issues with Wall Street and aims her barbs at Big Business while keeping the action moving at a brisk pace. She also wisely assembled a fine cast of actors to heighten the suspense. Mr. Clooney uses his charismatic good looks and acting prowess to show us a flawed man who must call on his inner strength to survive. Ms. Roberts, in a more supporting part, creates a straight-forward no-nonsense professional who truly values her partner. Their chemistry is the real thing. Mr. O'Connell brings out the frustration and confusion of his character well, although his Brooklyn accent is laid on a bit thick. Lending fine support are Dominic West, Christopher Dunham, Lenny Venito, Emily Meade, and Caitriona Balfe who emits a real star quality on screen.In Money Monster, we are still mad-as-hell, or just plain crazy mad.

		<shortDescription>"Money Monster" is well worth your hard-earned cash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone were to enter your home and steal from you, naturally, you'd be angry. You'd want to see that person caught and to pay for the crime and, if possible, to get your money back. When someone commits financial crimes, it's a little harder to accomplish all that, but the first step after the crime (or unethical behavior) comes to light is to assign blame. It also happens to be cathartic. As cathartic as movies can be, they've been a useful tool over the years for venting our collective rage over such misuse of our money and/or showing us how these things happen. Some of the better and/or more notable examples include "Trading Places" (1983), "Wall Street" (1987), "Barbarians at the Gate" (1993), "Boiler Room" (2000), "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room" (2005), "Capitalism: A Love Story" (2009), "Margin Call" (2011), "Arbitrage" (2012), "The Wolf of Wall Street" (2013) and, in 2015 alone, "99 Homes" and the Best Picture Oscar nominee "The Big Short". 2016 brings us "Money Monster" (R, 1:38), starring Oscar winners George Clooney and Julia Roberts and directed by 2-time winner Jodie Foster.Clooney is Lee Gates, the cocky and flamboyant host of a financially-themed NYC-based TV show called "Money Monster". It's high finance meets entertainment (similar to CNBC's "Mad Money", hosted by Jim Cramer) and it features Lee and his oversized personality both advising and amusing investors. Lee's long-time producer, Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts), keeps things stock-ticking along but is suddenly forced to become a hostage negotiator, crisis manager and investigative journalist when a man with a gun and a bomb takes over the studio (during a live broadcast!) and takes Lee hostage. Viewers first think that this is just another one of Lee's on-air stunts, but it's all too real (even though it's just a movie, of course).The desperate, well-armed man is Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell, from Angelina Jolie's 2014 WWII epic "Unbroken"), an ordinary working man who lost his nest egg of $60,000 after investing in a stock that Lee recommended on the air, with his usual showmanship and a little hyperbole. The day after the company loses $800,000,000, Kyle holds his gun to Lee's head and demands answers. The company's public relations COO, Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe) does a live interview with Lee, but simply spouts corporate rhetoric about a mysterious computer glitch, while CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) is MIA.As Lee wears an explosive vest which Kyle threatens to detonate, Lee and Patty use their professional talents to satisfy Kyle's demands that he be able to air his grievances publicly and try to diffuse the situation by getting him some real answers. Outside the studio, Patty has help from staffers Ron and Bree (Christopher Denham and Condola Rashad) and the police, under Captain Powell (Giancarlo Esposito from TV's "Breaking Bad" and "Revolution"), strategize. While Ron is (literally) running around town, Bree keeps an eye on the police. The NYPD bring in Kyle's girlfriend (Emily Meade) to try to talk her boyfriend down, which doesn't exactly go well, and then they hatch a risky plan, to which Lee would certainly object, if he knew about it. Diane does her level best to get Lee and Kyle the answers they seek, but is stymied by CFO Avery Goodloe (Dennis Boutsikaris) and with their mutual boss traveling and being incommunicado. The characters (and Movie Fans) eventually get some answers, but only after scenes in South Korea, Iceland and South Africa and back in the Big Apple after Camby's plane finally lands."Money Monster" is a taut and entertaining thriller. Within the film's economical running time, Foster keeps things moving and injects several lighter moments, while also managing excellent character development, which her perfectly-cast and very talented actors sell with aplomb. The script, which was developed by three different writers over the course of more than three years, features dialog that feels true, but packs an unrealistic amount of investigative success into a very narrow time frame. All this results in an indictment of some financial practices which doesn't simply trash capitalism, and a message movie which never forgets that is must entertain in order to deliver its timely message effectively.

		<shortDescription>Tension Heavy but Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster is financial crime thriller directed by Jodie Foster. It centers around Lee Gates (George Clooney) a financial reporter and Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts), his executive producer as they are in the midst of a hostage situation being run by Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell) as he attempts to get answers as to why 800 million dollars was lost by a financial company that Gates recommended everyone buy stock in. Being that the majority of the film takes place in a secluded area with our three main characters, Jodie Foster does a great job making sure that the film never feels claustrophobic. Part of this is due to the performances of George Clooney and Jack O'Connell. The two of them spend the majority of the screen time together and they have great chemistry. It almost reminded me of the strange yet surprisingly believable chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul in Breaking Bad. Throughout the hour and forty minute run length, the two of these characters have extremely development that is represented extremely well by the two of their performances. They each portray a believable character as we see under each of their fake personalities and truly digest the fact that they are just regular people.Throughout the entire film, my heart was pounding. The tension was extremely well written and directed as we are constantly worried that Budwell's thumb could slip at the slightest of moments. The movie doesn't just use one type of tension--it moves some scenes slow and other scenes are much more fast paced. But I can tell you this; throughout the whole film, I was on the edge of my seat, constantly waiting to see what would happen next. A lot of this is due to the well done pacing. The mix between humor, drama and tension made the film feel more realistic. When the movie went from drama to action based, it felt natural as opposed to being forced onto the audience for the sake of just having an action scene. Now let's get into why this film isn't phenomenal. First of all, the sheer predictability of the film. From about 10 minutes in, I knew exactly how the movie was going to end. This did take away from the film for me, as there were times that I almost wasn't nervous for the characters as the big "twist" at the end could be seen coming from a mile away. Julia Roberts was just okay in this movie. She didn't necessarily take away from the film, but she certainly didn't add to the quality of it with her performance. She felt somewhat bland at points and only had a couple of moments where she really came out to shineThe beginning 10 minutes was extremely rushed. An extra few minutes onto the film wouldn't have killed them. Instead, it probably would have helped them. Kyle is on the set within at least 5 minutes of the film and it would have been nice to have a little more introduction to Gates and to see a little more about the crash that happened with the market.Overall, I really enjoyed the film. It held my attention and had believable pacing, but the predictability did take away a far bit for me.7/10</fullReview>

I thought it was well filmed, very intense, and was a great film for character study. You love both characters and sympathize for the man who has gone bankrupt. I found this movie to build up a bond between these two characters and does it in a way that is believable. I would strongly recommend to anyone who is a fan of suspense and thriller. It is an intense thrill ride with a couple of hiccups with its predictable plot and some bad decision making.

		<shortDescription>A perfectly fine middle-budget thriller with enough on its mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a couple of things to note right up front about Money Monster, the first film directed by Jodie Foster in quite some time and reuniting Clooney and Roberts (remember them from the Ocean's Eleven flicks? or, you know, the two they were in together? good times) - first, I think it's important that if you do decide to go see this movie, see it in a theater (I'd say a matinée price works best, maybe not quite full price). It's the kind of movie that Lynda Obst has outlined in her book 'Sleepless in Hollywood' as being as something of an endangered species: the middle budget Hollywood genre movie with some big name stars and a plot that's appealing to a mass audience (so it's not quite an "indie" movie, but it's not something that crosses 100 million with elaborate special effects).Though these movies became a bit tiring (or more than a bit depending on who you are) by the early 00's, in the landscape where there's either comic book movies (Marvel, DC, etc) or comic book movies in look and tone as franchises (Fast &amp; Furious, Hunger Games, etc), a story like this where a guy holds a Jim Kramer type of cable 'news' personality and his crew hostage on live TV seems almost refreshing, at least as far as being something that's only pretense is that, you know, the economy collapsed not too long ago and confidence in things like the stock market should suck (though it seemed to have rebounded not too soon after 2008), and it's made professionally.The other thing to note here is that just because it's a highly entertaining dramatic thriller as far as the nuts-and-bolts of such a thing are put together - the actors are just right, with Roberts being the anchor for things to not get out of control as the director of the show, and even small players like Dominic West as the CEO of the company that (seemingly) screwed over Jack O'Connell's gun-and-bomb toting show hijacker, and Clooney's Clooney so that's good - it doesn't meant there aren't flaws.You've seen this before if you've seen, I don't know, Dog Day Afternoon or John Q (the latter's lessor than this but you may get an idea, the "Just hostage-taker" scenario), and even Inside Man, which featured Foster in a supporting role. Things to do with logic like the amount of security that should/would be in an area where a major cable show is being produced, or how the whole last third unfolds (and if you've seen the trailer, and it's hard to avoid it if you've been to the movies in the past few months, it shows you this section in pieces so you anticipate it) is implausible.But there's a lot of good drama to mine here, and buried underneath its quick and fast-paced plot mechanics it does have something to say about not just how the American people continually get duped into things like going for stocks (or at least the ones who can afford it or try to like O'Connell's working class character), but the power of celebrity. There's a wonderful little scene where Clooney's Lee Gates tries to dissuade this bomb-that's-going-to-go-off scenario by talking to the tens of millions (I should think more, depending on who has cable around the world, but I digress) and appeals to them to contribute money so that the stock can bulk up for the company that screwed over O'Connell's character. It's the kind of performance where it feels like a performance, but in a good way: it's self-knowing and Clooney plays up to it, and when the outcome of this happens (and it's not pleasant) the emphasis on this whole 'image' that Lee Gates has perpetuated comes back to bite him in the ass.So there's a lot of little sections that work and good character actors sprinkled throughout (Esposito, Jim Warden, John Ventimiglia), and it all boosts up what is fairly conventional and yet everything is there for the drama of this type of movie. Its even funny, in a bleak, sardonic sort of way, in a few moments (and one that's kind of weak, let's say it involves a sort of cream for your area that's, oh nevermind). I wish it was a little more strong with certain story details, but it's comforting in a way even as character yell and curse and stand-offs happen and rise and fall. Put it another way, if you want a less 'cluttered' take on stock fraud than The Big Short, look here, and if you want to spend some time away and to watch something with a few good Hollywood superstars, it's good on that end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love Julia Roberts and loved this excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cable financial guru Lee Gates (George Clooney) is in the midst of airing the latest edition of his show, "Money Monster." Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Global Capital's stock inexplicably cratered due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby (Dominic West) appear for a softball interview about the crash, but Camby unexpectedly left for a business trip in Geneva.Midway through the show, a deliveryman ambles onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Gates hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. The "deliveryman" is laborer Kyle Budwell (Jack O'Connell), who invested $60,000?his entire life savings, inherited from his deceased mother?in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company a month earlier on the show. Kyle was wiped out along with the other investors, and now wants answers. Unless he gets them, he will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver?and with it, Kyle's leverage?is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts), Lee tries to calm Kyle down and get him some answers. However, Camby is nowhere to be found, and Kyle is not satisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester (Caitriona Balfe) offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He also is not satisfied by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied by her own explanation either, and decides to contact the programmer who created the algorithm for answers, reaching a man in Seoul. The programmer insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position unless a human meddled with it.In the meantime, the police find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, seemingly taking pity on Kyle, agrees to help Kyle discover what went wrong.Once Camby arrives back in New York, Diane goes through his passport. She discovers that he didn't go to Geneva at all, but to Johannesburg. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the "Money Monster" team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to try and discover the truth. After a police sniper takes a shot at Lee and misses, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall, where Camby is headed according to Diane. They head out with one of the network's cameramen, the police, and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. They barely manage to corner Camby, and after ensuring that he will not run away, they finally confront him with the full story, with video evidence obtained by the hackers.It turns out that Camby bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in the mine while the union was on strike. If Camby's plan had succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multi-billion dollar profit when work resumed at the mine and the stock of the mine's owner rose again. However, the gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the flailing mining company. Confronted with the evidence, Camby admits his swindle. Satisfied, Kyle kills himself by allowing the police to shoot him after throwing the detonator away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WW) Worth WatchingMovie Category: Crime / Drama / Thriller?Money Monster is a fun and intense ride. It finds a really good balance between being too serious and a comedic satire. The movie has very little breathable moments. Once the movie starts just be prepared to be on the edge of your seat the whole movie. ?This movie puts a spotlight on the shenanigans that are rumored to be happening all the time in the global market / stock market investment world. This movie isn't afraid to pull back the curtain on the horrors and the tears stock investors experience from time to time. ?Jodie Foster in this movie shows that she is a force to be reckoned with in the filmmaker / director world. I can easily see her potentially joining the ranks of the Ben Affleck, and Mel Gibson. But I will need to see a little more to determine if she has a shot to get to the Ron Howard level of Actor turned Directing Legend. Acting?Both George Clooney &amp; Julia Roberts give powerful performances. Head to head if I were to decide who gave the better the performance, I would have to say Julia Roberts. She truly owned and blossomed in her character.Award Season Consideration ?Jodie Foster for (Best Director)Who Should Watch This Movie ?Fans of the stock market ?Fans of Julia and / or George ?Anyone curious to know what happens behind the scenes of a financial market TV show. ?Anyone interested in seeing the wonder that is, Jodie Foster's directing skills.MOVIE SUPREME COURT ----------- Creator / President / Film Critic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent satirical thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On January 29th, 2015, an armed man gained access to the television studio where minutes later the eight o'clock news on Dutch television should have started. A member of the technical staff was taken hostage, and the man demanded live television exposure. In the end, he was never live on television because the police was able to take control and arrest him. The recorded footage was released the next day, and can still be watched on the internet.I don't know if Money Monster's screenplay writers were aware of this historical fact. In any case, their script bears resemblance to this event. In fact, a lot of things that seem improbable in the movie, are based on reality.In Money Monster, a furious investor invades the television studio where the showman Lee Gates is hosting his money programme. The man demands apologies from Gates and from the ceo of a company whose stock has just collapsed, wiping out his mother's inheritance. It's the start of a series of spectacular events, during which some unsavoury Wall Street practices are exposed.The film is at the same time an exciting thriller and an intelligent satire on some shadowy practices in the financial world. It's one of those rare Hollywood films that are well made, highly entertaining and give you something to think about at the same time. To top it off, there are some excellent acting performances to be enjoyed. And I don't mean George Cloony or Julia Roberts, who are okay, but the unknown Jack O'Connell who plays the armed man invading the TV studio. O'Connell is perfect in capturing his despair, madness and unpredictability. Also very good is the equally unknown Emily Meade who gives a very short but extremely intense performance as the armed man's pregnant girlfriend.As a financial satire, Money Monster mainly attacks the so called high-frequency algorithmic trading. This is also the subject of Flash Boys, Michael Lewis's influential book about this new and controversial form of stock trading. Lewis also wrote The Big Short, on which another very good financial movie was based. Algorithmic trading was behind the so called 'flash crash' on may 6th, 2010. As I said, much of what you see in the movie is based on reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is one of the movies that define the word thriller! After a short slow start, the movie gets into it and explodes! I was seating at the edge of my seat for the biggest part of the movie waiting for the next thing to happen. Clooney and Roberts were phenomenal as well as the guy playing the bomber... I liked the movie from beginning to end! Really nice plot, nice filming and script and most of all, a topic that is really relevant these days. I was amazed to find out towards the end of the movie how some things work with the stock exchange. The ending was as expected, also really intense and noteworthy. I can't think of a better movie to spend your time with during this summer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What The Big Short should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Money Monster" is a pretty new American movie that deals with what happens when an unlucky investor takes hostage a famous television show host who suggested him in what he should invest and what obviously did not work out so well. The director is Oscar-winning actress Jodie Foster and the two lead actors are George Clooney and Jack O'Connell. Giancarlo Esposito, Dominic West and Julia Robert, of course, will also be known to many. The film combines the personal fate and backgrounds of the protagonists with a general take on the world of finance and with this combination, it worked pretty well I must say. I liked that the kept the film at roughly 100 minutes and that it turned out very essential as a consequence. I mentioned "The Big Short" in the title and the big problem with that film was, regardless what critics and awards bodies thought, that it was too complicated for general audiences without a big interest in the stock market. This one here does everything right to that regard and is a good watch also for everybody who is not too interested in finance.But it's not all positive I must say. The writing had a couple problems on some occasions. First of all, Roberts' character added absolutely nothing to the film I must say. Her relationship with Clooney's was underdeveloped which is not a surprise as they have almost no screen time together because of the scenario. Making the relationship work was one of the biggest challenges and they did not succeed, which makes the ending also a bit embarrassing as we simply did not care about the two characters' relationship. As a whole, the film really did not need Roberts' character. Apart from that, while it was fun to watch Clooney go shamelessly over the top and it also worked, I must say his transformation from bad guy to good guy was not really that credible. I just couldn't believe that he genuinely cared about his kidnapper. What stayed in the end is the question: Who is the money monster? Clooney's character? West's character? O'Connell's character? Ir just the entire financial structure of the planet? It's your pick to make and there is not 100% correct answer. It is probably a mix of all these aspects and characters. I recommend this movie. It is not "best of the year" material, but certainly worth watching with some nicely tense moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Clooney and Julia Roberts are two of the most watchable stars on the planet, so to have them in the same film is a treat (echoes of "Ocean's Eleven") although, given the way the story was shot, they actually spent very little time on set together. He is Lee Gates, the host of a TV programme dispensing financial advice in the brashest manner imaginable, while she is the show's director Patty Fenn, utterly professional and super cool when the set is invaded by a simple-minded investor who has lost everything and wants murderous revenge (Jack O'Connell).It's a pleasure to have a woman director (Jodie Foster) helming such a commercial proposition and, while the narrative is pretty predictable and the villain (Dominic West) somewhat cartoonish, this is a movie that hits hard at some serious targets - the financial markets who don't even understand their own algorithms and the media who rarely challenge seriously the casino economy - and does so in a work which manages to be both gripping and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more impressive than I expected from Jodie Foster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen Jodie Foster's previous three directorial movies, the best of which was Little Man Tate back in the nineties. I fully expected her to be able to follow up on that really good little picture but it's taken all this time for it to happen. The result I thought is that she's done even better than I expected with Money Monster, after the so-so Beaver. George Clooney plays Lee Gates, a t v talk show host which features the goings on in Wall Street. As I'm English, there's quite a lot of technical banter which I didn't fully understand in the first few minutes, but director Jodie Foster cleverly inserts a threatening atmosphere into the proceedings fairly soon after we are introduced to Clooney and Julia Roberts, who plays his producer. Jack O'Connell, a young British actor I haven't seen before, using an American accent, smoulders like another Tom Hardy I thought. Watch him, clearly star material. He's lost all his money investing in a bad deal on the stock market in a company run by Dominic West, a shady wheeler dealer, who has somehow managed to lose his company 800 million dollars. The film revolves around Kyle (O'Connell) loosing his cool and blaming Lee Gates (Clooney) and Dominic West for his troubles. He explodes into violence when he manages to infiltrate Clooney's TV show 'Money Monster'. What follows, I thought was a gripping 90 minutes which never really lets up, maybe a little towards the end, but I suspect Jodie Foster put that in to lighten the picture and allow some humour with the tension. It may not be heart pounding but I was still gripped throughout. Terrific acting all round by everyone, even the minor parts. As I write, it looks like the film has earned it's production cost back after a couple of weeks so I'd like to think Jodie Foster will finally achieve her dream of more directing assignments. Good luck to her, great picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greed is the Monster.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster (2016): Dir: Jodie Foster / Cast: George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jack O'Connell, Caitriona Balfe, Dominic West: Title refers to greed and how trying to get rich quick can lead to downfall. George Clooney is given the appropriately named Lee Gates, a talk show guru who gives advice and such regarding finance and stock. Julia Roberts plays his director Patty Fenn who can operate well under stress especially given her tired relationship with Gates. Jack O'Connell plays Kyle Budwell, a struggling citizen who lost $60, 000 when financial advice from Gates went sour. Investors lost over 800 million. Armed with a gun Kyle forces Gates to put on a vest with a bomb attached. Gates nervously attempts to find answers but Kyle's world only gets worse particularly when his pregnant girlfriend shows up and berates him on camera. The one other interesting role is from Caitriona Balfe who plays reporter Diane Lester who seeks answers to the financial crisis that she fears has been tampered by human interference. Directed by Jodie Foster who plays off the media fascination as well as the lack of human interest as when Gates pleads for his life in a failing bargain with viewers. The structure is pure formula and the ending is a cop out happy tease. The villain is cardboard and seems like another screenplay cop out. Clooney and Roberts fare well although their collaboration on Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was much more solid and intriguing. Theme hits upon the greed of money and how it can corrupt powerful people while damning those in need who succumb to poor choices. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really thought it was brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the trailer, I was expecting George Clooney to give us some enlighten answer, but for the most part, what Money monster does is lays out the questions so everyone can understand them.Clooney is the host of a show about the stock exchange and Julia Roberts plays his producer. The show is taken hostage by a disgruntled delivery man who lost his shirt on a stock Money monster told him was a sure thing, and does not believe that the stock going bad was glitch in the computer like the company says it was. The movie shows the rage from all sides of the equation. The average Joe who tries to do the right thing, but got screwed by everyone. There have been times when I wanted to seek revenge because I got screwed by someone who does not seem to care. And then you have Clooney's character Lee who's life is not all that's cracked up to be, Yet everyone thinks it's great. Money Monster works on so many levels and is very deep. Plus, I like how it does not preach to you a one sided view of the situation, it just lays out the situation with brutal honesty and I love that.Way to go George Clooney and Julia Roberts and Director Jodie Foster for showing and honest picture.</fullReview>

A film that demonstrates how vicious capitalism can destroy millions of people, only because one man's greed; and how the modern technology, and not only the media or network power can influence on our lives. I thought of Sidney Lumet's NETWROK all long this film, and I may remember that there were some other movies which spoke of the nearly same subject, how people are being manipulated. Pretty good society study pulled by more than convincing performances. But they should have chosen another actor for the poor Young man's character. A film that gives you a bitter ending.

		<fullReview>Just watched this thriller with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed the real-time aspects of the story of a live broadcast involving a TV economics host (George Clooney), his director (Julia Roberts), and a lowly package guy (Jack O'Connell) who holds the studio hostage because of some money he lost believing Clooney's advice some weeks ago. Director Jodie Foster gets plenty of tension during the proceedings and it mostly feels believable most of the time watching it. How much of it was realistic, well, that's for someone who knows more than I do but it certainly held both me and my friend's attention so that's a plus for us!

		<shortDescription>Money Monster (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year's The Big Short told the real-life story of the people that profited from the stock market crash in the late 2000's. It was funny, biting and just a little infuriating. Money Monster, on the other hand, goes for a simpler approach with a real-time hostage thriller. Money Monster stars George Clooney as financial TV host Lee Gates (an obvious riff on Jim Cramer from Mad Money) who is airing his latest edition of his show, you guessed it, Money Monster. Just 24 hours before, IBIS Global Capital's stock inexplicably crashed due to a glitch in a trading algorithm. A viewer of Gates' show, Kyle Budwell, loses all of his money due to a bad tip from Gates saying that IBIS' stock is "safer than your bank account." Halfway through Gates' show, Kyle gets onto the set and threatens Gates at gunpoint, forcing him to put on a bomb vest. Kyle wants answers, and if he doesn't get them, he'll blow up Gates before killing himself. Julia Roberts also stars as the show's director who attempts to get everyone out of the bomb threat from behind the scenes. Money Monster conjures up some great thrills from a reliably game cast, especially Jack O'Connell who plays 99%'er Kyle. There's also quite a bit of dark humor to give the more intense parts some edge while still not detracting from the movie's tone. It's a simple, timely and contained thriller that should give adults some respite from the myriad of PG-13 fare that is in the theaters so often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jodie Foster did a good job keeping "Money Monster" realistic and moving, and all players came across as credible, and the NYC financial district and NYPD formed a solid backdrop to the action. Clooney and Roberts put in their usual strong performances, but the standout was O'Connell. I'd also give kudos to the guy who played a TV cameraman and had some of the best lines. The action was such that the first two thirds of the film kept me at the edge of my seat. Only in the last third did the plot fall apart a bit with a overly complex explanation of the incident that provoked the rest of the story. But we'll give it a pass because the rest of the effort was so well done. A solid 7, maybe a bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent film that will connect the dots for those who couldn't follow the story line of 'The Big Short'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jodie Foster has made a wonderful entertaining and instructive film. She should be encouraged to making more and better films. She has chosen well her cast. There is chemistry between George Clooney and Julia Roberts. It's not the chemistry she had with Hugh Grant in 'Notting Hill', though. Clooney is a shill for companies on the stock exchanges or issuing IPOs. It is not to see his Lee Gates has much in common with that windbag Jim Cramer, who is still talking up buys and sells on NBC. (For elephants with longer memory, yes, the same Jim Cramer who went on TV urging his viewers to buy Bear Stearns within a week or so before it failed.) Gates is a showman, like a Liberace, but without substance. He's a good salesman, not a likable man, but he is at the pinnacle of his success. He knows how to read and give an oomph to the shopworn script a company gives him to hawk its stock. Roberts plays Patty Fenn his producer. She bright, spunky and knows how to keep Gates on message. She's the one's who pulls his strings behind the scenes, feeding him lines though an ear piece. (The idea is not new; it was used in 'Broadcast News'.) And then into this cozy formulaic format comes the talented Jack O'Connell, who plays Kyle Budwell and comes on the TV set upsetting this incestuous love fest of the media and companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ: each teasing he hard earned money from purses of the small investor and the hard working who look to make a mean life more comfortable. And then all hell breaks loose. What to many film goers produced glazed eyes in the excellent cinema version of Michael Lewis' 'The Big Short', is more accessible in Forster's 'Money Monster'. Furthermore, like Toto in 'The Wizard of Oz', it exposes the fraud committed and continues to be committed by investment banks and hedge funds. No computer glitches here; the fraud is fueled by old fashioned greed. What makes MM so on target is exposes hucksters like Gates who haven't the slightest clue as to what drives the market, the nitty gritty of the business. What say is a 'punt'? Like a trained seal, until the envelope is pushed to the maximum, might hav had a degree in economic, he didn't understand the market until his life is at stake. And even then, were it not for Fenn, resourceful and forceful, as she whispers the magic words exposing the scam on the public by a powerful corporation through an ear piece, does Gates get an up-to-speed course on algorithms and the geopolitical scheming of the giant multinational corporations. Here, it's fitting to recall Enron. And on the technical side, we see how a TV program is shot, using the camera in the same way Forster did--long shots, zooms, wide lens, so on and on. The cast is a harvest of good actors: Giancarlo Espito, the versatile Dominic West, Caitrionia Balfe, Christopher Denham and Aaron Yoo, to name a few of the fine actors. MM will make money and it should. It is intelligent, entertaining, hardly maudlin, but like TV, it is part of the news cycle and we know at the end the moral of the story is fleetingly learned until the next big scoop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Relevant as it is Scattered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you listening? It's about to get complicated. No, I'm serious, I'm talking complicated as in both theme and quality. Money Monster, directed by two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster, looks at the television series of the same name that dedicates itself to stock investment in the form of entertainment. Tens of millions of investors are tuned in to the broadcast, which famously features a big red button that makes sound effects while playing funny videos. The host of the program, Lee Gates (George Clooney) commands the screen with the mindset of money over people. In today's broadcast, his topic of interest will be the ever-rising stock of Money Monster's company, known as IBIS. Throughout the broadcast, Lee must depend on director/producer Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) as his only mode of conscious in the busy environment. At first, everything seems to be going as planned, until an unexpected guest comes in with a package. He sporadically pulls a gun out and forces the camera crew to stay on the air or else the host gets it. With a bomb vest now strapped around Lee, and the trigger to the bomb under the terrorist's control, he directs the people watching about how the corporation's stock of 800 million will be taken out by him, in an attempt to proclaim a harsh statement to the viewers about the truth surrounding their supposedly safe investment. &#x200b; Now, I don't watch the news or television nearly as much as anyone else. I couldn't even tell you anything from the last season of Game of Thrones. The only time I would run to the television screen is for a presidential debate. And you know what? Maybe Money Monster has convinced me that I am doing the right thing (I could also be referring to those embarrassing presidential debates that Fox turned into a game show, but that's beside the point). Foster's newest feature gives a strongly relevant anti-capitalist message for a time when technology makes the overthrowing of major corporations possible; although two crucial things are still missing: structure and commitment.The screenwriters Jamie Linden, Alan DiFiore, and Jim Kouf did have all the right ideas to communicate. They compare money to photons of energy and people to investments, specifically in how television enables the government to steal money and spend it carelessly. It's all true and relevant, not counting the challenge I had in receiving the message. Why's that? I'm glad you asked! Little storytelling opportunities are used with the limitless possibilities of its real- time narrative. There are several subplots that contribute to the ensemble piece feel that Foster went for, except without any structure or unity. There's also no decent arcs on any of the flatly written characters.The acting from an otherwise promising cast creates another obstacle between the message and the viewer. With names like George Clooney and Julia Roberts, you'd think that Money Monster would result in a phenomenal character study that commands the screen. Think again. Rather, these two washed-up Hollywood names draw back on tension that would have otherwise left you leaning on edge. George by now has lost his mojo as an actor as he plays the usual hectic businessman who disrespects everyone, just like every other role Clooney has ever played. Julia doesn't have any enthusiasm either, as if she no longer gives a hoot about restoring her career (don't believe me? Watch Mother's Day). The terrorist played by Jack O'Connell cashes it in as well, considering it was nearly impossible for me to make out his words on top of his screaming.Yet the biggest blame of the message getting lost under the gaping flaws goes to the director herself, Jodie Foster. Most of her resume in directing has been with television programs such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Now she has created a feature of similar genre and subject matter that sparks back to the old approach on these political thrillers of the 1970's-1980's that general audiences could understand. Some good efforts were made with a cool overall green tone to the news room and a tense techno soundtrack, and the tension does redeem itself by the third act, but Foster does not do enough to acutely express her beliefs on the media.Now, I ought to applaud Foster for her efforts, as these types of movies absolutely need to be made to warn us the dangers of giving ourselves into corporations who are merely after our money. She has the right of mind in telling us how we are responsible for their financial success, and that we ought to start thinking about our investments for once. We especially need to keep this in mind be it Donald Trump wins the presidential election, or Clinton, or Sanders. But honestly, if you want to see this same type of message done right, watch Network, a satire on the whoring that television has become, or The Big Short, a recent commentary on the corruption of modern-day banking. With Money Monster, you mostly think to yourself as you're watching it, "what could I have done differently if I sat in the director's chair?" It may not be the wake-up call we need right now, but with more searching as to what's available, you will surely find the perfect satire on America's money monsters. &#x200b; Overall Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hostage situation arises when a broke investor infiltrates a financial advice show during a live broadcast in this riveting thriller from the directing hand of Jodie Foster. A change of pace from her previous directing outing ('The Beaver'), Foster uses her acting experience in thrillers from the likes of Neil Jordan and David Fincher to craft an encapsulating ride. The film is not all thrills and chills though; it actually begins as a comedy with George Clooney as a goofy TV host caricature and some wacky humour involving erectile cream, and there is something pointed in how the entire first fifteen minutes play out comically until the TV show crew realise that the stranger who has wandered onto their set is a real threat. While the remaining eighty minutes are more serious, there is still a perfect dose of comic relief to prevent things turning too grim, and it is not Clooney or big name co-stars Julia Roberts and Jack O'Connell who get the laughs, but rather Christopher Denham and Lenny Venito as two dedicated crewmen. Not to dwell on the comedy side too much, the film has some interesting ideas and messages too - not so much in terms of Wall Street corruption and greed (all of this is quite routine) but rather in terms of the relationship between the media and viewers; the hijacked live broadcast quickly becomes a media circus with those in pubs and restaurants across the country reacting in varying ways to everything panning out. If the film has one distinct vice, it is a lack of likable characters. While Clooney gains some integrity during the course of the film, he still seems despicable overall, while Connell seems more pathetic than sympathetic for relying on his advice. Roberts does have a few good, human moments as the show director, and there is something potent in how the hijacking forces her to reexamine her relationship with Clooney. Whatever the case, this is more interesting than the somewhat mixed reviews out there might suggest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B-grade thriller with A-grade decoration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dressed up as a cautionary tale about financial greed and wealth dispersion, Jodie Foster's latest directorial effort is really just a popcorn thriller attempting to be more meaningful than it needs to be. Batting above its weight with the Hollywood royalty involved, the film feels most at home when it is building anticipation purely by observing the lead trio reacting within the confines of the hostage scenario. When it strays too far from the beaten path to half-heartedly explore its underlying themes, it comes across as smug, overly moralistic and a tad patronising, bogging down the otherwise fast-paced narrative. There's a surprisingly prevalent comedic through-line embedded into the movie's tone as well, the moments of levity largely working except for the occasionally misplaced gag that undermines the tension. Tinseltown heavyweights George Clooney and Julia Roberts are clearly having a blast in their undemanding roles, the former hamming it up as an arrogant TV show host and the latter playing it cool-as-a-cucumber as the show's omnipresent producer. Intense up-and-comer Jack O'Connell overplays it as the average Joe who decides to hold the wealthy accountable for their deceit, but at least he's given something to do, unlike Dominic West's rote corporate baddie. A B-grade thriller with A-grade decoration, Money Monster is adequate in-the-moment entertainment but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Money is everything, and unfortunately for Kyle Budwell and many other Americans the rich white man has taken that from their poor little hands once again. Money Monster tells the story of a man who loses everything thanks to a "glitch" in the stocks of a big corporation (or so they say) and so takes talk show host, Lee Gates hostage on live TV all to find out wtf happened to his money.The acting was great. George Clooney plays the George Clooneyish character who is no stranger to busting out a few moves. Julia Roberts excellently portrays a director who deals with the hostage situation scarily well, as if by doing her high pressure job she has been prepared for this moment her whole career. An finally, but by no means least, Jack O'Connel brilliantly plays the tortured soul of Kyle Budwell, an average guy who has just had enough of big business stealing all your money, a character i'm sure many could relate to and get behind even Lee Gates himself.The hostage situation plot was really tense but that tension is sadly broken at points when the film cuts away to Gus Fring and the rest of the idiotic police force. This is where the film prevents itself from reaching its full potential, if only the film stayed put in the studio or at least focused solely on Roberts, Clooney and O'Connel the film could have been amazing.One of the main messages of the film that I particularly found interesting was how dangerous the American police can be. Seriously when the best plan the police can come up with is literally "lets shoot the hostage and pray that he survives" you know they are incompetent. They also demand that they negotiate with Kyle even when he starts shooting because of that. They just keep on putting people in danger and at the end, once they shoot Kyle in the chest, do they apply pressure to the wound or try and help him in anyway? Nope they simply roll him over and handcuff him which left me physically angry thinking "Are you serious? The guy is literally dying on the floor and they handcuff him? He could have potentially been saved if you tried something."Overall Money Monster is a well acted but OK thriller that I felt held itself back from achieving its full potential. The police are frustratingly bad and in doing so speak volumes about the NYPD. Technology and Money are everything in today's world and Money Monster satirises this rather well throughout, as well as how greedy CEO's commit fraud and ruin the lives of the less fortunate. The things people do for a little bit of dosh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Academy award winning actress Jodie Foster's directorial venture Money Monster premiered in India and US yesterday. This movie features George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Jack O'Connell. This is a crime thriller which deals with stock market investments. George Clooney plays Lee Gates, a financial reporter who hosts the live TV show Money Monster while Julia Roberts plays Patty Fenn, the show's director. Movie starts off with the preparation for one of those live shows by Gates and few minutes into the movie, we see that Gates is suddenly taken hostage by Kyle Budwell played by Jack O'Connell who comes in posing as delivery man. Actually Kyle holds Gates responsible for his loss in stock market and he wants an explanation from Gates as what really happened. What is the reason for the loss and who is responsible or is it really a loss to the investors or it is some kind of hushed up scandal is told in an interesting and understandable fashion. Generally movies dealing with stock market will be difficult to understand for audiences but this movie seems to be quite straight for which we need to thank the screen writers and director Jodie Foster. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique provides the necessary support to director Foster's vision. Serious movie lovers will definitely enjoy this hostage thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the reboots and remakes and sequels where - fans and critics alike - are complaining about the lack of creativity and/or originality in Hollywood today, I really don't get the lukewarm reception this movie is getting. Certainly It's not perfect. But this is a new, creative concept IMO. This is a very fluid story that flows very well. And all the great humor was very unexpected. There are only a few big laughs, but it is chock full of great sarcastic one-liners(some may not be big fans of this like I am). The acting and direction was all solid - nothing spectacular. And if featured political/social themes that are both very relevant and somewhat thought- provoking. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misplaced Humor and Lack of Subtly Hinder an Otherwise Well-Acted and Thought Provoking Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Money Monster falls victim to the same sort of problems that the TV show in the film does, it has many moving parts that don't work as a cohesive product if they aren't all working well together. While it has many things to say about our current world, it lacks the subtly and a consistent tone to really hit home on the ideas that director Jodie Foster sets out to propose.Money Monster focuses on Lee Gates' show of the same name and the dire circumstances the show-runners find themselves in when an investor attempts to take over the show and take hostages. The film has plenty of good things working on its' side, including incredible talent on and off screen. George Clooney and Julia Roberts lead the cast as the host and director of 'Money Monster' respectively, while Jack O'Connell plays the upset investor, Kyle Budwell.O'Connell is the clear standout, which is starting to become a sentence I frequently use. As extreme as he takes this situation coming from his inner frustration, there are moments where you feel legitimate sorrow and pity towards Budwell. Foster tries to play with those emotions of ours perhaps one too many times, but there's no denying they are there.Another thing the film does well is its pacing. The entire runtime deals with the hostage at the 'Money Monster' TV show, and it managed to keep my attention throughout. I was always invested as to what would happen next, so Foster deserves some credit for that. Unfortunately, she also throws in a ton of unnecessary comedy without any subtly whatsoever. Comic relief is usually welcome, but I never felt like this story called for it. When people are on the verge of dying, I don't want the scene to cut to someone making sexual jokes or being caught in the act. Both happened during the course of the film.So while Money Monster has some intriguing things to say about questioning authority and where your money is coming from, which I can appreciate, it lacked the full package in order to feel the true impact of a horrible situation. However, with the performances of O'Connell and the rest of the cast, there's more than enough here to make this a movie worth checking out.+O'Connell once again kills it+Things to say about Wall Street+Pacing-Lacks subtly-Humor doesn't fit6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Adam McKay and Michael Lewis sought to educate us on the corruption and deceit within the marrow of the financial world. Director Jodie Foster and three writers (Jim Kouf, Alan DiFiore, Jamie Linden) scale things way back to show the effects on a single, working class man ? and how Wall Street and the media conspire to make it hard on us little guys.George Clooney stars as Lee Gates, a Jim Cramer type cable news financial guru ? the kind of media star who makes an Apollo Creed style entrance (complete with "dancing") for each segment. Julia Roberts plays Patty, the show's ultra-talented producer, and the one who keeps Gates and the show from flying off the rails. It's just another typically hectic day in the studio, when the show is abruptly interrupted by a man who charges the stage pointing a gun at Gates. Kyle (Jack O'Connell, Unbroken) has a few things to get off his chest, and makes it clear that he blames Gates for a recent financial loss ? and he expects some answers.It turns out that Gates had presented a recent investment as a sure thing, and Kyle believed him. When that company lost $800 million overnight, Kyle's loss was his $60,000 nest egg. Kyle represents the work-class folks who are simply fed up with the lies and manipulation for which the media and Wall Street seeming conspire on a regular basis.It's Jodie Foster's first directorial outing since The Beaver (2011), and she seems at home with a straight-forward hostage-for-admission story. Created for a mass audience (no segment or issue goes too deep), there are snippets of Clooney and Roberts humor that will satisfy their fans. The three most interesting characters are the gun-wielding, end-of-the rope Kyle; his PO'd-with-a-twist girlfriend played by Emily Meade (who provides the film a lift when it's needed); and Caitriona Balfe as Diane Lester, the communications officer for the evil corporation at the heart of the swindle.As with so many things these days, the hostage ordeal plays out on TV and captures the limited attention span of average Americans ? heck, the film even references the OJ Simpson event. Of course, this film isn't an instigator, but rather an exhibitor ? a mirror of the times. Once the spectacle ends, everyone returns to their normal activities.Since this thriller really only offers a few moments of real suspense, viewers might have more fun spotting and identifying the multitude of cable TV faces sprinkled throughout. The 1970's were the era for extraordinary conspiracy movies, and this one is less Network or Chinatown, and more like Phone Booth or John Q. 'Forget it Kyle. It's Wall Street (and cable news).'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Clooney and Julia Roberts are very good as usual. The movie itself felt shallow to me or at least not as complex as I was expecting it to be. It's a very basic film with no real surprises and not much depth. The hostage taker is indeed the basic angry moron that the trailers make him out to be. As pure Hollywood norm, Wall Street and big money are the heartless bad guys and the Stock Market is rooted in evil. Yet despite the hypocrisy (as if Clooney and Roberts are diversified heavily in stocks) and the clichés, the events in the TV studio are captivating and intense. Place logic aside and it really is quite entertaining. The movie definitely loses steam when it breaks from the tension of the studio/live hostage situation setting.Overall, it's entertaining enough to overlook all the flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Money Monster", starring George Clooney-Tomorrowland, Three Kings; Julia Roberts-Secret in Their Eyes, Hook; Jack O'Connell- Unbroken, 300:Rise of an Empire and Dominic West-John Carter, Punisher:War Zone.This is a conspiracy thriller about Wall Street and how people can be affected by investing in the stock market. It's directed by Jodie Foster, who also directed The Beaver, Home For the Holidays and Little Man Tate, besides being an actress herself. George plays a rather animated host of a TV financial show that gives out investing tips, usually wearing costumes and dancing around on his set. The name of his show is Money Monster. Julia is his producer on the show. One day, during a live show, Jack sneaks on set and takes George hostage-he straps a bomb vest to him and holds the detonator in his hand. Jack says that he took a stock investing tip from George and lost all of his money-Jack's pregnant girlfriend was pretty ticked off, to say the least. Dominic plays the head of the company that Jack invested his savings into, which was doing fine at the time he invested, but then lost $800 million because of a 'glitch'. There are some tense scenes as Jack tries to discover exactly what a 'glitch' is. Jack just wants to know what really happened. It's rated "R" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 38 minutes. I wouldn't buy it on DVD-one viewing is plenty-but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie. It has some strong dramatic moments, but fails to sustain a high level of tension. The premise is good. It's just that it becomes stagy with a weak ending. That's too bad because the movie contains some strong performances. Julia Roberts provides the strongest performance as the television director who does not bail out. George Clooney is also good as the TV celebrity who has to come to term with the fact that he is a sham. The problem with the movie is the man who plays the gunman. There is just too much overacting. And the dialog between him and his girlfriend is forced, contrived and corny. The movie is critical of the ethics of television reporting that packages advice in the form of entertainment and then refuses to take responsibility for the consequences. That's serious. Unfortunately, the stagy production and cheesy dialog transforms this movie into a interesting but tepid polemic on the evils of unfettered capitalism. That people got hurt is reduced to an unfortunate afterthought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that cannot make up its mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lee Gates (George Clooney) hosts a hugely popular stock market television show under the bombastic title of Money Monster. The film begins with Lee, the show's director Patty Fenn (Julia Roberts) and other crew getting ready to roll out a new show. The day before, shares of Ibis Clear Capital recommended as a hot tip on the show, had tanked leaving many investors collectively poorer by $800 million. One of the most affected investor is Kyle Budwell, who has lost his entire inheritance of $60000 on the stock. Kyle sneaks into the studio disguised as a delivery boy, pulls out a gun and straps an explosives laden jacket on Lee and threatens to press the detonator. Lee tries to calm down Kyle with the explanation that the stock fell due to a technical glitch in the trading algorithm. So far so good!But the plot takes a bizarre twist after the remarkable opening and we discover that the glitch is not the real villain after all. And that knocks the stuffing out of what promised to be a fine spoof on the stock market shows. The film turns unrecognisably worse as the director Jodie Foster now works overtime to reinstate Lee as a hero with a heart of gold. Within a span of 100 minutes, Lee Gates has turned from comedian to villain to hero and the transformation is not pleasant to watch. It makes even Patty squirm.The problem with the film is that it cannot make up its mind about what it wants to be ? a spoof or a detective thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Go Far Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "tricked" comes to mind when thinking of Money Monster. It's a movie that certainly sells itself as a strong indictment of Wall Street's greed culture and the media's complicity in said greed. But something happened on the way to the cinema. The film isn't just satisfied with pointing out and admonishing the well shellacked villains for hire at our financial institutions, it wants us, the viewer to understand our roll when we trade penny slots for penny stocks. Okay movie, I smell what you're stepping in, I just wish your tracks weren't so messy, muddy and awkward.Lee Gates (Clooney) is the loud, flamboyant, bratty host of Money Monster, a cable news network financial show that explains the markets to twits complacent enough to watch. He and lead show-runner Patty Fenn (Roberts) have a symbiotic relationship based on witty banter and friendly professional animosity. The show starts out with much needed exposition on financial firm Ibis headed by squeaky-clean CEO Walt Camby (West). We then get our first good look at Kyle (O'Connell) a delivery handler with a grudge and a vest full of C4. He holds the show and its unwilling host hostage, refusing to defuse the bomb until Ibis answers for an $80 million algorithm glitch that carried off Kyle's life savings.Much of the movie puts the excitable Kyle and savvy Lee at odds with each other as Kyle spouts the same half-formed, "feel the Bern" prophecies you see everywhere on the internet. Lee interjects with knee-jerk defenses and in some cases ire inducing school-yard bullying. So much so that we become intimately acquainted with Patty's safe word to get him to shut up (the word is Sacajawea). They stall, and stall, and stall some more as producers, assistants, Ibis decision-makers and the police all set up for a long siege; all of which is on air for millions to see.Money Monster literally lifts all of it's major story beats from Dog Day Afternoon (1975) only replace the masterful work of Al Pacino into the one-note clamminess of Jack O'Connell and replace the chants of "Attica" with "Occupy Wall Street". It'd be one thing if the film defined itself by the populist fervor it uses as a plot device. The Big Short (2015) did so with vitriolic glee becoming one of last year's finest films. Yet while wearing it's left-of-center themes like dainty candy-wrapping, Money Maker simply fails to rise above it's by the numbers hostage premise.And it's not for lack of trying either. When Camby is exposed for the Capra-esque villain he is, the audience is meant to feel a sense of completion, yet that catharsis quickly dissipates when we realize the movie exposes one isolated incident while ignoring institutional problems. Not only does the film leave you without answers, but denies you the very tools you need to ask the right questions. It instead insists that unless we all collectively get off our smartphones and put a gun to their heads, the media isn't going to investigate fraud which kind of undermines the whole idea of a free press when you really think about it.The movie saves its biggest gripes for a contrived third act showdown, laying the groundwork with Kyle's singular imbecility. during this time we're exposed to the failings of modern day sensationalism as crowds converge, chant and otherwise act like sycophants. Again, while the theme of greed being the byproduct of a tacitly approving and permanently distracted populous may seem near-poignant, it has not only been done better before but feels a lot like pandering in Money Monster.I will give it up for the marketing team behind this film. Utilizing the recognizable faces of it's talented cast and leaning heavily on its tertiary themes, people won't know they're walking into the tired clichés of a Taking of Pelham 123 (2009) re-tread (yes I'm aware it's a remake). Some may even walk out thinking they saw a movie that matched the level of anger they have towards a rigged system. Thing is if you knew all the stuff investment firms, hedge funds and banks actually do and do legally, you'd want that anger meter to be dialed up to eleven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a failure to realize its full potential and become something like this decade's "Inside Man", which ironically Jodie Foster stars in and from which the film clearly takes a page or two, "Money Monster"is a fine thriller that doesn't run too low on adrenaline or surprise and even manages to squeeze in some genuine commentary and emotion.What the film has to be commended for is for not presenting an easy way out of things. It presents an enormous amount of ideas and moralities and doesn't cheapen things to black and white. The fact is that this variety and complexity of points of views isn't brought to the screen in the most organic way. If you compare every story beat to a brick in a wall I'd say the wall stands up overall because of a major presence of strong bricks in it, but it is repeatedly undermined by the lesser, but notable percentage of weaker beats.Many times when you think the film has finally won you over, in comes something, an out of place action or a character, that really takes you out of the groove. Yet, also the exact opposite is true: for every time I thought the movie just did something that it wouldn't be able to recover from, in came a new twist that sparked my interest again. What it ultimately comes down to is the fact that the screenplay always keeps giving some new challenge to the characters or the audience, it is relentlessly paced and so despite the fact that some don't work, the majority do and it is always fresh enough for the viewer to put aside what is not working and focus on the interesting parts.Talking about the parts that don't work, I noticed the film does a little too much spoon feeding to the audience. Sometimes situations aren't given a chance to breathe and make the editing do the storytelling and we are fed exposition by characters or the characters themselves overcome an obstacle or further the story by coincidence and you aren't really sold on why some of the stuff that's happening is happening. That's the inherent problem of the film, which it never overcomes, you are never 100% free of doubt or hesitation on character motivation or plot developments and that deeply undermines the overall structure of the thriller. All the problematic parts arise because of a lack of subtlety in them.That is frustrating when you consider the fact that there is a lot subtlety in the film which works and which ultimately makes this a good ride. When it is not preaching to you the film really has it, characters, performances, Jack O'Connel is really great in this, cinematography, script, these elements are all in good place. As I said before, the majority of the moral issues that are presented to you work because they are all in the subtext of what is going on, those parts make for a thrilling watch, it's when it got too on the nose that it really bothered me.I loved the setup, the cast, the conversation it brought up, the tight pace, I just wish it could have trusted the audience a little more and focused on less fancy material at times to bring a more complete film together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun story ruined by horrendous characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know that film makers often like to put their personal political views into their films. Some do it subtly, others make it glaringly obviously. Jodie Foster it would seem takes the latter route. 'Money Monster' is so incredibly in your face with its agenda, that it actually becomes distracting and ruins what could have been an otherwise very effective thriller. The story is fun and creates a bit of a 'Collateral' type situation. Unlike that movie however, every character is so unlikable that you just find yourself frustrated and annoyed by the whole thing.George Clooney plays the lead role. If they were looking for the most smug actor possible to play the role, well let's be honest, they couldn't have done a better casting job. His character is supposed to go on an arc, from unbearable television host, to lovable hero who learns humility in the space of 90 minutes. I'm not buying it, and any audience members with half a brain won't either. Julia Roberts is also in the film, but I have no idea why. Have her stocks (sorry) really fallen that far that she has to take nothing roles in films, simply so that there is a female in the cast? She won an Academy Award, yet now she is reduced to roles like this. Finally, Jack O'Connell completes the trio of leads. He plays it adequately enough, but his character makes no sense at all. If you stop and think about it for a second his character is an idiot, who is taking his own mistakes out on other people (even shooting one of them), and yet is supposedly the hero by the end of the movie. Foster needs to take a good hard look in the mirror and ask herself just what exactly she believes the difference between right and wrong is.The thing that makes all this forgivable, is that it never stops being entertaining. The pacing is good and no scene ever drags. One piece of advice I'll offer is avoid the trailer before seeing it if possible, as it pretty much gives away the entire film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been an insightful move into how the stock market is manipulated by algorithms, the media, corporations, governments and insider trading. Yet the movie simply descended into cheap, tension-free farce. Then you have pushy Julia Roberts to transform a merely mediocre movie into a truly ghastly movie. And her upside-down (loud) mouth is a distraction. Certain characters such as the girlfriend seemed to behave in ugly ways that were convenient to the dire script but unconvincing. Then near the end one of the characters makes a confession that dissipates any tension left from the premise, and cheapens all that went before. The joke is on us. We are even neutral about the villain as he's just a minor character on a scam. The movie mocks him and we're supposed feel schadenfreude but we are indifferent to the plight of a stranger. The movie attempts to manipulate our emotions, but fails completely as we are dealing with shallow, self-absorbed characters. This is yet another soul-destroying, desolate, by the numbers Hollywood movie. As for plot holes, let's start with a major TV studio that has security that any old dodgy looking geezer can circumvent, and that's just the start. There are a hundred oh-so-convenient plot devices. The movie is a rip-off, designed to make monster money for old rope (and I'm not just talking about the leads).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Money Monster" (2016 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Lee Gates (played by George Clooney), the host of a CNN-like program called Money Monster. As the movie opens, we see Lee and his producer Patty Fenn (played by Julia Roberts) getting ready for another show, with just minutes to go. The hot topic is the tanking of the stock of a company called IBIS, costing investors $800 million just like that in a single day. Then, just as the program starts and Lee telling his TV audience "you don't have a clue where your money is!", a delivery guy--we later learn his name is Kyle--(played by Jack O'Connell) manages to sneak in the building and gets all the way to the live stage, where he takes Gates hostage and threatens to kill him if the live feed of the program is interrupted. At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is the long-awaited return of actress Jodie Foster's directing (the last she directed was "The Beaver" in 2011 starring Mel Gibson). Here she tackles the hot topic of these times, namely corporate malfeasance and the resulting further widening gulf of inequality. Basically the movie is two things in one: there is the hostage drama and how all of that will play out, and then there is the bad stuff that happened at IBIS. AAs to the hostage drama, O'Connor's rants grow tired pretty quickly, at least for me. Way too much yelling and screaming over and over again. Julia Roberts as the program director who is keeping cool and controlled under taxing circumstances gets the better of everyone here. As to the corporate malfeasance, it is dreadfully over-simplified, so much so in fact that it gets uncovered and solved in about half an hour of real time (the movie runs pretty much in current time), I am not kidding. If you want to really get mad at what is happening on Wall Street, go see "The Big Short" from late last year, that will get your blood boiling! Here, we get to enjoy the obvious on-screen chemistry of Clooney and Roberts, and that's about it unfortunately. Bottom line: this is not a 'bad' movie per se but I walked out from the theater disappointed by this. It proves once again that it doesn't matter how much talent is on the screen (which there certainly is in this movie), if the underlying script is weak, the stars can't do anything either. Thankfully the movie is not all that long, so it flew by in no time."Money Madness" opened nationwide this past weekend, and did okay (not great, not bad) at the box office. The weekday evening screening where I saw this at was surprisingly well attended, certainly for a weekday. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently has a rating of 54%, which is okay (not great, not bad). The word 'okay' seems to define this movie pretty much: "Money Monster" is not a bad movie, it's not a great movie either, it is just okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not like it.. Spoiler ALERT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this could be a clever movie, where I could be truly engaged watching the tricks and twists about those stock market/wall street but I was disappointed.. Nothing special about this movie.. Its just a simple plot about a guy, Kyle Budwell (Jack O'connel) who lost all his money on an investment...so he decided to hold hostage Lee Gates, (George Clooney) a TV show host/financial guru and wants the TV station to broadcast everything so he can get an explanation from the company he invested in.Patty Fenn(Julia Robert) is the producer of the show that helps Clooney and the rest of the crew get through this..it was not a strong character played by Robert even anyone could play it... But obviously she was cast as a crowd puller along with Clooney..I keep waiting for anything interesting but thats all about it.. The acting was average.. there is no likable character in this movie.. Maybe Lenny the cameraman and Diane is a bit likable.. I did not laugh at any of the jokes in this movie.. I only feel some sympathy to Kyle towards the end of the movie and Clooney seemed believable as a guy who learn to be more empathy after all this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Money Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With last year's Secret in Their Eyes and this year's Money Monster (my latest review), Julia Roberts has managed to truly become a nettlesome screen presence. Yes we all know she won an Oscar. But scene after scene of her talking in George Clooney's earpiece (he plays a boob tube host, she plays his executive producer) literally feels like nails on a chalkboard. She's part of the problem, not the solution. Oh I almost forgot, her Secret in Their Eyes and "Monster" also translate into all things USA Network (that means they feel made for TV). Hmm, that can't be good.Anyway, Money Monster with its reminisce of The Truman Show (reality television) and 2002's Phone Booth (similar running times along with the whole hostage diegesis thing), is directed by famed actress Jodie Foster. She has made four films of which I haven't seen the other three. Whereas "Truman Show" and "Booth" had a sizable amount of suspense and absorbing moments, "Monster" fails to generate any real tension. Hey, it's not all Foster's fault. She moves things along at a decent clip and the editing by Matt Chesse (World War Z, Machine Gun Preacher) allows the film to sort of earn its minimal twists and turns. No the complications here arise from the silly overacting of the antagonist (Jack O'Connell as Kyle Budwell), the silly overacting of his pregnant girlfriend (played by Emily Meade), the injection of out of place humor, the extras in "Monster" that seem expressionless, and of course, Roberts. In all honesty, this is a thriller and I should have left the theater shaken. Instead, my fingernails were intact, my resting heart rate perceived to be like 60, and I just felt a little meh. Result: A mediocre flick that feels slightly dated.Taking place in New York City and presented by TriStar Pictures, Money Monster chronicles television personality, Lee Gates (Clooney). He anchors a show called well, "Money Monster". During one of Lee's live broadcasts, a poverty-ridden, disgruntled investor (Kyle Budwell) infiltrates the set and puts a gun to Lee's head (talk about a weak security detail). He wants answers and demands that the cameras keep rolling. He then puts an explosive belt (or vest) on Gates and tells him that if he lets go of the trigger, Gates will blow up along with everyone else in the building. You see Gates gave Budwell some bad investment tips a while ago. Budwell lost all his savings on the advice of a broadcast where Gates told his audience to put all their dough into IBIS stocks (it's a fictional company I guess). Watch for a couple of segments where the 55-year-old Clooney dances to some rap music at the beginning of his show (I gotta admit, it's pretty cringe-inducing). Also, look out for amusing references to YouTube and a screenplay (by three writers) littered with almost nothing but the F word.In conclusion, you know the Food Network host that constantly says the approving phrase, "that's money" (in case you've been living in a cave, it's Guy Fieri). Well in terms of 2016's Money Monster, "money" it surely ain't. Rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**Somewhat Thriller ,Somewhere Predictable.**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie yesterday and here I'm come up with new review.Yes that's exactly what I'm taking about Money Monster,it is predictable.You can see the end of the movie from miles away. The financial thriller directed by Jodie Foster (Silence of the Lamb star), tried to put some extraordinary but she failed to do that.The movie starts from the show named Money Moster hosted by Lee Gates( George Clooney) who gives advice about picking stocks and on the other hand Patty Fenn(Julia Roberts) in supporting role who is the TV director of the show Money Moster ,but the movie mainly focused on two protagonist first is Lee Gates and second one is Kyle Budwell( Jack O'Connell). At one show Lee Gates had pushed people to pick a stock of a company whose shares gone plummet and causing a loss of $800 million.Thus the truck driver(Kyle Budwell)was devastated after losing his every single penny(savings) in that meltdown that was advised by the Gates.So withhold the Grudges into his heart Kyle created the situation of hostage and takes over the studio with gun point (he makes captive to Gates).And he wants Gates to give apologize to those ordinary people with whom he(Lee Gates) told them to invest.Despite the movie was bad directed The Clooney and O'Connell gave their best as they always do.We always appreciate their acting.We also have pretty woman in this movie (Juila Roberts)who acted not as perfectly as people thinks she did,her only job to do is handling Lee Gates with ear piece her appearance only make you feel like nails on the chalkboard.For this oversimplified financial drama thriller,who fails to make people sit straight. I will give 5 out of 10 (because of unanswered question i.e how can a person take a gun along with bomb vest breach out the security and take over the studio all his own?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chemistry avoided</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the potential chemistry that Clooney and Roberts could generate, what's the point of a film that keeps them physically separated by a control booth window for the bulk of the movie? It looks as though their separate shooting schedules didn't coordinate and they both played their parts in the absence of the other lead. The movie fails to generation much tension in the audience; the plot goes about where you expected it would, especially after one important detail about the bomb is dropped too early. Think of a movie with Tracy and Hepburn living out separate existences until the last reel. That's pretty much the problem here. You can't have any chemistry of the two essential elements of the compound don't react with each other. Very mild time-burner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wall Street meets "The China Syndrome"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever hear stories about bad TV sitcoms remaking episodes of older, worse sitcoms simply by changing the scripts some?Well, somewhere, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas are either outraged or delighted upon hearing Julia Roberts and George Clooney have remade their 1979 nuclear panic classic, "The China Syndrome." Too bad they transformed it into a really bad parable about contemporary financial angst in "Money Monster.""China Syndrome," for those unaware or too young to know, was Fonda's dramatic entry into the debate over the risks of nuclear-based power plants. Fonda was a reporter, and Douglas, her photographer, with Jack Lemmon playing the antihero within a corrupt power company. "Syndrome" drew directly from great public trepidation about the safety of nuclear power; "Money Monster" tells precisely the same story (right down to several specific visual elements) against a financial corruption backdrop; it makes Roberts a TV producer, Clooney a TV stock market henchman (an outrageous and some times embarrassing rip-off of CNBC's Jim Cramer), with the antihero played by the lesser-known Jack O'Connell. O'Connell sets this ball rolling by taking Clooney's character hostage on live TV and demanding "answers" following a financial meltdown arising from a "glitch" in one company's computerized market trading algorithms.On its own, "Money Monster" wavers from contemporary morality play to dumb, overplayed semi-comedy crime drama as its story unfolds. Clooney moves from the self-absorbed TV host to a clown more in the vein of his character from "O Brother, Where Art Thou"; but at least "Monster" gives the audience a few uncomfortable laughs - more than can be said of Clooney's abominably unfunny comedy, "Hail, Caesar." Roberts gives a few fleeting moments of credibility, but seems to phone in half of a performance when it's evident her character's primary role is to toss out TV producer jargon at regular intervals. You can't even bank on the Clooney-Roberts chemistry to help "Monster"; they're barely on screen together until the very end, and by then it doesn't really matter anymore.There are the requisite dumb cops, incompetent police response teams, even geeky, stereotypical hackers mixed in to "Monster's" play all to force the point that only Clooney and Roberts can resolve the bad- guy answers the film demands. And we'll leave the answers - and the ending - to the viewer.... ...Unless they just want to catch a copy of "China Syndrome," and save themselves the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chasing the Money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched the trailer I was in two minds about this film. First of all it was pretty clear that it was a hostage taker drama, and if it was just that I probably would have consigned it to the dustbin of history. However, since the drama was about a man who had lost all of his money by taking some financial advice, and that the film involved investigating why this particular company crashed it did grab my interest. However, after sitting through this film for an hour and a half in the end I simply left thinking that this was little more than your typical hostage drama with little to no real substance.Sure, the film is about the dodgy dealings that go on in the financial markets, and that even though a company claims to be transparent, in many cases this transparency is little more than a lie. However, while this may be the case with the current system, the film really didn't deliver any huge punches and I left the film wondering whether spending that hour and a half sitting in the cinema was really worth that time when I could have actually been doing something else. Still, I've seen the film, so I can chalk it up at that.Anyway, the film is about this financial television host, Lee Gates, who runs a daily investment show. However one of the companies that he recommended crashed due to a glitch in its trading algorithm. The other protagonist, Kyle Budwell, is an ordinary guy on minimum wage who came into some money, and on the advice of Gates, invested all of his money into this stock only to discover his entire savings vanished. So he decides to take matters into his own hands and storms the television studio seeking answers.Sure, this film tries to expose the lies and deceit that operates behind the opacity of the financial markets, but in reality anybody who invests all of their money into a stock based upon the recommendation of a guy on television is basically an idiot. Even the paid financial services (and people pay a pretty penny to get good financial advice) can be dodgy and the adviser acting out of their own self-interest. However I would baulk at any form of financial advice that comes freely, namely because financial advice costs money. However, that is beside the point because it was clear that this television show was basically entertainment, despite the fact that the lowest common denominator no doubt would be attracted to the glitz and glamour that is television financial advise.As I have suggested, this film is pretty dull, and in the end is little more than a stock standard hostage taker drama. Unless you enjoy that type of film, then I suggest you save your time for something a little more intriguing, and doesn't use the glitz and glamour to try and make a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money Monster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Money Monster started out as a very well done thriller, the third act differs greatly from its original theme, by giving the film a very blatant political agenda. While I don't mind films that push ideas and philosophies (in fact I believe that it is very important to stand behind something), but the climax of this film was not only very unbelievable, it differed so greatly from the feel of the first half of the movie it felt very strained. George Clooney does an acceptable job in the lead role, but I never felt that Julia Roberts did anything to progress the story. Jack O'Connell was probably the only performer who did anything to stand out, though it didn't take much. Much of the script was unnecessary, it felt longer than it needed to be, and there were more than a few times where I wondered if the film really needed a certain scene. In most cases I don't think they did. Sadly though, I think my biggest disappointment was that it started out with such a grand idea, and such a gripping beginning that I expected more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not believe TV hosts or for that matter movie stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a way the movie is realistic. It shows the culpability of everybody. Those idiots who believe these TV show hosts who promise them heaven on earth if they part with their money, are as culpable as those who take their money or those who help the white collar crime bosses, i.e. hedge fund managers by promoting their agenda.Over the decades I tried several times to like cable TV and ended up each time canceling the service because I saw no reason to pay money for the stuff offered. That leaves me with antenna TV where I occasionally, while channel surfing, watch a few minutes one of these TV preachers asking for money in exchange for sound advice how to save your soul. It is beyond me how anybody with some kind of brain matter can actually send them money but they obviously do because we know that all these TV preachers are multi millionaires. Now of course these poor souls will only find out after they are dead that their money did not buy them salvation, so none of them will try to take out one of these TV preachers. I have never seen the guy who served as a role model for Clooney's character in this movie, as I do no watch cable but if he is close to the portrayal, anybody who follows him deserves to be punished..In Money Monster the poor soul ,who invested his money in a hedge fund promoted by the financial adviser/TV host played by George Clooney, tries to held him and the financial company accountable, only to be shot in the end. Sounds realistic to you? The top one percent always get away with it. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster will make millions with a mediocre movie and we who paid for it by watching this drivel are the idiots left with nothing but a bad taste in our mouth. The movie started out okay but became more and more unbelievable as it lumbered along, especially the scenes where they took to the streets with a whole SWAT team in pursuit. I want them to make movies about the corruption of the financial institutions, the sensationalism of TV shows the deception in our society everywhere we look, But I do not believe one second that these Hollywood stars like George Clooney , who is the producer of this movie, is really interested in achieving change. Not with his life style. Not with his endless self promotion based on nothing but good looks and charm. I do not think he is a very good actor, none of the movies he ever directed or produced was outstanding or remarkable. In everything he ever did he is mediocre, but he is lucky and now he is rich and so he thinks he knows better than others. He may know better than others how to make money, but that is it. He offers no solutions to the problems of our society as this movie clearly demonstrates. Contrary to Clooney I think Jodie Foster is an outstanding actress and I wish she would stick to acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst of 2016 till now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's my first comment here, but I could not let this pass. This is one big (huge!) flop! I think the only one that can transmit a little of emotion and rush is Julia, because all the others, George C included, make this movie, one of the worst I've ever seen. Looks like the all cast is doing their first role in a movie, the writing is just crazy bad, the film has no emotion, the director tries over and over again to insert funny moments that kill the mood, I don't know... I could just pass the hole day writing. Really, I never thought that George and Julia would accept a role like this. Huge disappointment. Jodie Foster: please just go learn something about making a movie. Please Jodie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does this still count as corporate greed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made me pay money to see a George Clooney/Julia Roberts film? Well, the premise is rather interesting. It catches your attention immediately in the advertising. This is a pretty timely movie. It's the rallying cry of the people. From Bernie to Trump, everyone is saying the same thing... THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!!! No kidding, even Jack O'Connell wails this in the middle of the hostage situation. But is this the best film you could've made right now? The people deserve better. The system is still rigged, folks. Money Monster is yet another Hollywood payday for Clooney. It's the kind of movie that only big money can buy. I left feeling patronized, especially from the last two people that should be lecturing us all about corporate greed. The film plays like a cross between Dog Day Afternoon and Network, so in essence, it's not like we haven't seen something like this before. The screenplay is corny and flawed. The acting, notably coming from Jack O'Connell and Emily Meade, is way over-the-top. Some of the suspense works, and is well executed, but it's not enough. Bottom line, if you want a stimulating, entertaining film that discusses the corruption of Wall Street and the elite, The Big Short is now readily available to watch online. Invest your time more wisely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to score this poorly as it is simply a poor attempt at a FULL FEATURE MOVIE. If Jodie, Julia and George, think they can just show up on a set for a few days, and voila, a box office success is created, it's time to reset. ONE HOUR AND THIRTY-EIGHT MINUTES, does not deserve an entry ticket onto the big screen! Please, other potential viewers, DO NOT encourage this sham. If you are curious then find a way to see it without visiting the theater.FULL FEATURE MOVIES are a minimum of 2 hours! If you don't have the commitment to produce a full featured movie, then release it to TV where it belongs.</fullReview>
