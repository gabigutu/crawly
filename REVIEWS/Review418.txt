		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's Magical Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With "Button", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.When I first heard about this movie, I had to wonder...how was Fincher, the guy responsible for realistic, gripping, crime thrillers like Seven and Zodiac going to pull off the fantasy film of a lifetime? Armed with a massive budget, Fincher uses everything a director can use to craft the most charming and technically brilliant film of the year. It's a film to be cherished for ages."Button" has struck me like this because a recurring theme in the film is that age is only a number, and that we as people can choose what we do with our lives, no matter what our age is. What better way to tell this message than through a story where the titular character ages backwards, and must experience life in such a way? How does one fall in love when he could one day appear young enough to be his spouse's child? How does a 5 year old play with the neighborhood children when he's confined to a wheelchair stricken with old age? Fincher's epic explores our choices, lives, and the timelessness of life itself.Brad Pitt plays the title role of Benjamin Button with a certain air of likability like he always does. While I felt he did a good job with the part, he didn't have to do much...Benjamin, fittingly, is a rather quiet character (I'd be willing to bet he narrates more than he actually talks in the film). In terms of acting, the film belongs to the ladies, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson in particular. Though Blanchett may seem overrated to some, there's no denying her unrivaled talent at playing a character as complex and deep as Daisy, and she pulls it off with ease and charisma. Taraji P. Henson will warm your heart as Benjamin's mother, as she's humorous, warm, and loving, so loving that I felt as if she was my mother.The main complexity behind the film, especially with a director like David Fincher, is keeping the film grounded in reality, while maintaining the undeniable magic within. As a director, you don't want to lose too much of either quality, instead keeping a healthy balance of the two. I feel that Fincher accomplished this perfectly. He is mainly helped out by a magical score, and absolutely stunning cinematography (which immediately identified it as a Fincher film, because of the darkness and lighting of it).Despite the wonder and awe of the film, mixed with the realism that Fincher always brings, the true allure of the film is not just Benjamin's aging problem, but the romance between Benjamin and Daisy, which is beautiful. Two people in love, regardless of age, time, or place. It's one of the most compelling romances of the year."Button" is also the most technically well made movie of 2008, as the true standouts are the Visual Effects and the Makeup, both of which are Oscar worthy. Pitt plays the character at almost every age, but it's almost impossible to tell when the CGI is being used on him. You know it's there, obviously, but you can't tell it's being used. When the transition is just smooth enough for the Visual Effects to be retired, but just rough enough to use makeup, it's absolutely perfect. If you've ever wanted to see Brad Pitt look 20 again, look no further, as the effects that make our actors young again (the same goes for Blanchett) are just as stunning as those that make them older.Despite a long runtime, the film never drags. If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young). This doesn't hurt the film in any way, as it's just my wishful thinking.I know I've used the word 'magical' a lot in this review, and don't think it's on accident. If I could pick one word to describe David Fincher's masterpiece, that would be it: magical. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a captivating piece of art that shouldn't be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I was just thinking about how nothing lasts...and what a shame that is..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been awaiting to see this movie for some time. Alas, it was Christmas Day and you bet I was there to see the movie on opening day. I set my expectations really high on this film. I expected nothing short of brilliance with a film coming from director David Fincher, director of the masterful "Zodiac" and screenwriter Eric Roth, writer of the classic "Forrest Gump". The acting is brilliant in the movie. Brad Pitt and the marvelous Cate Blanchett share a fire that resonates so effortlessly out to the audience. Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson's as Benjamin's mother, and Tilda Swinton's as Benjamin's first lover. Another notable achievement in the film is the visual effects; none of it is overdone and it is quite convincing. The music in the film is great as well. The haunting and mythical music is composed by Alexandre Desplat. One thing that did surprise me in the film was the amount of comedy present, but I guess comedy's needed for a tale with such sorrow. I really do think that this film is a classic. And I would go and see it again. When I was walking out of the theater, some people complained that the movie was very good, but that it was too long. I disagree; I actually didn't want it to end. It's the perfect film to watch all snuggled up in a blanket during the dead of winter. All things aside, this movie is about the short time we're given with life and how we are to make the most of it. Even with a story as fictional as Benjamin Button's, the message rings true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" would seem to have everything going for it - major stars, an enormous budget, and a conceit that can't be beat. However, in the end it's that very conceit that hamstrings an otherwise wondrous piece of movie-making.Fincher's characters tend to be psychos, paranoiacs, obsessives, some of whom struggle vainly against the darkness in their own souls, but many others who have embraced it. Benjamin Button is none of the above, and that's perhaps his problem. Button, born "under unusual circumstances" in 1918 New Orleans, spends his early life literally surrounded by death, raised, as he is, by an orderly in a home for the elderly. As a prematurely old man himself (an effect achieved by fantastic MOCAP work from Pitt), perhaps it's not surprising that as he grows into a body with which he may truly engage the world, he is more content to observe appreciably. Now, this may be true to the spirit of the character, but unfortunately for Fincher and his screenwriter, Eric Roth, it doesn't make for very interesting cinema. At a recent screening, Roth referred to Button's character as the "anti-Gump", a classification that seemed both apt and problematic. This film will certainly earn comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' modern classic(also written by Roth), but where that film had a truly fascinating central character, who experienced as many mistakes and tragedies as victories and happiness, Fincher and Roth's protagonist is a cipher. There's a telling sequence around the middle of the film, where Button, by now a merchant seaman holed up in a dingy hotel in Murmansk, strikes up a relationship with a bored wife of a minor British official (Tilda Swinton). Unable to sleep, they meet each night for tea and good conversation (and later, sex). But instead of letting us hear what those conversations are about, he simply creates a montage, set to music, of various meetings fading into one another. By the time Swinton's character departs the film, we know next to nothing new about Benjamin other than that he has trouble sleeping and likes hot tea. The fact is that even Swinton's character, on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes, is more engaging. It's a frustrating glimpse of what might have been, had the filmmakers chosen to put the character before the gimmick, instead of the other way around.Which brings us to Cate Blanchett. As Daisy, whom Benjamin meets as a young girl and who grows into a luminously beautiful and troubled ballet dancer, Blanchett shines as brightly as she ever has on screen. Unlike Benjamin, Daisy is not content to simply accept whatever life throws her way - she has dreams and attempts to act on them, and does her best to lead a normal, interesting life. Benjamin, passive as always, must quietly observe as she grows out of the playmate of his "youth" and into a somewhat headstrong woman who nonetheless possessed of enormous potential. His loyalty pays off, though, when circumstances bring them together again at a time when they both happen to be the same age - a fleeting moment, and one they will cherish. But again, the relationship between couple and audience is one-sided, because while we can see why Daisy would wish to return to the rock-steady loyalty of Benjamin, it's unclear what he feels about her other than a regard (she's certainly lovely enough). We are told in rather soggy voice-over narration (spread throughout the film) that Daisy is "the most beautiful person I'd ever seen", but that's all we'll get. And so it goes, for nearly three hours. We cut frequently, and irritatingly, back to a modern-day hospital in New Orleans, where a dying Daisy asks her daughter (Julia Ormond) to read to her from Benjamin's diary as Hurricane Katrina pounds on the windows. There's something being said in these scenes about regret and the passage of time, but the appealing Ormond's character is one-note, and Blanchett seems nearly suffocated under pounds of old age makeup. It's from this diary whence springs Benjamin's narration, but, as Mr. Roth pointed out, Gump this ain't. Suffice it to say that the budget is up there on screen as we go on this strange trip through the twentieth century with Brad Pitt as our guide. A possibly unintentional (I doubt it) laugh arises mid-film when Benjamin finally reaches something around Pitt's own age. He strides into a garage in the mid-50's, decked out in leather jacket and shades, and whips a tarp off a motorcycle, on which he speeds out to the harbor to do some bare-chested sailing on a boat he builds himself (the shades remain on his head). It's a knowing wink to the wish-fulfillment of the casting - who wouldn't want their old crotchety husband to get younger and younger until they looked like Brad Pitt? - and a clever way to underscore the underlying tragedy of the situation. Sure, he looks like Brad Pitt in "Fight Club", "Se7en", "Thelma &amp; Louise", but eventually he's going to look like Brad Pitt in "Cutting Class", and then Brad Pitt in seventh grade, and finally Brad Pitt as a toddler, and that's not so sexy.Pitt does a fine job. It's a pity that Fincher, who has used him to such great effect twice before, didn't let him cut loose. Instead this is his most low-key performance since Meet Joe Black, in which he played Death, who was really just a nice young man curious about the world. Come to think of it, that's pretty much all that Benjamin Button is, and, if nothing else, he knows more about death than just about anybody around. Too bad that a film that means to affirm life turns out to be rather lifeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something beyond magical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's new film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was destined to join the "sweepers" at the 2009 Oscars I knew that I had to check the film out to see if the rumors were true. Go back in time a little to when the film was first announced. David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac) was set to direct with a script from Eric Roth (Munich, The Insider) based off of an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story of the same title. The aspects of the crew were locked and had me somewhat interested. Then the cast list was announced with Brad Pitt (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Twelve Monkeys) and Cate Blanchett (I'm Not There., Coffee and Cigarettes) headlining the list, to say the least, it had my attention. I rarely get hyped up for super-mainstream films anymore with all of the disappointments that have occurred in the past. Luckily enough I was given the chance to attend a press screening on December 4th for this film and left well, satisfied. Given the fact that I was underwhelmed by the trailers, being satisfied is certainly saying something.Benjamin Button centers on the life of well, Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). As he states throughout the film, he was born under unusual circumstances. Unusual does not seem fit to describe it. Absurd would be a more suiting for the strange predicament Button found himself in. Born at the same age of everyone else when they enter the world, he had one different trait that stood out like a great white shark in a fish bowl, he had the frail wrinkled skin of an old man. Not only that, all of his features were those of a ninety-year old man. How this happened, the film does not explain in scientific terms but rather labels it as a "miracle" which in retrospect, it certainly is. With the outside of an old man, but the mind of a new born, Button had quite the handicap to overcome as a child. He is raised by the loving Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who runs a nursing home establishment. There he meets an assortment of characters that all effect his life in different way although one person seems to have more of an effect than the rest. A young girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is the grand daughter of one of the elders residing in the home. There she befriends Benjamin and their epic tale of love begins.Go into this film with an open minded because you are going to leave with an over flooded one as it is. The story carries so many twists and heart wrenching scenes that the viewer cannot help but become completely engrossed in the film. The main theme in the film is not death, forgiveness or love, but rather life. Life as whole. Every little detail, every experience we have is our life. What we witness is an almost complete documentation of Benjamin's life. One thing that the film did quite splendidly was when Benjamin stated in his narration that a certain person affected his life quite greatly. When the scenes with that person would initiate, the film's pacing would slow down and pay closer attention to his relationship with the person and the changes they caused in his life. A beautiful portrayal of the finer moments in life.Even if you leave the film bitter there is one thing you cannot deny your love for. The technical aspects of the film. The make-up is the best I have ever seen in a film. The age progression of the actors is done incredibly well. Even the actors handled the age changing roles quite well. The costume design is also fantastic and will most likely take home the Oscar gold along with the make-up. Another notable technical aspect is Fincher's direction. He has never been nominated for the "coveted" Best Director before but he has a strong chance with this film. One of the film's sequences stands out above the rest as one of the greatest Fincher has ever directed. While I will not go into great detail about it, I will say that it involves a tug boat fending off a submarine and it is incredible. Alexandre Desplat who was the composer for the film creates a score that may not be one of the most memorable, certainly helps in creating the film's atmosphere, which is a poetic one. To fully describe the spell that the technical aspects cast over the film would be nothing short of mesmerizing.While this may not be the best film of the year, it certainly is a film that will be remembered for quite some time. It's not "flawless" or a "masterpiece" but it is something grand, something magical. A film that can be experienced over and over again. One that does not undermine the intelligence of the viewer by repeating sloppy dramatic sequences that will only end up to the understandable conclusion of happiness. No, Benjamin Button is a film that understands the human mind and revels in it. Producing every bit of love, happiness, depression, confusion, hate, companionship that life provides us with this film is a tour-DE-force on most levels. Come Oscar time, this is the mainstream "masterpiece" of the year that is to be reckoned with. I can easily see it picking up nominations in most categories and winning them as well. Like I stated before, it is not the best film of the year, but is one that you should see to experience the wondrous life of Benjamin Button.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The disappointment I feel is perhaps more for David Fincher's career than this film. Everything on the surface of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' appears beautiful - the cinematography, the special effects, the make-up, the cast... everything is about eye candy. It is sweet but like sweets containing high glucose corn syrup, it leaves one irritable and certainly dissatisfied. I find with most critiques of mainstream, big budget films those who fall into two camps - those taken in by the hype, by the surface of the film and those who feel and understand the film, aware of its flaws. It is the same with bestseller novels. First of all, the concept of this film was unique. Let us at least take notice of F.Scott Fitzgerald who may or may not have stolen the idea/material from his wife Zelda (whom many scholars believe was the true genius and not her husband). Origins aside, the film has all the trimmings of previous work. There are some people who are vehement about this being 'not Forest Gump'. I would stress the similarities between the two films and the fact Eric Roth wrote both. Let us take note of the obvious:Atypical hero: Forest Gump/Benjamin Button Love Interest Jenny/Daisy Mother (with similar accents) Hero's 'war involvement' Vietnam War/WWII Setting American South/American South Leitmotif Feather/HummingbirdThere are others but those are the most obvious. Let us also remind ourselves both films are narrated by the hero who both happen to have interesting and 'profound' observations about life and their lives. But if it were simply a matter of being Forest Gump, then I would still have high praise for Benjamin Button. Not so. The majority of this film remains on the surface. Despite all the observations, despite the epic sweep of events that pass through the narrative, we as an audience are rarely allowed to go deeper. Again, the film was based on a unique idea but without the human psychology, without more background on several characters, I found it difficult to relate to any of these characters. Benjamin Button. He is born old, he grows young. That's all we really know. He lives with old people, he learns to play the piano, he leaves home, he travels, he sees the world. Most of the narrative is about places and meeting people, rarely about being involved with others, what it means or feels like to relate to a world that sees him as old. He is an outsider. How does this feel? We don't really know as an audience. The film is entirely experiential, rarely psychological. Daisy. We know she had a grandmother. We knows she loves to dance. But little else. What motivated her to dance, why did she love dancing? We don't know. And of course, why of all things did she not have a relationship with her daughter? The relationship: A man returns from war. He meets a woman that used to be the girl he loved. The woman wants to seduce him. She attempts. He steps back. When this occurs in the film, we don't really understand the reasoning nor the purpose of the scene. Daisy is in town one day. Her and Benjamin go out together. Why is sex so important to Daisy? And why do we have to watch the two characters go back and forth before they land up together? When he visits her in New York, she is immature, a school girl attempting to get him jealous. Yet he is still attracted to her. There are so many other questions I have about this film and so many things that simply do not make sense. The main one that comes to mind: if you are a dancer, someone who is professionally trained, why in any circumstances would you even think of dancing on a crowded street? The scene in which Daisy was hit by a car was for too unbelievable. She is first held up by a friend with a broken shoe lace. Daisy remains behind. In such a situation, when you have to wait for someone, the last thing you want to do is fool around after waiting. The scene felt convoluted and dumb - not tragic. The montage in which Daisy and Benjamin find themselves together plays out like all other young lover clichés - they travel together, they make love, they buy a love, they make love in their home, they paint their home (there is a brief, albeit clichéd 'lovers painting the wall' scene ... yawn...seen it...). I didn't find this film to be magical, just a mosaic of previous formulas and scenarios. Benjamin 'youthens', he leaves her. He comes back later. Throughout the entire film, the audience really doesn't know or understand or get a sense of what it means to grow 'young' nor what kind of effect it might have on others. I felt very tired after watching this picture. The first half was not bad. My interest was kept, I enjoyed the characters but when I started feeling lost and cheated, that I would never get any closer to the lives, feelings and deeper philosophies, and what with some of the frustrating scenes between Daisy and Benjamin, I began to grow impatient.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Groucho Marx said there's no worse thief than a bad movie. (steals your money and your time) and that's exactly what this film is.Do not, I repeat, do not tolerate the comparisons to Forrest Gump - a film filled with history, humor!, star-studded cast, a solid script, jam packed with history, one clever gimmick after the other and brilliant effects.Spoiler - Benjamin Button had one effect, that was make-up: Take one of the world's most attractive men and make him look unattractive for 75% of the film, while he moans and groans about the deal he's been dealt in life. don't get me wrong, they did this well, but he's never sympathetic. Y'just don't care about him at all... to be honest, the whole film struck me as a giant, drawn-out metaphor for a midlife crisis: a man pines after a girl who's not ready for him for years and years, then when she finally takes him into her bed, they spend a glorious year between the sheets, and as soon as responsibility shows up in the form of a child, he runs away from commitment, blaming his condition. And what's the big deal with his condition??? So his body is getting younger.. not his mind. That would actually make him a great father... he'd be around for the same number of years as many fathers are for their children.. 30/40 years, and during that time he'd only have gotten stronger and younger, while his mind was still maturing. What a gift! Great, cherish it! Live it! Accept your lot in life, challenges and all, and be a remarkable human being. That's the challenge laid upon us all. But no - Instead of facing his problem and taking on life and love and cherishing every moment, he lets down the woman he loves terribly and runs out on her, for what? to have sex with a few women? Preposterous.And then of course, when he comes back, she forgives him for being a coward and a stinker. Well why? Why be so forgiving. What's so tough about his life, oh poor guy, he gets to get younger everyday, he gets to get stronger and better looking as he sleeps.. where was the appreciation of this miracle? Where were the papers who would have been making a big deal over him? Where was the major history that he lived through which we never saw? Where were his amazing slew of life experiences, we watched 90 years of a man's life and all he did was run and hide from who he was. Where was a p-l-o-t? - the guy had no appreciation for the people who loved him, never knew his mother was sick? Nope, just came home one day to find she'd died. Did he not stay in touch with anyone? He did have a sister. I guess she didn't want to call to let him know their mother was ill? Clearly no one cared enough about him to tell him. Classic. Well if they don't, I don't either. And why did Cate's character keep his postcards from their daughter once the journal was found? Made no sense. Cate moved into the house and lived with him for 5 years as he went through Alzheimer's as an infant - where was Julia's character during this time? Also not speaking to anyone? Was she not curious why her mother chose to spend 5 years of her life this way? Why did she never tell her about her father? Why did I watch this piece of drivel and waste my time??? Save yourself the agony.I'm sorry F. Scott Fitzgerald. I'm sure you wrote a lovely short story. But that's all it was, a short story, and should have remained so. Before someone drags out your piece to a 3 hour sedative they ought to maybe actually write a s-t-o-r-y to justify the running time.**Watch the trailer**. That's all you need. And really, do watch it. It's interesting, it's pretty to look at, and really that's the entire story right there, a minute-and-a-half, you can see all of the make-up and special effects, you can pretend you've seen the film, cause nothing more happens - save yourself 3 hours and go spend time with your family instead, appreciate the gift of life instead of squandering it on bad films, or watch a different movie, (ooh, Juno, that was a good flick with an actual script - about dealing with life, hardships and all without boring people to tears), or go bang your head against a wall, something remotely entertaining. Brad, Cate, Julia, you're wonderful, all of you, the whole cast, you're lovely, you got pummeled by a lousy non-script and mind-blowingly uninspired direction. I'm sorry for you all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be an interesting film; certainly not boring as I had heard from a few people who saw it in the theater. To me, it was simply good storytelling.Yes, it's slow, especially by today's movie standards, but it's certainly a unique story and it's nicely filmed, acted and directed. Story-wise, it's one of those films I understand if people love it or hate it. I'm somewhat in the middle and leaning toward the positive.For a movie that runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes and is not some suspense or action film, it has to be pretty good to hold one's interest. I can only speak for myself; it held my interest for 95 percent of it.I think the first two-thirds of the movie is the best. Brad Pitt as "Benjamin Button" is pretty fascinating, as is the story of him growing up from a wrinkled, old man-baby to a mid-40s guy. When he re-unites with childhood friend "Daisy" (Cate Blanchett) and becomes her lover, the film bogs down in a few spots but few people are going to stop watching after investing two hours. It picks up again, especially in the last minutes when "Benjamin" begins to finally become younger than an adult.There's a sadness to this story, especially near the end but overall, even though it's central theme seems to be "death," I don't think it's a depressing film. It does remind us, in a big way, that the longer we're around, the more death of friends and loved ones we witness. That's just a sad fact of life. I hear about it all time with my father, who is 91 years old and has seen almost all of his friends die.It's especially true in this story when Benjamin starts off and has a lot of old friends to begin with! "Benjamin" was an odd person to me; you could root for him, yet not admire him. He often treated people only to satisfy his desires and could have been so much more. Yet, being "a fly on the wall" and observing his interesting life, was memorable, making this a film worthy of the time invested to watch it.In the end, the movie made me appreciate the friends I do have, and not to take any of them for granted as life passes us by so fast, no matter what direction we're headed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly haunting, moving, and fascinating film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt makes his mark as an actor here as Benjamin Button, a man with a strange disorder - physically aging backwards. Along his emotional journey of life he encounters friends, family, loved ones, adventures, and most of all, chances.Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it. Truly, David Fincher and Pitt have created a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of its time. Taking a strange and fascinating tale and making it into one of the decade's very best films is something of an accomplishment.Pitt, here, is an actor, not just a pretty face anymore. With the state-of-the-art visual effects at his hand, he pretty much carries the whole show. It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects. You genuinely feel and sympathize for his character, rooting for him all the way. Pitt owns the film, in short. He and David Fincher make a great team, and they look unstoppable to create more terrific films.For the supporting cast, Cate Blanchett plays the love interest of Daisy to great effect. Her tale with Benjamin's make them somewhat star-crossed lovers. I won't go that far into detail but you'll see much later into the film. Taraji P. Henson also shines as Benjamin's surrogate mother, who gives her son the support he needs. Not to mention Tilda Swinton as an early love interest.The screenplay by Eric Roth is excellent. Told from Benjamin's point of view with some highlights by Daisy, there are no clichéd dialogs to be heard, and the script is filled with equal moments of joy, ecstasy, sorrow, and understanding. Some dialog here is timeless and quotable, such as the film's tag-line; "We are defined by opportunities, even by the ones we miss." When you age backwards, you get more chances rather than missing it. I love that and wish for it, but sadly that is what movies are made for. And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.David Fincher is a tour-de-force of film-making. Straying away from gritty violent thrillers such as "Zodiac", the unmatched "Fight Club", and "Se7en", he takes a bizarre love story, the most expensive budget he's faced, and crafts a film with such substance and flair that he adds quality to the film. There are moments in the film which make it obvious Fincher is calling the shots. The paced is slow, but this allows us to absorb and be infatuated with the characters. There is not one dull moment in the film. It is constantly gripping and re-watchable.Technically speaking, the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect; gorgeous to the eyes and senses, and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director Fincher's trademark. Accompanying this is the beautiful and heart-wrenching score by Alexandre Desplat, which is absolutely flawless. The special effects are unique and well-made, and you'll find yourself confused to whether certain scenes were made with special effects or not. If you want to see actors when they were young this is the best rendition of effects possible, and I hope the future movies use more of this amazing technology to make their stars more bankable. The special effects deserve their Oscar for it is the best I've seen in any movie in 2008.In short, it is a beautiful, tragic, and terrific movie. It is certainly timeless and will stand the test of time, and hopefully, age well like fine wine (no pun intended). This absolute gem deserves the nominations it gets, too bad it was released the same year as Slumdog Millionaire.Overall rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, worth film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before. Set all the way back at the end of the Great War, to New Orlean's meeting with Hurricane Katrina, this movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a baby born an old man of eighty, destined to die in the mere form of a zero-year-old. I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it. I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish. There are many emotional and touching scenes in it, including the end, where it brings forth Benjamin Button's 'younger' years as an old man. Nothing went wrong with the cast, Brad Pitt played a great job as a reverse-aging man, and Cate went well as his childhood friend. Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Conflict Avoidance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand the appeal of this film. It has no plot (which is not necessarily a bad thing. Another Fincher/Pitt collaboration from 1999 comes to mind), the protagonist has no goal, and the film basically has no conflict.Massive Spoilers Below.Button is a FREAK. You would think his life would be a living hell full of torment and meaty conflict...but no. Button's life is wonderful. He rarely encounters hardship.He gets abandoned by his father, who shows up later and gives Benjamin everything he owns. He is taken in by a loving woman who cares for him every step of the way, keeping him far from anyone who would consider him to be a freak. He lives the good life growing up...or would it be down? He gets a job handed to him while sitting on a bench (a job that he loves so much that he would have done it for free, but he's getting paid!). He travels the world feeling no ill effects and not being taunted or ridiculed one single time for his disorder.Most difficult situation he encounters is being left without a life jacket when the tugboat encounters a German WWII sub, which the tugboat ends up defeating with such ease and rapidity, Benjamin doesn't even have time to do anything but crouch down for a minute and hide. The lack of a life jacket doesn't even come into play at all. A set-up with no pay-off. What was the point of that? The episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to remember whether Tilda Swinton's character showed up before or after Benjamin went to war, but it doesn't even matter. Swinton has an affair with Button, but Swinton's husband is a spy! Oh shlt? Nope. That is another set-up without a pay-off. More conflict avoided. It's an affair without any repercussions.The closest the film comes to a plot is the love story between Daisy and Benjamin, which is also the closest the film comes to displaying any sort of real conflict. Benjamin goes to New York to surprise Daisy only to find out she is with someone else. She rejects him. Benjamin goes to Paris. Daisy rejects him again. However, the rejections are only temporary, and Daisy forgives him entirely. More conflict avoided.From there on, they live a wonderful life. There is even a montage showing how wonderful their life together is. Neither one has to deal with any sort of conflict for a while. They just have sex and fun all day long. They eventually end up having a child together, and Benjamin decides to walk out on them to avoid the possibility of conflict arising from the fact that he will eventually grow young and Daisy will have to care for both of them.So despite his radical disorder (that nobody even really comments on, let alone ridicules him over), Benjamin goes through what some would consider a perfect life. He ends up with everything he wants and doesn't even have to work to get it.Hell, I wish I was born backwards so my life would be free and easy.How could a story with a concept so ripe with conflict completely avoid it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt is not just another handsome guy who's made it big in film. This guy is one hell of an actor who'll walk away with this year's Best Actor Oscar as will the movie garner 10 awards. It is simply a masterpiece; no words can aptly decribe the poignancy and beauty of this celluloid Renoir.Kudos to two geniuses who wrote it;Eric Roth and Robin Swicord,masters of imagination. To think of the idea whereby the march of time runs clockwise for the entire world but backwards for Benjamin is, in itself, masterful. The concept allows for the type of intersection of people and events which has never been shown on the screen previously. I suggest that no one reads anything about the plot because the entire impact of the film will be lost by doing so. See it with an open mind and you will be totally astounded for close to three hours. Every once in a while, a film of this brilliance comes along to take the public by storm, the last being "Million Dollar Baby," therefore get set for another movie treat of a lifetime.Simply stated: this film is NOT to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You Still Wish You Could Turn Back the Clock?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a near epic film in almost the same way Forrest Gump was. I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work. Yet I strongly admired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.The acting was very good throughout the movie. Especially that of Cate Blanchett who seems to be turning out one great performance after another. She plays the role of Daisy, Benjamin Button's real love interest from start to finish. In fact she played so well it might have been a partial downfall to the movie. Her performance out shined that of the main character, played by Brad Pitt. Although Pitt was very solid in his performance I do not believe he deserved an Oscar nomination (rather Blanchett deserved one) for his role of playing Benjamin Button. He was not a necessity to the movie and did not add much to it. He was not bad but he wasn't spectacular. Throughout though many of the different actors and actresses lit up the screen. Especially Tilda Swinton who was wonderful to watch as Button's short lived love interest. Her presence was magical and a joy to watch. I would have loved to see just a little bit more of her character.The directing of David Fincher in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was of what I believe to be his best work to date. The screenplay of Eric Roth was written very well as he has had experience with these type of movies. In many scenes the dialog and great direction combined for some epic scenes.Ultimately I enjoyed this movie very much but something felt missing from the movie. Something seemed left unsaid that was vital. I felt that the great downfall to this movie was that Brad Pitt didn't give an amazing performance and did not take control of the movie rather Blanchett stole the show from him which made Button seem less important to me. Despite that though it this film was done very well and I would recommend it to all. Its an important story that makes us self reflect and think deeply. It displays how we need to live with our mistakes because they are part of our life. We need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder "what if...?".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Things Last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having developed pretty much the most successful directorial career of the decade, Fincher just refuses to hold back his enormous talent, always picking the risky projects and churning out an exhilarating piece of work. He's come a long way as it is, and then comes along the curious "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". The title speaks for itself. The result can be anything between a predictable romantic drama, or a stirring, magical, unforgettable, heartbreaking, intelligent, challenging experience. I'm sure you can tell which direction I'm headed.Oh, what a curious case indeed. The film begins as a child, born on the day of the end of the Great War (symbol of the beginning of life?), is abandoned by his father outside a boardinghouse dedicated for seniors. It is quickly revealed that he was born ugly and wrinkled (not quite the appearance of a child, but "still a child of God"). We don't find out immediately that he will lead his life physically aging backwards, but it is gradually revealed as he grows older, when his back begins to take shape and his wheelchair is rendered useless. What ensues after developing his bizarre nature, however, is the true core of this absolutely spellbinding masterpiece. There is always a lingering dread that his relationships will never work beyond their limited time frame, but its characters are driven by soul, not any shallow desires. The heart of the film is the relationship between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Will their love survive their difficult circumstances? Mortality is the key theme of this picture, the adamant difference between young and old age. Transience is man's greatest weakness. Although it's a pretty glum and straightforward thing to say that nothing lasts, the film does not depict itself through false optimism, but rather through hope. Hope that beneath these torn souls, there is the chance of wisdom and love overcoming mortality, and it culminates a damned poignant realization. There is also a playful theme to summarize the entire film -- no matter which way you age, life will always f-ck you. Tell that to the millions of women undergoing their midlife crisis, I guarantee the results will not be pretty. I'm getting off- track now, so let me just say this is possibly the best film of the year, and many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately, a completely pointless film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of this film before seeing it but there was nothing else good on, so I gave it a try. An interesting idea for a film, that he grows physically younger but mentally develops in the normal way. However, this leads to many inconsistencies in the storyline. It doesn't make sense that Benjamin, when he becomes a father, decides to leave and travel the world. He looks of the age to do something like this but he's meant to be more mature... And when he's an old man in a young boy's body, he has a tantrum like a young boy would, but that doesn't fit the idea of the story, either... When trying to find the point to this whole story, all it comes down to is that we should look after those close to us and take more care of them. Well, that's an original one! To me, it became extremely boring as there is never any deep meaning to it and it just keeps dragging on for far too long when you can see that it's quite a stupid idea to put into a film. The anecdotes in the story, the acting and the direction are all good but in the end, what's the point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Hollywood Hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I cannot start out saying anything other than this movie was complete rubbish from the ground up. At first sight, it seems to hold such promise: an interesting hook, renowned actors, as well as being based on a short (HA! more on that later...) story of F. Scott Fitzgerald's. I even paid to see it non-matinée the week it was released- a rarity for me. Yet all the overblown actors and excessive ad campaigns and self-congratulating awards shows in the world could not disguise what this film truly was.First off, the acting. I love Cate Blanchette, truly I do, but if she could do no better with her hackneyed portrayal of a Deep Southern accent, she did not deserve her role. In fact, both of the leads sounded so bad it would have been laughable had it not been so entirely insulting. I have lived all over the Southeastern US and have yet to encounter people who sounded so overdone and idiotic. Also, there was no way Cate could possibly hope to pass for early twenties. They should have taken their cue from Pitt's people and filmed her back-lit in complete shadows for the younger scenes. As for Brad Pitt, I have always been leery of him- I only ever hear of the man as an Adonis rather than an actor. Next time I will stick to my instincts- his pretty face did little to cover for his wooden lack of talent. It seems that all his contracts ever require of him is that he bang the hot chick. At least he got one part right.Which brings me to my next point- the absolutely sickening way Hollywood treats sex. It's so commonplace, so vulgar. Apparently, you are not a man, nay, not even a whole human being until you've shagged someone, even if its a hooker. Never mind that the character was supposed to only be mentally 13 (felony, anyone?). Or that no regard was given to the repercussions of such numerous encounters with people he had little other relation with. It's as if they wanted to see how long they could stretch out a film on pure bs. In fact, did this character exist for any other reason that to brag about his sexual irresponsibility in an outrageous southern drawl? Beats me.Even more curious than the case of the missing plot, was the mystery of the missing logic. Where was the racial tension of black adults raising a white child in New Orleans? Where was the brain of the policeman when Crazed Daddy Button came back with no ugly baby? Where was the sorcerer that was responsible for said ugly baby and the mysterious clock of doom we kept cutting to? Where were the obviously blind doctors and reporters that just happened to never realize the man was AGEING BACKWARDS? Not even a lone tormentor of this freak of nature? I've never known a person with life this good- everyone accepts him, wants to shag him, forgives him at a whim, and takes care of him no matter the personal cost. And all the while he is looking more and more like Brad Pitt. Am I seriously supposed to feel sorry for him? Everyone dies, everyone eventually reverts to a state where they can't care for themselves. I'm pretty sure that impermanence is when people keep telling me makes life SPECIAL. So shut up grow some, please.And then, to put the cherry on the sundae, our brave hero decides that it's just not fair for his lady friend he's knocked up to have to eventually raise two kids, so what does he do? He abandons her to raise one totally alone and travel the world seeking out more hookers to ease his pain. Oh tut, tut, life's just not fair, is it? Of course, he does actually come back when he can't change his diapers himself anymore, therefore negating any possible shred of nobility he supposedly professed. And all the while this is treated as the greatest sacrifice known to humankind. More like the greatest selfishness. I could go on like this for years, but I think my point has been sufficiently made.The friend on my right side during the film wept at the end, calling it the deepest film he'd ever seen. The depth must have overwhelmed the one to my left, because after dragging on for 3 hours for no discernible reason, all she could think of was when would it end so she could go to the toilet. I am inclined to agree with the latter: there are better things I could do with my time than watch this movie, among them, go to the toilet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe how positive the reviews for this movie are. I was extremely disappointed in this movie.1. The old woman's voice was extremely annoying and over-acted. Perhaps even unrealistic as I have never heard an old person talk like that.2. The hummingbird showing up at sea was stupid. Then it showed up again in the hurricane at the very end of the movie which was completely ridiculous.3. When Benjamin was born he was born with the mind of a child, the body of an 80-year old but he was baby-sized. The fact that he had the body of a child but was baby-sized was a bit bit inconsistent but fine, I'll accept it. When he aged, his body size grew, but everything other than his body size became younger, and his brain grew older. Then, by the end of the movie, he had the mind of an 80-year old, and the body of a baby, but he was baby-sized again. He should have started as a normal sized 80-year old or he should have died as a large baby. I prefer the former. He could have been born as a 100 lb old man, and that could have explained why the mother died, because she had given birth to a 100 lb old man (she could have been a 300 lb pregnant woman, not any harder to believe than Benjamin's condition itself). Yeah it sounds crazy, but to me it makes more sense and is more consistent.4. When old-body, young-mind Benjamin was screwing the whore they made reference to his stamina and he said something like "let's go again" to the whore. If he had an old body he would not have been such a performer in bed. Are people so stupid to believe that performance in bed is only mental?5. Incredibly boring. Moves at a very slow pace for the entire movie. There is almost no conflict, just boring scene after boring scene.6. Mr. Button grabbed the baby from the room in front of some nurses and a doctor and then ran away from a cop. He got away from the cop and put the baby on someone's front stairs. Did none of the people who saw him take the baby report him? At least to the media? If this movie made any effort to be realistic at all, Mr. Button would have feigned joy at the baby's birth and then dumped the baby after everyone had left. Or, they would have reported a missing baby with wrinkly skin.7. Last minute of the movie was such a groaner. "Some play music, some are mothers, some dance..." give me a break.8. Too long for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As of this writing, Benjamin Button is number 70 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of the year list. Many people believe this film deserves, in a year with films like Frost/Nixon and Doubt (and many others which I will not mention) that this is the one film which will bring home Best Picture.Wow. This is overrated. It will bring home the Oscars it deserves: Cinematography and Makeup, and if it's very, very, lucky, Special Effects. What bugs me most about the film is the thing at the core: the relationship between Daisy and Benjamin. It misses something very, very, important: why they fell in love in the first place.The most interesting section is one that completely captivated: when he has a love affair with a lady at the Russian hotel, why? Because they kept it at a brisk 30 minutes so it doesn't drag on for 2 hours, it gets you captivated, and it ends when it is meant to end. You can also tell why they had the affair in the first place: they wanted to find out to what it was like to be in love, or in the girls case: Benjamin's strange affliction.You (or at least me) become sick of Benjamin's relationship with Daisy when you realize it fails to ask the most important question at what is the dead center of the entire 2 hour 48 minute film: Why did they fall in love???Pitt gives a tolerable performance, nothing Oscar worthy. Blanchett, on the other hand was very good as Daisy, trying to fuel the chemistry with Pitt that just isn't there.It's also very long with a 168-minute runtime, it thinks it can spend all the time trying to win, but in the end, it fails. There are many useless scenes that could've been thrown out (particularly this one scene in which it shows all the things, which could've happened to prevent Daisy being hit by a cab, which leaves you thinking in the 5-minute section that feels more like 30 minutes which left me thinking "when will this end???"). Worth a rental for the astounding cinematography and makeup.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically, like most of Davin Fincher's movies, "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" is a wonder. The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. "Zodiac" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.</fullReview>

Maybe because people are so used to seeing visual trash from Hollywood these days, when they get visual trash with some good acting, they call it a masterpiece.Benjamin Button is a very well paced, visually affecting movie. But it is one that leaves you feeling hollow. The feel for the characters due to the skill of the actors, but you are given no understanding for their motivations. Why did the female lead desire so much to be a dancer? Where was Benjamins conflict about leaving his family? Layer that with the oh so obvious feeling that this was done before (and better) with Forrest Gump and you feel like this is a rehash of the same idea. Now throw in cliché after cliché (crazy sea captain, dancer struck down ridiculously in her prime, lovers buying a love nest and painting the walls...) and you end up feeling like you have gone on a ride, but it didn't make you feel any differently than when you got on. You can't identify or understand what has happened, so why is it important? Are we all so gullible these days that any movie with some enhanced visuals and good acting gets called a masterpiece?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest film of the last 5 years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was over (saw it on a late show on Christmas Day), I knew I had just experienced one of the most powerful cinematic masterpieces of my life. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is quite possibly my favourite film of the last 5 years (not since Sofia Coppola's "Lost In Translation" a contemporary film had moved me so much). I had high expectations for it, and they were way surpassed (fact: after "Se7en", "Fight Club" and this, nobody will deny David Fincher and Brad Pitt make great films together)."Benjamin Button" is the story of a man who ages backwards. Played and narrated by Brad Pitt, BB is the epic account of this extraordinary life, with focus on all the special women that were part of it (Taraji P. Henson as the mother, Cate Blanchett as the love interest and Tilda Swinton as a married woman he has an affair with). As a humorous, romantic, melancholic and visually stunning tale of a sweet-natured man who's different from most people, the film reminds me of "Forrest Gump" (which was also adapted to the screen by Eric Roth), but it is even more groundbreaking. It's hard to see a film that has it all, but TCCOBB is one of those. It's like a great epic from Hollywood's Golden Age, when a good story was as important as the magnificent sets (the art direction, cinematography and make-up are all fantastic, by the way, as is Alexandre Desplat's musical score) that populated them ? something very rare today, when CGI dominates most movies. We had a few great films this year ? from the king of blockbusters (Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight") to a compelling biopic (Gus Van Sant's "MILK") to brilliant indies like Danny Boyle's "Slumdog Millionaire", Mike Leigh's "Happy-Go-Lucky", Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York", Thomas McCarthy's "The Visitor", Courtney Hunt's "Frozen River", Tomas Alfredson's "Let The Right One In" and Jonathan Demme's "Rachel Getting Married", but I doubt I will see anything as good as David Fincher's masterpiece so soon. In other words, an instant classic (there, I said it). 10/10.</fullReview>

The ending was so un-intendingly funny that I couldn't stop laughing. I thought she was going to actually inhale the baby Benjamin into her womb to complete the cycle. There were many things about this film that was just plain stupid, but having to have Brad pit go back to the actual infant form was just insane. I keep trying to figure out why when a white baby was raised by a black mother in the 20's, 30's and on wasn't ever an issue with anyone in a very racist town like New Orleans in the south.

		<shortDescription>The Sad Case of a Film with Lots of Potential that Didn't Deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My boyfriend and I had been looking foreword to seeing this movie for about two weeks, when we finally got to see it yesterday afternoon. We knew about the high ratings on this site as well as in our local newspaper, and by general word-of-mouth. What a disappointment. It was slow, bland, only occasionally humorous, slow, unintelligent, devoid of conjuring up real emotion, slow, silly, and the main character was not very likable-- just a horny womanizer fleeing from love and responsibility. About two hours through, my bf forced me to walk out and leave with him. I say forced only because I hate walking out on ANY film, no matter how awful, and I hate losing my hard-earned money. Even though I didn't see the entire film, I still feel the need to comment on what I did see, especially because I found out the details of what happened after we left... just more cowardice, silliness, womanizing, and a continuously slow plot-line. Perhaps I'll give it another chance when it comes out on TV, or if I have nothing better to do and I don't have to pay to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one really has fooled everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>13 Oscar nominations, including best picture and actor, one would think WOW what a great film! WRONG. The con with this film is that it looks very impressive but has no real depth, soul, and is very uninteresting. The story is loosely based on a very old and short comic-book like story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The screen play, adapted by Eric Roth, gives it the old Forest Gump feel and starts out reasonably well. However, the character of Benjamin Button, a man who has a rare condition of ageing backwards but his mind ages forwards, is boring, unlikable and downright annoying! There are scenes in which Benjamin just mopes about feeling sorry for himself, bemused and confused! Yea, well wouldn't you be? I mite, but this man has a roof over his head, a family that have cared for him and raised him, albeit he was ditched by his real father and left on their doorstep, but he had a pretty solid homestead considering he was born in the 1920's. He grows up gets a job on fishing boat, and travels the world to rekindle the flame of his childhood sweetheart.When Benjamin meets his love to be, he is in his 80's and she 8 years old.They play games, stay up late at night and get along fine. I will just draw your attention to the word PEADOPHILLIA! This is WRONG people. If I had an 8 year old daughter I would certainly not let her hang out with an 80 year old man regardless of his condition! Would you? Anyway, when Benjamin grows "younger", he finally gets a chance to get it on with his darling, but she falls pregnant and he runs away because he thinks he is incapable of such a responsibility. Thats the message this film sends out. Do we really give a damn? Brad Pitt must be laughing all the way to the podium, as his performance entails standing still and having makeup applied with the aid of a little CGI here and there. He narrates the story, just like Forest did, but with a crap deep south Louisiana accent and just rambles on and on! The film last nearly three hours and it felt I was ageing forward faster than the speed of light. I cant get those precious 3 hours back now which is a shame! The amount of Oscars this film has been nominated for is truly astonishing. Based upon the trend of the academy awards films like this should not be considered for best picture as they are coming from a fantasy angel! But because there is a Forest Gump premise, people have bought into it and aloud it to sweep up. Go and watch it by all means, but mark my words you will NEVER EVER want to watch it again Let me leave you with this notion. The Dark Knight was totally shunned by the academy for being a comic book story. Which is more conceivable to you? A man dresses up as bat to become a masked vigilante, or a man who defies the laws of science and ages backwards? I rest my case!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very overrated Movie - Why has this garnered 13 Oscar nominations???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a masterpiece (as some people have been doing), has got to be the biggest misnomer of this year. Whilst it's an OK movie, it's by no means the masterpiece many are purporting it to be. I really do take issue with people spuriously calling movies of today masterpieces, especially when such an adjective is unwarranted. So, let's just say that this is a "masterpiece", are we to believe that it's on a par with the likes of "Citizen Kane", "Gone With The Wind" or even "The Godfather"? all of which I would deem to be masterpieces - I think not. The reality is that it doesn't even come close to any of the aforementioned movies, not to mention a myriad of others that I could mention.The story centres around a boy who is born "under unusual circumstances", in that he is born an old man and as a consequence ages in reverse, thus becoming younger. His father leaves him on the steps of a nursing home, having discovered that his wife (who has died during child birth), has given birth to an abnormal child. A black woman who works at the nursing home adopts him as her own and the story of Benjamin Button takes flight.I don't know if it was just me, but I couldn't believe the lack of dismay and consternation at how the child was initially received by the residents of the nursing home. One lady commented that "he looks like my ex husband", whilst others looked at the baby as if they'd been shown a newspaper. I found this particular scene highly implausible, because in reality, most people would have run a mile having been shown something so hideous and out of the ordinary.I have to say whilst I think that Cate Blanchett gives a good performance (as always), I found Brad Pitt's performance extremely pedestrian and lacking gravitas - proving yet again why he'll always be a "movie star" and never a bona-fide actor. I feel an actor such as Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr would have added more weight and natural acting ability to the role, but then, they are far superior actors.Although Mr Pitt has been nominated for an Oscar, he is going to have a mountain to climb if he's to win this accolade, as the performances from Frank Lagella(Frost Nixon), Sean Penn (Milk) and Mickey Rourke (The Wrestler) are far superior. This is not a bad movie, but I was expecting something far better, considering the acute adulation that this movie has been receiving.As for the best picture nomination, I think that "Slumdog Millionaire" should win as it is far more compelling and I cared about the characters a lot more. I think it is a far superior and unpretentious picture, whereas "Benjamin Button" is a movie that screams "Give me an Oscar", as opposed to actually deserving one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boring Ordeal of Benjamin Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was an overly long, excruciatingly boring heap of pretentious trash. The cinematography and direction was great. Everything else was pathetic, boring, or unintentionally funny.Brad Pitt has made a lucrative career on his good looks. He can't, however, act his way out of a paper bag. He displays three ranges of emotions : mouth closed, mouth one quarter open, and mouth half open. His character, like Forest Gump, was a Southern dimwit; except it was devoid of humor. The plain looking English woman who had an affair with him in Russia must have been extremely desperate to hit on a sixty-something wrinkled old bespectacled man who had the personality of a traumatized hamster. What - she ran out of batteries? Cate Blanchett looked horrendous. Did you ever see the transvestite in "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"? Dead ringer. Her makeup had to have been applied with a trowel by System Pavers, the company that paved my driveway last summer. She looks like that weird puppet in those "Saw" flicks. Such an unattractive woman in a leading role ruined the film. Pitt seemed to be getting cuter while she kept getting uglier. The movie became bogged down in this dull love affair. How could this woman ever generate passion from a Tibetan monk strung out on Viagra, let alone Brad Pitt, was beyond me. It was unintentionally funny when Pitt met his teenage daughter. The poor girl inherited her mother's looks. That bit in Paris where they had an extended "what if" sequence of events prior to the pedestrian/car accident was ludicrous. The silly twit forgot to look while crossing - so what?Faune A. Chambers, who played Pitt's adoptive mom characterized the most blatant, obnoxious stereotypical black person ever seen on film since the 1930's. I felt like standing up and shouting, "Okay, we get it - she's black!" Why the NAACP didn't boycott her performance, I'll never know. She made Stepin' Fetchitt seem like James Earl Jones.This film was Forest Gump meets Boring Chick Flick. The ending caught me by surprise. I thought he was going to regress into a sperm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally saw this movie last night. I can't believe this movie got so many awards. Plot-wise, it is similar to Forrest Gump, following the life of a 'special man'. But unlike Forrest Gump, this movie is devoid of humor, drama, passion, or any other reason to care about the characters. Also missing is any motivation for their actions; they simply jump from one event to another, apparently because it is time for them to do so.Technically, it is interesting to see and ponder life lived backwards. But for some reason, CGI or makeup or whatever, the movie is lifeless. And in the end, there is no reason to care about what you just saw. The Golden Globes got it right when they didn't give it any awards; let's hope the Oscars are equally as smart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New Orleans, while in her deathbed, the elder Daisy (Cate Blanchett) asks her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) to read the journal of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) for her. Caroline reads the fascinating story of a man that was born a diseased old man on the day that the First World War ended; abandoned by his desperate father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) in an asylum for elders and raised as a son by the black caregiver Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). While aging backwards, Benjamin meets the girl Daisy and they become friends; then he works as a sailor in the towboat Chelsea and travels through the world, participating of the World War II after the attack to Pearl Harbor; finds love with Mrs. Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton) and returns to New Orleans, when he meets his biological father and Daisy, who is working as ballerina in New York until he finally dies as a baby. While reading the diary, Caroline discloses a secret about her family."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is one of the most intriguing movies ever. The original story is supported by an interesting and curious screenplay that discloses the whole life of Benjamin Button and a stunning direction of David Fincher. The cast is magnificent, and it is not easy to highlight an individual performance (I loved Cate Blanchett), supported by magnificent cinematography and make-up. Surprisingly there are bad reviews of this movie that I recommend for those viewers that seeks a gem that is unique. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Curioso Caso de Benjamin Button" ("The Curious Case of Benjamin Button")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic about Love, Mortality and Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is unlike any other films I've ever seen and most probably ever will. It is an absolute masterpiece and will most definitely be one of the greatest films of all time. An instant classic. It is layered with top notch acting, well-executed directing and a magical soundtrack. It explores the subject of life, love and death, the death of the ones we love, on losing and finding and how it all connects. This movie is nothing but brilliance. An epic that have left me breathless.It is a tale of Benjamin, a man who was born old and aged in reversed, and was told from the diary read by his daughter. It is not his condition that makes him special. It is the choices that he made throughout his story. He gets to witnessed life from all angles. While he is growing younger, the people around him grow old and eventually die. He learned that in order to know how much a person meant to us, we are made to lose them. Life is not measured in minutes, but in moments. That is why he left his home, go to sea, fight in a war, find love, have a child, and in the end, start all over again.The most curious part of the movie ? for me ? is its incredible attention to detail. The art of this movie is unlike anything I have seen before. It puts you directly into the period of time of what is shown on screen. Never was a movie so vastly detailed and lavishly put together as this. From the war scenes at seas, to the city during the winter, events in the cities, 1920s, 30s, 40s and so on; they will leave you speechless. Instead of just showing earlier times, we're shown historical (though with a dash of fiction) events and figures, like the WWII, President Roosevelt, some reference to Shakespeare, etc. Some of these scenes are in washed-out colours, like a footage taken straight from that time period. And especially the six "struck-by-lightning" scenes, which have no sounds, just white-and-black footage that last for about 2 seconds each. It really gives the authenticity of those moments.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, had proved themselves that they can't only play variety of characters in variety of movies, but also characters living their lives while spanning decades and decades...all while in a movie. They are both so empathetic that audience can feel what they are depicting; how they grow, matured and developed. I get to see it in less than three hours. It has got nothing to do with the directing skill or the screenplay ? they're just highly skilled actors.David Fincher used the three hours that was given to him very wisely. Not one scene seemed out-of-place or inappropriate. He directed the film so well that the graceful storytelling reflects his direction.It will be a curious thing how this movie gets awful reviews.It is a definite example of the most wonderful depiction of love, life and death. It will leave you astonished. Because what makes our life meaningful are not the choices we have made and not the things we have found, but instead, the opportunities that we strike even the ones we missed, and the ones we love and how they are gone. Life IS curious. And the Curious Case of Benjamin Button had thought me how to appreciate it.P/S: One of the last scenes in the movie is the most beautiful and touching picture I have ever seen; An old woman, cradling a baby, and knowing that both of them are dying...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully made and a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, when I was working at a movie theater, I had seen the first hour of the movie, but never got to finish it. I was so disappointed because this movie looked like something truly special and finally I got to rent it, while I'm disappointed that I didn't finish it on the big screen this is one of the great movies out of 2008. Brad Pitt as we know has proved to be more then just a pretty face, he's pulled in some great performances, he needed a push though to get recognized by the academy and this was the role that he truly deserved to be noticed. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters that I'm sure will be remembered for all time, Benjamin Button, he plays the character with such love and passion, he and Cate Blanchett together once again to provide the perfect chemistry and make The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a very special movie.An elderly Daisy is on her deathbed with her daughter Caroline in a hospital as a hurricane approaches. Daisy asks Caroline to read aloud from a diary containing photographs and postcards written by Benjamin Button. Caroline begins to read as the story transitions to Benjamin's narration. In 1918, just as the people of New Orleans are celebrating the end of the Great War, a baby boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of an elderly man. The mother of the baby dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, takes the baby and abandons him on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Tizzy, a couple who work at the nursing home, find the baby. Queenie decides to take the baby in as her own. Over the course of the story, Benjamin begins to biologically grow younger. In 1930, while still appearing to be in his seventies, Benjamin meets a young girl named Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. A few years later, Benjamin goes to work on a tugboat on the docks of New Orleans for Captain Mike. While in Russia, he begins an affair with the older, married Elizabeth. Eventually, she breaks it off, only leaving him a note telling him she was glad they met. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and meets Benjamin again. Now the same physical age, they fall in love and move in together. They experience the 1960s together, in large part blissfully but increasingly aware of Benjamin growing younger while Daisy grows older. Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, and not wanting to burden Daisy with having to raise two children, sells his belongings, and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He leaves them both and travels the world.If you get the chance, I highly recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, this movie was just incredible in it's scope, story, setting and actors. David Fincher took what could have been just a small treasure and made it into something incredible. This was one of the saddest love stories I have seen in a long time, we really haven't had anything too special when it comes to a love story in film, we did have Slumdog Millionaire in 2008 as well, but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button carried it's love story throughout and made you really pity this couple that you know can't have much of a future together. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are absolutely beautiful in this movie along with a great supporting cast, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie not to be missed.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fincher understands cinematic narrative construction and has the craft to match. I fell under his spell during "Fight Club."The idea there was to play a game with inner narrative. It was, I think when Pitt first found his way into full collaboration with a director's adventure with the shifting of watcher and writer. That made Pit a real actor in my book. Fincher has played with other devices since. "Panic Room" was architectural, at least to begin. "Zodiac" twisted the detective story in odd ways. Here he works with one of the most basic challenges in film: how to show the internal workings of a mind in emotional seas. The conventional way in literature is easy enough for us now: we read about what we believe are the inner ruminations and remembrances of a mind. But that makes for bad films -- where we have all sorts of talk, explanations in words instead of immersion in experience through the visual grammar. These are the worst.But what if you want to tell a real love story? One of real love, deep love, impossible love? What if you want it directly from the lover's hearts and don't want some metaphoric overlay, some watered down convention? Well, you might try this collection of devices, these two.First there is the inter-nested story. We have the framing narrative of the clockmaker and his love. (This, incidentally, is one way to show love, to conflate it with something visual, like clocks, stations, hurricanes, lightning.) We leave that and come to an inner framing story, a dying woman still calculating, revealing secrets to a daughter. This is actually a pretty conventional setting as well. We revisit it enough to allow for an excuse for her to "read" from a diary, the excuse for us to hear the inner thoughts and emotions of Benjamin. This one device gives blanket allowance, and the casual viewer will scarcely notice that we get the inner beats of the woman's heart as well, in her own "words."This is combined with the more visible device of two lover's lives running in opposite directions. We go forward while the story is recalled as double memory, triple if we credit Ormand's character (the daughter) as the one going in reverse. And this IS conveyed cinematically by the somewhat hypnotic device of seeing the familiar face of Brad Pitt reverse age. It sounds simple, this concoction, but I imagine it to take the focused efforts of all involved, including the two women: our most talented folding actors (both redheads here) Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. Along the way, Fincher almost teases us with what he does not do. There is the "Doctor Zhivago" route not taken, the war movie route, the dancer (performance as love), the Ron Howard play ("Cocoon"), the Spielberg play, in fact all the possible ratholes that all the possible directors who were once attached would have gone down. Yes, it is slow. Love is. Yes, it is difficult, but this love is -- all deep love is. All lasting love is a passing moment, captured and nurtured internally while it tries its best to vanish. Is this the best, truest love story in ages? Yes, probably. Will it change you? Possibly, depending on where your heart passes.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me recap - a kid is being born as old man. As he grows, he is becoming younger and younger. Until he "shrinks" and dies at "infant age".As he grows older (younger in fact), he watches everyone around him becoming older and older. He watches others die. In fact, he watches them die even more, as he is brought up in a retirement home.As he is "growing up", no one seem to be asking any questions regarding his situation. Everyone seem to be perfectly all right with their observations. Not one visit to a doctor. Nothing, although everyone around him seem to care a lot for him.Throughout the movie, many "duh-wisdoms" related to life and death are being quoted. These quotes oversimplify reality to the extend that it makes you think than nothing else seem to matter.It seem that idea was something like -- "once we quote these; the audiences will forget about the sheer stupidity of the story" (giving the reviews here on IMDb, they may have been right, too).I understand that this movie suppose to have some "deeper meaning" and I think I understand what it intended to be.In stead though, it has become a cross in between Forrest Gump, Legends of the fall and many other movies, resulting in over two and half hours of absolutely nothing.THREE Oscars? Come on guys. This movie is bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie.I did not go to see it at the theatre because of the run time. Same goes for The Assassination(sp?)of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; really long movies both. Just watched both of these on cable movie channels today. Both performances were Brad Pitts' best.There is plenty to read about the characters and plot out there; so I won't go over it yet again. The women in the movie were great; Cate Blanchette, Taraji P Hinson and Tilda Swinton. Great performances all.But this movie reminded me of why, from the very first time I saw Brad Pitt on the big screen(Thelma and Louise), I knew he was going to be a HUGE STAR. I remember saying to friends that he was going to be the next Robert Redford.This was WAY before Jennifer and Angelina; he was still pure. And I have to admit, all the hype that went along with being involved with those women seemed to take away from his acting talents. Over exposure, I guess, kind of did it for me taking him seriously as an actor.Him being so good looking and talented made me start to appreciate his efforts again as he is maturing like a fine wine; better with age.Brad brings such tenderness to this part; his narration of the film was just as moving as the acting. I hope he continues to make great choices like this in years to come; women be damned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Movie About An Unusual Life Versus Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1920 American author F.Scott Fitzgerald wrote a short story about a man who born resembling an old person and dies younger. This short story was a great account about time passages and its importance over many ages, and other issues like the prejudice of society towards people of different ages, because Benjamin never looks like a person of his own age. He's 7 years old but it looks someone with 80 years old. After many attempts in transform this short story (since the 1970's Hollywood tried to make this film) into a feature film David Fincher (Zodiac, Seven) finally got the chance to direct this incredible and powerful movie with a great cast, amazing technical works and a touching and captivating story. Well, let's say: it came in a good time. Scott Fitzgerald's story lacked an deep look over many aspects of life, it was just a way to reduce Benjamin's life to some funny and awkward situations. In the movie, the screenwriters Eric Roth and Robin Swicord took the basis of the original story and created something different, something more passionate, added many points of view and in the end the result is excellent.The story begins in 2005, in New Orleans few moments of Hurricane Katrina's advance to the city. In a hospital an elderly woman is dying and her daughter (Julia Ormond) is asked to read a old diary that she kept. The diary contains the story of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), since his birth in 1918 as an elderly man until his last remaining days as a baby. But in the middle of all that there's all his precious and difficult moments. Abandoned by his father (Jason Flemyng) and left in a asylum he's adopted by Queenie Mama (Taraji P. Henson) a religious woman that believes that Benjamin was a miracle of God and accepts him likes her own son. The story also follows Benjamin's love interests. His first and eternal love was Daisy (younger version played by Elle Fanning, when older's played by Cate Blanchett), the granddaughter of one the ladies of the asylum. With Daisy Benjamin feels complete, and life seems to be an beautiful adventure. The second interest is a rich married woman (Tilda Swinton) that he met on a hotel during the war years after he join as an sailor on Captain Mike's boat. Benjamin lives like an ordinary person. He married, he worked, he had a children, and many other things but the time works differently to him. As we seen in the beginning there's a story of a watchmaker (Elias Koteas) that designed a clock to run backwards because he lost his son in the First World War and wanted that people remember that if we could back in time great things would happen and many lives wouldn't be shattered. To Benjamin time's strange, fatal but he lives the moment no matter what it takes. And love was the greatest gift he could ever receive. It really makes one look to it's own life and sees that no time can be wasted, all the moments counts because life isn't measured in hours, minutes or seconds but in the good and bad moments everyone has. One thing Benjamin has in common with all of us. Just like Bowie's song: "Time may change him but he can't trace time". I must compare the film and the short story because I get different reactions with both. The short story left me thinking over the subject and the result one can get is that this theme is depressing. The movie seemed to went to the same direction but when you see the whole journey and all the thing that were created for this movie you might think differently. There's something positive about it. Eric Roth wrote not only this film but he's well known to be the writer that pick a small and good work and changes into something bigger and better. "The Insider" was a little newspaper article that becomes a explosive and excellent movie; "Forrest Gump" was a funny and critical book and then Eric wrote an tremendous screenplay. Many people will compare Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button in many levels. Not only the writer is the same but the main plot about a man's life journey is the same. Personally I liked more "Forrest Gump" because it was something I watched often during childhood and the performances were better. But "Benjamin" has tremendous good performances by Pitt, Blanchett, Henson, Swinton, Flemyng and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. The special effects and the makeup are the biggest rewards of this film, everything was made beautifully, giving the public the chance to see Brad Pitt evolves from older to younger. The music by Alexandre Desplat evocate sadness to the magical and mysterious world of Benjamin. My only and minor disappointment was the cinematography that in many moments are very very dark, that aspect wasn't needed in such a beautiful movie. It could've used some lighter tons. Fincher leaves the killers and psychopaths and enters in a more humanistic world. His entrance in this world was great, thrilling, making one of the best movies I ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly wonderful and powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if you've not watched this film yet then go see it, its a beautiful film. brilliantly crafted by one of my favourite and best directors around "David Fincher"...... both the leads in this should of won Oscars, especially Brad Pitt. Just seeing him going through the aging process backward in the film is beyond brilliance. Cate Blanchett is very good too as the women Brad Pitts character loves in the film. All of the actors really give it their personnel best in this timeless classic. The film is fairly straight forward even though it is weird, Brad Pitts character was born old and through the years of his life he starts to grow younger and younger. It's just an epic journey through the life of what this man comes across. The film is on for about 3 hours but when I watched it that time went very quick. I do think longer films are so much better than short ones for the fact that they are more descriptive and you can get amazed by the story more. I'm so glad this won 3 Oscars even though it could have won more. It's not Fincher's best work but it's sure a film that won't be forgotten........ 10/10....... j.d seaton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exercise in Complete, Cynical Pointlessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On here, I've read a lot of reviews from users who abhor this film, and they give their reasons for hating it. The truth is, this film isn't bad - it's certainly not an awful film. It's just a film that's ultimately pointless and a complete waste of time; literally considering that's what the film's central plot device is.Think of it like this; you're listening to somebody talk - say, a politician - and this politician goes on and on and on, and he tries to explain things that we already know for 3 straight hours. Then suddenly he stops and the speech is over. What have we learnt from this speech? Absolutely nothing.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is exactly the same. It's a film that tries to tell us something (at length) but ultimately says nothing we didn't already know outside of some paraphrased, ersatz-Confucian drivel you'd find in any fortune cookie - "all we are is dust in the wind, dude", etc.By no means am I stating the film is terrible, mind you. I'm stating explicitly that this film is completely pointless. It tries to teach us something but from the teachings we learn nothing. It's a film with all the good intentions at heart, it's a film about morality and existence, and understanding what's important while we are all still alive - but it's nothing we didn't already know, frankly.Pretentious, condescending, tedious, heart-achingly melodramatic and ultimately a complete waste of time, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film that - whilst avoiding blatant and obvious cliché with a potentially unique premise for a story, offers the viewer nothing new with its message.Ironic, really, that a film whose central message is to tell me that I shouldn't waste my time on earth has resulted in me wasting three hours of my time on this earth watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my favorite movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew me away and I have read many reviews of this movie being boring or too long, I think this movie is a perfect length. More movies should be this long to build better plot lines just like this one. I have to say after I watched this movie I was speechless for 10 minutes. Which is the exact score I give this movie. David Fincher has to be one of my favorite directors, from movies like "Zodiac" and "Fight Club". Fincher once again stole, dare I say, my heart with his incredible plot line of a life of a strange man such as Benjamin Button. Its a lot like Forrest Gump's life except not just the highlights of Gump's but all of Benjamin's highs and lows. I really felt like i knew him at the end of the movie which is an amazing thing to know after only a little over 3 hours, compared to hearing every story of my Grandparents in years of knowing them of course. I was very disappointed that "Slumdog Millionaire" beat this movie in the Oscars. I also think if it wasn't for Sean Penn, Brad Pitt deserved a Oscar for such a deep role. It may not be his most Iconic but definitely Brad Pitt at his best. Every Actor and Actress in this movie deserved all the praise and respect they got for this movie. This is one of the few movies in my life I've seen that I would definitely give, if possible, over 4 stars.It is a must see hit that i will recommend to every future generation in my family. It will be my family's "Forrest Gump". Not every movie is perfect but this movie comes very damn close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just another Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" (2008) is the thinking man's "Forrest Gump" (indeed, the two films were penned by the same screenwrite, Eric Roth). It is a quietly tragic tale of one man's very unique journey through the 20th Century. Directed to near perfection by David Fincher, the film is not only a well crafted fairy tale, but also a meditation on age and the unrelenting passage of time. Based upon a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, "Button" follows the titular character from his birth as an elderly infant on through to his death in a similar state. This breadth of material explains the film's near 3-hour running time, and causes things to become a bit unwieldy now and then. There is a framing gimmick involving Daisy (Benjamin's love interest, played by Cate Blanchett with her usual elfin grace) upon her death bed, recounting to her daughter the tale of Benjamin Button. This element wouldn't be so bothersome if it didn't cut into the proper film so much; each time it does, it's like cold water dowsing a soothing flame. Apart from this, the film is nearly flawless.Conjured with the same meticulous beauty as most other Fincher films, "Button" crafts a golden vision of the 20th century that is both nostalgic and authentically real. The camera lingers on just the right detail at just the right time; a character's expression or the cresting sunrise. The cinematography is immaculate and delicious. Paramount among the films qualities, however, is the acting. Taraji P. Henson brings just the right amount of tenderness and wisdom to the role of Queenie, Benjamin's surrogate mother, to keep it from lapsing into caricature. Tilda Swinton is watchable as always as a British aristocrat who carries on a short affair with Benjamin. On parallel double duty are Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt as fated lovers Daisy and Benjamin. This is their film; all other players, while skillful, are here only to shepherd these two through the story.This film displays some of the finest age work in the history of cinema. The practical make up is subtle and convincing, but more importantly the performances are spot on. Blanchett especially manages to capture decrepit old age surprisingly well for a woman of only 39; her eyes take on just the right kind of weariness, her voice is wise and aching to just the right degree. She takes Daisy on a bittersweet journey from young adulthood to middle age right on through to death's door. Similarly, Brad Pitt gives maybe his greatest (definitely his subtlest) performance. He is tasked with first giving a digital performance for the film's initial third. Much akin to the method that brought Gollum to life in "The Lord of the Rings", Pitt had his face recorded by a computer and then pasted onto older and shorter actors to realize Benjamin as an elderly looking child. This might be the finest example yet of this very new technique, and it is very much the focus of first part of the film. But once Pitt takes on full acting responsibilities, providing not only his face but this whole, real body, Benjamin becomes the quiet little center that the noisy universe of the film revolves around. Pitt's work in this film confirms what I've suspected for awhile - that he is in fact a character actor in a leading man's body. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is cinematically melodic. It is not only the thinking man's "Forrest Gump", it is the anti-Gump.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Twas amazing. Best effects film in ages (not just awesome effects, but a real movie magic feeling comes from this that we kinda take for granted in the 21st Century with effects today). Ages, being really, I guess, since event effects films like Titanic, The Matrix, Jurassic Park and Forrest Gump. Not about animation, where amazing things happen every year in film, e.g.Wall-E, but visual effects blending with real live action. Along the lines of the successes of the Star Wars, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films recently. But those are so filled with animation and obviously computer-enhanced realities that the "magic" one feels by the use of less effects to create more illusion is a bit missing. Course, this was not about Two-Face in The Dark Knight stuff, not just like that with its half live action, half animated face, or even like a fully believable Golem in LotR, this was a movie where everything was fairy tale and everything was immediately touched with a sense of photographic trickery, but where you just couldn't tell exactly what was make-up and what was CGI, or what was an illusion or real... even though a lot of the tricks are clearly there. You know you're looking at Brad Pitt's face on an actor who is probably about 10 yrs old, with CGI and makeup all doing their best, but you're just not interested in thinking about that. Subjective of course, that's just what I felt. Plus, the movie was really eloquent on the subjects of our perception of age and beauty. It's a tragedy though. Like Forrest Gump in some ways, even if Forrest Gump was a cultural satire and a journey through the American Experience since the 60s, this was a similar feat of storytelling on film. Won't say much more, don't want any spoiling here. Verging on "a little too perfect", though, also... and I do some negative criticisms, but you should definitely see it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give me Gump any day...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this might be difficult for some to hear, but just bear with me: the fact that "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is getting such high praise is indicative of how shallow and easily entertained Americans have become. Not one time in the nearly three hours of watching this film did I ever become emotionally involved with Benjamin Button or any of the other characters, something which is extremely important if you are trying to keep the audiences' attention for that length of time. The potential was there, with a long and winding story rivaling that of "Forrest Gump" (no surprise there, as Eric Roth worked on both), but there were several reasons why this film fell flat where the other found its way into the Pantheon of great films.The main reason, as I mentioned before, is the lack of emotional involvement with any of the characters in the film. When making an epic movie, or any movie for that matter, the goal is to make the audience invested in characters. Love them, hate them, feel sorry for them, whatever, but the goal is to make us react emotionally to the people we see on screen. In "Benjamin Button", the only thing that gives us a slight reason to be interested in the main character is his strange predicament. We begin with a Caucasian child who is born old and decrepit, and as a result abandoned by his well-to-do father. He is found and taken in by a kind African American woman who works in a rest home, and in the subsequent years he begins to age in reverse. The issues surrounding such a situation could convey potent insight into aging, race, ageism, love, marriage, parenting, being a step-child, etc. What we get, however, is a stoic child who drifts easily through childhood into adulthood without ever experiencing any particular challenges and/or failure (any of the things that might, I don't know, build character). The patented blank gaze of Brad Pitt (think of his role as Death in Meet Joe Black) accompanies us through year after year of rest home domesticity until our main character finally decides to leave town. But what a town it is! He is never heckled, ridiculed, or treated differently than any other person despite his bizarre physical condition, his creepy fixation on the daughter of a resident of the rest home, or the fact that he is a white child being raised by a black woman. There isn't even a single incidence of racial bias despite all the interracial relationships in the film. I didn't realize that everyone in New Orleans in the early twentieth century was free of racism and xenophobia. What a great time it must have been! The next section, which include all of his years spent traveling, include a random assortment of characters, some more developed than others, but none who contribute anything particularly meaningful to the plot. As a matter of fact, the whole section involving the wife of the British spy (Tilda Swinton) could have been completely left out and it wouldn't have made a difference to the film as a whole. And the same goes for the watered down version of Lieutenant Dan, Captain Mike (Jared Harris). Whereas the narration gives us a hint of emotional connections to people and places, or even the occasional philosophical tidbit of insight into the nature of man, the acting completely fails to convey these things. Even in the scene where Captain Mike dies, Benjamin sits coldly by watching it all transpire. In fact, that seems like all Benjamin ever does. He watches, not necessarily thinking or studying or learning, the emotional equivalent of a camcorder.The last place to look, and the sole idea supposedly driving much of the film, is his eternal love for Daisy. Forget for a moment, if you can, the creepy early encounters between a wrinkled old/young Benjamin and the Lolita-esquire Daisy, and focus on the adult interactions between the two. There are a bare minimum of scenes including any wooing, chivalrous acts by Benjamin, or emotional connections between the two (which is typical of male-female relationships in F. Scott Fitzgerald's works, such as the short story this film is based on, but still). Does she ever express any desire to do anything besides jump his bones? While sex on a gazebo, or sex on a boat, or sex on a beach might show us how physically passionate they are towards each other, it does nothing to indicate any deeper emotional connection between the two. It goes from awkward to entirely sexual and then back to awkward again, or, from our angle, disturbing to arousing and back to disturbing. That's not the kind of enduring love that great movies are based on. By the time Forrest finally consummated his love for Jenny, we could feel it, yearn for it, and appreciate it the way he did because we had seen all he had gone through to finally win her heart. This is exactly what is missing in "Benjamin Button".I understand what the film makers were trying to do. They had an interesting concept to build on, they certainly had a big budget, and they hired popular actors to fill most of the main roles. But somewhere in the casting, direction, or writing, they forgot what the main point of a movie is: to make us care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Um...are you people serious?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like this movie. If you liked this movie, you were conned. Fooled by a bad movie disguised as a great epic sensational story about life death love and how it all makes absolutely no sense. I can't help but notice the many flaws in the plot that many other reviewers have already covered. And how these issues weren't enough to ruin this movie for some people is beyond me. Imagine Forrest Gump saying, "you know what, there's always this peculiar white feather that's always floating around me when something significant happens." Well, this is literally the case in this film. And who can ignore the fact that the script is a complete (almost scene for scene) rehash of Forrest Gump? This watered down movie received predetermined and obvious emotional responses from its fast food audience. I wasn't having any of it. By the 3rd time the "old lightning guy" does his thing, I wasn't surprised that fools in the audience were still laughing and actually thought it was a funny bit to begin with. Nearly all the humor in the movie was corny and trite. I literally shook my head after each scene. Not because I didn't get it, but because there was nothing to get. Yet this movie keeps getting reviews claiming cinematic perfection. Far from it.Now visually the movie is indeed wonderful. But so is a reprint of a famous painting. Please give me something original! I will say the films score was beautiful. And while the acting wasn't all that bad (considering the script of clichés they had to work with) I wouldn't herald it as anything too impressive. I've never read F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story and neither has Brad Pitt according to the recent Rolling Stone interview. Doesn't that bother you? Usually when a movie with this magnitude of reviews ends, there's a sense of movie magic that sweeps over the audience as the credits roll. Yet, when this movie ended, there was no applause and no feeling that the audience as a whole connected to the movie. There were the random people crying at the end and I looked at them like they were aliens. Movies have made me cry before, but it has to be genuine. You knew for 3 hours that Brad Pitt's character was going to die. How can you get upset? The supporting characters leave the movie all of a sudden and with no real value to them in the first place. They completely ignore huge departures of main characters and drivel over the deaths of insignificant ones. Blatant reuses of ideas from Big Fish too. I longed for my own deathbed after 3 hours of this nonsense. Emotionally driven scenes ruined with an attempt at humor. Kate Blanchett: "I have to pee." And why did they have to step on the damn baby in the beginning? Couldn't they have just looked down? Or heard it crying? Who writes this crap? And Benjamin's father felt more like he was cruising' for a young stud than trying to reconnect with his long lost son. I won't even waste my time ridiculing the useless hurricane Katrina subplot. Maybe this is a film for morons who didn't get Forrest Gump because its high concept went over their heads. I'm being sarcastic.Apparently I'm not the only person in the universe who didn't like this movie. Thanks to all the other honest and educated moviegoers for leveling the playing field with their own Ben Button reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fincher's reputation soared last year after the release of his impressive 'Zodiac,' but 'Benjamin Button' takes him back down a peg. It even makes you wonder if 'Zodiac's' obsessive intensity was really self-aware or just a mindless offshoot of blind ambition. The new movie develops an elaborate conceit based on a Scott Fitzgerald story about a man who ages in reverse. But whatever ironies about human mortality (and vanity) one might be led to ponder are muffled because 'Forest Gump' writer Eric Roth is satisfied with producing a superficial historical tour bristling with platitudes. The big budget production is impressive in the special effects and makeup categories, but Fincher falls into the Hollywood trap of going for a gimmick rather than an idea, technique rather than art. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett diligently go through their paces as the lovers who meet in the middle (when both are roughly the same age) during a decades-long romance otherwise frustrated, both before and after, by Benjamin's oddity. But with three narrative voices pushing the relentless arc of devolution, most of the time the stars are only pawns in the conceptual game.Unlike several E.L. Doctorow protagonists not to mention Forrest Gump himself, this picaresque hero marches through history without getting into contact with major figures or great events. In fact he doesn't do anything particularly interesting. His button manufacturer dad (Jason Flemyng) thinks him a monster and after his wife dies in childbirth on the last day of WWI in 1918 drops the wrinkled, sclerotic infant on the doorstep of an old people's home, an appropriate enough home base for him, for the next decade or so anyway. He's adopted by the home's presiding spirit, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Queenie is a born again Christian and one of the movie's best scenes is a tent revival meeting where a black healer succeeds in getting the little shrunken Benjamin to hobble across the floor, then drops dead himself. (It's a colorful moment, but it doesn't build into anything.) Later Benjamin is spied by young Daisy (who will grow up into Cate Blanchett), who takes to him even as a gnarly little old man on crutches. Mr. Button senior hovers in the background and assists in Benjamin's first sex and first drink when he's aged back young enough to enjoy such things. Eventually he's sufficiently robust to go to sea and sticks to that long enough to be involved in WWII at sea--but as a survivor, not a hero.The frame tale is a hospital scene where a very cosmetically aged Blanceett lies dying in New Orleans on the verge of hurricane Katrina while her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) reads to her from Benjamin's diary. It really turns out that it's the expiring Daisy who has brushed with greatness. She was a dancer in her youth, the only American ever invited to perform with the Bolshoi Ballet, and Balanchine himself noted her perfect line. When a now more Brad Pitt-like Brad Pitt with a youthful face under wavy gray hair comes back from his long years at sea and looks up Daisy in New York, her conversation and friends are hip, but Benjamin, who tells somebody he's been "nowhere, except harbors," still seems a rube. His Louisiana drawl constantly suggests that he's slow on the uptake. In a brief affair with an edgy Brit diplomat's wife (Tilda Swinton) in Russia, he says virtually nothing. Ross and Fincher are pushing the empty vessel thing a bit too hard. Or is this maybe Andy Warhol in disguise? Pitt can be mad fun, as he was in his brief but memorable turns in 'Thelma and Louise,' 'True Romance,' and 'Snatch,' and his recent buffoonery in the Coens' 'Burn After Reading.' Or he can be bland and cloying, as in 'Meet Joe Black,' 'Seven Years in Tibet', or here. The Botox and cosmetic surgery fanciers' novelty of this movie is to wait for the moment when Brad finally reaches his own age, the forties, and then is cosmetically de-aged back to a gorgeous, sexy 'Thelma and Louise' charmer. But instead of having the con-man edge he had in Ridley Scott's movie, this time under his boyishly pretty makeup sheen he's just a dumb-looking adolescent. It's the movie's biggest disappointment, given that it only delivers in the visuals and effects categories, not as mature drama.For all its production values, this is just a workmanlike progression through the decades, and it quite lacks the hallucinatory beauty of Tarsem Singh's 'The Fall,' the one cinematic visual triumph of the past year. We've seen Blanchett in lots of prosthetics already before now. This time she even gets a prosthetic body, since somebody else does her ballet dancing for her. As for Pitt, he gets his head mounted on the top of a gnarly little man in a wheelchair. Ultimately 'Benjamin Button' doesn't excite in any category. As a picaresque tale it's a washout because its protagonist's adventures are so mundane. In the realm of thought it never gets above the level of saws like "nothing lasts" and the reminder that aging, in either direction, can be scary--especially if sped up. Even in special effects and visuals it ultimately fails because its characters aren't interesting enough to care about. Oh yes: the prosthetics, CGI alterations and makeup are great. But the screenplay is a dud and the musical background reduces every scene to an even greater level of simpering sweetness than it has already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"One of the best movies of 2008"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' has been transformed into a splendid film by David Fincher. A marvelously made film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best movies of 2008. The cast is terrific and director David Fincher beautifully puts together the tale of Benjamin's life. The only large flaw many will find is that the concept of the film's premise seems too unrealistic.The film tells the life of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). Born as an old man, Benjamin ages backwards; gradually getting younger as those around him age normally. Benjamin is abandoned at birth and picked up at an old-age home. As a child - or rather as a hunched over 80 year old - he meets a girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett). Together they engage in innocent child games, and through this they develop a special connection. As Benjamin goes off into the world, Daisy continues to grow up, later pursuing her dream of dancing. Benjamin joins a crew and sails round the world, ending up in Russia. Then, after Pearl Harbor, Benjamin joins in the war effort, following battles across the north Pacific and only engaging in one combat situation.Returning to New Orleans, Benjamin has grown taller, lost many of his wrinkles, and grown more hair. The visual effects are spectacular in following Brad Pitt through the various stages of his life. From an old man to a young teen, Benjamin always resembles Pitt. Upon arrival in his childhood home, Benjamin learns that many of the tenants he knew have passed on. This is the tragedy of aging backwards, those you knew continue to age forward as they exit this world while you do the opposite. Benjamin also meets Daisy again, who after many years has become a successful dancer and has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Long gone is the innocence of childhood, and Daisy has become intimate with many men in New York City. Missing by an inch, she and Benjamin do not initiate a relationship until later in the film.Narrated from the present, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button starts with Daisy's daughter reading Benjamin's diary to her mother in a hospital on the cusp of Hurricane Katrina. This allows the narration to occasionally halt for an elderly Daisy to comment on events of her life. A key motif running throughout this film is time. Beginning and ending with sequences about the same clock, David Fincher seems to allude to the notion that things fade, and that we must hold on to the things we love in the time we have with them.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantastic film. Beautifully created, David Fincher paints an image of the south of the United States in the early 1900s which seems both realistic and fantastical. The film also illustrates war, travel, death, and many of the other events of life. Brad Pitt shows emotional depth as Benjamin, and Cate Blanchett is terrific as Daisy. It is surprising how much we can take away from a 166 minute movie, the audience feels as if they have known Benjamin and Daisy for all of their lives. While some may question the premise of the film, arguing that time is linear and that the plot is therefore incoherent, there can be no arguing that this film does its best to develop human relationships and to establish emotional connections between characters. As Roger Ebert once said, "A film is not about its subject; it's about how it's about its subject", and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button certainly handles its subject material splendidly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this movie in my local "Odeon" cinema this past Sunday.Now i had extremely high expectations for this one and it didn't quite live up to them. This is not to say it wasn't a good film as from my rating you can see i gave it an eight it was a brilliant film just not quite as gripping or "amazing" as a lot of other people seem to have thought.The story is obviously the highlight it really is beautiful and the director and the actors involved all helped portray it in the best possible way they could to be honest which was not an easy task. This really was a film that could have been easily screwed up but it wasn't! Pitt and Blanchett's performances were great from Pitt playing a small wrinkly young man! to some really brilliant scenes involving the both of them together.The film has quite a few "emotional" parts portrayed in the story and 80% of the time they work. There are other times some of the scenes i felt didn't really pack a strong enough punch and you didn't really feel any sort of emotion towards anyone involved.I seem to have said this about a lot of films of late but it's true it ran at 3hours 10 minutes including the usual ridiculous promotion before the film gets going but like the staff promised us before entering this film it will not bore you nor does it drag on it really is a pleasure to watch. It really is the sort of film that is halfway to being a masterpiece a lot more could have been done to secure it's place in film history but to be honest it could have been a bad film and it certainly was not that.I feel a few of the category's it has been nominated in at the Oscars it deserves to win.Overall it's a wonderful film with a great story backed up with some outstanding performances. Go in with no expectations and it might be one of your all time favourites. I wish i had not grown such high expectations of the film as i might have enjoyed it further. However a second time round i feel is one day in order! 8/10</fullReview>

With a running time of over 2hrs 30 mins a film needs to be something special to keep me entertained for that long and I was not disappointed. Brad Pitt was on top form and the direction of the movie was fantastic. The premise of someone born with the physicality of a dieing old man and growing younger over time was dealt with in such a beautiful way that you don't want it to finish, and emotions are triggered at several points in the movie. When you get the chance don't watch anything else, watch this. You will not regret it....trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" last night. I can't resist a new David Fincher film. It deviates wildly from the F. Scott Fitzgerald story (which could be why I liked it so much). The performances, make up, and directing are all amazing. The screenplay is a little slow and meticulous (Eric Roth also wrote the screenplays for Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer, Munich, The Good Shepherd) but the directing made it work perfectly (give me Fincher over Mann, DeNiro, Redford, Spielberg or Zemeckis any day). It really doesn't feel like a two and a half hour film.I could easily envision Oscar wins for Fincher, Taraji Henson, Brat Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Be warned - it is a bit of a tear jerker. It deals with mortality quite a bit, as well as the usual heady subjects of love, loss, war, and redemption... with just the right touches of passion and joy.10 out of 10</fullReview>

It was an entirely different experience from watching his previous works like 'Fight Club', 'The Game' and 'Alien3' which had more energy and adrenaline. It is a more 'mature' movie in comparison.Fincher is known for being a very stylistic director but here he uses a gentler tone that is rather subtle and quiet. The art direction is simply amazing. Fincher uses a sepia lighting that takes one back in time and adds to the nostalgia (this especially contrasts well with the modern day hospital scenes that use a cold lighting). The makeup department does a splendid job by disguising Pitt and Blanchett and physically demonstrating the aging of their characters. The camera-work is equally wonderful. Editing is sharp. The gentle soundtrack is lovely and flows beautifully with the story. Fincher beautifully tells the story about the life of Benjamin Button. The story mainly revolves around Benjamin Button's curious case of aging backwards but what I liked most about it was his complex love story with Daisy followed by Queenie's motherly devotion towards him. The remarkable dialogues are poetic and philosophical. I have always thought of Brad Pitt as an average actor overall. But there have been a few movies where he nailed the part and 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is one such example. Though many would argue that Pitt doesn't 'act' much in the movie because he's quiet, who says that acting has to be loud or even vocal? If anything, this movie shows Pitt growing as an actor and he is very able to successfully downplay roles that demand to be played with subtlety. Cate Blanchett is incredibly beautiful and is phenomenal as the vibrant Daisy. Taraji Henson is lovely and adorable as Benjamin's mother who loves him unconditionally. This actress delivers a spirited performance and she's a scene stealer. Jason Flemyng, Julia Ormond and Tilda Swinton shine in their roles.'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' was a unique experience because of its treatment of the material. The story itself is derived of a novel concept but it is Fincher's presentation and treatment that makes it one of a kind and hooks the viewer from start to finish. Above all, this is his accomplishment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Lasts Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a cold night on the eve of WWII in Russia, a diplomat's wife (Tilda Swinton) shares tea with a most peculiar tugboat man named Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). When she asks him where is he from, Benjamin replies, "New Orleans...Louisiana." Swinton's character replies, "I didn't think there was any other." This moment comes about forty minutes into the film which has been established on the grounds of a woman (Julia Ormond) reading to her dying mother (Cate Blanchett) from the diary of Benjamin Button as Hurricane Katrina sweeps over New Orleans. The ghost of a New Orleans now lost haunts David Fincher's lyrical adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story about a man who ages backwards. There's no denying this film couldn't have been made five years ago, not only because the technology wasn't there to make the process of aging backwards look real, but it would've also been a completely different movie as screenwriter Eric Roth wouldn't have been able to bookend the film with Blanchett on her deathbed as Hurricane Katrina comes to literally wipe away her life. The story is hung on a gimmick, and the film told as a fable, but there's grounding in the reality of life's greater mysteries that speaks volumes about not just the death of a man or a woman, but the death of a city and the death of a way of life.A big part of making the audience believe in the story falls on the film's technical aspects: the make-up, the CGI, the period-piece details of the film's set designs and costumes. If you look close enough, you can find things to nitpick, like the distracting disembodied voice of Cate Blanchett distorted onto a little girl, but for the most part Fincher constructs it all seamlessly. In terms of scope and sentiment, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" seems a complete departure for a director usually obsessed with darker more violent tales, but Fincher has always liked his plots to begin (think "Seven" or "Panic Room") or end (think "The Game" or "Fight Club") with a gimmick, and he's always been a filmmaker obsessed with cutting-edge technology (think of the VIPER camera used to film "Zodiac"). Fincher does a superb job with his meticulous construction of these elements (complimented nicely by Alexandre Desplat's subdued score), and he really wins the audience over with his flashbacks within flashbacks that are done in a charmingly stylized manner that remind us we're watching a movie that's meant to be enjoyed above any other pretense.By shifting the central location of the story from the original setting of Baltimore to New Orleans, Roth opens the film up to a new layer of interpretation. Though the episodic tale of Pitt's Benjamin growing younger while Blanchett's Daisy grows older spans the globe from Manhattan to Russia to Paris, the characters' hearts remain united in New Orleans. Roth, who also penned the thematically similar "Forrest Gump" peppers his screenplay with many momentous events from the 20th Century, but those moments ebb and flow through Benjamin's life just as the other characters do showing us that life is made only of moments. None of them last forever.The supporting players (including a gutsy performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother who runs a nursing home) are wonderful and allow Pitt and Blanchett to shine as the movie stars that they are. Sure, these two have probably given better performances elsewhere, but here they have been given roles for which they might be best remembered long after their star-power has dimmed.In a year when the films with the most impact (like "The Dark Knight") have been those that have tapped into the fears and mindset of the times we live in, it's rather fitting that a movie like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" comes along at the end of the year. It should be one of those movies that hold audiences rapt in hushed silence, but it's also the type of movie that usually receives instant backlash. I wonder how it will stand up over time. On the surface it attempts to tell a timeless tale, but in a bittersweet way proves the opposite. Movies stars like Pitt and Blanchett, movies like this, stories, fables, dreams, cities like New Orleans...none of these things are timeless. Timelessness is just a flight of the imagination...like the idea of a man aging backwards. But what a wonderful flight it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enchanting and wonderful fairy tale of an extraordinary man who lives a rather ordinary life in both moments of drama and unexpected love. And he lives it all in reverse!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" though a fairy tale film of wonder, excitement and joys of unexpected moments broadens it's themes more in depth by showing the joys of life and love. Adapted from a short story from F. Scott Fitzgerald the direction from David Fincher(one who's known for his dark thrillers like:"Seven")is beautiful as many scenes were done so well with the wizard of computer magic and top notch camera work. Yet most catching of all is it's message proving that each have an expected path in life everybody has a fate. Yet this the main character lives his in a most unusual way he lives it backwards! Just imagine escaping the norm as we are so use to living and being in existence from birth being young and living life till our old body gives out. Only how about trying it in reverse! This film has star Brad Pitt(Benjamin Button) who's born as an 80 year old and during his life span he ages backwards all the way to an infant. Yet from the beginning of his start in New Orleans at the doorstep of an old folks home his life spans thru the years from his meeting of people and friends to travels and journeys of memories that anyone would cherish.Beginning with Button's friendship early on when he befriends a little female Daisy(wonderful performance from Cate Blanchett)and many years later as Benjamin starts to gain his youth he once again meets up with Daisy along the way after she's became a successful ballet dancer and the two will develop a passionate romance and love story that anyone would dream of it was just so true and simple.The film even though long moves well with it's journey of drama and life discovery for Benjamin as it's memorable for his working and making a living on a tugboat. And his first love and his being seduced by an elegant and sophisticated married lady(played gracefully by Tilda Swinton). The film is clearly a journey of life's common ups and downs that are common for all yet this man's story of age and living is most uncommon.Overall this film is a masterpiece of joy told thru flashback it's a real taste of a historical journey of love, drama, and changing and most of all it shows to be happy with yourself no matter what. It's fairy tale and magic theme is well enjoyed as the wonder and thrill to see of how one can age backwards and still enjoy life, have success and discover love is amazing. Remember everyone is different, it's okay to be different and everyone lives and does life in a different way. That's what this epic masterpiece of a film shows it's clearly an emotional, and touching picture to love for the way it shows how life can be in a different order yet still it shows that it can be memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rich, generous Christmas present to anybody who truly loves movies --their art &amp; their power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>('Til today I thought TDK was going to the best movie of '08.)Make no mistake about it this is David Fincher's best film! ...Button has all the power of Seven but for entirely different emotional reasons.This is a warm, thoughtful, thought-provoking, heart breaking, uplifting example of what happens when great writing meets visual artistry.The only thing I'll say about about the story is that it is about the love of Life &amp; Death &amp; Love. Those of you who --like me-- who were looking for the ultimate Twilight Zone episode will not be disappointed. It is a love story. It has a love of language. It is complex. It is beautifully acted. It breathes (it is nearly 3 hours long because it had to be). It uses lightning as a punchline over &amp; over again to great effect.Fincher has always been a Michaelangelo, a Rembrandt, a DaVinci when it comes to visuals &amp; he at the height of his powers here. If you are not seduced by what you see then Button may bore you. There are frames in this film that I could stare at for long, long minutes rather than the few seconds that they appear on screen.HOWEVERNo movie works if the story doesn't grab you. Obviously this one has it. Visuals aside, it is a delight to listen to as well as look at.The performances from a large cast lead by Brad Pitt &amp; Cate Blanchett are wonderful.I've read some early reviews that the movie is ultimately cold --a common Fincher rap. It has Fincher's trademark intellect (if he hasn't trademarked it yet, he should). IT IS NOT COLD. It has the emotional power of a tugboat bring in a wrecked liner.Others criticize Button for being too much of a good thing &amp; that it has too many elements &amp; it does. And I'd rather have a film try too hard then try too little.You had to wonder why they waited until Christmas Day to release this film. The answer arrives when you see it because it is the only day they could have released it. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is Santa's (and Fincher &amp; crew') present to people who truly love movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar nominations or not, this is the most boring movie I've seen since MEET JOE BLACK. It's sad to see so much talent and effort gone to waste but what exactly is appealing about this story ? Why on God's name would a little girl and a seemingly old man find themselves bonded to each other ? Why don't either Guiness or Ripley stop by when all that is here is the ultimate freak story ?. The only fun I had throughout this movie was making a list of the similarities with Forrest Gump which run in the several dozens. The Katrina back-story could have been of interest but at the end, all they used it for is as an excuse to flood a room ! This movie has easily the best aging effects in history but you end up noticing you spend most of the time evaluating them instead of following the story which is the basic reason this movie fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously I Loved Benjamin Buttons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each and every day, we as humans face the cold hard fact that nothing lasts. We struggle to achieve various goals and joys in our lives, we want them to endure. The hard fact is deep down we know they wont. The film "THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON" is a true race against the clock. First I should say that this film is one of the most piercing, beautiful, and eccentric studio movies in recent memory, an exquisitely crafted film about memory, love, opportunity, and the passage of time. Set during the landfall of Hurricane Katrina, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is about to die, she wants to tell her daughter, Caroline (Julia Ormond) many things, she has been hiding them from her and she feels this will be her last opportunity. Daisy tells Caroline to read from a diary, when she does it is written in first person from the point of view of Benjamin Buttons. Benjamin was born on the day the great war ended, also Benjamin is a baby, but his body shows all the wear and tear of advanced age, including arthritis, cataracts, and a complete lack of elasticity to the skin. He's got a disturbing little-old-man face, but he's very much a baby in every other way. The moment Benjamin's father Thomas (Jason Flemyng) sees the baby, he snaps. His wife is in bed, hemorrhaging and sure to die, the result of giving birth to this twisted, diseased-looking baby. He grabs the baby and runs out into the streets, where all of New Orleans is celebrating the end of World War I. He wants to dump this creature, but he is seen by a police man who chases him from the waters edge. Thomas leaves the baby on the back steps of an old age home, as he leaves he shoves a few dollars into the baby's blanket, when Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) finds the baby. She decides she's going to raise him as her own, figuring that due to all the problems with his health, that won't be all that long anyway. And with this one act of cruelty and an equal act of kindness, Benjamin Button finds his place in the world and starts his very strange journey. There's a sense that Daisy and Caroline have been estranged, but she's at the hospital now. And thanks to the diary's collection of letters, photos and postcards, Caroline pieces together a story that completely changes her perception of her mother and, indeed, of herself. The diary is not just telling of Benjamin Buttons childhood but it gives Caroline an insight into the childhood of her own mother. Watching Ormond react as she's hit with all of these new ideas about who her mother was is quite moving. Benjamin's life is a lot of things over the years, goes through a lot of stages. Each of those encounters changes or shapes him, and none of them explode as high drama or melodrama. Instead, things have these slow-motion effects, detonations that are not felt immediately. One encounter is with tug boat Captain Mike (Jared Harris) who takes Benjamin to a whorehouse so he can be "with" a woman for the first time, he also gets him drunk for the first time. Than after Benjamin goes to New York to be with Daisy, she is with someone else, so Benjamin leaves and goes back to Captain Mike. They travel all over the world and Benjamin encounters Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton) in a hotel in Russia. What takes place between them is played with remarkable subtlety, and when it ends, it simply ends. The diary tells that when Daisy and Benjamin first meet, they're both children, emotionally speaking, and Daisy recognizes something in him, some kindred spirit. They bond, but he looks like a little old man and she's just a little girl, who is visiting her Grandmother Fuller (Phyllis Somerville). They both know it won't last. The next time they meet, in one of the film's most quietly painful sequences, he looks to be in his 50s. She's not quite 20 at this point, beautiful and ripe and young, and completely immature. She's willing to be with him, but maturity-wise, they're not ready to connect, and the encounter ends badly. It's only later, when the two of them reach the same age, after both of them have felt loss and sorrow and hurt, that they're able to approach each other as equals, as adults, with open eyes and open hearts. There is no bad guy introduced to steal Daisy's affections or to create some artificial tension in their relationship. Time is the only villain. And when they have a child and Benjamin realizes that he's not going to be able to be a real parent, time finally wins. He leaves again, setting off on the last leg of his journey alone. Along the way Benjamin meets his real father, has his first encounter with a prostitute, (Yasmine Abriel) learns about life and death, joins the war and sees death up close and personal. This is a heartfelt movie its not like being hit over the head, it makes it points ever so subtle like. The running time of this film is just over two hours and forty minutes and is due to be released at Christmas time. I give The Curious Case Of Benjamin Buttons a 4 and on my avoidance scale a 0, this is a great film, although there are a few slow moving scenes, when looked at as a whole this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have high hopes for this film, but I wanted to see it anyway as it looked very intriguing. I went to see it with two friends, and when we left the theater, we concluded that it was good but not that good. The next day we had all changed our minds, the film was excellent! It took some reflection (plus the fact we were distracted by a theater that was sweltering hot at about 85 degrees) to really see the beauty and simple message of the film.The acting is solid and well done across the board. Whoever cast this movie was genius, I wouldn't have changed one actor. Pitt and Blanchet were amazing at every age they portrayed. It wouldn't be the film it is without their incredible performances, they are truly believable and have great chemistry. Fincher directed an amazing piece of film. The CGI and effects were excellent, as well as great makeup jobs. I was really impressed by the color and artistry, not overdone but just right.The storyline is never confusing, but not quite predictable. I loved the humor of some of the characters that appear throughout the film. My biggest criticism is that the film was about 30 minutes too long. Looking back I can see where a few sections could've been shortened so not to prolong the inevitable.I definitely recommend this excellent film especially for those who love to be reminded of the important things in life and like to reflect on life's little metaphors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the writers titled his comment "I was just thinking about how nothing lasts...and what a shame that is..." Nothing lasts for reason - and it is not a shame at all. I am almost 76 y.o. and should last as long as can function and quality of my life is acceptable for me and my family. I am wondering how they have finished this chain of tedious, pointless, disjointed episodes. When this film will play on TMN I shall record it and fast forward. I couldn't stand it any longer. Old Daisy was lingering and lingering and I believe I was not the only one thinking: "Please die already". Abundance of made up emaciated ancient faces. Mocking some old man with his stories of being struck by the lightening 7 times (miraculously not repeating any of them). What was the meaning of all of it? I apologize if my unfortunate experience offends some people, who derived any emotional, artistic or other value from this film. After all I didn't see the whole thing. When Benjamin, who just acquired his proper last name, came to see Daisy with bouquet of daisies - that was toooo much and I couldn't stand it any longer as I said above.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few times I wanted to get up and walk out of a movie. The core concept is amazing - what if we aged backwards physically? but once we get past that, everything else falls apart. Just wanting to create another Forest Gump does not make it so.The narrative is so burdened by the vanity of the principal character that it looses its charm. Women audiences may swoon over Brad Pitt riding a bike but that has nothing to do with the story - his character would have done that in his youth even if he was aging like the rest of us.The director seems to be so overtaken by images (Lousiana setting sun) that he looses control of moving the story along.I will be scratching my head over the critical acclaim for this one for a long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweeping, visually enchanting Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is perhaps the only film in recent memory that has exceeded all my expectations for it.Let me start off by saying that the story of this film is perfect in every way. I found it was old-fashioned in a way, the way a man's life is explained through a journal. The sweeping feel of the film, perfectly balanced with a strong backstory, makes this film just more magical. The screenplay is perfectly written as a modern day fairy-tale. David Fincher has proved that he is capable of anything. This is not only his best film, but also one of the best achievements that a director has ever captured on screen. The pure poetry verses and lines that the film has are to resemble themes about life, death, and love. They were all perfectly balanced to make sense to the story.As much as this is a director's film, it has fabulous performances. Brad Pitt portrays each moment in Benjamin Button's life perfectly. His subtle acting as an old, yet juvenile man amazed me. To a greater extent, Cate Blanchett gave another amazing performance. Her role was not too flashy, but I think it helped her. I thought that she also did an amazing job playing the different moments and stages in her life. You could really feel her sadness, feelings, regret, and love as time passed by. The supporting performances were all fitting to the story and feel of the film, especially Tariji P. Henson's role as Benjamin's protective and loving mother.This film is absolutely perfect in every single art department. It probably has the best art direction of the decade. The costumes were perfect for the era of the film. The make-up is so amazingly done. The special effects are so first-rate. You could not even tell when, and how, they made younger and older versions of both Blanchett and Pit, whether it was make-up or visual effects at times. The music score was just so brilliant and soothing. One of the best I have ever heard. The cinematography was beautiful, thanks to the set designs. Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is truly the single best film of the year. It is a film that is gripping, and one that is very touching. It is a tragic love story at times, a sad film at times, an enjoyable film at other times. This is a perfect film for adults too, and for children. I have not said this to any films this year, but everyone, praise Benjamin Button! This is one of the best Motion Pictures of all time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a case of style over substance if I ever saw one, a movie that is all dressed up with no where to go. There is no point and no plot, but everything from the music to the dialog, asks us to suspend our critical thought, and take it on faith that it is as profound as it thinks it is. But then what could we expect from a movie based on nothing but a cute gimmick. "Hey let's have a guy who gets younger as life goes on". Everything that happens in this movie is predictable given this premise. For instance, of course he would meet a young girl, fall in love, and have a baby with her when their ages meet. This is in no way profound or interesting, it is just the most obvious gimmick to stack on top of the first one, and unfortunately how the movie would play out was obvious to me after only the first 10 minutes. The next two hours are just painful to watch, as the movie never deviates from the expected path, with no surprises and no depth, but still dripping with hollow emotional cues of false profundity, very much like those of a religious service. One star might be a little low but it is appropriate, given how overrated this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worthy of the rights to Fitzgerald's short story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has the audacity to claim that it is based on the short story "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" by the incomparable F. Scott Fitzgerald (published in 1922) who credits Mark Twain and Samuel Butler for the philosophical idea that 'it's a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end'.This film version of "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" did not retain any of the cogitative ideas presented in the book when a man ages backwards. So when watching, there is no deep thought-provoking concepts explored, and nothing to engage you in a philosophical exploration of life. I'm guessing that the only thing of value is supposed to be that part of the film has Brad Pitt looking not attractive. That is as far as Hollywood can take a good book.Clearly the film does have high production values and they may have done a lot of good things, but they lost their right to be judged fairly as a film once they bought the rights to Fitzgerald's story. Now nobody will even have a chance to see this great story brought to visual life, and that is a travesty.Please go to your local public library and borrow a copy of "Tales of the Jazz Age", you will be able to read the short story and get so much more out of it than the film and in less time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Faberge egg masterpiece of epic genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&nbsp; Eric Roth has hit another one waaay out of the ballpark with his brilliantly *loose* screenplay adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's original short story. Be prepared for a nearly three hour excursion into magical realism (with spectacularly seamless character effects), where time will fly as Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) ages in "reverse." The spirit and intent of the somewhat pedestrian FSF short story have been completely and lovingly transformed into a highly nuanced, cinematic Faberge egg masterpiece of epic genius. Substituting New Orleans for Baltimore permits the hurricane (that is ever looming) to be *Katrina* (with the washing away of all traces that might come to imply). Subtracting father Button (who figures so prominently in FSF's short) for most of the story also works to heightened effect. The story inventions of Caroline, Mr Gateau and his train station clock, Queenie ("'Nevah know what's comin' fer ya"), Mr Daws (Lightning Man), Daisy (and, implicit in that, a nod to Fitzgerald's Gatsby), Mr Oti, Capt Mike, hummingbirds and Elizabeth Abbott are all pure Roth, with nary a gleam in Fitzgerald's eye. Some of these embellishments might be dismissed as paint-by-numbers analogs lifted from Gump (which was also adapted from a lesser original source for the screen by our Good Scribe Roth), but I think most people will neither be offended, nor care. If you've payed attention, you know that none of these are Gump. tCCoBB is full of heart and laden with delicate symbolism. It stands fresh, with new revelations, even on a second viewing. If anything, tCCoBB is a more mature and polished work than Gump. The juxtapositions of time and point-of-view allow the story to steep in the best of two worlds -- Daisy's loving, yet unsentimental, *remembrance*, via Caroline's reading of BB's "last will and testament," on Daisy's deathbed, and the vicarious thrill of being a fellow traveller on BB's actual journey. Of course, an attentive audience figures out, well before Caroline does, what her relationship to BB is; but how can one not ache to see how she will come to take it, given that BB is now long gone? While there are many moments of pathos in this story, the film is ultimately inspirational and uplifting. David Fincher's directorial vision brings forth pitch perfect performances from the entire cast. Brad Pitt exceeded my every expectation. Not only is this his best work to date, it clearly establishes that he has developed acting chops that eclipse his long running reputation for good looks. Rather than deliver a "star turn," Pitt confidently and subtly inhabits Benjamin Button in a way that no other actor could. In addition to Pitt, the notable standouts (not by any ranking) are Henson, Harris, Blanchett (along with the two younger Daisy's) and Swinton. I find no fault with any of the other players (including the variously sized/aged Benjamin body doubles) that I fail to mention by name here. It absolutely *requires* a cutting-edge-tech savvy director like Fincher to juggle all of the elements of characters, locations, sets, plot/sequence/pacing *and* workhorse digital GG/VFX and make all of that *craft* disappear into a seemingly effortless work of art. It all looks, sounds and feels so organic. (The score is terrific, too.)It is important to add that I attended the advance screening solely on the basis of the astonishing cinematography, as glimpsed in the television trailers. Every frame in this nearly 100% digital shoot was composed and captured as if it were a painting, with all of the warmth and subtlety of an old school film shoot. There will be many award nominations for this film in all categories. People should be advised that the "make-up" is almost entirely state-of-the-art CG/VFX (digital facial mapping, combined with digital "make-up" effects, in some cases, grafted onto body doubles) that are as technically unobtrusive as (but vastly more elaborate than) all of the VFX that were in the English Patient (and Gump). (There will also be moments when some will wonder if one other Hollywood icon in particular, RR, made a cameo appearance.) This is easily the best film of the year (and that is said as much as I *love* Slumdog Millionaire). If you somehow manage to miss this film in the theater, you will have denied yourself the cinematic gift of the year. I can hardly believe that this is a "major studio" film. Bravo!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a lovely movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and one worth going to see simply for it's escapism.Loosely adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1921 short story by the same name, this is what going to the movies is all about. It offers escapism, it's full of delight. It's full of looking at life from a different perspective, something most of us don't do.I don't go to the movies to write critiques, I go to be entertained and to escape the regular humdrum of life, this movie fulfilled my desires. The nice thing about attending the session I did, it was a full house and people actually applauded at the end of the movie in appreciation of the acting and the concept of the story. You can't ask for more than that, despite what so called movie critics might write.Music, theatre, movies, acting in any form is very much a subjective thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible and yet a perfect fable for love, memory, aging, and life itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)Magical, bizarre, emotional, sentimental, gorgeous, profound, impossible.Thankfully the director of this amazing short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald was David Fincher. You can imagine how overblown and needlessly saccharine it might have been in the hands of a more centrist director (say James Cameron) or how needlessly fanciful and detached by a more visionary one (say Baz Luhrmann, who just released that other Fitzgerald adaptation, "The Great Gatsby"). Fincher shows a sense of psychology in the characters, and of probing how we all think through edgy, improbable situations (from "Fight Club" to "Se7en" to even the one-dimensional "Panic Room").I say "amazing" story because in fact the original story is even better than this really moving, excellent movie. (It left me weeping at the end.) So maybe start there. Google "Benjamin Button xroads" for the full (short) text.Or start here. The beginning makes clear the problem. A child is born an old man. Infant-sized (unlike the story) but with cataracts and arthritis and so on. And as he grows (and does not die as expected) he gets younger. Eventually he becomes a tottering Brad Pitt, and then an extremely handsome Brad Pitt. And then...well, what can happen as you get so incredibly young after six or eight decades?I know, I know, how ridiculous. But somehow Fitzgerald makes it all work, and Fincher pulls out that core for the story here. The biggest issues are love and death (as Woody Allen keeps reminding us). In love, you can see how it might be frustrating to fall in love with someone and then realize that as they get older you get younger and you end up literally growing apart. In death, the problem is even more profound, because even though the title character, Benjamin, seems to be lucky because he doesn't grow old, by his final years he ends up facing all the same problems--losing friends, losing his ability to function as he once did, and eventually, shutting down. Dying. (The final line of the book: "...and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether from his mind.")This gives nothing away, not really. It's how this happens that matters. And simply seeing it happen. This is where Fincher does such a solid, delicate job. There has been a lot of worthy talk about the effects used--aging people (in both directions), and working with the different eras so fluidly. The movie does span most of the 20th Century, ending with a Hurricane Katrina echo in the 21st. It's a visual masterpiece, for sure (much like "Hugo" is a computer-enhanced masterpiece in turn of the century France). But not once does an effect get in the way or announce itself. Pitt, it has to be said, is brilliant--and brilliantly restrained. Unlike his "restrained" role (one might say deadened) in "Tree of Life" we see here a subtle inner mind at work, an "old soul" with some wry wisdom and delight at being alive showing. He's sometimes played up for his looks alone (on purpose, and it made us laugh out loud at the poster-boy look he can pull off), but mostly he's just really convincing. Equally so, but with a smaller part, is the other main character, Cate Blanchett, who also ages (in the normal direction) and works through her years against the main character's.There are some additions to the movie that are moving and not Fitzgerald's, and some of them are unnecessary for the story, and maybe distractions or attractions depending on what you need from a movie. The biggest example is the way the story is told through reading a diary at the bedside of a dying woman in a hospital as a hurricane approaches and the lights flicker. It brings to mind "The Notebook" (which will make you cry even harder than this movie will), and it's not badly done, but is not actually helpful, either, except to give the plot and the characters more depth. Likewise, there are lots of little historic scenes thrown in for drama--World War II, for example--that are purely extra material. Good enough. But also more than enough, perhaps.Most of all the movie changes the love-affair of the story from a realistic and heartbreaking tale of aging and changing attraction to a very Hollywood "love is forever" kind of romance. It's fine, and you'll probably like the optimism, but Fitzgerald tapped into something more trenchant that Fincher was apparently afraid of. The movie is too long for sure, dragging at times. And it's too dreamy and sentimental for its own good, too, at least sometimes. It lacks some kind of puncturing force, wrapped up so nicely as it is. But see it, regardless. It's got too much to recommend it overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Radiant film-making. Good watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has been compared with Forest Gump and Big Fish, and justifies to some extent... With Fincher directing it, you can easily expect great cinematography, acting and effects... Lives upto it... Though, at one phase, movie slows down and one would have expected Fincher to come up with something unexpected! However, I loved a few small scenes, "The Accident Description", "The on- going 7 Lightning story", etc. to name a few... Probably not in par with Fincher's masterpieces but an example of radiant film-making :)"Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments"In the end, the message sent in the film, as quoted from the film, "We are meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benjamin Button. Brad Pitt has done a very good job and he transforms himself according to his age. Cate, beautiful, lovely, pretty lady that she is, has again performed well. The movie is pretty unusual and the direction, cinematography is excellent. Each character has its uniqueness. Its a simple film that projects human emotions that actually complemented. One of the few films that has actually filmed as it is taken from the book. Everyone has contributed to this films success. Highly recommended. My first thought about this film when i saw the trailer was; OK another film to watch. But after watching this movie i have not got over the character of Benjamin. I still watch the film for Cate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional journey that should not be missed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button inspired me on levels that most movies today fail to do. Not only is this my favorite movie of 2008, but it's in my top 5 favorite movies ever. I remember going to the theater to see it and not knowing what to expect. The trailer seemed interesting so I thought I would give it a try. When the movie finished, I had tears in my eyes....because I just saw one of the greatest movies ever made.One of the things I appreciate about Benjamin Button is its level of emotion, and the acting is superb in every way. Cate Blanchett is one of the most gifted and talented actresses. She truly gives an intense, gut-wrenching performance. I can't picture anyone else playing Daisy. Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime. I always thought he was an excellent actor (after watching him in Meet Joe Black, Sleepers, and Fight Club) but this movie puts the cherry on the cake. He breathes life into Benjamin in a way that really wowed me. Tilda Swinton also gave a great performance.It really saddened me that this movie didn't win for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, it's a Hollywood tragedy. From beginning to end, Benjamin Button had Best Picture written all over it. I highly recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to anyone looking for a beautiful, emotional, thought provoking story. No matter where your tastes lie, there's that something in it for everyone. This is one of those special kind of movies that stay with you long after you watch it.As I end this review, I just want to say thank you. Thank you Brad and Cate because this movie will inspire me and live in my heart for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film grabbed me from the very first frame. For being almost three hours long, it felt about half that long. The film length is not a factor as the events that unfold go by rather quickly.This was the first film I had ever seen that had made me feel better about myself after the credits rolled. On the way home, I wound up not turning the radio on or anything just so I could reflect on the movie for that much longer and keep this rare, warm, fuzzy feeling for as long as I could.This is arguably Brad Pitt's best role, at least from the films of his I've seen. Making something like having the mind of a seven year old while having the body of an eighty year old man believable is probably not an easy task, but he pulls it off rather flawlessly. The make-up effects are something to behold, as well. The way these effects are used to show people aging in this film is just remarkable.I've heard a lot of people compare The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to Forrest Gump. The truth of the matter is that other than both films being told in a narrative style and that characters sit on a bench at some point in both films during the time this story is being told, there really isn't much the two films have in common. I for one prefer Benjamin Button over Forrest Gump, but I'm not taking anything away from either film.As superb of a film this is, its one downside is its length. That will probably turn a lot of people off. I was a bit weary when I first realized how long it was, but once I was finally in the theater watching the film, it all went by so quickly. My eyes were literally glued to the screen the entire time. The story is sad overall, but it moved me in ways no film has ever done before in the past. It's well worth whatever price you pay for the ticket and it's well worth sitting through the close to three hour duration. I wouldn't tell you it was the best movie of 2008 if I meant otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He "Youthens"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid description of how Benjamin Button has reversed the aging process in his life, there is nothing of his the plot of his story. But the idea behind the updated version is as vivid as when he put it to paper.When Fitzgerald published the story it was 1927 probably at the height of the jazz age and his creative powers. As he wrote it, Bnejamin Button was born after the Civil War and lived through World War I. But he lived backwards as it were. In Camelot, King Arthur describes Merlin as not aging, but that he 'youthens'. That coined word describes just what happens to Benjamin.When he's born he comes out of the womb a little old man, something like you might imagine Yoda if you can ever imagine him as a child. With all the usual problems of old age. But as he grows older chronologically, Benjamin loses all those infirmities gradually and gets younger and younger. Several actors play him before he finally morphs into Brad Pitt.Which makes the achievement of director David Fancher all the more impressive. Although Brad Pitt was recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the directing of several others almost in tandem to play the same role at different stages is a great achievement. Too bad he didn't get the Oscar for that alone although Fancher was nominated also.In fact The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button got a flock of Oscar nominations including Best Picture as well as those mentioned. It won for Art&amp;Set Direction, Visual Effects, and in fact if it hadn't won for makeup the Oscars should have been picketted that year.Taraji Henson was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress. When Benjamin is born and his mother dies giving him birth and his father abandons him, the caregiver who is black takes him in to raise in her large and extended family. Given both his physical condition and the circumstances of his childhood, Benjamin had one unique perspective on life indeed. Henson is nothing short of fabulous in her portrayal.Cate Blanchett who was overlooked in the Oscars for this role plays the woman whom he loves, but who is working her way up in physical age while Pitt is working down. The film is seen from both her's and his perspective as she tells her daughter to read from this diary that Benjamin kept. When they met at the middle though as Benjamin ran the bases backward through life, there love was real and really physical.The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a remarkable achievement that gave some career roles to some fine players.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the work of David Fincher. His visual sense is quite possibly the best out there these days. This movie takes it to another level. It's a wonderful story told about as well as you could ever expect.From a technical standpoint, the visual FX are flawless and the attention to detail is impeccable. Quite simply, I was blown away. It felt a lot like a dream, and I didn't want to wake up.Acting, Cinematography, music, period work, staging, and every other thing is pitch perfect. I never thought Fincher could outdo Fight Club, but I won't doubt him again.I'll give it a nine out of ten, because I always like to leave room for future improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curious case of an old man growing young</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is based on a short story by renowned Jazz Age novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is an extraordinary individual, one who was born old and keeps getting younger. The film explores how this strange situation affects his relationships with other people through the years.The screenplay garnered one of the film's many Oscar nominations and keeps us interested through a hefty 166 minute runtime. Could it have been trimmed? Sure. Is the ending a little anticlimactic? Some might say. Nevertheless, storywise, the film is satisfactory.Brad Pitt was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance and I'd have to say that it's his best to date. His co-star Cate Blanchett wasn't nominated, though, which is perhaps understandable since she has done better work elsewhere. In supporting roles, Taraji P. Henson landed an Oscar nomination while the rest of the cast (which includes Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng &amp; Jared Harris) contributes solid support.Fincher's direction is well-handled and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Overall, the film shows significant refinement, as reflected by the 13 Oscar nominations that it received. The film's three Oscar wins came in technical categories that I think should have gone to other films but the general level of technical proficiency is undeniable.In conclusion, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a worthwhile fantasy/drama, complete with fine performances, a compelling story and first-rate craftsmanship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative and Thought Provoking - Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am certain that many have written of the superb acting, absorbing and imaginative story line and, the remarkable realism of the age progression and regression of the main characters. Some, I am sure, may have criticized the length but, I found it not to be so because it is easy for the thoughtful to develop a profound interest in the characters as well as a fascination with the implications of reverse aging. For example, most of us have said wistfully at one time or another, "If I only knew then, what I know now." The passions of youth can compel us to make unwise choices while disregarding worthwhile pursuits. Benjamin Button had the oppressive effects of a decrepit body when he was young to prevent him from making imprudent choices but, had the wisdom of age to productively direct the passions of a youthful body when he was older. An interesting idea.Overall, a beautiful, thought provoking movie which I highly recommend. I hope Hollywood makes more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a pure case of excellence by a great case, great story about turning back the clock. Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt) is a man who is born old and gets younger from time to time. He is taken care of by an African-American woman who has a heart of gold, and treats him like it was her own. To me, any woman with experiences of parenting can make the most out of the person's life by being the parent they are. When times go on, Benjamin gets younger and younger by the minute. In one time, he meets Daisy(Cate Blanchett) and gets the experience for which he will never forget. He travels to different countries, meets different people, got to see the sights he never seen, that should be an experience for anyone at any age. For Benjamin love knows no limits. This movie is close to "Forrest Gump", only the character has a little more sense. 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film making is very close to musical composition, the difference being the creator use images, instead of notes. Very few films have achieved true visual compositions, Stanley Kubrick did, notably in "Barry Lyndon", and now director David Fincher has with the exquisite "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", one of the handful, true artistic cinematic masterpieces of the past decade. The film breathes, pulses, rises and falls as we follow the life of Benjamin as he he is born, experiences life and finally dies. Words can never do justice to this wonderful film, but if you are open to it, have experienced enough of life, you will come away enriched and humbled that artists like Mr.Fincher share this time and space with you. Bravo to all involved in this film! and Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of the most excellent movies I have ever seen. We own several hundred movies, but when my sister-in-law called me this evening from the video store and mentioned this one, I was all for it. She didn't even realize which one it was... Certainly one we will never forget. Brad and Cate have amazing chemistry together, and the reversal of how we expect to live our lives (i.e. fall in love and grow old together) is both beautiful and horrific. Be prepared. If you have functional tear ducts, this movie will drain them for you. And to the person before me... pointless is when there is no message. This movie is not pointless. It is these sad (even if fictional) stories that remind us how human, how special, and how lucky each one of us is for the gifts we have been given in life. Enough with the sentimental.

		<shortDescription>A Backwards Fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is January 3, 2008. I saw today The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for the second time with my father. It was a hassle getting him up.. When he was younger, in his twenties, he was playing tennis with a friend and when he went for a backhand, his spine cracked. He had to get surgery on his lower back and has hard a scar ever since. His back got better, but a few years ago, it began to feel sore again. He had to get an enhanced type of surgery to help stabilize his spine. After this surgery, he progressively got better, but his back continued to fluctuate between feeling all right and feeling worse. There are many reasons why I feel the need to tell you all this before talking about Benjamin Button. The first and most obvious reason of all is because the film is about 3 hours long, and my father had the guts to sit through it, and still enjoy it. But past that, there are more complex reasons why Benjamin Button connects to my fathers life. You see, this film is different than anything anyone has seen before. If you are sick of seeing the same story over and over again, this is the sort of movie you've been waiting for, for it is a story that has never even been touched or thought of before. It begins without a touch on the life of Benjamin, and instead, opens with an old woman and her daughter in the hospital, the older on the death bed, and the daughter telling her mother how much she loves her. The woman tells the story of a blind man whose son goes to war, and in the meantime, builds a clock. The man and his wife get the message that the son is dead, and when the clock is finally revealed to the public, the clock moves backwards; he figures time should go back to honor the memory of his son, in the imagination that maybe he'd be able to see him again. After that story, the woman decides to spend the last moments of her life being told the words from a diary, and it turns out to be the life of Benjamin Button. And from this point on, you are swept away on a miraculous and wonderful, self righteous journey of a man is physically born an old man, growing younger. As his life goes on, you see deaths around him, how his life influences the people around him, and how others influence his own.. You honestly feel as though you are seeing through the eyes of someone different; someone who lives their own life and gets carried away by the pleasures of life in general.I will try not to sugarcoat it, but Benjamin Button is truly a film that helps you believe in life. With the help of fantasy, it is a film that can open your mind and help you get past all the pettiness of your own life (atleast it has helped with mine). But don't take the miraculousness of this film from someone as biased as me, take it from my father. You see, Cate Blanchett, who plays the love interest of Benjamin when he is old and she is young (they meet each other in the middle, don't worry), says it herself: we all end up in diapers. Benjamin Button is a film that can inspire any age, give life to the old and wisdom to the young. It can even get a pained old man with screws in his back out of bed. So go see it for yourself. It's a film that becomes a part of you forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very best movie ever made (so far, and in my own opinion).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been my most favorite movie for at least three years now. To give you a bit of background, others that have held that spot for me include: "The Royal Tennenbaums", "Amelie", "Memento", "The Virgin Suicides", "Alien", "What Dreams May Come", and "The Empire Strikes Back". The funny thing is, I had to watch this one three or four times before admitting it's my number one. The iconic imagery, understated acting, sublime effects, massive scope and universal messages are undeniable, but its lines of monologue and dialogue - so easily fitting into any book of quotes - are worthy of tattoos and demand frequent repetition.Here are a few of my faves:-"It's a funny thing about coming home; looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. Then you realize; what's changed is you."-"You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went. You can swear and curse the fates. But, when it comes to the end, you have to let go."-"For what it's worth, it's never too late - or, in my case, too early - to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit; start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it, and I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. And if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again"-"Some people were born to sit by a river. Some get struck by lightening. Some have an ear for music. Some are artists. Some swim. Some know buttons. Some know Shakespeare. Some are Mothers. And some dance."The more I watch it, the more I think that this can be a blueprint for a life fulfilled, available to any and all who approach with an open mind and thirsty spirit.

I could easily write a million pages criticizing the movie and explaining the themes, but there's no need to, because what will be written is simply what we face everyday i.e. life!! Some think that it was too long, and I have to admit, I thought that too, but a deeper look made me realize that it was all part of the intended effect; our life sometimes could seem long and boring and insignificant, but by the end of the day we realize that every single person we meet, ever single word we hear or say, and every single look... count.

		<shortDescription>A Magical Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no surprise that this movie came out during Oscar season. Everything about it just screams "Academy Awards." The rhythmic, but not too wordy, dialogue, the epic scale, the unfolding storyline, this one's got it all. I've criticized a few movies for being manufactured to be Oscar darlings. While I won't deny that that's probably what happened with "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," but this is much better because it doesn't SEEM like it."I was born under extraordinary circumstances..." Had this movie been a megahit (and perhaps it will, having been freed of the shadow cast by the indie-favorite Best Picture winner "Slumdog Millionaire"), these words would be as iconic as "I'm king of the world!" Still, that's the best place to start the description of the movie. It's also the best place to end it. This is one of those movies that's all about the premise, and what the filmmakers do with it. Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) was born an old man, and grows younger by the day. It's a fascinating premise, and the filmmakers do everything that can be done with it.The acting is terrific. I've never been a Brad Pitt fan, and the tabloid obsession with him and Angelina Jolie makes me like him even less. But this has got to be his best performance. He's reflective, and ably portrays such an unusual character. There's no sense of showboating, or that he's "acting." We don't see Brad Pitt as Benjamin, we simply see Benjamin. Cate Blanchett is a goddess among actresses. Except for perhaps Meryl Streep, I can't think of anyone who can match her versatility. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that Blanchett would be terrific as Benjamin's lover Daisy, and Blanchett delivers. Taraji P. Henson is solid as Queenie, and while I wouldn't have been one to demand that she get nominated, I'm not going to complain. Tilda Swinton is underused as Elizabeth Abbott, the woman with whom Benjamin has his first fling, but it's not a very important part. A movie like this is filled with bit parts by unknowns. But for me, one of them really struck me. That is Jared Harris, who plays Captain Mike. While he may be a drunk, Captain Mike is really the one who teaches Benjamin the most about life. He's a likable character who really resonates with the viewer (not to mention Benjamin).Acting aside, this film belongs to David Fincher. Known mainly for his visual style, Fincher has gradually become known for other aspects of directing. The tone changes throughout the film, but Fincher knows this. It goes from magical to dramatic to a conclusion with pathos. Fincher has complete control over it.However, Fincher has not lost his ability to create awe-inspiring visuals. From the dream-like cinematography to the jaw-dropping visual effects (like the aging on the young Benjamin), they are amazing.One thing of note is that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett looped their voices over those of their younger counterparts (though the actors adjust their voices accordingly). It creates a distance between the movement of the mouth and the timing of the audio. Some people may think that this is a mistake, but I liked it. It creates an otherworldly feel to it.Do yourself a favor, see "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unduly long, nihilistic and just plain stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was excessively long. It somehow missed the editing process altogether, for if anyone had actually taken a serious look at the camera time given to the entirely unappealing--if not repugnant--and nearly still image of the shriveled old lady (Cate Blanchett) dying in her bed, they would have discovered that, lo and behold, fully one-quarter of the movie is wasted on a single shot. I honestly think that if this film had been submitted as a final project in an editing class at film school, the student would have failed the class.Nowhere was I drawn into the story so as to be able to sympathize with the characters. On the contrary, I actually came to wish for the death of the mumbling old lady with ashen face, quivering lips and intolerably irritating pseudo-southern accent, because she was literally boring me to tears. Never was I given any reason to believe that any of the random and disconnected scenes involving various and sundry arbitrary people had any importance whatsoever. In a final flourish of nihilism, the film ends with the depressing message: "ashes to ashes, dust to dust" or, perhaps more to the point: womb to tomb. I disliked this really annoying and pointlessly epic film immensely. The only way I could even make my way through it was by dividing it into three parts. Even then, each hour was a form of slow torture by boredom. To make matters worse, this monstrosity is filled with cheap sentimentality and shallow, trivial "insights" on life--a veritable compendium of banality and pseudo-philosophizing. Very, very bad.There was a single creative concept here, but the execution was so egregious as to veritably extinguish that small spark of creativity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The incredibly boring film of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly awful movie is hard to find. Usually there is just a spark of something that made the film beat the production system that always says "no". In this film it is utterly incomprehensible who thought it might be interesting, and who thought it would be successful. The story seemed like a good idea to F.Scott Fitzgerald, who was making the equivalent of a quarter million dollars per story at the time (that was when people read stories). The very implausible birth of a 90 year-old baby could be glossed over. Same with his childhood. Same with how his foster-parents could ever get attached to him. Fitzgerald's rip-off of Wilde's The Portrait of Dorian Gray could be carried off in the imagination. But when a literal-minded commercial cinema put it into production, it just didn't work at all. Implausible from the word go, it remained implausible throughout its immense, mind-crushing length. Only the most raving egomaniacs could have produced this huge turkey and thought they'd make something great. It was dead from the kick-off. Any lover of cinema should studiously avoid this giant turd of a movie and not even watch it just to see what happens. Nothing happens. Period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt cannot act! I repeat: BRAD PITT CANNOT ACT! No matter the situation in this movie - that the man who has befriended him is his father; that he is to become a father; that his foster mother has died (the body count here puts Jason and Freddy Krueger to shame) - Pitt reacts with a blank stare! I bet when Angelina informed him that she was preggers the first time, and Pitt responded with that stare, she got Lara Croft on his retarded ass!The clichés would make the folks at Hallmark puke! And the explanation of the "fates" which "conspired" to destroy Daisy's career when, in fact, she had no one to blame but her fool self, was obscene! Even more obscene is the portrayal of African-Americans as a bunch of wide-eyed rubes who scream "Praise Jesus" at the drop of a hat!"Curious" how Blanchett's face was airbrushed, but Pitt - who has an "I am SO hunky" moment on a motorcycle - doesn't get the airbrush treatment! From "1962" on, he looks exactly the same (complete with that stare)! Also "curious" is how Benjamin catches The Beatles on Ed Sullivan, but was AWOL when JFK's head was blown off three months earlier! He was also out to lunch during The Great Depression, Germany's assault on Murmansk (while he was IN Murmansk!), The Cold War, The Civil Rights Movement, The Moon Landing, and Vietnam, just to name a few minor events.Why wasn't Button reported when he snatched Benjamin? How could a black woman get away with raising a white baby in the Jim Crow South? How could the "old" Benjamin bone a whore like an 18 year old on Viagra? How did he know Elizabeth's hubby was a spy? Why does Daisy accept him bailing on her, then accept him showing up years later? Why does he expect her to take care of him? Why does she keep him a secret from their daughter? Why does he talk like a Toaist Nike commercial? How is it that he never registers a blip on anyone's radar? More importantly, how does this hack Eric Roth keep getting work?If F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to set his story in 21st Century New Orleans, he would have! And if he had wanted to create the idiot characters that populate this tripe, he would have done that, too! That whirring sound you hear is him spinning in his grave!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benjamin Button teaches us a multitude of great things about life: people die. Unbelievable. The portrayal of death in the beginning of the film is pathetic: a self absorbed daughter has a senseless conversation with her dying mother. Anybody who has ever seen a dying person has to puke if (s)he sees this clichéd, badly acted, completely nonsensical intro. But I guess some of the people who rated this film so highly probably even got touched seeing this... As for the rest: there has been exhaustive comment here on the weak points, here just a few in summary: -completely bad performance by Brad Pitt -lack of depth in all the protagonists -lack of message (altogether): the film is empty -full of cheesy clichés (...) How could someone like David Fincher ever go so low?</fullReview>

The only thing that I would give it is an award for, is being a boring film and wasting a few hours of my life.I know that the movie title says it all, but I thought from the rating etc it would be a good movie. All that happens is Benjamin tell us a story about his life. How fun is that? Why do people even think of stories like this? I don't know how they can allow it. And bringing it to the cinema's. What were they thinking. They could of thought of something better. It is a complete waste of my time. I feel asleep while watching it. I feel tired now even talking about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is only half successful.First of all, if there are any Oscars to give out here it's got to be for whomever did the miraculous make-up jobs. Technical awards category might give this one a few Oscars for visual effects and cinematography. And the music by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous.But the story is a ponderous one, something about the time warp that occurs if a person ages backwards and keeps getting younger than all his contemporaries--but as fascinating as that concept might be, it takes a much better grip on fantasy to work for a movie that runs two hours and forty-seven minutes. Frankly, there isn't enough of a story here to sustain such a lengthy film. How many of us have to worry about getting younger each year, so where's the connection? And towards the middle, it really starts to sag, despite some good performances from a first-rate cast performing brilliantly under Bryan Singer's direction.BRAD PITT has certainly chosen an unusual role to play and he does it with his customary capabilities intact. CATE BLANCHETT is outstanding as Daisy, the childhood sweetheart who grows up to be the love of his life, but her motivations are sometimes vague and her character is sometimes irritating.Most interesting supporting roles are well played by TARAJI P. HENSON as Queenie who finds the foundling Benjamin and raises him as her own, and JASON FLEMYNG as the boy's wayward father who abandons the baby.The biggest hurdle for BENJAMIN BUTTON to jump is making the story seem credible, as fantastic as the concept is. But since the concept istelf isn't grounded in any sort of reality, it's too big a leap to make.Should find its special target audience in fans who love the arty type of flick, no matter how slow moving the story may be. But in the end, it's all rather meaningless. After all, is anybody else in the world going to have Benjamin's unique problem? Only in the movies--or if your name is Dorian Gray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Review from The Massie Twins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button so uniquely approaches its subject of life and death that one can't help but ponder its themes of love, existence, and mortality. Director David Fincher's latest garners an epic feel, not from its rather lengthy runtime, but from spectacular storytelling and intricate character development - or perhaps undevelopment. A slight loss for affecting drama and a few borrowed elements from notable predecessors can't detract from the amazing journey at hand, one brilliantly entertaining and curious indeed.As Daisy (Cate Blanchett) lies dying in a New Orleans hospital, she has her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) read to her from a mysterious diary that chronicles the peculiar life of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). Born as an old man, Button steadily grows younger as everyone around him grows older, and a majestic tale unfolds, one filled with adventure, intrigue, and an epic romance that transcends the restrictions of time.It's a meditation on life, death, time, fate, forgiveness, love and every emotional experience in between; most often it's beautiful, melancholy, romantic and saddening, but ultimately it suffers from the futility of a predestined course. Although it borrows memorable elements from Titanic (narration by an older character reminiscing on the past) and Forrest Gump (a hummingbird replaces the CG feather, and Cate Blanchett's Daisy mirrors Robin Wright's Jenny, most noticeably in her acceptance of Button only after numerous experimentations in love), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button doesn't suffer from unoriginality. It is exciting, dramatic, epic and refreshing; it may be flawed, especially from a lengthy running time, but still manages to be one of the more impressive films of the year.The tagline reads: "Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments." Although the film doesn't exceed at any one element, with its lengthy running time it does include moments for everyone. Falling slightly short in the affecting drama expected of its epic scope, Button still beautifully showcases romance with the constant gaining and losing of Daisy; action at sea with the patriotic Captain Mike (who is also reminiscent of a Forrest Gump character: Gary Sinise's Lt. Dan); and comedy relief aplenty, most memorably from a man who was struck by lightning seven times. The film's focus is mainly about the events and characters that affect Benjamin, as opposed to his own influences; he is an observer of his own existence (thereby decreasing the potency of Pitt's performance, but perhaps increasing its refreshing subtlety). The importance of life and death, the experiences of growing up, and discovering sexuality and love are all viewed in a new, backwards perspective (frequently discouraging for Button - "some creatures aren't meant to survive"), which gives an entertaining twist to the majority of events which would otherwise be unceremoniously routine.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button sticks out like a sore thumb in David Fincher's filmography. Having already directed 2 contemporary classics such as the dark and labyrinthine "Se7en" and the ultra violent "Fight Club", Mr. Fincher forays outside his core competence and tries something new in TCCOBB.With Brad Pitt on his side, and Eric Roth (screenwriter: Forrest Gump, Munich, Ali) writing the screenplay, I would think that Mr. Fincher's first shot at mainstream cinema would be unmissable, and if that's not enough, the "curious" premise of the movie --being born an 80 year old baby and aging backwards-- is attracting moviegoers by the droves for this one.Alas! In spite of all the talent behind this movie, TCCOBB relegates itself to the barren wastelands of mediocrity. The 'magic' of the premise was not enough to sustain my interest for the whole duration simply because the movie contented itself in showing the obvious and failing to scrape past the crust of Benjamin's feelings, admonitions, hopes and frustrations-- instead the movie labored, in all its 168-minute glory to show TWO key themes: 1. That he QUITE OBVIOUSLY, could not be treated in the same way as other kids and 2. He could not create meaningful relationships .. the whole movie revolved around these 2 themes and at almost 3 hours, you'd think that the movie had gravitas, but it actually has nothing special in it, just a monotonous piece of fantastical story telling.This movie could have been so much more, the movie could have explored the inner recesses of Benjamin's psyche, did he feel bad about his condition, when he fell in love, what were his initial thoughts? shame? guilt? hopelessness? What were his dreams, did he even have a dream at all, how did his condition affect HIS RELATIONSHIP with HIS OWN SELF, as supposed to his relationship with others.When he was 10 years old, then 9 yrs old, then 8 years old.. how did he feel about his pending exit from the world not as an old man but as a baby... i would think that since he grew younger, his death would be the slowly taking away of his faculties,. like a degenerative disease... how did he cope with with this destiny.. those were the most "pressing" questions I had while watching the movie... but towards the end of the movie, in the waning years of Benjamin, when he was close to death, WHEN HE WAS MOST INTERESTING.... the movie focused on Daisy (Cate Blanchett)... what a cop out...After 3 hours of benjamin, i don't know the guy, he's like someone from a friend's girlfriend's dog's doctor's birthday party... he came, then he left.. that is how i feel about benjamin...No wonder this movie lost to slumdog millionaire in the recently concluded golden globe awards....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 hours that could have been 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this today and I came out of it relieved to see it end. This just went on too long and didn't need a lot of the exposition and filler it had to tell the story, which from what I've seen certainly was a lot shorter in F. Scott Fitzgerald print form.There were three things about this movie that cause me to say it does not deserve to be Best Picture.1) I understand the story that was trying to be told with the old woman and her daughter in the hospital. However, the constant cutaways to Benjamin's life story and then back to the hospital for this subplot just got to be annoying after awhile; i.e., this subplot just got in the way and added about 45 minutes of screen time that could have been shortened or just outright eliminated.2) There were so many times in this movie as it moved along that I kept being reminded of "Forrest Gump". There's just a lot of the styles and elements of that film from 1994 that I saw here: the friendship as children that grew into love as adults, the main character as a child having trouble walking, the love story that oftentimes couldn't be, the crazy but ultimately likable guy running the ship that the main character works on, etc. I can't believe I haven't already heard more about just how similar these stories are on film.3) The whole element of Hurricane Katrina. Was it really necessary? Did it add anything to the story? I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who didn't need a reminder of that.Yeah, all in all, I gave this a "6" but I'm thinking even that's generous...the film was fine, but just too long and too much like another (and better) film that won Oscars 15 years ago. I don't feel this deserves the honor.UPDATE: Time has passed and with more and more blatant obvious similarities to "Gump" having come into the public eye, this now gets a "2". Next time Eric Roth does a film, I hope someone does some cross-referencing. This film did about as well in the Oscars as it deserved to: 3-for-13 with no major wins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain films that I claim are "amazing" or some other similar adjective but don't actually recommend for people looking for entertainment. 2001: A Space Odyssey is such a movie. An extraordinary example of movie making as art but most will find it boring as hell.Some movies explore a concept or idea in minute detail and at great length, that is to say the film makers used the movie to convey a point, some great truth or what have you. These movies can have entertainment value or deliver some emotional payload.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is neither.Long winded without saying anything. Slow to start.. but never goes anywhere. Brad Pitt's accent will strike you as absurd several times throughout the movie.I think the goal was a new Forest Gump but the film makers forgot the memorable characters, the interesting events, an engaging story.Absolute waste of time, I stuck around thinking "surely this will become interesting" after I realized that wasn't the case I stuck out the last 60 minutes! just to see how they handled the childhood part of the title character's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically impressive but the weaknesses in the material makes it a "good" film ? not the great one that everyone is suggesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daisy has been on her deathbed for quite some time and her daughter Julia is determined to be there as she leaves this world. As they sit together, Daisy asks Julia to read from her from the diary, postcards and letters of Benjamin Button, a man she had known her whole life. His life begins by being abandoned by his father on the doorstep of an old people's home where he is taken in and pitied for appearing to be older than many of those at the end of their life. So it continues as the child Benjamin starts his life as an old man but appears to be younger physically as he ages. His story tells of love and loss, war and peace, life and death.Benjamin Button comes to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and nominations and many critics here have given it an unquestioning five out of five stars and lavished praise on it. Of course I was keen to see it and went to see a preview as soon as I could ? not expecting brilliance but just out of interest to see the film that is wowing them. The truth about the film is as to be expected these days about many "big" films, which is that it doesn't really deliver on all the things you hear about it. Fortunately this is not a dull summer blockbuster that had all the money shots in the trailer and Benjamin Button is an engaging and enjoyable film ? it is just not the "soul-filling" "visionary piece" or "modern classic" that some have hailed it as. In the broad story of a man's life, the film is engaging and has plenty going on ? as others have said the film doesn't feel as long as it is and in essence I was interested in what was happening and what was going to happen.The problem is that I was rarely that interested in what had happened and I didn't really feel myself being that engaged by the lives I was watching. In a way this is a positive thing because the film doesn't ever go for the easy emotions and it stays away from the sweeping musical scores and grand emotion that some directors would have milked as hard and as often as possible. This restraint is to Fincher's credit as it creates a more adult and worthy feel as opposed to the feel of someone frantically pushing "cry" or "laugh" buttons but it does leave me with the problem that I ended the film feeling like I had watched a "nice" film ? not a great one. Within the context of the narrative, the ageing backwards concept didn't produce what I would have liked. Here and there it gave me pause for thought due to putting a slightly different spin on a common situation but I'm not sure how much I was doing versus the film. Outside of the odd moment, the film follows birth to death and the direction of ageing isn't really that important in terms of the story being told, it makes it feel unusual sure, but doesn't actually deliver much with it. I was looking for a new perspective on things, something to justify the concept but it never really came. What this left me with was an OK film and I am left looking on at those weeping and proclaiming it to be one of the finest films ever and wondering, really, what am I missing? Technically I have no qualms with the film because the special effects are so good that you barely notice them. The "old man" effects are one thing but it is really impressive to see Pitt looking younger than I've ever seen him but still unmistakably be Brad Pitt. This is true of the whole film as it just feels pretty real, whether it be the "show piece" effects or just the way everything convinces as being of the period. Indeed in this area the film excels and I think it deserves the many technical etc Oscars I'm sure it will pick up. The performances are good but perhaps not quite as heartfelt as I would have liked. I do not mean I needed them to be obvious or weeping at the drop of a hat but they didn't have as much inside consistently as I wanted. Pitt is solid and has easy charisma but I didn't feel for him, I didn't think he put anything into his character's heart as a result of ageing backwards. Likewise Blanchett was only strong in a few specific scenes and didn't have much to work with beyond that. The support cast are good though as we have turns from Ormound, Flemyng, Henson, Swinton, Koteas and others all doing solid work.So perhaps it is just me. I suspect I will have the votes and the PM's to assure me how wrong I am but I cannot see this film as being more that "pretty good". No matter how impressive the technology is or how interesting the concept is, it just doesn't have enough about it in the material to really be engaging, insightful or particularly moving. It is in no way "bad" ? I liked it and time moved quickly despite the length but it is just now the classic that many are calling it. A good film that could and should have been much better ? don't expect more than that.</fullReview>

Too often you feel you are living his life at real speed- and while that could be powerful and helpful at times in connecting you with his life- it was used too often and without reason. Not wanting to give spoilers to those who would like to see this visually impressive film, I warn you to look for a slow paced long afternoon to see it. Be prepared to get only the standard challenge ("live your life to the fullest!) from this movie of the heart.

		<shortDescription>Disjointed, stupefying nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it up there on the screen but I didn't connect with it. It was a beautifully mounted movie with nothing interesting to say -- not to me, anyway. I did my best to accept the central premise as a fantasy not to be questioned -- I mean when I found myself wondering how the body of an infant born with the skin and the arthritis and the cataracts of an old man might conveniently be blessed with growth spurts in old age followed by shrink spurts in youth ... nah, I decided there's no need to go down that road. Repeat after me: The movie is a fantasy. Benjamin Button was born old and progressed to infancy and that's the movie's premise and I accepted it. And with that behind me, I wanted to see the life of Benjamin Button developed into a story that would fascinate -- that might offer insights on life as viewed by someone living it backwards.Instead I got a mishmash of vignettes told in flashback from a dying woman's hospital room in New Orleans -- with EEK! HURRICANE KATRINA! bearing down to no apparent dramatic purpose whatsoever. I saw a pygmy and a brothel and a Russian beauty and a boat and lightning strikes and a broken leg and a war and ... Cate Blanchett kept getting older while Brad Pitt kept getting younger and by the time Benjamin Button met his daughter she was an adolescent and so was he ... and it was just one melancholy development after another and ... how in the world am I supposed relate to any of this disjointed, stupefying nonsense? Here's the movie: Benjamin Button's friends and family grew older and died as he grew younger and died. Period, that's it, no more, no lessons learned, no insights gained, no emotional connection, not even any marveling by the world of science at what was happening to this unique individual. Well, OK, this happened too: Some young man died in WWI so his blind father built a clock that ran backwards and I never figured out how this related substantively to the rest of the movie. I do know, though, that it is not the nature of New Orleanians to replace ornate, historic, quirky old railway station clocks with digital monstrosities. Bleh. I truly regret that I invested time in this mistake of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am, like many film fans, a worshiper of David Fincher. The man's films have a perfect quality to them that very few director's can manage to say about their work. Here, with this film, he manages to come as close to perfect as I've ever seen. The experience of watching a man's life and all the experiences and people he meets across the way was beautiful and very moving. When Brad Pitt and David Fincher get together to make a film, pure awesomeness comes out. I am not going to tell you what happens in the film or why I am so speechless about the artistry of it, but I just want to say that this film is worth your time. If you love movies in general or just a beautifully well-told story you must see this. If no one involved in the film gets nominated for any Oscars, it just proves that there is no God. :) Just enjoy the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's Benjamin Button Takes Us Places We Have Never Been Before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FLThere are moments in life where we all feel "different"! In the Curious Case of Benjamin Button, on the one-way highway of life, Benjamin Button lived and died?going the wrong way?.Well, at least, COASTING the wrong way.And therein lays perhaps the great flaw/conundrum in David Fincher's film: For 2 hours and 40 minutes, "Button" seems content to meander aimlessly and unhurriedly toward its, and his own, inevitable conclusion. Thusly, it must be frankly said that BUTTON, at times so languidly paced?prompts us to ask, was Fincher, the director, as appears to be the case with his lead character, seemingly not knowing or caring where he was going?.If any place at all? What a shame! Because the basic premise is nothing short of breathtakingly original? Perhaps one of the most original concepts to arrive on the screen in the past decade! I will admit that I am conflicted on this point.Perhaps the seeming pointlessness of Button's retro-existence is a bit of a metaphor for own lives, which, in the long term scheme of things, end up, do what we may, whether we like it or not, being hollow, devoid of purpose, simply inertia-driven and without any real merit or worthwhile impact. It shakes up our mindset, casting a shadow of doubt over our entire life/death belief system. In that sense, Fincher's film haunts me as almost no other film has. If this was one of his goals in making BUTTON, I would say he was quite successful! Visually, this film borders on miraculous. Three well-deserved Oscars in Art Direction, Make-up and Visual Effects certainly back up my last statement. However, none of what you see is in-your-face. Every minute detail seems delicately integrated in a blissfully natural tapestry that is nothing short of inspired. On that note, let's look at Brad Pitt's performance in the title role?An actor who, ever since his twitchy, neurotic, paranoid Jeffrey Goines in 12 MONKEYS, has never ceased to amaze us and certainly does not disappoint as the soft-spoken Button. Pitt's interpretation convincingly shows us a human being who has adapted to his unique condition and who has learned to take life one day at a time, virtually expectation free! Kate Blanchett as Daisy is superb! The singularity of the nature of her relationship with Button allows her to take the audience into uncharted cinematic territory and, oh, what a delicate and sophisticated journey she takes us on! David Fincher's Benjamin Button surely is an ageless film for the ages!9*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa?ol, are most welcome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's Directorial Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB)has achieved the zenith of his career with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, a sweeping and majestic fable that spans almost an entire century. This moving and eloquent story follows the life of a boy named Benjamin, who was born as a baby in his late 80's and ages in reverse. His mother died in childbirth and his father was so horrified at the sight of him that he left him on an anonymous doorstep, where he was taken in by a kindly black owner of a boarding house in post WWI New Orleans. We become completely enveloped in Benjamin's tale as we watch him calmly accept the extraordinary hand that God has dealt him while others do the same or run in terror. We watch the kindly adopted mother who accepts his as he is, though does take him to a faith healer thinking she can "save" him; we also watch his biological father track him down and regret his decision of giving the boy up while he maintains a life long friendship with Daisy, the little girl who he meets as an old manchild, whose lives meet in the middle as she grows into a vain beauty who can't accept the fact that Benjamin grows younger as she grows older. The film is visually arresting and bold in its cinematic scope as Fincher's meticulous direction brings you a story that should make you ponder, but really only makes you behold. Brad Pitt received his second Oscar nomination for his performance in the title role, a role which many feel was all visual effects and makeup; however, Benjamin has a mind and a soul and a voice that Pitt brings to this extraordinary character with a quiet and understated dignity. Cate Blanchett is luminous as Daisy, the love of Benjamin's life who can't quite accept Benjamin's life for what it is and there is strong support from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother and Jason Flemyng as his biological father. Fincher breathes an extraordinary life into this story which could have been buried in visual effects and makeup but has a life of its own and the final act as Daisy becomes an older woman while Benjamin regresses to infancy, is absolutely heartbreaking. A one of kind cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's brilliant direction is just one of the many things that elevates the film to its rightful position.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What you're about to read would be my personal opinion. It's just so rare that I give a 10 to a film due to several complex factors that drown you completely in its greatness, the plot, the characters, the beauty presented in each scene and they are all compelling, nothing lacking, they're just perfect. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in my opinion is a film that has everything, a masterpiece in every possible way. It is a great story completely wrapped in a very complicated plot and it would be too hard to digest if it wasn't because of Fincher's flawless film direction and genuine creativity. Every film enthusiast can have his or her own perception to what makes a film good or bad. This perception is generally based on various considerations involving particular film aspects. However, despite those different points of view, they usually agree on the greatness of certain film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button would be the case here. I think we can all come to an agreement that this film really brings back David Fincher to The Golden Throne of Great Film Director because of its meticulous film framework. Fincher's brilliant direction is just one of the many things that elevates the film to its rightful position, besides the absolutely artistic design, impeccable soundtrack, amazing moments of visual imagery and a story that transcends its starting point. Benjamin Button is a story about life, about coincidences, about self improvement, about finding oneself, and ultimately, on how to appreciate our existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Experience!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan and an admirer of David Fincher's movies like Fight Club, Social Network, Zodiac and The Girl with a dragon Tattoo, I decided to catch with the Brad Pitt starer 'the Curious Case of Benjamin Button' based on a 1921 short story. A totally new concept is what I witnessed after watching this movie thereby considering this endeavor to be Pitt's best till date. In the year 2005, Caroline goes to see her mother Daisy lying on her deathbed in a hospital in New Orleans. Aware that she is not going to live long, Daisy makes Caroline read a diary which contains the story of Benjamin Button. After end of World War 2, In November 1918, a mother died giving birth to a boy. Since the infant is old, wrinkled and ugly, he gets abandoned by his father Thomas Button by leaving him on the stairs of an old age home. The mistress of the old age home Queenie takes care of the little baby clearly getting over the fact that he is ugly in appearance, considering him to be the child of God. The doctor claims that the baby boy won't live long since his body condition is weak and deteriorating. But Fate has something else in the store for Benjamin (as he is so named by Queenie). Throughout the film, Benjamin follows a reverse aging pattern. Rather than becoming old, he starts becoming younger than before. The prime soul of the film is Benjamin's friend Daisy who goes on to become the pivotal part of the movie. Right from 1918 to present day 2005, the plot goes forward recreating every era it witnesses. The movie is mainly about Benjamin's life and his struggle in coping up with the world that looks at him again and again in a way which makes him realize that he is different. The film is about the unconditional love which Benjamin and Daisy share and how they seemingly realize they can't be together for long due to Benjamin's curious case. The film contains scenes which triggers emotion in the viewers. Pitt escapes off with a fine performance. Cate Blanchett who plays the young Daisy also gets on very well. Overall, a big bow to Fincher for gifting us this magical experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the runtime, Benjamin Button was worth sitting through two hours and forty minutes of a true rare romantic film. Some viewers may feel that the film is extremely slow throughout but if you sit down and experience Fincher's odd take on a F Scott Fitzgerald short story, you can see why David Fincher is one of the best in the business and worthy of his Oscar nomination. There are many aspects that describe this film as mesmerizing, whether it may be the make-up, setting, production design, or even acting, but the story is what creates this masterpiece with a caring love tale as an aging backwards man learns the meaning of life by living it in such ways that I couldn't think of. Even though Benjamin Button is classified as a romance, it is not your ordinary chick flick as it moved my heart as the characters' hearts move older and younger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is an inspiring film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>" time is passing, even backwards." Benjamin's time is passing backwards. It is an unusual story from other films. It's a piece of wonder. Benjamin Button was born under unusual circumstances that he ages backwards. No matter this is a curse or a gift from God, he still has his own life as other people. That's what the film tells us. Besides, Benjamin encourages us to be the ones who we want to be, and make ourselves the best. Many times I can acquire from the film is that we always look backward on our life, at the moments we should still know what we are going to do next and we must live our life forward. Actually, the case of Benjamin Button is extremely incredible, but it is established as a real life of a man. It's so true. It's well- directed. And the acting is also a brilliance that both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett acted in a perfect way. Totally the film cultivates a comfortable and favourable ambiance. At last, I admire this film very much and I may say it has become one of the films on my favourite film list. I strongly recommend this to you all as it might inspire your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film unlike no other and epic movie that may never be seen again which makes this even more magical. The film was not only filled with top notch actors, directing and wonderful performances. We are all compelled to not only feel for the death we witness but also for the amazing like we see him experience. This was an incredibly visual and emotional journey of a man who ages backwards. The man played by Brad Pitt goes through the same things we all do growing up and growing old. He starts to discover life from all angles but that doesn't make him any more unique its the love he has. His whole life he tries to comprehend how his love for Daisy works and only has a few years to love her. With the frustration and hardship that their lives shows us its all worth if even if its only a few moments of joy. The end result is nothing but flawless. The way he is able to weave the story together and makes it flow so that it is enjoyable from start to finish. All the shots are impressive that at almost 3 hours none of it is wasted. With the performance of Brad Pitt is nothing short of amazing, his nuances are so believable and realistic throughout even with his make up and computer graphics he still is the one who makes him come alive. This was such a imaginative depiction of life, love and loss. This is not your average drama that spoon feeds emotions, its the message that what makes our lives impressive are the moments we don't seem to grasp long before letting go. With this movie Fincher should be solidified as a top in the industry with a film that is so magical, riveting ground breaking and a timeless classic. The theme of age is only a number and we can choose what to do in our lives no matter what that number is. The best way they choose to tell this was a man who ages backwards and the experiences he has. How can we fall in love with someone when that person looks like the persons child? How can a child play with the kids on the block when your body is old enough to be in a wheelchair? Although Brad Pitt does a great job the winners go to the women with Cate Blanchett and Taraji p. Henson. Blanchett playing the complex character of Daisy with ease and charisma. Taraji with her performance warming your heart as a mother not able to bear children takes Ben in and takes care of him as her own, her funny and loving nature showing she was the mother. With the complexities of the film David was still able to make the film seem reality and still having that magic. The score and cinematography also helped with the beauty of the film. Seeing the romance between Ben and Daisy seeming to transcend age, time and location made one of most compelling romances of the year and within years. With fabulous computer graphics and make up its hard to tell when it is used and when its real which goes to the skill of the people working on the film. This film was a work of art and should not be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that has everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on Fitzgerald short story called the same way. I read Fitzgerald and honestly the movie is very different but way much better. Here we see how great the special effects went on Benjamin's face, Brad Pitt did a really good performance with very natural expressions.The plot is basically a man that was born physically looking old, and the film goes on deeply into his life and all the events and situations Benjamin confronts only because he's different for growing young.This movie can be seeing as a point of view of a social criticism because society often rejects the difference, sometimes because it's just unusual and can't be accepted or sometimes because of the fear of accepting it without knowing future consequences. But also, this movie can be interpreted as a message sent to the audience, a message that is never too late to achieve your goals in life. And so, in my first impression, the thing I got in mind was that when people get older they start to act like little kids again, so it's wonderful that this movie portraits how the time play us back.After watching this movie, probably you will see life for another perspective and will want to enjoy it at the fullest and start to work for your greatest aspirations because time is not forever and it can't be turned back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a potentially good movie; nice quiet performance by pitt, carried by getting more from blanchette, misused and underused ormond, nicely shot, seems quite promising- except for the elephant that keeps charging into the room- the reverse age thing; you have to buy, or overlook, the premise of reverse aging, but then they keep hitting you with it in the wrong ways- like he starts as a 4'8" cripple who reverse ages to a 6-foot paragon; old people do sometimes shrink an inch or two, but not a foot or two; there are too many times when pitt is supposedly 10 years younger, but shown with a more furrowed brow, and blanchette is 20 years older and not a wrinkle; it's a though the continuity girl lost it- the one on the set who is supposed to see that when the cigarette has burned down to the filter, the close-up takes don't show it freshly lit; also suffers from been there done that, a la dorian gray and others; and the conundrum of a baby dying by becoming younger? as though unborn is dying? doesn't quite work metaphysically; so as you get hooked in, an usual love story, through the ages, even backwards, the movie keeps hitting you with implausible and impossible conditions instead of brushing them aside and keeping the story and your attention on track</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story with great feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by David Fincher, this movie is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1922. I've read the short story, but ignoring it when I review the movie is easy as there is basically no connection between the two. I review the film on its own merits, which are many.The cast is great: Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, and more. The script takes the concept of the short story and goes in completely different directions, taking a path that borders on overly sentimental. Benjamin is born at the end of World War I as an infant who is apparently about seventy years of age, nearly blind from cataracts. As he grows, becomes a toddler, then a pre-schooler, crippled with arthritis, frail, and elderly. He can only watch his peers at play through his glasses. As time passes, his health improves and he becomes more able. It becomes clear that he was born an old man but that he is getting younger as time goes by.Benjamin's mother dies giving birth and his father, horrified by the appearance of his son and by the death of his wife, at first considers throwing the infant in a canal (the movie is situated in New Orleans) but he ends up leaving the baby as a foundling at an old folks home where little Benjamin fits right in. He's taken in by Queenie, a black maid at the home, and her boyfriend or husband, who is the cook. Benjamin is raised as their own, with no mention ever being made of race. I really liked this although it's impossible to conceive of the reality of a race-blind New Orleans in the Twenties, Thirties, Forties, Fifties, and Sixties. Benjamin calls Queenie "Momma," and he's treated by all as her son.It's a heartwarming story from the time we meet Queenie, with age as the defining metaphor. In the old folks home, frail elderly come in, dead go out, and young Benjamin watches it all through the cataracted eyes of a pre-schooler, then a pre-teen, then a teen as the hormones kick in and hair starts to grow on his body. As befits the little old man that he appears, Benjamin is wise beyond his years, and we get a wizened view of life. I didn't really get any depth from the movie. It was a great story with great feeling, but no great lessons. And that's fine. It ran about two hours and forty-five minutes, and it held my attention throughout. It's well-written, with good characters, good dialogue, and good visuals.I highly recommend the short story, whether you've seen the movie or not. Neither will spoil the other as there are no plot similarities at all. The story is much more bitter-sweet than the film. I recommend all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short stories. He was excellent. Many, maybe all, of his short stories deal with youth and the failure of its promise. The story of "Benjamin Button" deals with it in reverse. The movie misses that entirely, as a Hollywood film must. The ending of the short story is one of the best I recall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benjamin Button is almost a great film. The problem is the length which is at least 30- 40 minutes too long. It would have worked as a two hour movie. David Fincher needed to get his ego under control and leave some things on the cutting room floor.A backwards running clock starts things going as a reason for the plot of Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt) aging backwards, starting as an old man and time shifting in reverse to youth. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the original as a short story. Benjamin falls in love with Daisy(Cate Blanchett) and so begins a life long romance with the twist being that she gets older and he gets younger as the years pass by. Real historical events such as Pearl Harbor are used as a background. Brad and Cate have a natural chemistry and Fincher's visual sense is acute, this is a gorgeous feast for the eyes. I was initially mesmerized by the concept until the final 1/3 which became ultimately exhausting. My only advice to Fincher next time is edit, edit, Edit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been awaiting to see this movie for some time. Alas, it was Christmas Day and you bet I was there to see the movie on opening day. I set my expectations really high on this film. I expected nothing short of brilliance with a film coming from director David Fincher, director of the masterful "Zodiac" and screenwriter Eric Roth, writer of the classic "Forrest Gump". The acting is brilliant in the movie. Brad Pitt and the marvelous Cate Blanchett share a fire that resonates so effortlessly out to the audience. Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson's as Benjamin's mother, and Tilda Swinton's as Benjamin's first lover. Another notable achievement in the film is the visual effects; none of it is overdone and it is quite convincing. The music in the film is great as well. The haunting and mythical music is composed by Alexandre Desplat. One thing that did surprise me in the film was the amount of comedy present, but I guess comedy's needed for a tale with such sorrow. I really do think that this film is a classic. And I would go and see it again. When I was walking out of the theater, some people complained that the movie was very good, but that it was too long. I disagree; I actually didn't want it to end. It's the perfect film to watch all snuggled up in a blanket during the dead of winter. All things aside, this movie is about the short time we're given with life and how we are to make the most of it. Even with a story as fictional as Benjamin Button's, the message rings true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can ALWAYS BET ON MR. David FINCHER for a good flick!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this guy the among the best directors in Hollywood. Rest of the pick are Ridley Scott, John Mctiernan, David Cronenberg, and Michael Mann.This film has a very, very interesting topic about reverse aging and an engrossing character named Benjamin Button."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is based on a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and first published in Colliers Magazine on May 27, 1922. It was subsequently anthologized in his book, Tales of the Jazz Age, which is occasionally published as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Jazz Age Stories. Development rights to the story were held for years by the late Hollywood mogul Ray Stark. Stark retained those rights until his death in 2004, when they were purchased from his estate.The film adaptation DIFFERS GROSSLY from the short story.Brad Pitt, the actor I liked in Fincher's bleak thriller Seven, does a professional job in his role as Button. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy Fuller, Benjamins's lover. She also complements Pitt's character. Other notable actors are: Taraji P. Henson as Queenie, who adopts Benjamin and fulfills her role as a mother to him. Jared Harris as Captain Mike Clark Benjamin who offers Benjamin a job on his Tugboat. Rampai Mohadi as Ngunda Oti, a pygmy who befriends Benjamin.Full Plot: In 2005, Daisy, an elderly woman, is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. Daisy asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.In 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of a very elderly man. The baby's mother dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. "Tizzy" Weathers, who work at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.In 1930, 12-year-old Benjamin, having exchanged a wheelchair for crutches, befriends six-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. As Benjamin's body grows younger, he accepts work on a tugboat. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans with the tugboat crew for a long-term work engagement and starts an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister.In 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, and learns that 21-year-old Daisy has become a successful ballet dancer. Benjamin again crosses paths with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals that he is Benjamin's father. Thomas wills Benjamin his possessions before he dies.Daisy's dance career is ended in Paris in 1957, when she is hit by a taxi cab and breaks her leg. When Benjamin goes to see her, Daisy is amazed at his youthful appearance, but frustrated at her own injuries; she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and move in together.Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline in 1968. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father figure to his daughter due to his reverse aging, sells his belongings and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He travels the world alone during the 1970s.Benjamin, appearing to be in his early twenties, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now re-married, Daisy introduces Benjamin to her husband and daughter as a family friend. Daisy then visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they share their passion for each other. Daisy admits that Benjamin was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. Benjamin departs again.In 1991, widowed Daisy receives a phone call from social workers. They have found Benjamin ? now apparently about 12 years old ? living in a condemned building, and have contacted her because they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers say that his condition resembles dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home where Benjamin grew up and takes care of him as he becomes increasingly younger until, physically, he becomes an infant once more. In 2003, he dies in Daisy's arms remembering who she was. Benjamin's story now told, Daisy dies in her New Orleans hospital bed, as Hurricane Katrina approaches.Verdict: Buy it on DVD! Other D. Fincher films I have seen that you may also like: Alien3(Directorial debut film 1992), Seven(1995), The Game(1997), Panic Room(2002).P.S: I think Fincher was robbed off the best picture award!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the catastrophic day that Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans, Louisiana, an elderly woman named Daisy Williams, played by Cate Blanchett, is in the hospital on her deathbed. Accompanying Daisy is her daughter, Caroline, played by Julia Ormand. Daisy asks Caroline to read from a diary that was written by a lifelong friend, Benjamin Button, played by Brad Pitt. Benjamin is born with an aging disease that causes him to age backwards. Benjamin's birth results in his biological mother's death, so his biological father sees Benjamin as a monster and abandons him on the step of a senior's home where he is found and raised by a woman named Queenie, played by Taraji Henson. Though it is thought that he won't live long, the film follows him through his long life and how he gets to know Daisy. The diary tells of Benjamin and Daisy's relationship through the years, and the struggle Benjamin faces with his disease and he grows Younger into his childhood. Caroline ends up learning about her mother's life, and a little about her own as well. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, the theme is that of identity. Since Benjamin is born as an old man, his attitude and personality is that of an old man. He spends time with elderly people, and he doesn't leave the seniors house he lives in. As Benjamin starts growing younger, he wants to go out and explore more. In his first trip out of the house with Ngunda, his character seems excited and his personality shows more vivaciousness than previous. As Benjamin gets younger, his character becomes more sociable, and he goes out and does more things. Benjamin is in a war, he goes to brothels, he meets more people, and he just generally sees the world. As he ages into a very small child, he gets into more mischief, such as getting up on the roof of the seniors home. This shows the relationship between age and identity. Throughout life, we change as humans in our personalities and views, and certain ages of our lives make us act certain ways, whether it's being lively while you're young, or matured when you're older. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is similar to the movie Forrest Gump, written by Robert Zemeckis, in the fact that the movie relives a person's whole life and follows how a person changes identity throughout their life. Angle helps identify the theme of identity in the movie. When Benjamin is elderly, and living at the seniors home, the camera is often looking down on him. Being elderly, Benjamin is very introvert and not as outgoing as he is as he gets younger. The camera angle shows this smallness to everyone younger than him, such as Queenie and Daisy, by having the camera looking down on him.The motif of the senior's home also helps the theme. Benjamin goes back to the senior's home when he learns a life lesson and has to become more mature. When Benjamin and Daisy fight, Benjamin returns to the home and matures on the subject. Even though he is younger, it reflects the maturity he had when he was older and living in the seniors house. Benjamin's change of identity throughout the movie reminds us that identity ties to our age and what we've seen in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film stars Brad Pitt as the title character Benjamin Button, Cate Blanchett is Daisy Fuller, the leading lady and love interest of Benjamin, and Taraji P. Henson, surrogate mother to Benjamin. This film is directed by David Fincher. The film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is about a boy who is born old, and grows younger instead of older as time passes. It is a coming of age in reverse. Benjamin's experience through life is much different than what everyone is used to. Benjamin is abandoned by his parents because of his unusual condition is taken in by a black women named Queenie, who loves and cherishes him as her own, in spite of his unusual condition. He spends his childhood at a senior citizen home. The filmmakers choose the technique irony of setting by having the young boy in the old man's body live in a senior citizens home. The seniors don't mind his company; he's fits in with them and their lifestyles. His changes when one of the tenants has her granddaughter visit for the weekend. This is where Daisy, a very pretty, precocious, redhead little girl enters the story. Daisy and Benjamin instantly connect. Daisy later becomes the love of his life. Benjamin is subjected to things as an old man. He learns of death and mourning from the senior citizen home. Benjamin drinks under age and experiences sex with prostitutes whenever he chooses. As Benjamin grows younger, his intense curiosity propels his sense for adventure. One day after meeting a sailor who is looking for an extra hand on ship, Benjamin is quickly decides to join him eventually finding himself in World War II. Through these experiences is where Benjamin learns the true meaning of life. Over the years his curiosity takes him many places in life. As Benjamin grows younger, everyone around him grows older, but his heart and soul remain humble. The theme of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is about unconditional love despite the curious life lived by a young man. Benjamin experiences through life shape his understanding of himself and the world surrounding him. The narrative from Brad Pitt along with flashback scenes places the viewer into the world of Benjamin. This film is shot from the subjective point of view, so the viewer feels like a silent observer watching events. The cinematography techniques used are transitions from one scene to the next, which make the film flow seamlessly. The film grade is sepia colored, with a muted color palette that allows the viewer to focus on the story more than the background. The costumes and make-up used does a good job of portraying the passage of time and emphasizes the time period for the film. The film is long; almost three hours, but the story is so compelling, you do not realize how long. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good love story. The love story in this film is not only about romance, but about unconditional love and acceptance. This theme of this movie will appeal to viewers young and old. The compassion by Taraji P. Henson is enough reason to view this film itself. If that theme, visual effects, and superb acting is not enough, the handsomeness of Brad Pitt will definitely win female viewers over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a 2008 film directed by David Fincher that is loosely based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It tells the story of a man who is born old, then spends the rest of his life aging backwards. His life is not measured in minutes, but by the moments spent in life. The story begins in 2005 with Daisy (Cate Blanchett) as an elderly woman on her deathbed in a hospital, asking her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) to read aloud from a diary. As Caroline begins to read from this diary, the film goes back to 1918, when Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is born with the physical appearance of an elderly man. His mother dies shortly after childbirth and Benjamin's father, Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng), decides to immediately abandon him on the front porch of a New Orleans nursing home. One of the nursing home workers, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) finds the baby and decides to raise him as her own. As Benjamin starts to grow up, the movie allows us to view his life from the days spent in the retirement home as a child, to a sordid love affair in a hotel in Russia, with different adventures in New York, Paris, and India all along the way. As Benjamin grows younger and healthier, his mind grows older and wiser. Benjamin eventually grows young and dies in 2003 as an infant in Daisy's arms. With his entire history, including his true love for Daisy, now told through this diary, Daisy slowly slips away to the fate that inevitably awaits us all. As sad as this movie is, it is a wonderful film that shows us the importance of loyalty towards family and friends, loving each other no matter the circumstances, and always appreciating what you have and are given in life. The film has some similarities to Forest Gump, but it is a little less goofy and has a much more sincere and endearing quality to it. Both films have that element of sentiment primarily stemming from both of their peculiar lead characters, both born with afflictions, following them through their lives as they both go through peculiar situations, and dealing with peculiar people along the way. Both Pitt and Blanchett do a great job in this film, but it is the supporting cast that really wins you over. Queenie in particular does an amazing job of providing love, joy, and humor that is second to none and allows you to immediately identify with her character. Pitt was also amazing as he portrayed a young, curious, and innocent soul in an old man's body, as well as when he portrays an older, wiser soul, in a much younger looking body.There was a general motif of time throughout this entire film that was pretty obvious. There are multiple scenes in which a clock is shown, including at the end of the movie, just as an infant Benjamin dies, when an old clock is quickly shown reversing in time. In addition, the cinematography and lighting of this film are both absolutely amazing. There is an old fashioned approach that is used throughout this film to give it that Hollywood epic feel, however, as time progresses and Benjamin begins to get visibly younger, a different style of film and lighting is clearly used to give each scene a fresh and vibrant look, which is able to compliment the amazing makeup job used to make Pitt look just as he did in his 1991 movie Thelma and Louise.Considering we are not getting any younger, take time to enjoy this wonderful and heartwarming film, it will not only make you appreciate your life a little more, but will also make you wish you could stop the clock and make it last forever. ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drama/Romance for not so Drama/Romance Guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was an excellent drama/romance even for those not so fond of the emotional rollercoasters used in dramas. The drama is man versus nature as Benjamin battles life with the cards he had been dealt. Benjamin is born with an unusual condition, he is born old. He enters the world as an infant at the age of 80 years old. Benjamin Button who is played by Brad Pitt for the majority of the movie is also played by six other actors. Benjamin grows up in a retirement home where he learns valuable lessons about life and how it should be appreciated and treasured. The director uses a subjective point of view to show the audience how the events in Benjamin's life impact him and attempts to engulf the viewers with the same feelings. The camera angles and close-ups of Benjamin after being disappointed show us how the child/old man feels this pain. At the beginning of the movie I actually had great difficulty visualizing this old man as a child however, the acting along with the camera angles showed how the old man showed disappointment like a young boy, well done. Later he meets a Daisy Fuller played by Cate Blanchett while he is still young but looks about 70. Daisy is special to Benjamin and she realizes that he is different. They become good friends and begin to share a special bond. While the children are at the retirement home the director uses very soft lighting. Much of the acting at the retirement home is done in candlelight which really brings the audience into the movie. We ultimately realize that Daisy is the old woman in the hospital. Her daughter Caroline Fuller played by Julia Ormond is reading the events of Benjamin's life. If I had to choose one piece that I could say I did not like about the movie was the two and one half hour run time. There were points in the movie where I was still interested but restless. Although the movie ends very dramatically it felt as though it took just a little too long to get there. Having said that, I do believe that the emotional impact given by the director in the end would not have had the dramatic effect it did have if scenes had been removed.This movie showed great resemblance to another movie, Forever Young. In this movie the theme and conflict surrounding the move is about time and love lost. Mel Gibson who played Daniel McCormick is frozen in a time capsule and at the conclusion of both movies the viewers are left with a feeling of unaccomplished goals. Both of these movies are man versus nature and well performed. Overall I would rate this movie very high. It was able to gain and maintain my interest even though I would typically pass the title over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing movie that everyone must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******SPOILER ALERT********The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was an interesting film that I never would've really watched if it wasn't for this film class. It seemed very odd when I had seen previews for it. I never looked at any reviews and knew little of this movie going into it. I thought it was going to a long and boring movie, but to my surprise it was definitely a great movie. This movie was about a man named Benjamin Button (played by Brad Pitt) and Daisy (played by Cate Blanchett) and pretty much about their love and Benjamin's life. Benjamin was basically born an old man and as he grew older, his looks and body grew younger. His mother died while giving birth to him and his father thought he looked horrible and left him on the steps of a senior home. This was fitting because he looked like an old man and looked like he belonged there. He was taken care of and loved by the caregiver at the senior home. While he lived at the senior home he met Daisy when she was about five years old and from there it grew from friendship to love. Benjamin went off and discovered the world and constantly sent post cards to Daisy telling him of his life and his adventures. As Benjamin got younger in appearance, everyone else around him was growing older. Ben and Daisy finally ended up getting together when she was in her mid-thirties I believe and lived together happily for many years. When Daisy is on her death bed during Hurricane Katrina she tells her daughter of who her real father is by having her read Benjamin's diary. The theme of this movie is coming of age/loss of innocence/growing awareness. Although Benjamin appeared as an old man at the beginning of the movie, his mental age was that of a five year old. The doctor's had never seen anything like it before and thought that Ben would not live very long when he was just a baby. Benjamin ends up living a very long life and experienced many things, including love. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was also about not taking things or people for granted. This movie reminded me a little of the movie Jack with Robin Williams, this movie is about a boy who's body and appearance is much older than he really is. He has a disease which makes him age four times faster than any other normal human being. Jack is also a coming of age movie where he ends up going to school and meeting friends who accept him for who he is and tells of his life as a kid who looks like a grown up and just wants to belong and live a normal life. In the movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, there was a scene in the movie when Ben and Daisy are with Daisy's grandmother and the grandmother is telling them both a bed time story. After the grandmother is finished reading the story, they both want her to read it again. You can see the similarities between Ben and Daisy even though he looks like an eighty year old man his mental state is that of a five year old. Another scene is when Benjamin drinks alcohol for the very first time and throws up from drinking too much. He looks like an old man but he is actually in his teens I believe. The acting was done very well by both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The costumes and scenery were both in relation to the story. Never once did I notice anything that was not matching up to the storyline. The lighting on Daisy when she was in her twenties was a very soft and warm glow that she had about her during these years as well as when Benjamin was getting younger the lighting was making him look more alive and vibrant.This movie was heartwarming, sad, and at times funny. I absolutely recommend this movie to others to watch. It was by far one of the greatest movies I've seen this year. This movie makes you think about your loved ones and appreciate them that much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was about a young boy Benjamin, played by (Brad Pitt) who was born with a rare disease that made him age backwards. He started out as a baby but as time grew longer, he aged really quickly. During his childhood, he fell in love with an older girl played by (Cate Blanchett). Although he was much younger than her, no one could tell because of the disease making him look older than what he was. As time grew further, his time went backwards. For a while it was nice being with the girl, but then he started to go back into the stage of an elderly man until one day he died. Although his true age was young, the disease made him older than what he was until he turned old, dying, and leaving his love behind. The theme of the Curious Case of Benjamin Button is to allow someone the opportunity to view life in a different aspect. This movie shows how, even though you are born with a disease that you may or may not live through, you still can have a chance at living life as much as you can as well as finding someone to love and to love you back. It shows that people of all walks of life experience hardships but have the opportunity and ability to move past their problems and into a peaceful place in their world. This movie also shows the viewer that love does not see images, and can be found through the eyes of the beholder. Brad Pitt played the part so well in allowing the viewers to see the challenges people can face and the opportunity to overcome those challenges to live as normal life as possible. You felt like you were in the scene with the Benjamin Button and watched his life blossom and then wither away, all in the same film. I watched this movie in total awe. It was very interested and gave me a new outlook on life. Another film that this story reminds me of is The Titanic. In that movie, you find one rich person and one poor person; both from different walks of life, but still found each other and fell in love. It didn't matter to them what type of life they had or where they were going. But through the film, although her parents didn't want her to so much as talk to him, they still fell in love, and she remember the day that she met and fell in love with him, until the day she died. She told the story through her love for the person. In the movie the curious Case of Benjamin Button, the lighting showed various ways of feelings that the young boy was having. When he was in pain from the disease or angry about what he was going through, the lights were dim. When he was with his love, it was very bright in light; almost portraying they were feeling for each other. Another technique I recognized was the angle of the film. In different parts of the film, when Benjamin was a young boy living with the maid, the space was very small. The camera was zoomed in at some points showing how small the room was in which they lived. It gave it a sense of togetherness. As if that were their room or living quarters and no one else's. She took care of Benjamin even in the smallest of spaces, and loves him as he was. This movie was one of the best movie's I've seen in a while. I like how it told the story of the boy with the disease, falling in love, and what their lives were like and pulled you into character while doing such. If more movies could be like this, it would show the creativity of one's mind and what you can do while just telling a story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been best picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is basically about a boy who is born old and as he grows up reverses in age until he is a newborn. During this reverse aging process he lives an extraordinary life traveling the world and seeing many different sights but he always keeps coming back to his child hood love, Daisy. The theme of this movie is actually expressed by Benjamin himself, nothing ever last. Throughout his entire life Benjamin is always dealing with loss. The theme of this movie is shown over and over as Benjamin deals with loss as others around him keep getting older and he keeps getting younger. When I first saw this film in the theaters I thought it was a masterpiece. The story is so well written and played out of the course of the movie that you get instantly sucked in. Benjamin meets many characters over the course of this film but few other than Daisy really stick with you as memorable. The many scenes and activities of his life can get forgotten if you were to retell this movie to someone but the overall movie can really stick with you. I honestly felt like this should have been best picture the year it released. The overall story and message of the film just seemed to stick more than any other film that year. Another underlining theme of this movie is, opportunities that you take or miss make up your entire life. David Fincher is a fantastic director and this film just adds to his resume. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett both put on amazing performances however most of the supporting cast is easily forgettable. I like that they used the real events of Hurricane Katrina as a back drop and even including the storm hitting and the floods washing away some of the memory of Benjamin at the end of the movie. The only complaint I have about this movie is the run time is a little long for the film to be enjoyed multiple times. This movie will really make you think about your life, where you've been and where you plan on going?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film from start to finish does not let up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the real Best Picture of 2008!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt in a role that is a real inspiration to all in this tale of self exploration and true drama.Benjamin was a strange case as he was a child born with an odd condition that left him aging differently than other people in the world. Growing up with others dying around him he managed to gain a unique view of the world in light of his condition.This film pretty much is a remake of Forest Gump in most aspects which is one of the reasons that this one has an 8 instead of a 9. This tale shows many adventures of our hero over his lifetime and Brad Pitt's portrayal of this character rivals Tom Hanks in his portrayal of a similar character type. With him and his counterpart Cate Blanchett they get along well together making the interactions very smooth and enjoyable overall.In the end the message of enjoy life in the moment gets across well and this movie is very much one of the more enjoyable films of that year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't want it to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am a lifelong movie lover I can not write as intelligently about movie making or movie makers as many who post here. So I can not speak to the technicalities of this except that of course there were many. Mostly though I simply loved this film. We were three generations who saw it together and we all loved it. To me it was filled with love. The gentle character of Benjamin himself, the selfless love of "Momma" All the scenes were beautiful even while they were violent. I loved the scenes in the kitchen in the Russian winter palace, in the home, the last scene, the sailing scenes. This was so rich and dense with characters that were all interesting and ultimately loving, from Benjamin's father to the twin brothers on the tugboat and the kindliness of so many of the people in the home, Benjamin's "sister" the welfare workers and the main characters themselves. To me this was a flawless movie, which perhaps if I watch it again will not remain so, but for one who sees relatively few movie theater movies, this was the perfect movie going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was curious alright and glad it got the better of me..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I've been highly curious to see for a while and finally got round to it. I heard it was long and it is long for around 2 hours and 40 minutes but it is a rich story, sympathetic characters and makes you wonder at the preciousness of time and life that we have.Brad Pitt - now I never really saw him as much of an actor but boy has he done a great job here. You forget that he is the tabloid pretty boy everyone keeps talking about. In this, he feels more like a character than ever. Cate Blanchett is superb and the chemistry between the two leads is terrific. It is also interesting to see how they both grow older but in different ways - he becomes physically younger and she gets older.What I think the film is trying to get at is how we all emphasise on the fear of becoming older. But if you did it in reserve - where you start off as an old person and become younger - do you really become younger? You still live out life and go through the journeys that normal people go through. You love, you feel pain, you cry etc. This is made more ironic by the fact that when you are born, you start off being helpless and when you are old, you become fragile just as if you were born as well but with more wisdom.While I think the ending could have touched more on its message, it leaves you to interpret what they are saying here. It's what you take away from the film and the experience of Benjamin with you. And while it could have been a bit more specific with its message, I think if you are highly moved by this film, you will pick up your own moral from this film.Essentially it's almost like a Forest Gump type of film where it's about a man who goes through life's experiences. There isn't really a solid based story here - you could simply dismiss it as a bunch of things that happen to this person, but what makes it meaningful is how the character develops with the realisation that time is short for him just as everyone else, and that is something all of us can relate to.I spent two and a half hours watching this and I certainly don't regret it. This is a film that will either move you or for some, bore you but I wasn't bored. I have more respect for Brad Pitt after seeing this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very smart and inventive story turns into a very conventional and soulless movie by a lot of additions and omissions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problem of Benjamin Button is that the original story is probably one of the most smart and interesting stories ever written, but the movie cannot adapt this idea well because of several reasons that I will mention in order. The first reason of this is that the movie changes a lot of things in the short story. Why? Benjamin Button was not boring to me at all, but it was soulless and conventional. I read the book after watching the movie which I seldomly do and I saw the differences and saw that how Fincher turns an interesting and heartbreaking story into a soulless and usual movie. For example, in the end of the movie, I felt nothing, but the book made me stunned. The book is very short, in fact too short for such a story, but somehow, the author fits everything into 70, 80 pages and it becomes wholly satisfying, not scratchy at all. What a success! In the movie, the script writer wrote a screenplay that makes a two hour and a half movie. Why? To make it an epic in order to win Oscar? Then, can we say that Benjamin Button is Oscar-driven (and I believe that also audience-driven) If the movie had been 100 minutes for example, still it would not have made it great, but much better, because there are unnecessary additions and omissions in the movie which the main problem as I said. Aren't there some movies which are pretty short, but one of the best ones of all times like 12 Angry Men? From now on, my review will contain spoilers about the movie and the book both. In the book, the writer is the narrator and his observations are very interesting and amusing as well. To tell some parts of the story by using a narrator is a cliché way, but in this book, it sounds mesmerizing. In the movie, we hear the story from a diary of a woman by his daughter. This is real cliché! In the book, the beginning, the hospital part is much more realistic than the movie, the reactions of the father, the nurses, the doctor, all the people are much more realistic. Instead, the movie uses a cliché, an ill old woman in a bed and her daughter who reads her mother's diary, uninspiring. One more thing, in the movie, Button is born as a deformed baby, in the book, it is a tiny old man. Benjamin Button in the original story is a much more interesting and amusing character, also his questions and his answers are the same. The tone of the movie, especially the story telling are not magical, it is conventional. For example, the battle scene in the sea, entertaining, but audience-driven, unnecessary and conventional. In the book, the first days of Button in home are very interesting too, it does not need such scenes, but the movie does not focus on Benjamin Button, his character, his psychology, the situations he is in, the reactions of the people around him etc. I loved this part in the book: his father brings a rattle and Button takes it by a weary expression and jingles it at intervals. He buys toys, but Button is not interested in, he reads medical articles to find an answer for his weird situation. The relationship between Button and his father id very important too, but in the movie, it was just uninspiring and does not make any sense. Yes, the book is about love also, but in the book, the love affairs of Button are very realistic, but the point is that it is not the center of the story. In the movie, the little girl is interested in Button when he is an odd-looking old man. Is such a spoiled little girl interested in such an odd looking old man? What a mess! At night, she invites him to play under a table. This is ''two children are interested in each other while playing'' matter. Obviously, she likes him which opens door to pedophilia. And the images which Button and Daisy live in a flat that has no furniture were inappropriate for such a content by the way. The movie is almost a pure romance, love story. It means that an interesting story turns into a love story. In the book, his wife does not attract him anymore, because he gets younger, it tells something about love. One of the most stunning parts in the book takes place in the university. The movie does not even refer to this. He looses weight, gets weaken, so cannot be as successful as he does in the first year in the football team. These parts make you sorry for him. In the movie, the childhood years of Benjamin Button is told in a too scratchy way. We see him while playing piano and later on the roof, that's all. What is the point? He is very angry, he swears that seems odd. Yes, spiritually, he gets older, so being awkward is normal, but it is against the original idea that is much more consistent and brilliant. In the book, Benjamin becomes a normal child, nothing more nothing less, he plays toy soldiers etc. then is sent to a kindergarten. The author describes his childhood years in detail (yes, imagine, this is a 80 pages book) Only by two pages, two pages!, Fitzgerald tells his childhood and babyhood periods and it is so effective, we feel everything that baby Button feels. In the movie, we see that he is in Daisy's arms and closes his eyes. Honestly, I felt nothing. Besides being visually well and entertainment in some scenes, the only good thing in the movie is Brad Pitt, who is one of my favorite actors. That's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was designed to make you cry. Watching it was like being a guest on Oprah. You know -- those guests who are larger than life but end up bawling on her couch after she brings up every sad thing that's ever happened to them? That's what this movie was like. Unfortunately the dying old people, parental betrayal, and creepy infant Alzheimer's moments weren't enough. We had to relive Hurricane Katrina as well. Meanwhile, I'm squirming in my seat about to have a panic attack and begging an usher for one of those morphine drips Cate Blanchett's character was fortunate enough to abuse throughout the movie.There were no dry eyes in the house when I saw it. I think Fincher could've slit the throats of scores of puppies on screen with that freaking Sarah McLachlan song in the background for three hours and it would almost equal a third of the crushing sadness of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.You never know what's comin'.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very eager to see this film - based on a story by a great pillar of American literature, directed by the ingenious director of 'Fight Club' and 'Se7en', multi-million dollar state-of- the-art special effects, Brad Pitt as a teenager... To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The film lacked any originality and screenwriter Eric Roth clearly couldn't be bothered to think of any new ideas, so just copied and pasted the screenplay for his previous Oscar-winner (Forrest Gump), changed some names, used a thesaurus, and 'hey presto, nobody's going to notice I've just written the same film I wrote fifteen years ago!'. But indeed, we have noticed. Just check the FAQ to see the innumerable similarities. The times I heard lines to the effect of 'Life is like a box of chocolates' left me fighting the urge to shout 'Run, Forrest, Run... away from this remarkably crap film!' But to be fair, 'Forrest Gump' is a lovely film with (surprisingly) a lot to say for it, so seeing a re-hashed version of it wouldn't be so bad? Well, not when the new version is a whole lot worse. The dialogue is boring, dreary and pointless throughout the whole film, with one in three lines being an aphorism regarding human lives such as 'With life, you've just got to take things as they come' or 'People die and people are born and that's just the way things are.' Yes, Benjamin, we all know this and just because you say it in a deep, rasping Southern accent doesn't make it philosophically insightful. Of course another massive flaw in the screenplay is that it completely ignores the potential of the premise of the film - a man who ages backwards. There is some ACTUAL thought one could put in about that idea, perhaps regarding the temporal nature of life?, the waste of youth on the young? No, no, no... Forrest Gump doesn't need to think of things like that. Ignoring the silliness of the premise, for which there is no attempt to reduce such ridiculousness by making the whole world more fantastical and magical, or finding some kind of scientific explanation for it, he lives his life as any other man, so we must ask, 'What's the point of this movie?' I think I may have realised. There is one way this film can be considered a masterpiece... as a satire. This film is full of every possible Hollywood stereotype of sentimentalism and cheese and the characters have as much depth and emotional intrigue as a penny, yet from a director of a film that said 'They make you believe through the movies that you're gonna be millionaires or rock stars but you're slowly realising that you're not. And you're very angry about that' (or something to that effect), that I think 'either Fincher has had an aneurysm and ingested vast quantities of sugar or this must be intentional'. I've realised that every individual section was in fact a parody of one of the generic Hollywood movies (most of them ending in either a sunset or a sunrise). There were so many moments in film I felt a sense of deja-v, thinking 'I know I've seen this image somewhere before in another movie... or maybe a postcard'. I shan't spoil it, but towards the end there is unnecessary 'pain and heartache' (and I mean really unnecessary - ' He didn't have to leave! He would have had twenty years!'- I nearly shouted) to make sure the audience got in enough of a cry. I have a theory that what Fincher was doing with all of this is making a subtle comment on the emptiness of the Hollywood cliché and how we should look beyond this to find the true soul of our characters beneath the cardboard. But of course, nobody has noticed this so it is really nothing more than pointless clichéd schmaltz. There is real credit to the film in its technical wizardry. The ageing (and rejuvenating) of characters is done with admirable precision and finesse. Physically, the film is quite an achievement. So it is probably there that it earns the majority of its four out of ten stars. A quick note on the acting - perfectly capable given what was provided. Nothing more or less. Overall, I'm very disappointed as this film really could have been something so much more than what it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What DID Benjamin Learn in his Life?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie I have seen this year, and it is a fine David Fincher masterpiece. But here in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", Fincher tackles a story furthest from his previous masterpieces, "Se7en" and "Zodiac." This movie is based loosely from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, with the main idea of being born old and growing younger with the passing of years . The story can fit into a single web page, but this movie takes this plot point and stretches it to nearly three hours of cinematic time.This film has been compared to "Forrest Gump" because of several parallelisms between the two movies. They are both long films that depict the passage of time with a series of episodes in the lead character's life. Maybe because they both happen to share one scriptwriter, Mr. Eric Roth? But while Forrest Gump is an active participant in the events (like in Vietnam or the pingpong), Benjamin Button was more of a passive observer of the people and events around him.This is my main reservation about the movie in general. I felt it would have been better if they had spent more time in the part where Benjamin is an wise old man with youthful looks. Ironically, at the time when he is older and already supposed to have all the experiences behind him, he looked younger but without any apparent wisdom. In fact, it seems he became more reckless and irresponsible as he grew older. This sort of limits the performance of Brad Pitt as well. When Benjamin looked like he was 12 years old, he already had dementia, so we never really learn what this type of living backwards in time has achieved in him.As for Cate Blanchett's character Daisy, we see her development more clearly as this was described in detail by Benjamin in his diary. I really like that sequence of scenes depicting how a series of small events led to a most unfortunate accident. I liked that montage of touching scenes showing how old Daisy took care of the demented child Benjamin. My main issue with her character was her attraction to the old child Benjamin. When and why did it happen? This was not clearly explained.The movie is long, yes, but it is engaging and you will want to know what happens next. The photography is luminous, both intimate and panoramic. Being a story that spans practically the entire 20th century, the costumes, set design and make-up are meticulous. Since Benjamin was born old, there are special effects to execute what happens to his body as he gains in years. While the effects to make Brad Pitt look old may be easier to imagine, how they make him regain the fresh youthful face we saw in "Thelma and Louise" at a certain point is really amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think back to the experience of watching this sorry piece of crap, I feel NOTHING. My sister (who also hated it) said rather optimistically it had 'a good message'. And what would that be, a freak who is born as an 80 year old and ages backwards until he dies as a baby can live as boring a life as the rest of us? Let's see now.. he learns how to play the piano, gets adopted by a black woman, falls in love with a red-haired girl, goes out to sea on a tugboat, abandons his daughter when she is born to mop some floors in India.. sorry, none of these little incidents and worth sitting through 3 hours of tedious drama for. Plus, Brad Pitt's narration is utterly irritating and pointless, and Cate Blanchett's character with her extremely fake New Orleans accent and shrill personality will make you wonder what Mr Button ever sees in her.The highlight of my trip to the cinema was leaving for 10 minutes to get myself a hot-dog and giant Pepsi Max at the foyer, sadly there wasn't a very long queue so I was back a lot sooner than I'd like to have been. In fact, as the rubbish plot unfurled and the couple with the least amount of chemistry I've seen in a long time spouted their soap opera dialogue to each other, I noticed small things, like the gum under my seat and how many tiles there was in the ceiling. Anything to stave off the boredom from David Fincher's cure for insomnia. Is this really the same guy who directed that brilliant film Seven? I thought Fight Club was overrated, but compared to this it was frinkin' Casablanca.What more can I say? Clumsy metaphors (Check out the clock that goes backwards) bad child actors (Cate Blanchett as a little girl is HORRENDOUS) no humour (apart from one brief scene with a prostitute.. sorry 'sex worker') all deserve a mention, but nothing, I repeat NOTHING can prepare you for the absolute stone dead monotony of sitting through the lame-brained, pathetic long slog of a motion picture. What is it the critics can see that I can't? I honestly don't care. What I do know is while it was on I wish, like the main protagonist I could age 28 years, regress back to being a baby and then climb back inside the womb for a bit of peace. Nice &amp; dark in there, and no boring, inconsequential films with a bloated sense of their own importance to bother me. Pass me the pacifier. SUCK SUCK. 2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cross between Forrest Gump and The Jerk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost right away this movie brought to mind the opening line from "The Jerk." "I was born a poor black child. I remember the days, sittin' on the porch with my family, singin' and dancin' down in Mississippi." Only in this movie it was more like, "I was born a very old black child. I remember the days, sittin' on the porch with my family and the old folks, singin' and dancin' down in New Orleans." And of course it resembles Forrest Gump, which I thought was an overblown, highly overrated bore. The screenwriter was the same person. During Button, I thought to myself, he's really going to say something as dumb as the box of chocolates line... and sure enough he did, several times. But most of the time during this three-hour one-note symphony, all I could think was, OMG when will this be over. I kept trying to figure out why they were working Hurricane Katrina in, and then it turned out to be nothing at all, really. I accepted the basic fantastic premise all right, but then there were obvious incongruities within the context of that premise. For example, if he is a teenager in mind, but physiologically old, he isn't going to be a sexual dynamo.When the credits started, my wife said, "I have to get to the bathroom." I said, "OK, I'll see if I can get a refund." Sure, the actors did their best, and the effects were not noticeable, which is a good thing; but, the sum of it all does not amount to good storytelling. Rent it; don't pay 9-10 bucks per ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the curious, yet bland, case of Benjamin button.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this new David Fincher film, and the premise of the movie was awesomeness. However, I thought that for the most part this movie was very bland and slow. At times it would seem that it would be for a more dramatic effect, seeing how you are going through his whole life, in a Forrest Gump kind of way. But often times i found myself loosing interest. The first hour or so when he is between the ages of 1 and 19 or so, where very entertaining. But from there, with a few exceptions, the movie bored me most of the time. The sequence explaining the events that led to Daisy being hit by a car where entertaining but it has been done many times before. I also felt that for the more than ample budget that this film must have been given, they really didn't use the money as well as they could of. Lastly I'm not so keen on the style Fincher used in this film. I enjoy an upwards crane shot when it is necessary. But it seems like almost every time somebody would walk a crane shot from a window was used. Oh and also, Brad Pitt could have done a much better job with the role. I wouldn't say it was a poor performance, it was definitely a good one, but meet my expectations it did not. In short, David Fincher you have disappointed me dearly. After the first hour and a half of the movie I just couldn't wait for it to end. 6 out of 10. Word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film of near near robotic technological precision. It is also one of near robotic emotions. Despite a few good supporting turns, the characters come across as simply means through which to display directer David Fincher's eye for the camera. Fincher is a gifted directer,who brought us such gripping films as "Fight Club" and "Zodiac". However these two films gave him something that this one did not: a good script. Eric Roth has borrowed heavily from his previous work, "Forrest Gump" with themes of innocence and learning, along with those nifty catch phrases. However unlike "Forrest Gump", "Benjamin Button"'s themes feel tacked on and not fully developed. At times it sounds as if the characters are giving the audience a lecture, that serves themselves no true purpose. This is not to say the the film isn't a technical marvel. In fact, some of the films better moments have no speaking, and are more a display of Fincher's solo talent. The performances are solid, but often crumble under the clunky script. One exception is a brief, but marvelous turn by Tilda Swinton, who has the film's best scenes and adds a much needed layer of character complexity. However Swinton is simply not on screen enough to elevate the film as a whole, and by the time the credits arrived, I simply thought..."OK, that was kinda cool...so what?"</fullReview>

Poor Brad- he just doesn't get it does he? I can just imagine the post Oscar night disbelief at his house for not scoring the Best Actor award as it feels throughout the film like that's what he was subconsciously expecting when you hear his voice over and notice how dead boring the story is. Maybe they thought, 'Don't be mistaken... all great Art is dead boring.' Perhaps it picked up in the last hour and became a top notch well acted, scripted and thought out masterpiece of modern cinema but, I wasn't prepared to risk that hour's sleep to find out and neither should you.

		<fullReview>This movie was good, but I don't know that it deserved the slew of Oscar nominations it received. It certainly wasn't good because of Brad Pitt, he has one of the least expressive faces in show business and it is difficult to actually believe he is feeling any of the emotions the script calls for. Another liability of this film is its length, most of which is spent showing the title character bouncing around apparently trying to find himself, which makes sense, given his circumstances, but it is a very superficial treatment. Finally, his aging process is not actually linear (neither forwards nor backwards), so an already implausible premise becomes even more difficult to buy into. I'm glad I saw it, but it is not the spectacular film people would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Preposterous Pecadillo of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have always wanted to see a really wrinkled baby grow up in reverse while he learns valuable lessons about life and love, then this is the movie for you. First off, any time that you see a title that has double alliteration ("Curious Case" and "Benjamin "Button") and then up the ante with a whimsical name like Benjamin Button and the promise that you're going to see a truly Curious Case, then you know you're in for something good. They even bring in the sultry seductress, Blanche Devereaux, from Golden Girls to get the groove going (although I was upset that Rue McLanahan wasn't available to play her this time). Still, imagine how thrilled I was to sit through something like four and a half hours of life, love and tears, as wrinkled baby becomes handsome huckster becomes young boy with the mind of a 90-year-old. What better way to learn how you should feel about life and love? After seeing this movie I totally re-evaluated everything I've done so far, left my husband, quit my job and left on a search for the giant-sized, adult baby man with whom I fell in love so many years ago. My search continues, and I shall let you know how it goes. Thank you, Paine Webber, and thank you, Benjamin Bratt!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to be the resident party-pooper, but I was left feeling cold by the end. For me, the gimmick wore off and I was left with a bunch of really sad lives, particularly the leads.The entire relationship left me puzzled. I don't know about you, dear reader, but when they first meet and he looks 70 something and she's about 7, I just sort of felt that was awkward and not right.There is some nice humor sprinkled all throughout, particularly from the aged residents of that house, and with the early scenes that introduce us to Benjamin. But as the relationship between Benjamin and Daisy transforms in the second half, it was harder to accept this big block of Hollywood cheese. Their scenes as they begin to get closer in age started to feel strained to me. There is a scene where Benjamin visits Daisy in New York, and it's just stilted and forced.I really wanted to care more about this film, but I feel like it was more an interesting exercise than a real experience that leaves us with something.For me, a 6 is where movies go that I liked in some ways, but that are near misses, and all the thick laying on of melodrama and bittersweetness finally just did the picture in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hated it. A lot. From the trailer it looked like Button was going to be an epic, self-indulgent way too overly sensationalized mess of a film. Now I don't go into a film expecting anything good or bad, so don't think that I went into it determined to hate it. And even if I had, it wouldn't be for those reasons. Although there are a few moments of the film that fit that description (the Mr. Gateau story, for example), most of the film was more low-key. However what the film did turn out to be was unbearably dull. There was no emotion, no intrigue, no life. It's a shame that a story which is fascinating on paper could turn into a picture that is so absolutely lifeless. The performances, the characters themselves, the direction, the screenplay. All of it contributed to a completely comatose picture. The visuals weren't even impressive. Sure they weren't bad, but they sure as hell weren't anything above average. And thus Button is just another highly-praised film that's making a dent in the awards season that I simply don't understand the praise for, at all. Three hours of my life I wish I could get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie so much because it speaks on something fundamental and precious to everyone: time. The way the story is told reminds me of Forrest Gump. And the plot reminds me of a book I read in elementary, called Turnabout by Margaret Peterson Haddix.The movie itself is a beautiful work to watch. Each character has a story to tell. The emotional tension really heightens in the end, when everyone realizes they can't escape time and when Caroline realizes the sad truth. Life is a funny thing: you can't stop it, you can't escape it, and you can't go back in time, even for Benjamin Button.One of my favorite dialogue from the movie goes like this: Benjamin Button: I was thinking how nothing lasts, and what a shame that is. Daisy: Some things last.Yes, memories and love lasts forever. I guess we really just have to cherish every moment we have with our friends and family. I think it's quite sad yet true when Mrs. Maple told Benjamin: "We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?" This movie is moving because it's so relatable and speaks the truth on many things in real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant, Powerful, Unforgettable Masterpiece Of A Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise seemed hollow and I'd heard that the film was very L O N G. Wow -- was I surprised. I was transfixed by the richness of the imagery and the resonance of the characterizations. Every performance in the film -- right down to each and every bit player - flawless! I haven't seen that in a long, long time. We expect Cate Blanchett to be brilliant but I was amazed to find Brad Pitt in the zone as well. He does the most amazing job of playing this unusual, demanding role with quiet understatement ... subtle yet so completely "present". It becomes clear fairly soon that the odd premise is a clever device for examining some of the deepest reflections about what life is ... and what it is not. And it works completely -- the reverse aging novelty allows for a fresh take on just about everything we might have previously thought -- about living and dying -- and about deep personal relationships.There is so much here! I feel like I've gotten to see four or five great films for the price of one! It didn't seem at all long to me - - in fact, I'd look forward to an even more fabulous directors cut, if there is one. The story line is dazzling -- it's a wonderful ride, full of the highest and lowest adventures of youth and age. And the images are unforgettable: a scarred leg slipped inside a silk stocking ... a mysterious female face shaded by a wide-brimmed hat ... and on and on. There's naval battle scene that's incredibly short -- yet I have never felt such pure, dark, deadly evil -- and such physical vulnerability as I did in that scene. Everything works -- all the wardrobe -- every set -- superbly designed and visually managed. For years David Fincher has been in high demand for directing high-class commercials, where every frame is routinely produced to perfection. No one ever thought you could hold to such standards in a 2 to 3 hour feature film but Fincher seems to do it routinely now.I would imagine the director happened to read this great novel and wanted to take on the daunting challenge of transforming it into a great film. Most would say "impossible". In the past, movies that follow a character over a lifetime have usually broken the part down for three different actors -- one plays the child, one plays the youth, and one more plays the adult. And there is invariably a huge jolt when the actors changeover. Well, being so focused on the aging process, this story obviously required a lot more than three versions of the character. Reportedly the film took a year to shoot -- and two more years to get the face of Brad Pitt onto all the other Benjamins. For me it works seamlessly.This is not your feel-good movie of the year. This is not your latest thrills and spills blockbuster. If that's your thing, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy and appreciate meaningful, memorable, epic motion pictures -- in the tradition of The English Patient, Lawrence Of Arabia, and Citizen Kane -- you will be challenged and you will be moved. Great films stay with you forever -- this is a great film.</fullReview>

I didn't think Brad Pitt was a good actor until I saw this.The setting was almost perfect.

In a way, the film could've never met my expectations. I hoped for something...magical, which isn't what I found upon viewing.Pitt does a good job, Blanchett, too, but the film devolves from something macabre, interesting into a message. The atmosphere is lost. The majority of the film is spent getting to the punchline. By the end of the film, I wanted baby Button to keel over and die in a pool of endogenic sludge.Benjamin Button is worth a watch though, especially for younger people (teenagers) looking to jump into life. You will find a message worth taking away. For older people who've been beaten down by the wh0res of life, you will wish for a better cut of the film to surface.</fullReview>

Henson: Curious drama about identity as an abandoned baby turns out to be over eighty years old and progresses backwards. It chronicles his life from old / young to the predicted young / old and his complicated relationship with a ballerina. Directed by David Fincher with tremendous visual appeal stemming from 1918 to the present. Brad Pitt is flawless as Button with convincing makeup as well as transcending the mental and emotional state in progress. Both Fincher and Pitt have worked well together on films such as Seven and Fight Club but here Pitt is clearly in the lead right up to its rather depressing conclusion. Cate Blanchett plays his life long romance who narrates the film from a hospital bed on the dawn of a storm. Tilda Swinton makes a memorable appearance as a woman whom Button encounters on his quest whom will disappear only to exist through his memory. Julia Ormond also give fetching performance as their daughter whom is waiting on her mother as well as discovering who she is through the story. Taraji P. Henson plays the woman who raises Benjamin when his father abandons him. The role is brief and more obvious than broad. It presents a strong case regarding age, life and love that is curious within each individual. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adding to Fincher's Collection of Masterpieces is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt as Benjamin Button, a man who was born in his old age, and ages backward, eventually as a baby. Throughout his life, he meets many people and experiences many things. These things are to teach lessons about life, and that's it's life is hard, no matter who you are or what your profession is.This is David Fincher's only PG-13 movie, so it's kind of out of his ball park. However, he made the film very well. The directing is great, and the cinematography really captures which time period Benjamin is currently in, whether it be the 1920's, or the 1960's. Fincher uses the camera so perfectly, the audience gets sucked into what's happening and forgets that they're watching a movie.The acting in this film is also amazing. Of course, Brad Pitt does fantastic, especially when pulling off the role of an old man. He plays a 70 year old, a 50 year old, a 30 year old, and a 16 year old all throughout the film, and he portrays the struggle of such a condition beautifully. Cate Blanchett as Daisy was good. It didn't really hook me, or present anything new to the film, but it definitely didn't bring it down at all.The score also depicts the time period very well. Early in the film (the 1920's) the viewer can subtly hear old fashioned radio music quietly in the background. Later on, in the 1940's, you can hear popular jazz or such that described that era. Finally, in the 60's, there's a Beatles song that plays (Twist n' Shout), showing the time period without even giving it away verbally.The above paragraph also leads into my next point: the cinematography. The cinematography illustrates the time period wonderfully. In the first act, everything is gloomy, due to the economic crash of 1929, leading into the Great Depression. Later, everything is more modern, yet not too modern. Streets are dark at night, and snow is on the ground. This shows the trouble that was World War II; whether Benjamin be in the United States or in Russia. Later, surroundings are more colorful and vibrant. This depicts the Vietnam/drug era. All of the decades are masterfully.The only real issues I had with this film is the progressiveness of it, and the timing in which the movie cuts back to present day (2005). In some portions of the film, nothing of importance will happen for 15 minutes or so. In other parts, three very significant things will happen within 20 minutes of each other. This balance throws the movie off in a way, and confuses the audience.My other issue with the movie is the timing of cuts to present day. While I won't say what happens in the present, I will say it's timing is very off. There will be times when the viewer is paying close attention, and the film cuts to 2005. This is very distracting, and sets back the audience. To your average movie goer, this won't be a big deal, but to a film enthusiast who watches movies the way a painter looks at Vincent Van Gogh's art work, it's offsetting.In conclusion, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a great film. It may bore some people, but I was very entertained, say for some of the present day scenes. I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button an A-, or a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Paced and Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has a very interesting idea. It's the life story of a man who ages backwards, starting from being a very physically old baby and growing up into a regular baby. It's quite an interesting concept, and it definitely turned out well. The plot of this movie is, like I just said, very interesting. However, with an idea like this it could prove difficult to make it interesting, especially when it's rocking a near 3-hour run time. However, while I know many people who found it to be slow and boring, I was very intrigued by it. I love these kinds of movies to begin with, and I only found one part of the whole movie to be particularly slow. It only lasted for about 10-15 minutes, so it didn't take away from the movie too much. Other than that, it's well-paced and interesting to watch. The character development is pretty good too. It's a life story movie, so you'd hope so. While there's more development of Benjamin Button himself, there's enough for the other characters that they still feel relatively important and you still feel relatively attached to each one. Something that I haven't been fond of in movies is when it starts with two characters and one of them tells the story of the movie and then the actual story starts. This movie had just that, but there was enough focus on the characters telling and hearing the story and they were relevant enough to the story that it didn't feel pointless, but more that it made the story better. It actually helped explain a thing or two about the movie as well. One of the main problems that I had with the movie was the romantic aspect of it. While it wasn't particularly poorly done it wasn't something we've never seen before. In fact, it felt horribly similar to that of Forrest Gump, which was made over 10 years beforehand. It wasn't a huge deal, but it was big enough to make a difference in the movie. Also, the fact that the romance between the main characters was shown primarily through their sexual behavior was a little annoying. While their relationship is well-developed, there wasn't enough focus on why they loved each other, but more on how much they love each other's body parts.Overall The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a very interesting, and very long, movie. The plot is interesting, it's well-paced, and the characters are good. Unfortunately, the romantic aspect of it could have used some more work, but it was still good for the most part. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie, so long as you like movies of this length about living life. I can see pretty much anyone being bored by this movie, but there will definitely be some of you who are as intrigued as I was by it I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-numbing, surprisingly bad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a curious case of a fantastic idea taken up by idiotic hands. The result is a great concept and not much else. The acting is laughable throughout the film, the script predictable and saccharine and the cinematography/screenplay bland.There's a constant, irritating feeling that the director thinks himself a 'genius of our time' and he takes special care to remind us just how wise he is at every single step of way in long, hollow, moralising speeches which don't help us in any way.I gave the film a very good chance (2 hours), but had to stop watching in the end.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benjamin Button (both the film and the character) is a little odd. Though engaging and well-acted it leaves you a little flat as you realise there isn't much point to the story. I mean, it's not something that's every going to happen in real life, is it? Button is a movie that would be much more well received I think if it had a 'Based on a True Story' flashed in front. Obviously that's not possible, and the movie unfortunately ebbs away from your memory not long after you see it. Logically, a lot of things don't add up, though I suppose if you go into the movie looking for a logical film you're not watching it properly.The special effects were good for the time but haven't held up completely well. Also, the film is pretty long at just under three hours, and unnecessarily so. However, it's not to say it is an unenjoyable three hours ? I found myself mildly pleased at what I was watching. A lot of parts were interesting, especially when Button meets new people. There's a grand sense of wonder and harmony that I connected with on more than one occasion. The romance was well dealt with and I didn't find it cheesy at all. It's just when the film finishes, its probing and stimulating touch kind of? evaporates, really.Best Scene: Cate Blanchett is confronted by a far younger Brad Pitt who looks suspiciously like he just walked out of the 90's after years of separation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very different story and it was well put to the screen by director Daving Fincher. And it was also nicely filmed and edited. But a movie is only so much without talented actors, and it should be said that "The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons" has some really talented stars on the cast list.And the storyline is unique, as we follow the life of Benjamin Buttons, who is born as an 80 year old man and grows younger with the passing of years; essentially aging in reverse.The story spans over many events, both historical and personal to Benjamin Buttons. But everything was presented in a very stylish manner, and the various ages and locations were very realistic and believable.A very impressive cast list brought this beautiful story to life on the screen, including names such as Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Elias Koteas and Jason Flemyng."The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons" is definitely a movie well-worth watching for its storyline, but also for the good acting performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great concept but comes short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film by David Fincher is based on the concept of the reverse aging process where the protagonist in the film Benjamin played by Brad Pitt is born with an unusual disease where he is aging backwards.Adapted from the fictional story 'The curious case of Benjamin Button' written by great American writer of the 20th century F.Scott Fitzgerald, the film goes with a slow pace with very minimum twists and turns but keeps the viewer on the edge for some unexpected development as the concept itself is a very interesting one and seeing that it's kind of disappointing with what the film is able to achieve and that is just a one time watch because of it's amazing concept.Only the title and the concept is retained from the book and the plot of the film is very different from the original story in the book.The film revolves around Benjamin who is born on the day the world war 1 ends but after giving birth to him his mother dies and his father abandons him after he sees his face thinking of him as some kind of monster but a caretaker of old people who runs an old age home, Queenie(Taraji.P.Henson) takes him in and looks after him, the boy grows up and becomes younger day by day. The film has a beautiful rhythm to it and the love story of Daisy(Cate Blanchett) and Benjamin is beautifully choreographed with the sentiments of the Benjamin who is left with a choice to either father his child in unusual circumstances and complicates his family's life or leave so that his daughter would have a normal life.overall the film is a good watch but has a lot of loopholes with no one taking attention of a miracle like reverse aging process in the manner it should be taken and the lack of emotions from the characters in the film is kind of unsettling.Brad Pitt's acting is average and other characters in the film other than that of the captain of the ship Mike Clark(Jared Harris) and Queenie fail to impress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprised to see all the negative reviews on here. Missed it in theaters but saw this movie with my mom and we both adored it! Pitt is a great narrator &amp; the flick takes you for a ride through the 20th century from the point of view of a man not growing older with the world but younger. Sure it's simple in a way, just the story of a man's life, however he is not an ordinary man. I've seen this movie umpteen times since initially watching it because I thought it was so well done! Make-up/costume was great, side-effects, acting, setting, plot- all great. I would recommend it to anyone who has yet to see it. One of my top five movies for sure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>great movie 10/10 worth ratingBefore seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie, I entered deeply in all emotions of this amazing masterpiece. It is not only a movie about a strange disease, but indeed it is a drama about the human being's conscience of its own life and the importance of all people around. Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt played well. You are never lost in time with a help of historical references. About the screenplay, I felt that each detail in each scene was carefully prepared to make us remember somebody which passed against our lives and made some difference. And a brilliant and nostalgic and simple final observation: "Some people, were born to sit by a river. Some get struck by lightning. Some have an ear for music. Some are artists. Some swim. Some know buttons. Some know Shakespeare. Some are mothers. And some people, dance."</fullReview>

The story was emotional and worth the attention and time one would invest in it. The best thing about the movie I found was the ending, it was beautifully shot and put together and the music was really suiting for it; how it showcased every influencing character in such an emotional way really won me over, as if I didn't want it to end and as if I were the one who shared experiences with those people, and it left me with a really satisfied feeling about the movie.

		<shortDescription>A Review Break 4 Casting Directors: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On truth, meaning, world-view, biblical principles and interpretation.How fiction reveal truth in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' movie is the movie makes it clear that you can't stop time, whether you're growing older or younger as we all are going to end up in the same direction. So enjoy the moments you have with the people that life brings across your path, and try to make the most of it. On meaning, describing what the story/director is trying to say is with all the clocks and flashback moments displayed in the film, I think that the story/director are trying to say that even though time can't be stopped and you can't make yourself get any older or younger time should never be the thing that tries to stop you from making the most out of the moments that life brings to you, as you can share those moments with the people that comes across your path. On world-view, describing what rules and values are in use by the characters are that the characters lived a life of lawlessness, as there seemed to be no rules hardly, it was a live of lawlessness as I don't think I saw any law enforcement vehicle, but I heard a police siren in the background of a scene so that could symbolize that they are around and just not seen. In the film it seemed like there were a bunch of worldly principles in the characters, as there was some party scenes in the whore house, drinking and living life carelessly until the characters was aging and on there death bed with regrets. The beginning of the movie started off displaying good values like Queenie taking care of a baby that was seen as something less important, Queenie taking Benjamin to church, Carolina reading to her mother Daisy, Daisy teaching ballet to the youth and some of the characters you can see valued the time that they spent with each other, those are just a few examples.Now discussing the characters' behavior, based upon biblical principles. One biblical principle that I noticed was when Benjamin button was drop off and abandoned at the steps of Queenie, Queenie took Benjamin button in, despite his physical appearance and raised him like her own. This biblical principle is taking care of the widows and orphans, as you can also see that Benjamin honored his care-taker by the way he treated Queenie. This can apply to honoring you father and mother. On interpretation, describing what the movie means to me personally. There was a lot of notes that I took on the movie, as I believe that I got a lot of stuff out of it. One was the value of time, as I have stated early on that you can't stop time, but you can make the most out of it while you are here on this earth. By sharing memories with those that life bring across your path, doing the simplest things that may seem big for others through their eyes and to not take time for granted as that is basically what this movie means to me personally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is strictly an adult film, and extremely LONG. Quite a feat for this day and age. So first, prepare yourself for a long slog, it's 3-hours, plus. It was a different kind of movie, based upon an equally dubious tenet. But if you're willing to take that large leap of faith, the film has it's moments. First, a tour de force performance by Brad Pitt. He's much more than just a pretty face, and this part must have taken a physical toll (oh, the makeup!) on him. He played the role with uncommon subtly and grace. And naturally, the luminous Kate Blanchette is always a joy to behold, revealing emotions on a level hardly seen today. That said, to base an entire, epic-length feature film on such a flimsy premise and glacial pace kind of left me gasping for air at the end, although there were some thoughtful and memorable moments. I'll give it an "A" for effort, but this isn't box office magic, to be sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A captivating masterpiece?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a weird little - it's a 2 hours and half - film. The subject is intriguing enough to get you to watch it but you stay because it's simply captivating. I was so invested in the story that I cried several times while watching it. The film is touching and heartwarming, and also subtle. It seamlessly breezes through times and really brings to life what the tagline is about "Life isn't measured in minutes but in moments."The film does go through Benjamin Button's life and really shows every step, moments, that defined who he is. The movie is very much grounded in reality which makes the fantasy elements of the story real. You quickly believe that a boy born old but with the mind of baby is possible. So the magic is there, grounded in the reality of Benjamin's life. I don't know who to accredit this to but it's very clear, palpable, that when Benjamin is growing up, looking like a man in his nineties his youthful energy shines through.Brad Pitt, being the title character is just stunning in this film. He helps make the weird aspects of the film OK. The same goes for Taraji P. Henson, she makes the old wrinkled baby the most normal thing, she brought the dramatic gut wrenching emotions of a mother's love in all her scenes. They all have their moments Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett all bring another layer, another moment in Benjamin's life. Blanchett evokes the undeniable question of love, and a lasting one as that. Benjamin's condition raises a valid question about age and love, which is interestingly dealt with in the film.More than a riveting story with great acting, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a technical prowess. The make up, the cinematography, and the special effects are mind-blowing Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look older and then younger and it's done beautifully. The darkness and lighting in David Fincher's style of film making really compliments the story but more so the technicality of the film. He was the perfect director for and did an amazing job throughout.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a wonderful film about time, life, and love. It's another David Fincher masterpiece that is timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some years have passed since I watched this film. Nevertless, it's still fresh in my memory for various reasons: 1- The theme of this movie is powerful: time and how we spend it in life. The evolution in the relations that Benjamin establishes with every single soul that he meets are quite enjoyable to watch. Even with the character of Cate Blanchett we can observe some interesting dynamics: sometimes we are not destined to be with the great love of our lives. Or at least, not in the fashion that we may suppose.2- The acting. I was quite stunned to see Brad Pitt in a role that made me look every single minute of the film. Cate Blanchett is quite brilliant and charming as in every other movie of her career.3- Maybe the most important of all: this film made me cry so hard (specially during the death of B.Button) Worth seeing, definitely. But be warned, you may cry so bring tissues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life Can Only Be Understood Backward. It Must Be Lived Forward.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A David Fincher film that's quite unlike any other David Fincher film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button marks the esteemed filmmaker's first foray into a genre that's very different compared to his usuals, is a fascinating portrait of life seen from a different perspective, and even though it may not be not as amazing as Fincher's best works, it's certainly his most distinct film to date.Inspired from F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story of the same name, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tells the life story of its titular character, who was born with all the characteristics of an old man but starts getting younger in appearance as the years pass by. The film covers his adventures &amp; experiences as he journeys through life in reverse, &amp; also follows the life of Daisy; his love interest.Directed by David Fincher, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button features many of the director's trademarks, especially in its visual &amp; sound design but it's not a film that many of his fans will enjoy or appreciate. Fincher shows a fine grip on storytelling elements here, keeps each event firmly glued to another &amp; does a pretty neat job in wrapping up the project that had been stuck in development hell for years.Coming to the technical aspects, Set pieces are well-detailed &amp; fit the different timelines they are depicted in, Cinematography benefits a lot from Fincher's sweeping cinematic vision &amp; the colour composition is spot-on, Editing could've paced the story a little better for its runtime is felt on few occasions, Visual effects &amp; make-up work in near-perfect harmony with each other, and Alexandre Desplat's score is a welcome one.As far as performances go, the screen is shared by either Brad Pitt or Cate Blanchett or both for the most part, and the two stars chip in with fabulous contributions in their given roles. Adding further strength to its cast are Tilda Swinton &amp; Taraji P. Henson, but there's nothing memorable about the acting here. More than the performances &amp; the narrative, it's how the events are filmed which leaves a lasting impression.On an overall scale, David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button often gets a lot of flak from his admirers &amp; others but it isn't as bad as they say, it's just quite different. I really enjoyed watching it, absolutely loved that monologue when Button travels to India &amp; don't really mind recommending it to anyone. There are many similarities between this &amp; Forrest Gump, so if you like that Tom Hanks starrer, you're very likely to have a good time with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with bizarre consequences. On the day that Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans, elderly Daisy Williams (nee Fuller) is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. At her side is her adult daughter, Caroline. Daisy asks Caroline to read to her aloud the diary of Daisy's lifelong friend, Benjamin Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire extraordinary life, the primary unusual aspect of which was his aging backwards, being diagnosed with several aging diseases at birth and thus given little chance of survival, but who does survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's grandmother was a resident at that home, which is where she first met Benjamin. Although separated through the years, Daisy and Benjamin remain in contact throughout their lives, reconnecting in their forties when in age they finally match up. Some of the revelations. Roger Ebert wrote "According to the oddsmakers at MovieCityNews, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is third among the top five favorites for best picture. It may very well win. It expends Oscar-worthy talents on an off-putting gimmick. I can't imagine many people wanting to see the movie twice. There was another film this year that isn't in the "top five," or listed among the front-runners at all, and it's a profound consideration of the process of living and aging. That's Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York." It will be viewed and valued decades from now. You mark my words." This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow what a fantastic movie, magical, captivating and visually stunning, there are just so many things to love about it. Including some very quote worthy dialogue and special effects that I've yet to figure out how they did what they did to Brad Pitt -aging him but giving him a child's body and then making him look young again (like Thelma and Louise young). *sigh* The epic-ness of this story as a whole is fantastic, covering Benjamin Buttons entire life and all those that pass through it, there are a lot and his travels take him far but I think for the most part this is a love story. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy, in and out of Benjamin's life, for about 60 years. They again do an incredible job with her makeup and I was totally impressed with the scenes of her dancing which she (may or may not actually be doing) Damn tricky that CGI.The movie is long but never feels it, as there is a big story here to tell. I honestly just think this is a perfect movie. 11.13</fullReview>

When I saw the trailer, I was really convinced it would be the Oscar movie which would have the place in Top 100 at worst. Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett are one of my favorite actors, especially in Drama movies. And together in film with so interesting story? What can be better! At the beginning I was pretty sure my expectation was right. Especially the scene with young 90 years old Benjamin and his new mother in the church. She was asking god for the forgiveness and suddenly he stood from the wheelchair and his real life just started. And the meeting with Daisy, the little beautiful girl, was start of the perfect trite romance. But an hour, I firstly look at my watches. And I started to be a bit bored. It was amazing to see how is the ravages of time cruel. Benjamin was younger and younger but Daisy was just losing her life. Retired ballet dancer, who is together with the boy who would be a baby in twenty years. The story was still interesting but it was too long. The first years of his were for me much more interesting and it took only 30 minutes but next hour and half nothing touched my heart. I probably don't remember properly any scene from this main part.And the end? Finally I was so interested like at the beginning.</fullReview>

Pitt is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Pitt is a unique presence in North American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces in the future. The film's screenplay is tight and well-written, and worthy of praise. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's a great work, everything I had hoped for in fact. 7/10.</fullReview>

He took him and left him at the step door of Dorothy Baker who worked to service elders at a house for old people. The baby was named Benjamin, and he grew backwards. He met Daisy and loved her from the first sight. As she grew old and he grew younger their love sparked and they spent a beautiful life together.

This isn't as fun as Gump, but we get a real love story instead, spread over lifetimes going in different directions. Cate Blanchet is amazing as both the story teller on her deathbed and Village dancer in a time where decadence and desire were accepted. Brad Pitt, as Benjamin, is solid throughout, and his reactions are accepting rather than judgmental. That in itself, was special, but not always believable. Director David Fincher delivers an experience, albeit through a ton of CGI, that is not to b missed. Surely, some will balk at the concept, pace, or star power, but that would simply be their loss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie since David Fincher was my favorite director. His films were likely to have large surprisings at the end of films, such as Se7en and Fight Club, and that is just what I liked. This "Benjamin Button" has nothing as such, but is well-made enough to satisfy the audiences."Benjamin Button" has some common factors with the film "Forrest Gump". For example, both films serve us a lot of beneficial suggestions through a very unique man and his unique life. Both are highly excellent films in the cinema history, I suppose.I love this film's implications, that life has many meetings and many partings, that somebody familiar may disappear suddenly and may never appear in my life again, and that life is always wonderful even though unhappy. All messages might be ordinary and stereotype to you, but they get to be valuable and colorful again, due to coming through a special man's life and eyes, named Benjamin Button.Nonetheless, there is a disappointing factor to me, which is the fact that the film would have been more fabulous, if some items had worked in more effective manners. For example, the items such as hummingbird and the great clock turning counterclockwise do not appeared in the story so much, though they could be very good metaphors related with human life, moments, and Benjamin's curious way back to birth.Well, as a whole, I love this film so much, because I can feel the creators' politeness to this film. Benjamin and Daisy really fall in love each other, only for several years when their lives and ages are crossing. The period seemed too short for the fateful 2, which was highly moving me.In a word, this film is awesome fairy tale for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything I expect to see on a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has become one of my top 5 films. I just bought the special edition DVD and watched this for the fourth time to have the exact same feeling i had when i first saw it. I simply find, that even putting aside its plot (which is by itself very magical) this movie is amazing at every aspect you could try to find: Our two main characters (Brad and Cate) truly show what their greatness in acting is. As I saw on another review, the films tenderness and feeling is brought by its actors, whereas Fincher, who is not so a romantic director, does his best at making the film as complete as possible in every technical and artistic aspect. I looked at all the special features on my DVD and realized how much the compromise of the cast and the crew with making a perfectionist piece of work was. I think that's what i had felt with Benjamin even before watching the special features. This film has become a topic of discussion at home ever since we watched it. Its look at life and it's splendid focus on special effects and artistic representation makes this movie 500% worth watching!15 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating but not the most compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On her death bed, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) recounts the story of blind clockmaker Mr Gateau to her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond). In 1918, Mr Gateau made the train station clock that runs backwards to commemorate his son as well as countless other lost in the great war. Daisy asks Caroline to read the diary of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). He was born on the night when WWI ended. His mother died in childbirth. He was born horribly old and his father almost threw him into the waters. He is left on the doorstep of Miss Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who ran an old age home. As he ages, he appears younger and younger.Director David Fincher has created a fable. It's darn interesting, but I can't say it's a compelling watch. It's fascinating without being exciting. It has very little tension or suspense. The workmanship is excellent, but the slow pace really tests anybody's endurance. It's a marvel of technology to see Brad Pitt in BB's every incarnation. But it takes too long to get to the heart of the movie which is the romance with Daisy. Also the age difference in their appearance make the romance kind of awkward. I think it would be better for them to meet at a later date, and start the movie then. The movie is basically one big flashback. I think the movie should flashback to his childhood only as needed. Take away the reverse aging, this is a movie about a long winding life. It's a little too long and too winding for my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started to watch this movie with high hopes. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, but I expected this movie to have a story that was reasonably well-scripted with character development and complex plot elements. Call me dense, but I found none of those in this film.To begin with, the trope of a dying woman from the Old South (former Confederate States to those of you from outside the US) telling a story of her life was done better with True Grit and The Oldest Confederate Widow Tells All.The adaptation of Fitzgerald's work is a travesty. The early part moves slowly, and shuffles along, pardon what might some might find as a slur on the Southern stereotypes offered for popular consumption. After about an hour and a half, I decided it was not worth it.I tried to watch the rest of the movie the following night, but lost whatever plot there might have been. Adapting a short story into a movie nearly three hours long does not make sense.I am looking forward to a decent adaptation of Times Arrow by Martin Amis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt has performed many great roles, but to me this isn't one of them. The single idea of a man going backwards in time is rich in possibilities but this story does a poor job of exploiting them.Instead it offers a very weak version of Forrest Gump with nothing remarkable happening.For me it was a tortuous experience sitting through this long film with not enough happening to keep me interested to the end. My favourite Brad Pitt film is Twelve Monkeys which is also about time travel but at the other end of the spectrum; Twelve Monkeys having an extremely rich plot.The most famous character to live backwards in time is Merlin but that aspect hasn't been explored in recent Arthurian renditions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With 13 Oscar nominations and three wins, and almost as many BAFTA nominations and wins, there is no doubt that this is one of the best films I've seen.First off the makeup and visual effects and sets and cinematography and sound were all superb as one would expect of a film of this caliber. The acting? Well, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, and Tilda Swinton were all absolutely amazing. Yes, there was a huge cast of supporting characters, both playing the above at different ages, and there were others interacting. They all made this a most enjoyable experience. It was Eric Roth's screenplay and David Fincher's direction that pulled it all together into one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen. The lines in the film were some of the most thought provoking imaginable. What a beautiful love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch movie before you die.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is that rare thing: a truly magical movie. And as such, it's difficult to find the right way to convey its spell in words.If I tell you that it's a movie about life, death and the passage of time, you'll probably raise an eyebrow; if I say that it's nearly three hours long, you'll probably make some wisecrack involving the phrase "passage of time."Brad Pitt, assisted by some remarkably subtle CGI effects, plays Benjamin from start to finish; it's an essentially passive role, as he's a watchful man who learns about life from those around him. Young (or old) Benjamin grows up (or down, so to speak ? you see why language fails me a bit with this movie) in a New Orleans boardinghouse for the elderly, on whose steps his natural father abandoned him at birth. He's raised by a fiercely loving African-American foster mother, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson, in a performance of great sweetness) and fits into the quiet world of the house, where, we're told, "death was a common visitor."Daisy, who he first meets when she's a little girl visiting her grandmother at the boardinghouse, is his great love, the woman with whom he can briefly meet in the middle, when her age and his age converge. Played as an adult by Cate Blanchett, she's a dancer and a romantic who believes in star-crossed love and dancing in the moonlight. But time is their enemy, and Blanchett's face as Daisy beholds Benjamin after a long absence, is devastating. He is golden and young; she is no longer. In a framing device, an elderly Daisy narrates the story from a New Orleans hospital as she herself waits to die.Shot in sepia tones and faintly dusty light, "Benjamin Button" beautifully captures a mood of nostalgic wonder, a near-century passing by as the city, like Benjamin, grows and changes. Its fairy-tale issues are melancholy, but the film itself is uplifting and often enthralling as the actors gaze into each other's eyes and try to will time to stop, to capture a perfect moment. In its haunting central image (from Roth, not Fitzgerald), which you'll carry with you long after the movie is gone, time itself reverses: A clock at the railway station is built to run backward "so the boys who died in the war could come home again."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting and visually superb, but with flawed storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher isn't someone who directs stereotypical films. Thus, this biography of a man, told to his former love interest on her deathbed, is more than just that, the twist being that the man ages backwards: he's born an old man and dies an infant, perplexing everyone around him. This story, the fact that the source novel was written by no one less than F. Scott Fitzgerald, and a budget of $150 million endow a director with gigantic possibilities and, thankfully, Fincher utilises most of them in the making of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.The visual feats he and his crew have achieved were deservedly awarded with three Academy Awards and I have to say that I cannot remember a film showing the process of aging more realistically than The Curious Case of Benjamin Button does. On top of that, Fincher and his cinematographer Claudio Miranda create a picturesque recreation of past times and distant places. However, the most important part about filmmaking remains the story and the telling of it, and in this aspect, I wasn't always content with what I got to see. Telling a lifetime- spanning story within the limits of one motion picture is a precarious endeavour and rarely ever do directors succeed with it ? Fincher's attempt at it is no exception. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button suffers from an odd narration, switching from an interesting character having the time of his life to a woman on her deathbed, an overly long running time, inevitably making the film boring, and many a poor taste in deciding which scenes to keep and which to cut out.Be that as it may, the film still offers an exciting look at life and is easily Fincher's most beautiful production. The characters are rich and the actors are a joy to watch while playing them, no matter if it's in romantic, sad, humorous, or adventurous scenes, all of which The Curious Case of Benjamin Button includes. It's a great story, and proof that David Fincher can do more than just the violent thrillers he's become famous for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an elderly woman lies on her deathbed she recounts the peculiar story of Benjamin Button, a man whose life is inexplicably tied to a mysterious backwards-running clock. After Benjamin's mother dies in childbirth, the father abandons baby Benjamin because of his stark physical defects. Luckily Queenie, a black woman who manages a senior's care home, finds newborn Benjamin and raises him herself. For the rest of his life Benjamin calls Queenie mother.When Benjamin is born, he emerges prematurely aged. Medical tests show that he has the physical characteristics of a person in his eighties. Originally penned by F. Scott Fitzgerald, makes Benjamin Button tells a peculiar life story that forays in the world of the fantastic: the crux of the story is that, just as the clock ticks backwards, Benjamin too ages in reverse. He gets younger and younger over time.The task of dealing with this massive disconnect between his physically aged exterior, and his inner infantile self, forces Benjamin to attempt to act like an adult (to match his aged exterior), but no matter how hard he tries his true inner child shines through, especially whenever it comes to booze and women, areas where he has zero experience. Benjamin wins the adoration of most every character he meets, and along the way he breaks through the prejudicial barriers that age and race typically erect.This film is a diversion for Fincher. Many of the defining qualities of David Fincher's films are not so very present in Benjamin Button. This charmed, almost magical tale shares none of the characteristic of other Fincher scripts. It is not filtered through the darkened lens of hyper awareness; there is none of the desolation and bleak deconstruction of modern culture that fills Zodiac, the most recently released Fincher film before this one.Benjamin Button seems to be the only film in Fincher's body of work that is not a dark, psychological thriller. Here, Fincher proves that he can work in drama just as well as he can work in action and suspense, however he does have expert help.The director of photography Claudio Miranda, who had worked on a number of Fincher's earlier pictures, sets the tones and temperature of the images so they project like a thriller, dark with shadows, slight, almost sepia toned. A highly refined picture quality.Once again, this film features Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter, the brilliant editing team that would go on to win multiple Oscars for best editing in The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They brilliantly let visuals alone tell as much of the story as possible. As with Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Benjamin Button has tons of shots and locations. The exact opposite of Panic Room.Eric Roth &amp; David Fincher The technique of recounting the story through recollection as a series of flashbacks, as well as Benjamin's unexpected success despite his handicap, make Benjamin Button bear an off-putting resemblance to the structure of Forest Gump (1994). This is no coincidence.The same writer who won an Oscar for his Forest Gump screenplay, Eric Roth, is also the writer of Benjamin Button.As characters both Forest and Benjamin worked on boats, both took part in World Wars, and both perpetually pursue women from their childhood. What is great thought is that Fincher is able to divert this potential redundancy. While Forest bumbles along, simply falling into phenomenal situations, Benjamin paves his own way. It's existential drive versus dumb luck.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good drama... watch it if you can.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTONThis movie is a movie that has always interested me, but I never got round to watching it until recently.The movie is about the life of Benjamin. When Benjamin was born his mother died during child birth. When his father saw the baby for the first time he was disgusted by the way he looked and left him on the steps of a house. The reason he looked so different was because Benjamin has a condition which makes him age backwards. He was born an old looking child and the older he got the younger he looked.I like the idea of this... when I first heard about it it did make me ask a lot of questions. The good thing is, they all got answered.The story was sad in places, but so happy in others. It is a drama that keeps you hooked to the TV. The movie is steady throughout. I can't remember one bit where I was bored or lost interest. The movie is quite long, it is on for 2 and a half hours, but it didn't feel that long.You really get to know the characters. Another thing I liked about this film was the fact that Benjamin was a likable guy most of the time, but from time to time he was horrible. He did things that was not too nice and even made me hate him at one point, but then he seemed very gullible at times.The acting was top class from everyone. Brad Pitt was fantastic playing Benjamin. He was even good at playing an old and young man. Cate Blanchett did a fantastic job too. I really felt sorry for her most throughout. Her character went though a lot and didn't deserve what she went though.Finally I have seen a movie where the make up is amazing. Brad Pitt actually looked old without the make up looking plastic. I have never seen make up this well done... in fact I am not sure it was make up or just computer effects that made him look old. It was just too good.This is a great film that I will watch again in the future. I am not surprised that it won numerous awards. They are all well deserved.I will give this film 7 out of 10."It's a funny thing about comin' home. Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. You'll realize what's changed is you."For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a Fantasy World. Benjamin Button is born old and hardly raises an eyebrow in this Parallel Universe. It is played straight and forward as the curious Benjamin ages backward. This long Movie is Fantastic in its use of unobtrusive CGI, a sort of opposite the regular overblown and overused way the Digital domain is usually employed.Here it seems seamless. It is a touching and heartfelt Story all the way through its almost 3 Hour Running Time. The only time it is too Melodramatic is the many Scenes of the Death Bed Daisy with Her almost indecipherable Dialog and wheezing. In fact the whole method of using the Diary reading as Flashbacks might have been a mistake.But there is much to adore in this Film and it is poignant yet not very profound. Benjamin is the nicest Guy possible and is impossible not to Love. His Life Story is not unlike most Life Stories, only that it is in reverse Time. It is a clever and catching arc, but never really is anything more than a costume for the Film to wear.The Movie is more than tricky effects. It is slice of life put on display with a neat, nuanced niche that is a track that asks to live Life no matter what Life dishes out. It makes its case with some heavy decision making, but is never heavy handed. It is emotional and evocative in the way its Characters are all likable and that is pure Fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have too much to say about this film, except that it was one of the most beautiful, touching, poignant, and bittersweet films I have ever seen.Benjamin Button lives his life in reverse. Despite this, it's a great life, full of adventure and love and learning. He finds out that no matter what, it's the people who make life so special.The film is beautifully photographed and true to the periods it represents.Brad Pitt is fantastic, and those CGI and makeup techniques for him and the rest of the cast are marvelous. It's a tribute to the film that it's very organic to the cast so we are not aware of makeup and CGI. Cate Blanchett is incredible; she is a dying, old woman in the beginning and gives a tremendous performance.We're born helpless and without life memories, and some of us die that way. In a way, I guess, it doesn't matter if you're born old or die old - it's like Benjamin tells Cate Blanchett in the film, you'd still end up where you are now. The life experience, the people you meet, the wisdom you acquire, all happens -- and it happened to Benjamin at a time when he could really value it. But as he points out: "For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This could have been a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lyrical and poetic attempt at an epic chronicle of a man aging backwards by David Fincher (Se7en (1995), Fight Club (1999)), who is obviously less at home in the fantasy genre than he is doing thrillers. Nevertheless, the film looks fabulous and stars an array of wonderful actors, chief among them Brad Pitt as the protagonist Benjamin Button who is suffering from this strangest of afflictions and the stunning Cate Blanchett as Daisy, the woman he keeps on loving all his life despite the obstacles time throws at their passion that keep them from forming a natural relationship. Born as a wrinkled and frail baby suffering from all the symptoms of old age, Benjamin is discarded by his disgusted father and left at a home for the elderly where he is raised by caretaker Queenie (Taraji P. Henson, who was Oscar nominated for her contribution). Growing up amongst the old folks, Benjamin isn't suspected to last long but surprises everybody by getting younger and younger, eventually leaving home to explore the world, which results in a voyage through the 20th century similar to Forrest Gump (except not going for comedy, undoubtedly for the best), having the naive and ever positive Benjamin participate in WW II and witness the space race of the Sixties among other situations. Traveling the globe, he never loses contact with the love of his life and finally settles with Daisy when both reach middle age (the only moment of temporal equality for them both), after which they produce a child, only for Benjamin to realize his grotesque condition means he could never be a true father figure for his new born daughter. A sense of lust for life and adventure goes hand in hand with an unshakable feeling of tragedy and melancholy when The Curious Case of Benjamin Button steers towards a dramatic ending that doesn't entirely successfully balance a bittersweet note with blatant sentimentality. The film is also an homage to the city of New Orleans which witnesses the beginning and end of Benjamin and his caring for Daisy: however, Fincher's decision to have the story be told by an aging Daisy on her death bed in a New Orleans hospital threatened by hurricane Katrina keeps on hindering the plot at various turns and adds an uneasy link with recent history the movie had better done without, also to keep the running time in check instead of letting it run rampant to 166 minutes, with many of the last act's moments losing pace and dragging on needlessly, thus making a potential masterpiece end up as just a curious case itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing and original idea but somewhat overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one film I wanted to see at the cinema when it came out but didn't get around to although my former friend's niece saw it and probably enjoyed it. I eventually added it to my LoveFilm rental list and got sent it for free last year in the run-up to Christmas because LoveFilm were generous to send me a free rental during that time.Moving on to the film itself, I found the story unusual and engaging for the most part but it was somewhat overlong and it had an element from one of my least favourite film genres (war movies) but I liked the film tying in with major events such as Armistice Day and Hurricane Katrina, both of which coincided with Benjamin's birth and Daisy's death respectively. It was interesting to have the story span across several decades and I liked the fact that the titular character was born on 11th November 1918 (the day World War I ended) since it is also my Nan's birthday, although she was born in 1937. I found parts of the story a tad hard to follow so I ended up reading the synopsis on Wikipedia to help me. The historic costumes were true to their eras up to Benjamin's 'old-on-the-insude-youthful- on-the-outside' stage sometime in the 1990s, which I found surprising, and I liked the cast since Brad Pitt is one of my favourite actors - the only other films of his I've seen are 'Ocean's Eleven (which was forgettable and harder to follow than this one despite its well- known cast)' and 'Happy Feet Two (a decent follow-up to the first).' It also made sense that Benjamin and Daisy were portrayed by different actors to show their varying ages throughout the film such as Pitt and Cate Blanchett playing them in middle age and Elle Fanning (Dakota Fanning's younger sister, both of whom voiced the sisters in 'My Neighbour Totoro') playing Daisy aged about seven, but the actors playing the 'old-on-the- inside-youthful-on-the-outside' Benjamin are lesser known. There are some heart-wrenching moments such as Queenie the nursing home worker having died during Benjamin and Daisy's reunion sailing trip, her funeral and Benjamin dying on screen towards the end, which was implied by his eyes closing in a similar fashion to Marley closing his eyes whilst being put down towards the end of 'Marley and Me.' I nearly bawled my eyes out when Benjamin died because it reminded me of the rarity of babies dying.All in all this film had an intriguing and more original idea than the likes of 'Big' and both versions of 'Freaky Friday' (the 1976 and 2003 versions) albeit its length, but I suppose it had to be over two and a half hours long to depict the various time periods. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is easily one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It is one of those kinds of movies that regardless of how many times you see it, you can still be amazed at the symbolism, messages, and just small nuances with in the movie. The story revolves around the titular character Benjamin Button who was abandoned as an infant and is later raised by Queenie. Button is born as an old man and ages in reverse to die as a young man. He is a mystery to all he comes across because few can understand what his condition is and shy away from his looks. He also gets into a relationship with Daisy throughout his life. Though a confusing tale overall, it depicts Button's life and his interactions with those around him very well. It is a movie that makes you feel something, provokes thoughts, though you might not be entirely sure what the moral is. This movie made me think about growing up and savoring the people I meet for who they are, what they do for others, and appreciate everything they can show me and what impressions they leave in my life. Perhaps it is something I think too deeply about, but I promise that it is a film that will make you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie about a man who ages backwards.The story begins with Julia Ormond.She is sitting by her mother's deathbed in a New Orleans' hospital as Hurricane Katrina approaches. Her mother, Daisy, is played beautifully by the extremely talented Cate Blanchett. Daisy asks Caroline to read her a journal which use to belong to an ex-lover of hers, named Benjamin Button. But Benjamin was no ordinary man, he was born as he was approximately eighty years old, and instead of growing older he began to grow younger. Needless to say, the movie was not HORRIBLE, it was a great story, but an uninteresting movie. But it will most likely become a classic. These types of movies usually do. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why it's just 7.7 on IMDb, I think it's as good as The Forrest Gump. It contains love, battle, life, death,and the most important point, the relationship of a family, which is really important for each Chinese. So, in China ,this movie has got a very good score, almost at least 8.5 in each movie club like IMDb. Maybe this is the difference of culture as we know, Americans don't like this type of movie, right? As I know, most of Americans prefer some movies about psycho, yes, just like my "User Name" on IMDb, for example, Psycho by Hitchcock, Fight club by David Fincher or whatever. yes, I also agree those movies are very nice, by the way, I am a big fan of Fincher.Although I really have no idea why Americans don't like this movie, it's always in the top 10 in my heart..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is attracted attention with scenario. When I watched, I don't know why, this movie made me remember this poem that Can Yücel- Hayat&#x131; Tersten Ya&#x15f;amak. You should read it.What &#x130;mpressed me was that a woman grew up her darling. I don't think my darling as a baby in my arms. It must be interesting kissing him like your child. Thanks to this film, we saw Brad Pitt in old age. He is still handsome with his wrinkles, even though it is make-up. The best comic character in this film is an uncle who says that he strikes lightning 7 times regularly. It is my opinion, of course. That the length of a movie is longer than average may be boring. Sometimes I was bored while watching. Watch and see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dorian Gray With A Life-Curious Case ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" was more like Dorian Gray having a positive life.With his life in reverse, Brad Pitt, who played Benjamin, did an excellent job of conveying the problems of being born elderly but progressing through the years as a younger man. In the end, he has had a fulfilled life, but has to suffer the indignities of dementia as a young lad.The make-up artist for Mr. Pitt certainly deserved some sort of accolade, especially in his work with Pitt as an older man.A dying woman conveys the story to her daughter via a diary, and the young girl learns that Pitt was her father.There are other excellent performances by Cate Blanchett, as the woman who loved him dearly, and Taranji Henson, as the black woman who took him in and raised him in his "elderly" years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a great movie with a fantastic storyline,script,cast and characters.I found it to be a little disappointing because the movie won 3 Oscars and is written by Eric Roth,the same man who wrote Forrest Gump,and I thought it would be similar to that,which it was,but not as good in my opinion.Forrest Gump was more up to date with plenty of cultural references and comedy,however Benjamin Button is a lot more old fashioned and serious.It is still very enjoyable,with a length you wont feel and an outstanding performance from Brad Pitt.Benjamin Button looks back on his life as he starts off as an old man and gets younger as his life goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt did an excellent job of playing a very young old man struggling because he just didn't fit in. The whole thing was beautifully shot, and the underlying quirk of the main character was rather interesting. But overall I wasn't drawn that far into the romance, mainly as I was unconvinced by their meeting and the assumption that their love was unequivocal. Even if I were to believe that it all started when Cate Blanchett was a young girl and he was an old man, I just wasn't sold. It also seemed that she was more mature as a child, because as an adult she became more of a selfish and immature upstart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever but not that impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Benjamin Button" has a storyline that is very original, I'll grant you that. Primarily based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film chronicles the life of Benjamin Button, played by Brad Pitt, who's mother dies during child birth, and who's father abandons him on the doorsteps of an old-folks home when he is born with the appearance of an elderly man. The home, run by a black maid named Queenie, takes him in as a son, and people begin to see that he is in fact aging backwards, from old to young. Its a premise that, in the right hands, could have been expanded brilliantly to reveal poetic ideas life and death, but, starting with the screenplay, a series of mistakes cause the film to sink.People need to accept that Benjamin Button and Forrest Gump, both written by the talented Eric Roth, are fundamentally the same movie. There must be at lease 30 similarities. Both men are southern gentlemen, both have a miracle moment walking for the first time, both spend time on a boat, both spend time fighting a war. Additionally, both films involve a female love interest who ventures out of her home for several years to pursue a dream, while on a rocky road to find herself. These 2 movies are identical, and the film's biggest defenders will have a hard time arguing against that fact.But I'll ignore those similarities for minute, because I should assess this movie as its own work. And when looked at that way, I'll say the first word that comes to mind is preachy. Every 7 minutes, Benjamin, narrating the film, gives us a brand new metaphor about life and how its just so "un-predictable". There's also some completely pathetic visual poetry with a hummingbird, whose significance in the film's message I'm still unsure of.But you wanna know what's funny? For all its preaching about unpredictable events, Benjamin button lives a pretty normal life. He works on a boat, he serves in the navy in WWII, he co-owns a dance studio with his romantic interest Daisy, played by Cate Blanchett, and then he operates a toll booth. That sounds pretty average to me, and I found personally that Benjamin Button is, himself, more of a bizarre science-fiction character than a human being we could all relate to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good Fincher and Pitt partnership.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Brad Pitt takes on a supernatural role for the third time, I feel his grim reaper in "Meet Joe Black" still stands out, even surpassing his undead character in "Interview with a Vampire". That said, his Benjamin Button is not only off the wall, but in a subtle way proves a timeless message ? No matter who you are or whatever you become, there is always a beginning and an end.The story is narrated by a dying elderly lady, through the title character's journal. It begins one night in post World War I New Orleans when a hideous baby is born, extinguishing his mother's life as he begins his own. Aghast by this abomination, the father immediately abandons the infant hoping it would never see the light of day. But a kind hearted black woman finds and shelters the baby. Benjamin, as she names him, is a freak of nature as he is born old and frail with no apparent chance of survival. However, that doesn't stop her from raising him as her own. Then a strange thing happens, while learning to walk and talk, Benjamin starts to "grow" younger. As the years go by, he gradually becomes younger, while everyone around him are aging and dying. Along comes Daisy, an adolescent redhead who strikes an immediate bond with a very senior Benjamin. But their new found friendship is short as she pursues a career in professional dancing while Benjamin starts work as a sailor. As the years fly past, their paths cross many times until a point when they are almost the same age, allowing them to grab a moment in time, giving into a relationship both secretly hoped for. From here on the film takes on a darker tone and like Benjamin, suggests we have already seen the happy ending in the beginning."Forrest Gump" is one of my all time favorite movies but I couldn't help notice some uncanny similarities between these two films; starting with the Southern setting and the very Southern accents from several characters in both films. There are also mutual references to the violent hurricanes that frequent these US regions. Both Forrest and Benjamin are ridiculed and loathed from a young age, but go on to become legends of sorts. Sub-plots from both films blend with actual American history along with a short yet intense war scene. Finally, both films have an unrequited love theme that is reciprocated too late. Comparisons aside and without a doubt, the only thing more curious than Benjamin's inverted world is this intriguing story from the legendry Scott Fitzgerald. But adapting Fitzgerald's short story into a screenplay is the ingenuity of Eric Roth, the screenwriter behind "Forrest Gump". Even as an adaptation, the concept here is beyond original thanks to director David Fincher and his nuance as a master storyteller. It is always entertaining to have twists and turns in a good story, but an abstract story that also becomes believable as it is beautiful? From its phenomenal beginning to its profound ending, this story is about the frailty of humans and passage of time through our greatest emotions ? love, yearning and loss; but not necessarily in that order.If it weren't for the overrated "Slum Dog Millionaire", this film would have easily grabbed the "Best Picture" Oscar at the 81st Academy awards. Picturing how Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett would look when they get old is one of the reasons why this film did win an Oscar for "Best Makeup", amongst two other Academy Awards. Sharing intermittent screen time together, Pitt and Blanchett are perfectly cast with magnetic screen chemistry. Despite the makeup and cinema magic, this is Brad Pitt with his best foot forward and easily one of the best films of his career. Having worked with Pitt before, this epic film from Fincher will take up more than two hours of your time, but films like this are a rare achievement in contemporary cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sprawling epic, based on a short poem, truly takes the concept of adaptation to a whole new level. Featuring a couple of amazing lead performances, and a heart-breaking love story on the level on the Notebook, Button is one of the best films in Fincher's canon.Those who hate this movie often claim it is slow, boring, unrealistic, etc. This is a semi-fantasy dramatic movie about the course of life, of course it is slow and unrealistic in ways, but it is still utterly relate-able, which is stunning considering the impossibility of the main character. This is not a film you will be re-watching again and again, it is emotionally draining, much as life is for Benjamin Button. The themes this film brings up are universal and looked at in incredible ways, whether it is love, war, parenting, racism, aging, respect, changing times, or really any other part of the human experience, it can be found here. This is a gem of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Fantasy Drama Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantasy-drama film directed by David Fincher. The screenplay by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord is loosely based on the 1922 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film stars Brad Pitt as a man who ages in reverse and Cate Blanchett as the love interest throughout his life.What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness.Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond co-stars.In 2005, Daisy, an elderly woman, is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. Daisy asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.In 1918, Mr. Gateau, a blind New Orleans clockmaker, loses his son on the battlefields of France in World War I. As a way to deal with the grief, Gateau builds a large clock for the New Orleans train station, but fixes it so that the time goes in reverse. When asked why, Gateau states that maybe time will reverse and the men lost in the war? including his son?might come home again.On the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of a very elderly man. The baby's mother dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. "Tizzy" Weathers, who work at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.In 1930, 12-year-old Benjamin, having exchanged a wheelchair for crutches, befriends six-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. As Benjamin's body grows younger, he accepts work on a tugboat. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans with the tugboat crew for a long-term work engagement. He eventually finds himself in Murmansk, where he starts an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister.In 1941, while the tugboat crew is still in Russia, Japan attacks the U.S. at Pearl Harbor thrusting America into World War II. Mike, the captain, volunteers the boat to be a ship in the U.S. Navy and the crew is assigned to scrap collection duty. During a patrol, the tugboat stumbles upon a sunken U.S. transport and the bodies of hundreds of American troops. While surveying the carnage, a German submarine surfaces. Knowing his duty Mike steers the tugboat full speed towards the sub while a German gunner fires on the tugboat killing most of the crew including Mike. The tugboat rams the submarine causing it to explode sinking both vessels. The next day Benjamin and one other crew member are picked up by ships of the U.S. Navy.In 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, and learns that 21-year-old Daisy has become a successful ballet dancer. Benjamin again crosses paths with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals that he is Benjamin's father. Thomas wills Benjamin his possessions before he dies. Daisy's dance career is ended in Paris in 1957, when she is hit by a taxi cab and breaks her leg. When Benjamin goes to see her, Daisy is amazed at his youthful appearance, but frustrated at her own injuries; she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and move in together.Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline in 1968. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father figure to his daughter due to his reverse aging, sells his belongings and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He travels the world alone during the 1970s.Benjamin, appearing to be in his early twenties, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now re-married, Daisy introduces Benjamin to her husband and daughter as a family friend. Daisy then visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they share their passion for each other. Daisy admits that Benjamin was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. Benjamin departs again.In 1991, widowed Daisy receives a phone call from social workers. They have found Benjamin ? now apparently about 12 years old ? living in a condemned building, and have contacted her because they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers say that his condition resembles dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home where Benjamin grew up and takes care of him as he becomes increasingly younger until, physically, he becomes an infant once more. In 2003, he dies in Daisy's arms remembering who she was. Benjamin's story now told, Daisy dies in her New Orleans hospital bed, as Hurricane Katrina approaches.It was a critically acclaimed film that went on to receive thirteen Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Pitt, and Best Supporting Actress for Taraji P. Henson. It won three Oscars, for Art Direction, Makeup, and Visual Effects.It was an epic fantasy tale with rich storytelling backed by fantastic performances led by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.David Fincher's epic doesn't wallow in nihilistic obsessions, but preached no comforting homily about life's rich pageant either. Life is feel-good in spurts - a series of oddly interconnected, occasionally elating moments that accumulate before death.The only thing about it is it was a bit long at almost 3 hours.Nevertheless,it does not fail to entertain and satisfy any viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A parable. A tale. Sketch of an existence. Memento mori. Story about ordinary things. Picture of nothing. A spell is soul of this movie. Like liquid honey, each moment, each detail is form of hours and end of time. A film as hot coffee. After taste - grounds. For the magicians and for lost parts of himself. It is beautiful in many ways. For the metamorphose of Scott Fitzgerald lines, for atmosphere, for similarity with melancholic songs, for touching colors and remember of life values. It is not a moralistic lesson. Not a charming theory. It is not stage for great acting. It is only form for self-definition. With many crumbs of different movies and books, with slices of magic and love story, with thesis about what is it important, with sadness and drops of hope and death as final part of old symphony. But, in same time, it is a declaration of sense. And shadow of every life. As part of other existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to hear about this movie and the concept of someone aging backwards in time was great and so i saw this movie. This movie has a slow pace to mention about and it works in the way that, it gives us the feeling as if we are living with Benjamin Button. People who like him like this movie, people who doesn't like him doesn't like the movie, its so simple isn't it? But the movie has something else other than a person and his life, this movie is about life itself and the self proclaimed beauty of living to the fullest. One of the best quotes of the film is when Benjamin in his letter to his daughter writes "Hope you live a life you're proud of and if you find that you're not, i hope you have the strength to start all over again". The music in the film is magical, It gives you an out of the world experience. The movie's cinematography is at its best and its so welcoming to see a movie that runs around 2 hours and 45 minutes, a welcome change perhaps from the usual time line of movies. This film a biopic lets has a soul inside and at the end of the film it gives you the feeling of living a life and how good it is to be an ordinary person. In many ways i envy Benjamin, he did what all he wanted to, i believe he lived a life he's proud of and this character a memorable one played by Brad Pitt is flawless in the way he has flaws and makes us believe Benjamin could be anyone among us. Brad Pitt excels to the fullest and all the credit goes to David Fincher's work, i would say this was a work of art something which you don't find often. It's one of the best films i have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin button. Deliberately made-out classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CCBB was a short story written by Scott Fitzgerald in 1922. Its about a boy who born with a rare disease called 'Progeria'. Progeria is a reverse aging disease. Simply said the boy was born as an old man and dies as an infant. This is what the short story spun about. The film is based on this short story mainly on its name and the reverse aging disease.The story and happenings of a boy, Benjamin, born with such a disease has lots of curious things to handle in a single life. The original story dealt mostly that point. But this film's script completely deviates from this point and spins around an old-age home, sea voyage, pearl harbour (pathetic deliberate sequence), affairs of Benjamin, ballad dancing and a 95 years Titanic 'Rose' kind of memorabilia. The audience never had a chance to feel what Benjamin feels on various occasions on situations that arise with his aging problem.The script is deliberately poetic but did not make the impact. In Few places it looks good though; the relationship between Benjamin and his original father, some dialogs 'nothing ever lasts.. it's a shame'...and some parts of the final sequence etc. Brad Pitt and other actors did their part well though. Benjamin's 'mama' started to be an interesting character and left out in the middle and then flattens. Photography, Sets and musical score are all good but stand out as flannel-mouth pieces. So don't go with high expectations when you watch this film about reverse aging because this film does not show anything about the problems or the process of reverse aging. But otherwise you would get a decent, flat, normal love story which is more than enough for most of us. So you may not get disappointed. My rating 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star in a movie about a man named Benjamin Button with a condition to age backwards, while being born as an old man. There's one strange thing about this movie, since this movie is way too similar to the movie, "Forrest Gump". Here are some reasons why these two movies are similar. They are both written by Eric Roth, both have 13 Oscar nominations, both is about a man with a condition, both have romantic struggles, both have supporting mothers, both involve the war, both have wonderful life stories, and they both contain a big heart. But besides that, the movie was an excellent movie due to the works of director David Fincher, screenwriter Eric Roth, and the brilliant cast of Pitt, Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, and Tilda Swinton. Also, the exhilarating use of makeup and visual effects stole the show, with the addition of incredible cinematography, art direction, and film editing. This movie is a unique portrait of our every day life, but the other way around (since the movie involves a man aging backwards). The story, similar to "Forrest Gump", felt like it was told through someone's point of view. This movie contains incredible life lessons about being true to ourselves, no matter what age. This is a beautiful movie, and it's work of art in itself. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", in my review, "a beautiful 'point-of-view' portrait story".</fullReview>

His mother died in childbirth, and afterwords his father dropped him off on the doorstop of a seniors home were a caregiver named Queenie (Taraji P.Henson) takes him in and raises him as her own. In the seniors home is were Benjamin meets his lifelong love Daisy (Cate Blanchett) who comes to visit her grandmother. Throughout the movie Benjamin goes off exploring he world as he develops into a younger man, and Daisy goes on to pursue her career in Dance. They keep in touch throughout the years encountering each other until they meet up in their mid to late thirties and become intimate. Benjamin eventually leaves Daisy realizing that he did not believe that they it would work, as he grew young and she grew old. He comes home to her when she has married and n her mid forties and realizes he has to stay away from her in order for them to live their lives. And in the end they find themselves at the ends of their lives with daisy Holding Benjamin until he is gone. The theme for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is Identity. Throughout this movie Benjamin leads us to believe that age is a number. You are led to believe in this story that the age of someone controls his or her identity. He is born old in the beginning as an infant with the mindset of an older man in a baby's body but appears to enjoy the company of the elderly. Then throughout the movie as he grows younger physically you see the changes in his personality becoming more outgoing and flashy. In this story I believe that the author is trying to convince the audience that you are only as old as you feel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When someone gets Alzheimers, that person becomes quite often childlike and I am pretty sure that this film is based upon that fact and not the freak genetic disorder. However, the subject of dementia is only briefly touched at the end of the film and the story is actually more about life. They have decided to cover life from beginning to end and that's quite a lot material to cover, so be sure to make time for this one. Luckily for me the movie never grew dull for me, unlike some fastlaner's reviews I have read. When you do not take Benjamin Button's age to literally, a lot of life's truths are revealed like; for everything is a time and something good never lasts forever. This all is brought to you in a very lightweight charming story that never really becomes really dark, even though some really heavy subjects are brought to light. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**THIS MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER** The story of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is about a boy who experiences life in a much different way than what anyone is use to. At birth Benjamin was already different than the rest. His mother died during labor and his father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) promised her that Benjamin would be safe. That's when Benjamin met his new mother and father on their doorstep at a house for elderly care. His new mother Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) worked there and loved Benjamin very much. That is where this magical story begins. Through time, friendships, war, death, sorrow, children, marriage, old and young age Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) ceased every aspect of life. Benjamin was born old. As an infant he was born with cataracts, arthritis, and other things that have him resemble an eighty year old man. The older he got meant the younger he looked. By the time Benjamin was a teenager his back was much straighter, hair a little thicker, and vision a lot clearer. Throughout the film Benjamin has always loved a girl named Daisy Fuller (Cate Blanchett). Their love is a love that definitely lasts the test of time. No matter what obstacle went through their lives they have always ended up back in each other's arms one way or another. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is romance, magic, and drama all in one bite. Benjamin Button directed by David Fincher was an excellent film. The film not only had great actors, costume (Benjamin as an old infant in the beginning), dark lighting set for the tone and feel of sadness or being there, and classical music for sound that brought to life Daisy's dancing, but the story itself was well put together. The movie started out at a hospital while Hurricane Katrina is in the midst in New Orleans. Daisy is laying there for what looks to be like her last few moments of life with her daughter Caroline by her side. Daisy's last wish is for her daughter to read a diary for her and that is where the narration took place. Benjamin's voice over telling the story gave life to the film and while switching back to present at the hospital gave focus for the film. This movie is full of death and disappointment but also love and fantasy for anything is possible. As Caroline reads the diary from her soon to find out father, I was stuck in the beauty of life at all stages. Even though Benjamin and Daisy couldn't stay together always because of his condition they end up back to each other in the end even when Benjamin has aged himself backwards into an infant until he passes away in Daisy's arms. Throughout the film Fincher also used every scene to the fullest. Each scene was meant to be there for some symbolic reason. The hummingbird for example in the storm on the boat Benjamin says he has never seen a hummingbird that for out before and that they represented love. In the end of the film right before Daisy takes her last breath you witness a hummingbird outside her window in the hurricane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie about love and growing old with a twist.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button stars Benjamin Button (played by Brad Pitt) and Daisy Fuller (played by Cate Blanchett). The movie is directed by David Fincher. The movie is about the life of Benjamin Button. This is a man who was born old and lives his life aging by years but physically getting younger. It is a coming of age movie through different stages of life. Benjamin experiences drinking for the first time, physical contact with women, and being out on his own as an adult. His years are 17 but his body is of an old man. He shares a midlife experience with the love of his life and he experiences getting mentally older while his body is in the best shape ever. The film also shows that love can withstand time.Benjamin and Daisy know they care for each other even when Benjamin's body is too old physically for him to like a girl that is close to his birth age. Benjamin grows up and leaves to see life on his own. He sends postcards to Daisy from every place that he visits. Daisy also explores the world to develop her dancing. They come together in the end and Daisy takes care of Benjamin. The movie uses flash back and voice over to put the audience into the film. Another movie that uses this style is Titanic. This movie also shows love can endure and that there comes a time that choices have to be made as an adult. Both movies have women telling of a past love that has passed away. The camera angle is shown at an eye view making both characters appear as equals. This is true when Benjamin is talking with Daisy as an old man physically and when they are close in age and having a relationship in their forties. As Benjamin is mentally growing older but physically getting to the age of 7 he appears larger than life standing on the roof. He takes chances that most 7 year old would not take because of having the experience of a sixty or seventy year old. Benjamin and Daisy spent almost all of their life together or being a part of each other's life all of their years. Benjamin sees a lot of death in his life and Daisy is his life that keeps him going. His diary that Daisy has read at the end of her time takes her back to his firsts and lasts reminding her of his love even then. It also reminds her that they had to experience their own life to appreciate each other when they do get together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie relives life backwards can be more complicated than living it forward.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starring handsome Brad Pitt and beautiful Cate Blanchett was a close look at reality in what life would be like living it backwards. People tend to think about what could have or should have been and the saying "hindsight is 20/20. This movie relives life backwards can be more complicated than living it forward. I think this movie displays also no matter how old we are its how we feel inside, physical appearances may be deceiving. The makeup and camera were great in the setting and time of the movie. I felt the movie was very long but it needed to be to keep the story going and anything less would have made it less than the classic it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The storm outside reflects the storm inside as the story of Benjamin Button is told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waiting for death to take her from a hospital in New Orleans, Daisy Williams (Cate Blanchett) asks her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormand) to tell her the story of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) one last time as he had chronicled in his diary. As the story is told, a hurricane roars on outside the hospital and ultimately sets the mood for the rest of the movie. Daisy, Caroline and Benjamin's lives are ones filled with a storm of lies, betrayals, darkness and light. Changes in the mood and setting, or the storm, are marked by darkness and shadows, struggle and tragedy.The story begins with a backwards ticking clock that was made by a clockmaker for Grand Central Station in New York City. On the day of the reveal to the public, we learn the blind clockmaker purposefully made the clock to count time backwards in hopes that those who died in World War II would be able to rise again, come home, and live their lives in full. This helps to set the theme of the movie, which reminds us that what may be ideal in our minds might not always work out the way we want in to in real life.Benjamin was born the night that World War II ended. He was abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button (Jason Fleming), after his biological mother died in childbirth. His father was ashamed at the old and wrinkled Benjamin and left him on the step of a senior citizens home where Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), a black woman, who was an employee there, found him. He grew up in the home and that is where Daisy and Benjamin met when they were both young. Benjamin eventually left the senior citizen home and made a life for himself at sea working on a tugboat, joining the war and living his life. Benjamin's life, while not lonely, was still dark at times, when the people who grew up with would die and he was not able to be a real child. He was unsure how to act at times, afraid of what others thought of him or how they viewed him.Benjamin returns to New Orleans and Queenie, where he meets up again with Daisy. The attraction is still palpable and they agree to go out on a date but it quickly ends when Benjamin spurns Daisy's advances and she leaves him sitting at the lake. After this time, Benjamin learns the truth about his biological father, Daisy continues to dance ballet and lives her life but after an accident in Paris leaves her with an injury to her leg and unable to dance or walk. The age difference is not more than five years, but they are obviously at very different points in their lives, with Benjamin being more mature and ready to settle and Daisy just starting to live her life.Daisy, finally able to walk again, visits Benjamin at Queenie's house. They both realize they still love each other deeply and travel on the sailboat Thomas Button left Benjamin when he died. They return from their travels only to learn that Queenie has died. Daisy and Benjamin buy a house and move in together and open up a dance studio where Daisy teaches. As Benjamin watches her dance one day, she reveals that she is pregnant. Benjamin is concerned that the baby will be born like him but when their daughter is born, she is perfectly healthy. It is at this moment when reading the story that Caroline realizes that Benjamin is her father, not the man she assumed was her father all those years. She is quite upset and leaves the room, only to return and finish the story from the diary. This part of their lives, the calm before the storm and the happiness that exists, is shown in light and hope.Benjamin, who is worried about being able to care for his wife and child as he grows younger and younger, tells Daisy that he wants Caroline to have a real father and that he wants to leave before she can remember him. On Caroline's first birthday, Benjamin sells the factory, the sailboat, the summer cottage and his assets, leaves all money in the bank and walks out. This is when Daisy tells Caroline she met her step father and they married so she would have the best life possible. You see through Caroline's emotions that she finally understands her mother, why she did what she did, to not only protect Caroline but to give her the best life possible. The storm climaxes here and starts to weaken.Benjamin drifts through his life, traveling, working odd jobs and just wandering through the world. One day, Benjamin, who is now younger than 18, is found living in an abandoned building in New Orleans. CPS looked through his diary, finds Daisy and contacts her. He does not remember her but feels like he should know her. She moves into Queenie's old house to care for Benjamin as he grows younger in age but experiences all of the illnesses of an older person and can't remember living his life. He finally passes, as an infant, in Daisy's arms. The storm, that we now know is Hurricane Katrina, makes landfall and we see the medical staff making preparations to evacuate the hospital, Daisy passes and we hear Benjamin recounting the people he met during his lifetime. We also see the storeroom, where the backwards ticking clock is, being flooded in the storm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It pushed my buttons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was actually expecting to hate Benjamin Button (the film not the character) but actually I ended up rather liking it, but not exactly loving it completely. To me it shows uncanny resemblances to Forrest Gump and is no where near that standard in my opinion.Let me start off with the cons. I really have to express my feelings towards the old woman, supposedly Cate Blanchett, at the start and throughout. Why? What is the point of her, everything she sad just made me burst into hysterics because she was just so inaudible. I literally couldn't understand a word she said. (Apart from a few). She is meant to be a dying woman and even sounds like she can hardly speak because she's so close to death's door, yet she ends up telling a 3 hour story! The whole sub-plot made me laugh with these pointless interludes that were as pointless as the old woman in "Titanic", and at least I could understand her! Her strong southern accent would be hard enough to hear anyway, never mind a croaky, disjointed strong southern accent. "Hello worse nightmare!"- Miranda.My other problem is the lack of life. The story is so eccentric and sometimes had mad-cap strokes that were really over the top, which is absolutely fine! It sometimes resembled the works of "Amelie" yet lacked the life "Amelie" had. I think that they should've taken it further, instead of making it so still like a gentle drama. "Forrest gump" was also full of much more life than this.Don't get me wrong, "Benjamin Butty" really did have strokes of genius and wonder. The script really is top-notch, as it visits a mans life and every aspect of it as he ages backward. The story is interesting and original and David Fincher shows some really fantastic directing and cinematography. "Butty" really is a nice-looking film.The CGI effects were amazing, making Pitt look like an ancient old hag, to a boy-ish face. Cate Blanchett wasn't quite so convincing, she just looked like herself with a couple of lines drawn on her face. But you can't have it all.Overall, the film is actually really long but it doesn't feel that long at all. I was scared of getting bored, but I didn't thanks to the intriguing story, gorgeous cinematography and top-notch directing. However, I do feel it could've been just a little bit better and perhaps a little more... Crazy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why a lot of people say this film is boring,It's a beautiful one.maybe is not as good as Seven or Fight Club,but it has magic moments.The last scenes were very nice and tragic.I think many people didn't like it cause everybody was waiting it like one of the best films of the history.Well,it is not,but is a memorable one,that's why very much people didn't like it,but it's made the way the classic love stories have been made.I m so sure if it had been done 50 years ago exactly the same way it's it would has been considered a masterpiece.Benjamin Button was voted the seventh best foreign movie released in Spain in 1999 by the Spanish critics(and Slumdog Millionaire got the 11th position)And is studied with passion in cinema Spanish books,so I think is not a bad movie as much people say</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiouser and curiouser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This epic account of one man's journey backwards through life, beginning physically as a baby-sized octogenarian and ultimately succumbing to his demise as a confused infant, is so beautifully told and presented, well acted for the most part and superbly written that within the first 30 minutes of the film the audience will most likely have completely forgotten how ridiculous the premise of The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button truly is while simultaneously accepting it as the key theme to the film, upon which the entire story is based. In essence, it is wholly concerning the occurrence of a man being born old and growing younger as time progresses. It is utterly absurd. Nevertheless, the attempt to present this borderline "realm of fantasy" foundation as a straight-forward (though unavoidably quirky) and accurate account of love is very successful, and it is at times far more moving than one may expect. Benjamin Button was adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's more light-hearted (though not necessarily superior) short story by Eric Roth. One of the major criticisms of the film derives from this fact: not many people are truly surprised to learn that Roth also penned the cinematic adaptation of Forrest Gump some 15 years earlier. It is true that Benjamin Button follows the basis of Forrest Gump closely, in being an ambitious chronicled narrative of somewhat comedy- satire, somewhat tragedy that ultimately is driven by the pursuit of love by an outsider, one whose journey is defined by his endurance in life rather than his abilities. However, this significant variation is mostly acceptable considering the entertainment value this enjoyable and pleasing spectacle offers as a somewhat original achievement. One would be hard-pressed to find too many direct excerpts of dialog, character references or scenes in this film that are taken directly from Forrest Gump (the exceptions being Queenie, Benjamin's African-American adoptive mother, a very similar caricature of Mother Gump, and Benjamin unable to use his legs in early childhood, gaining said usage in an inspiring and memorable scene). Director David Fincher, famed for such grungy yet captivating films as Se7en and cult classic Fight Club (both starring Brad Pitt), reaches perhaps the highpoint of his audience-engaging career with Benjamin Button. While his earlier projects had the power to offer thrills and entertainment, they did so through the medium of stylized violence, caustic philosophy and unflinching realism. Button truly is Fincher's first attempt (and success) at intimacy with the viewer, meeting with them on a comfortable level that can be relished without recoil, pleasantly savored instead of shockingly unforgettable. The strongest directed scenes in the film are, as to be expected from Fincher, also the most thought-provoking, in which each and every event that contributed, no matter how slightly, to Daisy being hit by a car is revisited and contemplated, ranging to as small as a person tying their shoelace. It is then proposed, as these aspects are shown once more in real time, that if but one of these occurrences had taken slightly less or slightly more time to take place (or had not taken place at all), Daisy's accident would have been avoided. The viewer would try their best desperately not to blink during this incredible segment. In regard to performances, Cate Blanchett has a strong deliverance as Daisy Fuller throughout the varying stages of the character's life, from the appropriately cute, lovable, naturally impatient and confused Daisy at late-teens/early-twenties, to the mature and assertive (though subtly aware and frightened) Daisy at mid-thirties/forties. A notable newcomer to big-budget splendors is Taraji P. Henson, who is captivating and scene-stealing (in a good way) as the sassy, wise, no-nonsense Queenie.Brad Pitt, as the eponymous protagonist, is a little less luminous. Most of his narration is somewhat monotonous and sometimes redundant in regard to the action on screen. Early on in the film his embodiment of an elderly, frail and optimistically confused youngster is very pleasant to watch, but with his transition into adulthood comes an equally significant shift from entertaining to? not dull, but perhaps restrained (in a bad way). His words, written with such passionate feeling, are sometimes spoken without the vaguest indication of emotion and his character often becomes second to Daisy and her more deeply invested sense of adventure and enthusiasm for life. On the other hand, in the defense of such a charismatic performer, perhaps this discreet performance was intentional. Truly the audience will notice a difference in Brad Pitt, seeing a more adult and established side not present before in many of his previous roles (such as the boxing "Pikey" in Snatch or the comically insane animal rights advocator in Twelve Monkeys). So maybe this unevenness, so to speak, is Pitt's maturity coming through; well, that's definitely worth something at least. So, all-in-all, the occasional bland mediocrity and revisited ground present in Benjamin Button cannot detract from it's heart and intent as a deeply rewarding film of great substance that has been far too excessively criticized and for the wrong reasons, e.g. too much sentimentality (in a film about love; is that possible?). And, when this argument is raised in the film's name, the retort is a very common misconception amongst movie-goers: that Benjamin Button tarnishes the very name of love and destroys all that is sacred about it with its peculiar and unsatisfying take on romance. While this film may quite surely present love as a fragile sensation experienced in what can only be called a very unstable situation, does it not demonstrate all too well the triumphant nature of love and the power and strength that love possesses? The power that it can invoke in oneself. To love Benjamin Button was to love inevitability; to love him was to accept loving something that ultimately and unpredictably might not love you back. To love the unknown? and yet, Daisy loved Benjamin with all her heart, until her dying day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In an ambitious, philosophical tale, Brad Pitt experiences life aging backwards!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a popular short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film tells the story of a man, who is born old and ages backwards, struggling to find a place in a society, which is afraid of the unusual and the unknown. Being Fincher's most expensive project to date, with a budget of $160 Million, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is somewhat of a fairy tale and a historic epic, that takes place in the 20th century, and in the end, has a bit too much ambition for its own good.On the night the Great War finally ends, Benjamin Button is born in New Orleans, under "unusual circumstances". Thomas Button is confronted with the exact meaning of these words, when he finds out that his wife died in childbirth and that his child looks like the miniature version of an old man on his death bed. Desperate, he takes the child from his home and drops it on the stairs of a nursery home, where two young employees find it and decide to adopt it, despite its physical abnormalities. Although they expect the child, named Benjamin, to die soon, he starts to grow and to everyone's astonishment younger. After a couple of years, he meets Daisy, a curious girl, who immediately feels a certain affection for Benjamin although they couldn't be more different in their looks. Growing up in the nursery home, Benjamin frequently encounters death, as its takes one after another guest of the home, and eventually he decides to leave and go to sea on the tugboat of Captain Mike. Initially reluctant to take the old man on board, Mike is soon surprised by Benjamin's strong will and youthful spirit, and him and his crew travel all around the world eventually ending up in Russia. There Benjamin meets Elizabeth Abbot, who vegetates in an unhappy marriage and starts an affair with Benjamin, who eventually realizes that his true love, Daisy, is far home where he should be. But he questions himself whether a relationship is even possible, when two people age in different direction, and while one of them grows older the other one gets younger.Watching this film like going through the photo album of a stranger, who evidently had a fascinating life, but we only get glimpses into it without any explanations of what lead to the situations. The film feels like a set of pictures, that was failed to put together properly to create a compact narrative. For the first hour, by far my favorite part of this film, from his early days in New Orleans to his career on the tugboat, I was really interested in the storyline and the strange character of Benjamin. But, as soon as he comes home from the war, the story begins to fall apart, and makes several jumps from one time period to another, without ever really going into them. New Orleans looks wonderfully nostalgic though and the scenes convey a unique atmosphere that make out the magic of this film. What it lacks in story development, the film makes up with an unreachable timelessness. Being filled with motifs of death, war, and loss, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a highly melancholy film that has few happy moments and therefore becomes more of a historic drama, than a fantasy epic. It's highly philosophical, with Benjamin Button narrating quite a bit of the plot, and inserting his unique views on the world and its people.As I mentioned previously, the inspiration for the movie was a 32 page short story. So, with the running time of the film just falling short of three hours, I felt that the plot was stretched out too far, and all in all the film is about 30 minutes too long. It's sad, because the story is really one of importance, and it would be a shame for it to get lost to some of the viewers. It's a complex movie, and one that requires a clear mind and attention. Some of the little things in the film really stood out for me, like the introduction story of the blind man, who creates a clock in memory of his fallen son, a shocking and unexpected hook to the story. But, while the film has some humorous elements, like an old man, who had some trouble during his life going out during thunderstorms, it is mostly very depressing, quiet and sad. While comparisons to the films "Forrest Gump", and especially "Big Fish" are almost bound to happen, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" doesn't quite have the passion and the energy of the other two films.Benjamin Button is played by Brad Pitt, who more than deserved his Oscar nomination for a role that is unusually quiet and philosophical for him. While by no means a bad actor in his other projects, he usually tends to be a bit of the winking "funny guy", rather than the introverted outsider. His performance is striking, yet subtle, and it's especially his expressions and the tone of his voice that make his character so intriguing. Cate Blanchett adds another stunning performance to her long resumee of top-notch character performances. While not quite as mesmerizing as Pitt, she has this captivating aura, that makes her an intense presence on screen. Taraji P. Henson is excellent and proves her undeniable talent for dramatic roles. Tilda Swinton plays Benjamin's first true love in the cold Russia, and while her role is almost a cameo, her chemistry with Pitt is astounding.The film has a lot going for itself, including the acting, the effects, the nostalgic settings, and the philosophical message that balanced some of the saddest themes of life so well, that it really made me think for many days. But in the end, I keep thinking back to the metaphorical photo album I described earlier and I just have to say the movie is not the masterpiece it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual, but touching and exquisitely filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for a long time, I had heard people raving how amazing it was but others calling it overly-sentimental tripe. After seeing it myself, while it is not my all time favourite movie or a perfect film by all means, I am glad to have watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. There are some parts where the film is very slow, and it is probably too long as well. Also I do think Se7en and Fight Club, also directed by David Fincher were better movies.That said, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is still an interesting, worthwhile and very good film on the joys of life, the sadness of death and a love that endures beyond time. It's concept is curious and unusual but is explored in a poignant and sensitive way. The screenplay does have some honest moments, and the story is incredibly heartfelt and touching, I admit I was emotionally wrecked at the end. Fincher's direction once again is very impressive. To top all this, the film has exquisite visuals, seriously the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is sumptuous, the make up is superb and the costumes are gorgeous. And the score is breathtakingly beautiful, very hypnotic, soothing and haunting. Personally I really liked the acting, Brad Pitt while I do think he has given better performances is surprisingly touching in the title role. He plays the role with real humanity and depth, and I didn't find his narration annoying at all. Cate Blachett has also been better, having been mesmerising in the Elizabeth movies and The Aviator, but she looks gorgeous in this movie and acts as a very sympathetic time-crossed soul mate, and the two stars are believable together.Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is very good, not outstanding but I am glad I watched it. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: On the eve of the end of the first world war a boy is born. His mother dies in childbirth, and when the father looks upon his child he is horrified. The newborn looks like he is about to die of old age. He leaves the child on the stairs of a nursing home where the kid grows up. No one expects the kid to survive for long, but he does, and seems to get younger as he grows older. When he is about ten years old he meets a young girl, visiting her grandmother. Instantly they form a bond that will follow them through their life. She growing older, he growing younger by every day.Comments: If this movie would have been a house, people would have knocked on its beam and been impressed by how well it was built. The curious case of Benjamin Button is a really well made movie, it is a piece of craftsmanship. It is well shot, well edited and well acted. It is an impressive piece of art that is well worth watching.But a movie, how well made it is, a movie is still dependent on the story it tells. The story is good, it is entertaining but perhaps the title is really describing it best. It is a curious story indeed. As the movie is well made, it is well written and solid enough. But the entertainment value lies within its peculiarity, that I was really curious how it would develop. Nothing wrong with that at all, but don't expect much of a comedy, and certainly not much action. It is a drama with certain romantic elements, but not very much of a happy one. In fact I found that the story is quite a sad one, of love with almost insurmountable obstacles.It was a beautiful story, but with a sad and emotional ending. But despite the end being rather sad, it is in line with the movie, beautiful and fitting at the same time.The only fault might be that it is quite long. But to tell a whole life's story takes time, even if it is backwards.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We must lose the people who we love, or how do we know how important they are?" It's the most touching lines in whole movie in my opinion. I think this movie is beautiful, but full of sentimental at the same time. Because of the elder appearance, Benjamin was abandon by his father who was suffered from the pain of his wife's death. A couple adopted him and they found that when Benjamin grew up, his appearance would get younger. In his life journey, he knew lots of people. He met a little girl whose name was Daisy, falling love with her. They had chances to get together with each other but they just missed them. The movie is probe into many issues, such as affection, love, the capricious of life, and meaning of infinity. I think the most impressive thing in this movie is the love between Benjamin and Daisy. Owing to the special body that Benjamin had, they couldn't grow old together, possessed the normal happiness either. They actually had delightful time. However, when Daisy had children Benjamin decided to leave. He thought that his children need a real father not a mate. I knew Benjamin thought a lot and loved his family truly deeply so while I saw he rode his motorcycle to leave, I couldn't help crying. Reality was always heavy. When both of them finally met as well as got along with each other at the almost same age, I think that moment is the immortality. No matter the end is heavy or desolate or splendid, we begin think about our life, cherishing the thing surrounding us. That is totally enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Life of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a film that had been in production since the early nineties, with different directors like Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard and actors like Tom Cruise and John Travolta being attached. It was subjected to numerous rewrites until David Fincher and Brad Pitt took control of the project.Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) was a man with an extraordinary condition: he was born as an 80-year-old man in 1918, in New Orleans. His mother dies during his child birth and his father Thomas (Jason Flemyng) abandons him at an old persons home. Benjamin is raised in the home and a carer, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) becomes his surrogate mother. Benjamin's condition makes him grow younger and physically experience life backwards. He soon meets the love of his life, Daisy (Cate Blanchett, Elle Fanning and Madisen Beaty). The two go on their separate ways, Daisy becoming a ballerina, and Benjamin travels, but the two are continually drawn to each other.When I first saw the trailer I thought it was a Tim Burton film, giving it a dark almost Gothic feel: but the real film is not like that. It would have been better if Tim Burton did direct this film, it was an idea that he could have sunk his teeth into. David Fincher does offer a solid hand behind the camera, and give the film a tender touch: despite what some people say, Benjamin Button is basically a love story. But Fincher is better at grittier subject matter like in Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac. Fincher also makes this film a bit too long and therefore, makes it drag. That is always a problem in any film.There is a good cast in this film. Brad Pitt once again shows he is more then a pretty boy and gives a compelling performance in the lead role. Cate Blanchett is offers a decent performance, but she had done better. Taraji P. Henson who was nominated for a Oscar gives a very good performance as Benjamin replacement mother. The child actors in the film were also very compelling in their roles.The script was a problem area for this film. It was written Eric Roth who also wrote Forest Gump (a very overrated film). He follows a same sort of plot, a two friends/lover who take separate courses in live but still able to meet each other at points. As well as coping a similar plot, their seems to be a lack of realistic or internal logic, with everyone seeming to be normal about Benjamin's condition: surely wouldn't he be taken to a doctor or be tested or something? It's even more strange when at times the world is very surreal, but others it's quite down to Earth. The other problem is for a film that is set in New Orleans during an important period of America's social history the film completely side-steps the issue of racism and the civil rights movement. All this historical events are just background noise.A decent but flawed film. 7.5 out of 10. Tim Burton would have been more suited for this project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curiously compelling case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benjamin Button was born under unusual circumstances. He was born old, a baby with the wrinkly appearance and multiple maladies of an elderly man. As everyone around him grows older it is Benjamin's fate to grow younger. Backwards Benjamin goes, from that wrinkly baby to a child confined by "old age" to a wheelchair to an older-looking Brad Pitt. And then to just plain Brad Pitt and then a younger-looking Brad Pitt and...well, you get the point. Curious indeed. And this exceptionally curious life's journey is captured brilliantly. Pitt's performance in this incredibly challenging role is terrific. Obviously in this kind of story special effects and makeup are going to be critically important. If the effects fail the movie is doomed to fail. That proves to be no concern as this is one movie in which the special effects are special indeed. As Benjamin lives his life in reverse the whole thing actually seems plausible and believable. It looks real and for that the effects and makeup teams cannot receive enough praise. For as good as everything looks though the film still has to grab you emotionally to really work. The viewer has to really buy in to this story and director David Fincher crafts his tale in such a way that one can't help but become emotionally invested in the curious life's saga of Benjamin Button.At its heart this is a love story. Now how exactly, and with whom exactly, could a man like Benjamin Button fall in love? How is it possible for this man to share his life with anyone? The answer comes in the person of Daisy, a young girl whom Benjamin meets during his childhood. Of course during his "childhood" Benjamin is by all appearances about 70 years old. But Benjamin and Daisy have an instant, if rather odd, connection. Nobody seems to really understand Benjamin. Somehow though young Daisy seems to get it. And their bond remains strong as Daisy grows older and Benjamin grows younger. The young girl growing older, the old man growing younger, destined to meet in the middle. It may be the most unusual love story you'll ever see but the love between these two is very real and incredibly heartfelt. It's a powerful, compelling and rather beautiful story which is always tinged with a hint of melancholy. Because when Benjamin and Daisy do eventually meet in the middle the unspoken truth is that they remain two ships passing in the night, headed in opposite directions. This really cannot end well can it? We shall see.This is a movie unlike anything else you'll ever see. Well, most anything else as many Forrest Gump parallels are obvious. But while that comparison does work somewhat the fact is Benjamin Button is an incredibly unique film. If this story fell into the wrong hands we could have been left with a film which was an absolute mess. But director Fincher steers this production beautifully. In so many ways it is an incredibly challenging story to tell and you get the sense not many people could have really pulled it off. Fincher does it wonderfully, helped immeasurably of course by Benjamin himself in the person of Pitt. What a long, strange character arc Benjamin has and Pitt is spot-on every step of the way. Having a wonderful actress in Cate Blanchett to play off of certainly doesn't hurt Pitt's cause. Blanchett's portrayal of Daisy is, as you would expect, magnificent. So many other characters float in and out of Benjamin's life and a terrific ensemble cast brings each and every person to wonderfully vibrant life. Such a large group of performers and it seems there is not one casting misstep. Credit again to Fincher for drawing out amazing performances from so many people. Maybe the film is a tad bit long but it's hard to say which scenes you could really do without. Benjamin Button led an amazing life and you can't help but want to see as much of it as possible. All in all it's a film which is a magnificent technical achievement but more importantly it's a wonderful story. And that story is told beautifully in what proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Tale Adapted For the Modern World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the close of the first Wold War, a child is born... Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who extraordinarily happens to be physically about seventy years old despite having a child-size body. Throughout his life, he grows younger rather than older.David Fincher just keeps growing as a director. While I'm very partial to his earlier, darker work ("Seven", "Alien 3", etc.) his latest projects just continue to amaze with his unique sensibility and with a wonderful cast of friends and crew.There's really nothing bad that can be said about this film. The original story took place about sixty years earlier, but you would never know that... the screenwriter was so careful to make a new story while still respecting the old concept. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved.Brad Pitt was wonderful as always (here's another person who grows all the time), Cate Blanchett was enjoyable, Tilda Swinton was tolerable (I don't generally like her) and we had some nice supporting roles filled by the likes of Elias Koteas. It's no wonder this film is in the top 250 on IMDb as of this writing.I have to give special credit to the CGI crew. While I am not generally a fan, they did a great job. The "old" Pitt was decent, but I was really impressed with the younger Pitt. He was "Thelma and Louise" young all over again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald story about a New Orleans native (Brad Pitt) that ages backward, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has all the ingredients for success, but falls victim to its own and Oscar aspirations. Button narrates his life story as it's posthumously read to true love Daisy (Cate Blanchett) on her deathbed, just hours before hurricane Katrina hits. With Pitt's characteristic faux Southern narration and the anciently made-up, mumbling Blanchett who intermittently croaks out one final fantastical story, the narrative feels instantly trite; the impending catastrophe just a cheap melodramatic gimmick. Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson is the only strong point in the film at this point, her role as Benjamin's adopted mother heartbreaking.Fincher, whose directing style is consistently cold (effective in the right setting), doesn't do enough with the backgrounds, a missed opportunity for a story set in one of America's oldest and most historically lush cities. It feels cold all around, especially as both Pitt and Blanchett are the type of actor to play their roles with a gusto that feels like an actor playing a part, and not an actor sinking into a character. That's not always a bad thing (ie. Inglorious Basterds or Elizabeth), but when their forces combine with the addition of Fincher, it's hard to stay invested.The film does find its heart once Daisy (who ages normally) and Benjamin meet in the middle. What was once clichéd begins to feel real and magical, especially at the end as Daisy nurses the infant Button at the end of his life, or as the waters of the Katrina engulf New Orleans. Sadly, the last half is not enough to save the film from itself, but does make it worth a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken off of Scott Fitzgerald's short story, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; writer Eric Roth and director David Finchner take this fantasy and bring it to life. Benjamin (Brad Pitt) is born with old age and lives a life growing younger as everyone grows old. Even in this unusual circumstance a love story unfolds. A central insight in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the complexity of life and love. The movie is expressed as a narrative of the life of Benjamin Button consisting of many flashbacks that emphasize how complex life and love can be. From the beginning when Benjamin is found by Queenie (Taraji Henson), a black woman who runs a nursing home, is unable to have children and takes Benjamin in as her own. Queenie represents the importance of life and maternal love woman have for children. Other flash backs conclude life is full of opportunities, some missed some recognized. The dancing motif helps recognize those moments. Benjamin meets a cute red headed young girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett), who comes to the nursing home to see her grandmother. After Daisy demonstrates a dance move for her grandmother, she is introduced to Benjamin for the first time. It's obvious that Daisy is going to be the one he falls in love with. The flashbacks and dancing motif continue from New York City to Paris and is a constant reminder that love can be found but is just as complex as life itself. Fincher makes you wait but the love scene does happen. Finchner's flashbacks used throughout The Curious Case of Benjamin Button illustrates Benjamin aging in reverse and is just as effective as the flashback Lasse Holstrom in Cider House Rules used for the main character Homer (Toby Maguire) to express the complexity with the coming of age. Both films establish a pre-destined path with their main characters that is easily recognized but effectively accomplished."Living and loving: Two themes that never grow old"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing Premise, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a visual feast. It is lush with the images of America in all its incarnations from the early 20th Century. I agree with Roger Ebert that the premise is also the thing that short circuits the film. Once Benjamin comes to realize what is happening to him, he now has to play by a set of rules that are not of his own making. All relationships of any substance are clouded by his fate. Even taking the premise about living in the here and now because we all eventually meet our end, doesn't help me. The sadness that hangs over the entire movie (which is awfully long for drama), with all of the implications of outliving virtually everyone, make it a hard sell. Even with all of that, I thought there were wonderful performances by just about everyone. I am a great Brad Pitt fan and felt that he was masterful in his performance. I was pleased that the transitioning of his being wasn't accelerated. The gradual movement back to his youth is subtle and the make-up and special effects people are to be congratulated. They also integrate his mental acuity with his physical change. I could go on. I just believe that this is a good, engaging film, but it was doomed somewhat from the start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfectly executed film, bittersweet story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film as you would expect from the title and trailer describes the life story of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) who is faced with the unusual predicament of aging backwards. Director David Fincher guides us through a series of Benjamin's life defining moments, but it is his relationship with Daisy (Cate Blanchett) that is central to the film. I was drawn in by this hugely interesting premise and keen to see how a tale that presents such obvious technical challenges would translate to the big screen. Despite taking nearly three hours to unfold I was more than satisfied with the experience, I fully believed in both Benjamin's character and the relationships he forms throughout this beautifully crafted film.I can definitely see where the comparisons with Forest Gump have come from and whilst I'm a fan of both films I had the same problem with them - they are a tad tedious! It's sadly inherent in a film that focuses on someones life story that they end up being rather predictable viewing experiences. Fortunately the film kept my attention thanks to some exemplary casting and stellar performances from both Pitt and Blanchett, as well as a Taraji P. Henson who play Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie. The key moments of Benjamin's life are brilliantly captured, I personally enjoyed that the director focused on both the highs and lows of life in equal measure but I was left emotionally exhausted by the time the film reached its climax.Benjamin Button has much to offer, it's almost worth watching for the presentation alone. It's a tribute to the quality of the make-up and CGI in this film that I was so drawn in to the screenplay; we have really reached a stage where special effects no longer distract from the content. I can see why many will be left frustrated due to the slow pace and subtle payoffs, but if you put aside the time and go into this with a curious mind I'm sure like me you will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic storytelling. Pitt proves that he's an understated actor and Blanchett makes you fall in love with her.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benjamin Button is an epic film from start to finish. Sweeping in its approach, clocking just under two hours and fifty minutes. It really only felt like an hour, honestly. Films of this elegance do not come around often. There is a rare sense of old Hollywood in this picture. It is grand, vibrant, and full of life in every possible way. The process of watching a man live an entire life on screen, one can't help thinking of his own, reevaluating past memories and forgotten faces. The sheer exuberance leaves a life affirming reassurance as the end credits roll by. Many have probably seen the previews on television and have gotten a basic concept. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a child born old to grow young. Abandoned by his parents, taken in by a black women, he lives a childhood within an old age home. The ironic twist here is that he was born old, so the residences don't mind his company; he's just like them. His life is changed when one of the tenants has her granddaughter visit for the weekend. Her name is Daisy, a precocious redhead; her and Benjamin instantly connect. She will later become the driving force of his life. Benjamin is subjected to things as an old man. He learns of death through the old age home. He can drink under age and frequent the whorehouse whenever he pleases. Yet he grows younger, curiosity fuels his sense for adventure. One day he meets a sailor who is looking for an extra hand on ship. Benjamin is quick to join. They sail and explore. Stationed over in England, he meets a married woman lonely for companionship. They soon begin an affair, meeting in the hotel lobby every night. World War II then breaks. Benjamin and the crew are enlisted to fight. They set off to sea once again.If this film has one major disadvantage, it is that Forrest Gump bares a striking resemblance, structurally. Written by the same man, Benjamin grows up in the south, handicapped, yet loved by his mother unconditionally. He befriends a girl who will become his main love interest throughout and then goes off to fight in war. There are other similarities, but why discourage potential viewers. This is a wonderful film. Adapted from a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, David Fincher centres the story on Benjamin, what he sees in life and how aging backgrounds has it benefits, but also tragic consequences. Think about it, one with the same condition would be lonely all their life. You could never grow old with someone, never watch your children grow up. These are factors that excel the film from mere fantasy to a timeless drama. Furthermore, with a running time of almost three hours characters and situations are fleshed out, room is allowed for growth. As said before, a man's life is lived right before one's eyes, it is a truly remarkable theatre experience. CGI in this film is used not only to an advantage but as a whole other life form. Brad Pitt as a man dealing with an incurable fate is acted with a subtle shyness, always listening, rarely speaking. Pitt is not only good in the film; he's never been better. The supporting cast is top notch as well. Taraji P. Henson, Benjamin's adopted mother, Queenie, cares for him no matter what. A strong character actress in recent years, she leaves a lasting impression. Cate Balncett as Daisy is also worth mentioning. The love of Benjamin's life, she exudes a sophisticated presence one can't look away from. In one particular scene, Daisy performs a dance for him under the moonlit night. It is perhaps the sexiest scene of the year. No sex or nudity, just the seductive movement of an actress channeling flawless beauty. This film must be seen on the big screen. It demands full attention and involvement. Photography is not talked about enough when it comes to film-making. Shot in New Orleans, it is homage to a once beautiful destination ravaged by an infamous hurricane. Katrina and weather are a reoccurring theme throughout. Forget the Forrest Gump similarities that are ever so predominant. This is a classical fable, make sure you see this with someone you love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man is born, lives, and dies. Simplicity at its peak. Nature at its best. The world revolving as always. Nothing new, nothing surprising, nothing noteworthy -- until something changes. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tells the story of a man's life, his physical and emotional growth, his struggles, his triumphs, his failures, his loves, and his death. He leads a normal life, one filled with sweeping adventures, love, friendship, happiness, sorrow, and all of life's emotions and experiences that define one's character, one's heart, and one's soul. In the eyes of the passer-by, at a glance, a snapshot, or an instant -- Benjamin's Button's life was no more or no less interesting than that of most others -- except for the fact that he experienced it backwards. Born an infant but with the physical characteristics of an elderly man, and growing younger rather than older with time, the entirety of Benjamin's life was marked by his astonishing and seemingly incomprehensible development. Regardless of his differences, no matter his stage in life, and despite his very existence that defied all logic and scientific explanation, Benjamin's place in the world remained firmly grounded in love -- both given and received. Stamina, strength, vision, and hair may come and go, but man's one everlasting quality, no matter his age or physical appearance -- the simple act of love -- proves once again to be the foundation of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual contentment regardless of how normal, or abnormal, a man may be.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, based on the short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald, tells the tale of Benjamin (Brad Pitt), a man born the size of an infant but with all the characteristics of an aged gentleman. His mother dead as a result of labor complications, Benjamin is left on the steps of a New Orleans nursing home by his father on the night of his birth, the same day the city is celebrating the end of the first World War. Taken in by the gentle-hearted Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), Benjamin defies all odds, surviving one year to the next and growing taller -- and younger. As time passes, Benjamin's crooked back and hands straighten; his once-bald head grows hair; and he finds himself no longer confined to a wheelchair. Over the years, Benjamin discovers the true meaning of life on board a tugboat, in war, and in the arms of the girl he's loved since childhood, Daisy (Cate Blanchett). While he grows younger, the world around him matures. Friends and relatives die, love comes and goes, but his heart and soul remain steady, fashioned over time by those who took a chance on -- and loved -- a human being living a blessed, unusual, and certainly curious life.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie about life and death, but also about what defines man in between those dates etched in stone at the end of days. The process of living -- the people and the experiences that shape a man's fundamental understanding of himself and the world around him -- depends not on a number, a tuft of hair, a physical countenance, or even the ability to walk, talk, or fully comprehend the world, but rather on the heart and its ability to give and receive, to cherish and accept, no matter the circumstances. Unconditional love -- that which defined Benjamin's life and, in particular, both his formative and final years -- served as the foundation to his very existence, the fact that he was born wrinkly and ill or died a smooth, unblemished baby mattered not to those that saw fit to give their hearts fully and in turn receive the joys of love returned in their lives. Those two individuals that shaped Benjamin's life -- his caregiver and de facto mother Queenie and his lifelong love interest Daisy -- each accepted Benjamin not as a curiosity or an accident of nature but rather as a human being, worthy of love, affection, acceptance, understanding, and happiness.Aside from being an emotionally stirring and deeply profound masterpiece that shows that it is the whole of the experience of one's life and the importance of one constant -- love -- rather than a snapshot or even a biologically-correct series of stages and events that makes a man, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is also a technical triumph, the film awarded with thirteen Oscar nominations. Henson's character, Queenie, serves as the film's emotional core and most important character. In many ways, she represents the ideal human being, one who always offers a helping hand to those in need and regardless of their physical and mental capacities. The film also features seamless transitions from one version of Button to the next.Most importantly, though, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a sweet movie, one told with the utmost respect and compassion for the story, the characters, and even cinema itself. The story is both at once spellbinding and expertly-crafted into a simple and innocent yet incredibly moving and effective picture. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button deals with the complexities of life made more challenging by one man's unusual experience, but despite what is often weighty subject matter, the film remains tender and gentle in its approach, look, and feel. The warm, inviting and sometimes sepia-toned interiors, roughly-reproduced flashback scenes (complete with fading, jumping, scratches, and dirt galore), and some surreal imagery all compliment the tone of the film wonderfully. Brad Pitt's narration, too, is superb, his tone and delivery perfectly matched to the incredibly well-written and sometimes even poetic words that both move the story forward and serve as a source of fascination and enthrallment throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing lasts... What a shame...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is one year's best movies, although it runs a little long. Coming from Director David Fincher ("Seven" and "Fight Club"), the movie is unexpectedly sentimental. Brad Pitt gives perhaps his best performance. Cate Blanchett is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nod. The screenplay by Eric Roth from the story by Robin Swincord and Roth based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story is the lyrical allegory of a man who ages backward through his life. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" feels reminiscent of Pitt's "Meet Joe Black" and "Forrest Gump". This may be intentional. I am guessing that the original F. Scott Fitzgerald story may have been darker.Fincher envisions "Benjamin Button" as a poignant parable of change in life, and life being whole and complete. The old woman, who teaches Benjamin to play piano, tells him, "Everyone you love will eventually die?" I think Fincher and Roth tell a story of legacy, mortality, and love. Effectively told from retrospective narrative, the story follows the life of Benjamin (Pitt), who is born an old man, and grows physically younger as he ages through his life. After giving birth to Benjamin in 1918, his mother dies. His abhorred father Thomas Button (good Jason Flemyng) abandons his son at an elderly care home.The baby is raised by strong young Black woman Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), who names her son Benjamin. This is an amazing narrative touch, as "old man" baby Benjamin is raised among the elderly?his people. There Benjamin meets the love of his life Daisy (who eventually grows into Cate Blanchett) when she is 7 years old. Here Fincher and Roth display a delicate touch. Benjamin and Daisy's fostering relationship is endearing and awkward, when it could easily have been a little creepy. At 17 years old Benjamin decides to leave home and sail the seas with tugboat skipper Captain Mike (larger than life Jarred Harris). All the while Benjamin writes to Daisy as he promised. Daisy grows up into a beautiful free-spirited ballerina.Eventually, their lives collide somewhere in the middle. In a moving scene together Benjamin confesses to Daisy, "I was thinking how nothing lasts, and what a shame that is." And we watch as Benjamin and Daisy deal with their fate and the inevitable. Along the way, life happens. Henson is so strong as Queenie, who loves Benjamin as her blood. There is such a moving moment at Benjamin's father's funeral. Queenie holding Benjamin's arm tells him that his father will be buried next to his mother. Pitt quietly says, "You're my mother." "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is about the fleetness of life and mortality, but is also about family and love spanning the generations. Along that line Julia Ormond is amazingly poignant as Daisy's daughter Caroline, who discovers her mother's amazing life. Tilda Swinton is also riveting as Elizabeth, the other great love of Benjamin's life."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is so moving, because of the powerful performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Brad gives his best performance. He brilliantly balances the wonder and pain of a man fated to live his life backward. His chemistry with Blanchett is authentically moving and touching. Pitt and Blanchett make us believe that Benjamin and Daisy are soul mates. Blanchett is amazing, and deserves an Oscar nod. Although she plays the normal Daisy, who grows old like the rest of us, she emanates a deep compassion and humanity that is so moving. She is great with Pitt as their love story blossoms in the middle. Blanchett is powerful in her compassion and silence in the moments near the end."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" celebrates life, unexpected and always a wonder. David Fincher maintains a sense of humor, and tells a touching and inspiring tale with an edge. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are amazing and powerful. See "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film, lacking in few areas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins with a good plot and a great idea but unfortunately does not develop into the full thickness that it easily could have. This issue is on the part of Mr. David Fincher, the director. For instance, the entire racial issue of the 1900's is ignored, I mean hello??? He is living in a retirement home run by African Americans during the whole civil rights era. Unfortunately, racism in New Orleans was very common. Although it is sad to say this, the racism would have added much needed sadness to the film. Another plot issue involved in this film is the serious lack of dialogue on the part of Brad Pitt. Yes this sounds stupid because he narrates this whole film but think about it, he says nothing that can show his true acting talent.I will have to agree with the masses on the whole, "The visual effects AKA the CGI is incredible," possibly the best since Saving Private Ryan or the LOTR film. But let me tell you this, that whole younger Brad Pitt meaning when he was really old, and the young Cate Blanchett, were all visual effects, not make-up. Sorry to break it to you folks. Make-up can do some amazing things, but it cannot make Cate Blanchett look more attractive than a goddamn goddess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher and Pitt have done it Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has simply improved with every film he has done. He started off with the underrated Alien 3, then moved on to the mysterious Se7en, gave us his greatest hit with Fight Club, stayed strong with Panic Room, and, most recently, treated us with the chilling thriller Zodiac. Now, he gives us The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but you wouldn't know that Ficher directed it if you didn't see his name at the end of the film.Once again, Fincher teams up with Brad Pitt, who portrays the title character. Pitt, who was terrific in Se7en and even better in Fight Club, portrays a character he dosen't usually portray. Benjamin Button is a tragic yet determined individual, who has the slight problem of aging backwards. Whoever did the CGI effects in this movie deserves an Oscar. Early on, Pitt portrays Benjamin Button as a seven year who looks like he's in his 80's. You will not believe that it is Brad Pitt under all that makeup and CGI.As good as he is, Brad Pitt can't carry the film by himself. After all, he needed the respective help from Morgan Freeman and Edward Norton to make Se7en and Fight Club work. Fincher's male lead comes mainly from Jason Flemyng and Jared Harris. Flemyng does a convincing job as Benjamin's father. I didn't even recognize Flemyng, who I thought played a classic role in Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. And Harris is terrific as Captain Mike, a man Benjamin befriends while working at sea.Fincher also succeeds once again with his female lead. After working with Gwyneth Paltrow on Se7en, Helena Bonham Carter in Fight Club and Jodie Foster in Panic Room, Cate Blanchette is excellent. Cast as Benjamin's love interest, she is simply perfect. She has terrific chemistry with Pitt, especially in the touching scenes where she grows older and he grows younger.Overall, a terrific film. If I have any complaints, I have to say, the film didn't know to quit while it was ahead. What could've been a nice two hour film is stretched out to nearly three hours. And the early scenes showing the wrinkled baby Benjamin Button are a tad disturbing to look at. But I will say this. I'm not the type of guy who loves all these "Oscar Worthy" flicks. But take my advice...trust Fincher and Pitt to work their magic all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one was to think about the technology that helped bring this affecting story to life it would be almost intimidating I'd assume. To have just about every other element of the film, technical or otherwise, bond so wonderfully that it makes you forget about how Brad Pitt's face is on that old man's body, and just see Pitt as an old man, is something that deserves praise. I hope Fincher didn't have too many sleepless nights over it though, because from the opening oddity about a backwards clock and the man who made it, we are transported into what resembles an intriguing modern fairy tale. It seems to have an aura that few films do or attempt to create anymore. Something that even if you did not enjoy it, it stays with you, but if you did, it is nothing short of utterly absorbing.Themes of opportunity, love, growth, life and death are consistent as we follow the unambiguous linear storyline, constantly moving forward. Engaging and quirky characters interweave the film throughout, with roundly excellent performances from all involved. Beyond Pitt's effortless essay of Benjamin, Blanchett again proving she is the best female actor working today, Taraji Henson's Queenie and Jason Flemyng as Thomas Button, deserve to be mentioned. The narration used to tell and introduce is delivered as well as one could have hoped with Pitt's New Orleans's drawl finely convincing.I recoiled initially from the chosen narrative, of the journal being read by Daisy's daughter to her on her deathbed. Beside the fact that this device brings unwanted comparisons to the vastly inferior, Forest Gump (note the same screenwriter here), a cut back to Daisy's hospital room in present day, too rue or explain her regret about a certain situation, started to grow slightly tedious and almost into muddy cliché. Luckily Fincher pulls back before it becomes a nuisance or overly sentimental. It's a close call, and I perhaps would rather have just seen the story unfold without it.The film's sword - the one for which it lives and dies by, is that for all it's tear jerking storyline and emotional performances, it's sentimentality is trod around like on a razor but declines to tip over, despite constantly threatening to do so - especially during those hospital scenes. There is no denying it is a sentimental film, but not in a groaning or manipulative way like other Hollywood films can be so guilty of. It's a delicate boundary to dwell in, but Fincher's steady hand coupled with its uniquely mature and darkly funny script, lifts the film above any of its peers and raises the bar for anything wanting to be in its company.If you find yourself a bit too cynical too endure the message it provides of simply enjoying life and it's never too late, it would not be so surprising, but you would be missing a wonderful experience. One that proves Fincher is someone who won't be pigeon holed and without doubt, one the most interesting directors working out of Hollywood today.</fullReview>

I had wished the love story was introduced earlier and made stronger from thereon. Although screenwriters, Eric Roth and Robyn Swicord had done a good job.Director David Fincher does a fine job of creating a chemistry between our two leads, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.There are some fabulous photographic compositions and if the love story was more compelling, then such photography would have had a more powerful meaning.With the excellent cast, the story, the direction, the score (Alexandre Desplat), the cinematography (Claudio Miranda) and all of th rest of the very skillful elements in the movie, I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not for everybody...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. While I most certainly didn't like it as much as Slumdog Millionaire (which was a definite crowd pleaser), Button carried with it a great message about love and death that will resonate with me. The story in its entirety is good although I might revise a few scenes to create an alternate ending. While watching it, I truly didn't realize that it was nearly 3 hours long because the story engaged me. There's no doubt that the audience knows and can somewhat predict how the story ends yet, for some reason, I was compelled to sit back and watch the true outcome of Benjamin's life. There is no doubt that movie was somewhat over-hyped due to it's A-list cast. Cate Blanchett does gives a great performance and so does Brad Pitt and even Tilda Swinton yet it didn't move me in any particular way. Button reminded me of a Forest Gump combined with Big Fish and if you didn't like either one of those movies, I suggest that you stay clear away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film did not induce into any deep emotions in me. It was an interesting film, but nothing great and people shouldn't be all "oh my god, this is amazing", oh, the concept is very good but the execution is nothing special and nothing that we haven't seem a hundred times in other films. The fact is that this is one of those mass produced canned Hollywood biographical feature films that are exactly alike each other, with some very minor variation in concept.So, here we have, another Hollywood biography based on the same mold as millions of others. This time, however, the protagonist got younger with the passing of time! Ohhh.... Nothing special here. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fist of all, let me say that this movie might not be everybody's cup of tea. It might be very slow, boring, and meaningless to some people, but I enjoyed it very much (and I'm a teenager). On the surface it might seem boring because it consists many short scenes unrelated to each other centered around Button, and at the end of the movie it might seem stupid because it never really ends in a solid conclusion. However, the reason I enjoyed this movie very much is because it contains many symbolisms and deeper meaning to the movie. I would definitely recommend you to look up the symbolisms of the humming bird, the clock, the guy who repeats that he got struck by lightning many times. Also I would also recommend to see if Button actually defeats time, (is he really getting younger, or is he actually getting older?). Also it is a beautiful film with some humor, and romance.I would recommend anyone to watch this alone, in you're room, without any distractions when you have time (it is a long film). It is a chill film that doesn't really have a climax. I would also recommend you to view it multiple times because it has many, and I quote, MANY symbolisms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated simplistic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this movie, similar films which stories are based on flashbacks/retelling the past came to mind: Forrest Gump, The Bicentennial Man, The Bridges of Madison County... Well, I actually enjoyed this Clint Eastwood movie back in the day, although my personal circumstances were different. Anyway, what those 2 first films and B. Button have in common, apart from the way the story is told, is how they try to take superficial human emotions and overuse them in order to produce a movie that moves the viewer. And, as it happened with Gump and The 200th Man, it ends up being just somehow hollow. Sure, if you enjoy simple emotions and the views of morality and what's supposed to be important that most of the world shares, you will enjoy its 2 hours and 46 minutes. Although, apart from the fact that this is the story of a human being whose body grows younger rather than old, all else have been told in other films. In the same ways. A love story trying to grab more, trying to go into "deeper" emotions that all human beings can feel connected to by exemplifying the occurrences in the life of one man. In this film you will find all your typical issues, including the subtle hint of americanism, all masterfully (?) crafted to make the common folk wet his/her eyes. I gave it a 6 instead of a 5 for the artistic value. Any person without an abstract mind who likes what's supposed to be "touching" and "emotional" will enjoy -don't know if that's the appropriate word for making you cry- this. If you seek a true deeper knowledge of the whole spectrum of human emotions, don't expect it here. Also, in a more personal note, I found the Louisiana accent a bit too much sometimes, but that's just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most extraordinary condition in the history of mankind is treated as a crushing bore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the most confounding pieces of screen writing that I have experienced in quite a while. Here is a movie built on the idea of a man who has the most phenomenal affliction in human history and surrounds him with characters that treat it as if it were a new haircut.The man is Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who is was born in 1918 the size of a normal infant but possessed all the infirmities of a man in his 80s. He ages backwards (apparently though a magic of a clock that runs backwards) and through the progress of this affliction, we see him spend his toddler years in a nursing home with wrinkles and liver spots then grow into his middle age and on down to his youth and develop the feeble mind of an elderly man when he reaches his preteen years.At birth his mother dies and his father gives him away to a nursing home where he is cared for by the loving caretaker Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). All around Benjamin are elderly tenants like himself who die with a sad regularity. Benjamin notices those around him getting older while at the same time his skin clears, his stooped walk straightens and he has fewer aches and pains.Somewhere in this elderly state, he meets a child named Daisy who will become his lifelong love. She arrives in his life periodically on her way to be a great ballet dancer. We know, inevitably, that they will be in love and that their best moments will take place when they eventually reach the same age. We wait patiently for the two to seriously begin discussing his bizarre aging process but when they do, they don't discuss it with any depth or any reason. They might as well have been discussing their wedding day.No one else really gets to the business of questioning Benjamin's predicament either and that's troubling because here is the most amazing thing that has ever happened in the history of the universe, a man is aging backwards and all through the movie, those closest to Benjamin treat this incredible miracle as if it weren't all that unusual. This is absolutely the wrong note on which to approach this premise. All through the movie I kept waiting for a doctor to examine Benjamin and turn him into a bit of medical history, but no, we follow his life's journey as he takes a job working on a tugboat, fights in the second world war and eventually shares a brief love affair with Daisy. Ho-hum.The fact that Benjamin's journey through life is so ordinary and unexceptional makes his aging process seem all the more like a movie gimmick. The story was written by Eric Roth who also adapted Forrest Gump, another story of an afflicted man's journey through life. But while Forrest dealt with his affliction and used it as a catalyst for an extraordinary life, Benjamin just seems to be running out the clock. We know what will happen to him (which is extraordinary when it finally happens) but what happens in between is paced so slowly and features events that are so unexceptional that we feel like we're following his life in real time.Benjamin Button was directed by David Fincher, a brilliant talent who has made films that I have loved like Se7en, Zodiac and Panic Room and some that I didn't like Fight Club and Alien 3. What all of these films have in common is a bold visual style that's fun just to look at. He has made bad films but he has never made a boring one. What he achieves with Benjamin Button is a different visual palette for every decade of Benjamin's life and an amazing array of visual effects to transform the tall, good looking Brad Pitt into a doddery old man who is about 5 feet tall and carries him through all the stages of the man's reversed age. But all the special effects and make-up don't mean a thing if there isn't a workable story to put around them and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button contains a lackluster story within an extraordinary idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Missing Thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bizarre story of a baby born with symptoms of old age grows up to become a baby with symptoms of old age. This is all there is to it.As if this is not bizarre enough, the movie fails to establish any connection between different yet apparently significant episodes. Sexual promiscuity is the main theme, at least that is what it is made it out to be. Story moves from an episode to a different one which has no consequence on each other or on the life of the protagonist.A baby boy is dumped by his father and later given all his father has got - a thriving button making business but this has no consequence in his life.He sleeps with different women (including hookers) and this has nothing to do with anything in the movie.His girl friend too sleeps with several men: no consequence whatever to this story.Suspend your disbelief: A tug boat (on which lead character is working) overruns a German U-boat (yes, this is fiction of course) and yes you got it, that is inconsequential to Benjamin's life and story in general.Benjamin learns to play piano; his foster mother dies; he abandons his girlfriend; several years later meets his grownup daughter (he just says 'hi'); and these are all disconnected with the plot that is supposed to be there.And what the heck is a humming bird doing in the middle of pacific or at a hospital window in a storm? Julia Ormond has no role other than just reading a diary and she is wasted, so is Brad Pitt, and so was my time watching this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with a kind of hokey premise: a man whose life cycle is reversed, being born old and getting younger. The production values are as high as can be possibly achieved, and the acting by all the players, both starring and supporting, is excellent. The movie 'feels' like Forrest Gump in many ways. The hummingbird is the feather, the frame story being in essence narrated by a major character, love passing in and out of the player's lives, encounters with historical events, and on and on.CCBB tells its story without humor, but humor is not really called for, and would no doubt be out of place. Neither is it a tragedy, as one of its themes, that of life running its course, regardless of which aging direction, is not tragic, but merely inevitable. It is a great film visually. The encounter between the tugboat and the U-boat is wonderfully done, as are all the period aspects of the film.Brad Pitt, a favorite of mine, gives an even and convincing, yet understated performance as the title character. He is clearly well-directed and up to the task without any hint of hamming or emoting. Cate Blanchett is excellent, as usual, as is Tilda Swinton. But despite individually excellent performances, the movie is cohesive and a pleasure to watch.I defend the long length of the film on the grounds that a)it seemed to fly by, and b)I did not want it to end. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sort of like "Forrest Gump" run in reverse and without the laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" sure got a lot of attention when it came out in 2008. It got so much attention that it received three Oscars and is ranked in the IMDb Top 250--currently at #247. And, as a result, when I finally got around to seeing it, my expectations were way, way too high. I was expecting too much, I am sure, as it's hard for a film to live up to all this hoopla. Now if I look at the film and try to ignore all these ridiculously high expectations, I see that it is indeed an exceptional film...but perhaps not quite the 'must-see' that I thought it was. I can't put my finger on it...it just didn't seem like a film a cinema freak must watch...though it was a nice, gentle viewing experience. And, after seeing this and "Slumdog Millionaire", I can see why "Benjamin Button" didn't capture the Best Picture Oscar.Probably the best way to describe this film is like "Forrest Gump" run in reverse...and without the laughs or meetings with presidents and all the celebrity status. That's because although Benjamin SHOULD be world famous for being the only person to ever live life backwards, curiously he isn't and people seem to almost take it in stride. In addition, and this part DID bother me, everyone's performance seemed way, way, way too restrained. There were very, very few emotional highs in the film--and even those were curiously subdued. To me, that's what's curious about this "Curious Case"---why such an excellent film pulled its emotional punches throughout the film. As a result, when it should have been exciting, it wasn't...or not nearly enough. Still, it's well worth seeing...it has some lovely romantic elements and is a sweet film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Button reminds us all that Time is Precious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most overwhelming emotion I experienced during and after this film was that we have only so much time in which to enjoy life. Unfortunately this reminder of our mortality had nothing to do with having watched a deep, insightful, thought-provoking film, but instead was because I had just sat through over 2 and a half hours of really very dull movie.I have nothing against slow films. I am not an action film junkie in any way and would rather enjoy a thoughtful experience at the cinema than some car-chase thriller with a generic plot/characters/dialogue/soundtrack. But The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a big disappointment. In fact the only curious thing about it was that it ever made it into my local picturehouse cinema.It did not strike me as a particularly original or clever concept, not that a film necessarily has to be either, but in this case at least a dose of one or the other would have made the experience more bearable. As it was I spent a good deal of the second half looking at my watch... which seemed to be going backwards. Unfortunately unlike Benjamin instead of feeling younger at the end I felt a good deal older than when I had taken my seat.So I am writing this a long time after having watched it, but having seen that somehow it rated 8/10 on IMDb I felt duty bound to add my voice of discontent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously uninvolving and rather an odd amalgamation of Forrest Gump met with slices of Magnolia's pretenses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor Jason Flemyng, who plays the father of the titular character. I discovered somewhere some years ago that he turned up on set during the shooting of 2000's Snatch. claiming to be looking for role behind the camera. Truthfully, he was there so that he could get a glimpse of mega-star Brad Pitt. He ended up being cast as Pitt's on-screen best friend, most probably after a bit of pleading with the director when he realised this'd probably only ever be the one chance he'd get at being on screen with the star Pitt ever again. Now he IS on screen with him again, but chances are he'll have wished it only ever stayed at just the one time after he sees this mess. There'll be few films as broad in scope and journeying but as coldly uninvolving as David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; a film that begins with a relatively hokey short story about one thing or another before branching out into a somewhat longer, more overplayed hokey story about one other thing or another. The cold, distant tone is set early on when an elderly woman named Daisy lies on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital, the wind and rain swirling all around her outside as Hurricane Katrina draws closer, and tells a story from decades ago involving a blind clockmaker. Daisy's daughter Caroline sits beside her, soon to be in possession of rather a large book in which thoughts and memories have been captured. But first, a short tidbit: the said clockmaker unveiled, at a major train station, a grandeur new clock he'd made; one which ticks backwards so as to pay tribute to his dead son and those whom fell in World War One, He was an individual whom partook in some eccentric deeds such as these before ending his own life in that typical manner these 'old tales' usually amble toward; in that he made a point about something dear to him and (cue falsely dramatic voice-over) "was never to be seen again". One wonders, after all this, how long the officials would've taken in replacing the clock with a proper working one which ticks in a forward motion so as not to confuse travelers. Is the opening story supposed to highlight how certain individuals cope with the deaths of people? Is the storm brewing outside representative of the underlying quote the film carries in that "you can't stop what's coming?" or "you never know what's coming"? Would the film be any different if at all the quirk in the premise were to be removed and Button was a normal guy with a normal ageing process born around about ten years prior to what he was? Maybe, probably and probably not at all.From here, we have the life of a certain Benjamin Button (Pitt) narrated to us by Daisy's daughter Caroline by way of Button's journal of ninety odd years, further still filtered by way of Daisy's own recollections and Benjamin's own presence in these various eras. The film is of the sort that you might stumble across in years to come whilst it's playing on television, the kind that usually sees people sit there and tune in about half way through by way of channel hopping because they're relatively familiar with the premise and like a good sporadic, life affirming film. You know the types, those that watch films but only pretend to actually like cinema. Benjamin is born in 1918 as The Great War comes to an end; deemed a monster by his father and after his mother dies during the birth, he's ditched on the doorstep of Queenie's (Henson) old persons home a wrinkled and ugly baby before growing up into an elderly man, despite only being alive for fifteen or so years. You see, Button ages backwards. He begins in old age and then ends up as an infant.The film preens and provides a deceptive sense of both realism and heart to it as it progresses through the decades and does its best to keep everything grounded, but Button remains in the public eye rather than in some kind of lab having tests done on him. Despite the majestic, high-brow concept; Button's life is turgid and plodding. He's boozing; sleeping with a woman for the first time; getting a job; falling in love at first sight; fighting in World War Two, suspiciously, with the neutral Irish; having an affair with a female swimmer; then the child crush has another man; then she doesn't; then something else happens ? so what? None of it makes the slightest bit of difference to any sort of narrative or progressive character study. One of the film's more cringe-inducing scenes sees an elderly lady speak directly into the camera: "We're meant to loose the one's we love, it shows how much we love them" she says, resulting in the flashing green bulb in the corner of the screen going into overtime when those that aren't paying attention need a generalisation of the crux of the thing brought to their attention.I read the film was based on a short story; one that no doubt maintained Button's gimmick in a sizable manner instead of blowing it all out of proportion like here, in which it drastically shows. The film is a flimsy chain of events, events barely connected to one another as it chugs on through the twentieth century beginning the night The First World War ended and ending somewhere in the 1990s. Nothing's really linked to anything else, there's a love story thrown in and it becomes apparent that Daisy is Benjamin's wife but that's about it ? everything else is punctuated foreplay that might lead onto something else but almost always ends up kicking on and into another random chapter in this guy's life. The case of Benjamin Button is indeed curious, the story of the man is dull and consistently flounders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've given this film 8 out of 10 which is a pretty good mark for me. However going into this film I expected more and found it quite frustrating at times. Brad Pitt plays Benjamin Button, a boy born old who as years go by gets younger and younger. It is in fact not only a simple love story but also has messages around life, death and everything in between. Benjamin Button is not an extra ordinary man like Forrest Gump (which is a similar style movie) apart from his condition he lives a normal life, and interacts with normal people. This is the whole point - we are all different and have our own paths to follow, our own wishes, desires and its never too late to change which is a great message. I'll cover the points that frustrate first: First of all one thing the whole piece misses, which I totally blame David Fincher for is: Emotion. There is none at all in a story that should be dripping with it. David Fincher is out of his depth when it comes to human emotion, in a similar vein to Kubrick - he is a very cold director (massively talented at telling a story, working with actors, finding great shots, creating memorable imagery) but when it comes to making you feel anything for the characters he just doesn't achieve. Because Benjamin is brought up in an old peoples home he is around death quite a lot, so is quite used to those he forms a bond with dying around him. So when his mother (or the lady who brings him up) dies there is no reaction - hence no reaction from the audience. Its almost like he shrugs his shoulders and we move onto the next montage of scenes. Also when his child is born - he leaves, just like that one night he just walks out leaving everything. I understand why he did it but I just didn't feel it was a particular wrench for Benjamin to go - so again I didn't feel anything. All 'great' films usually have a memorable music score that weaves amongst the imagery and can elevate the picture to another level. The score for this film was crap - no themes and more suited to a TV movie. Next...Brad Pitt - I like Brad Pitt he was awesome in Jesse James but I think he was miscast here. His performance again I didn't get any emotion it was just....bland. However, it is a great story and as I have said Fincher technically is one of the best directors around (Zodiac was brilliant but was more suited to his style). Cate Blanchett as always is a shimmering beacon of talent.I could easily fall in love with this woman. Lastly the message in the film, its an important one and I loved what it was trying to say. Movies like this can change your outlook on life but I feel this was a real missed opportunity and a shame as it could have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is way to long for how hokey the storyline is. It's about a man who was born to be an old man, though he somehow retained his infant appearance and affect. Well, that is if you ignore the arthritis and wrinkles. He had some very far-fetched unbelievable medical condition. To make matters worse at the age of about 13 he really looks 70, and he falls in love with a little girl....it's a little strange. By the time of the end of the story, she's an old woman and he is a small child. I guess you could call it star-crossed love, but I didn't find it convincing. That's just my two cents. If you think this movie looks good feel free to watch it, you might like it more than I did. It has a few redeeming qualities. The cinematography was really good. Also, Brad Pitt is actually okay in this movie. There are also some very funny quotes. But it really takes a lot more than that to make a good movie.</fullReview>

Yes, a baby starts out old and gets younger, but so what? There was barely a story to support the concept. You could tell it wasn't based on a novel because it had no substance whatsoever. It was based on a short story and they dragged it out and out and out to death. I didn't feel any emotion during this film or for any of the characters. Benjamin was so boring it was painful. This film had nothing to say. I have no idea what the clock story was about at the start and how it related to the Benjamin story. And how would the dying woman know about this story? They could have made this film without it. It seems that plenty of people like this film for some reason. Maybe I missed all the symbolism and metaphors - nonsense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Button: An Interesting Concept Slightly Flawed in its Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benjamin Button is an enjoyable film. There is humour, drama, emotion, and action. The idea of a man ageing backwards makes for an interesting film and is an original way to explore the themes of life and death. However, the theme exploration is one of the areas where the film falls flat.First off, the acting and the characters; Brad Pitt was not a good choice as the lead, in my opinion. I would probably have gone with an actor who is less of a typical Hollywood leading man: e.g. Gary Oldman. That said, he does a passable job in this role albeit seems to lack emotion at key times in the movie. Cate Blanchett was, I believe, a considerable better choice that Pitt- she out-acted him despite her character being arguably the less interesting one. The characters narrowly avoid being dull clichés and stereotypes with an extra touch of depth to each one, keeping you rooting for the protagonists. The supporting cast was excellent; no complaint there.Next; the story and the way it is presented. The story, like the characters, avoids the general clichés and pitfalls of a lot of these types of films. I felt that the story was one of the stronger points of this film- it seemed like a more believable version of Forrest Gump. One of the flaws in the storytelling, however, was the narration. It's a cheap trick to move the story along and did very little in Benjamin Button; generally, when a film has a narrator, I expect some extraordinary insight and commentary from the narrator- that didn't happen (with the exception of the favourite scene in the film involving a long chain of events, I'm not going to spoil it), and I got the feeling that the only reason the narration was in the films, was so the entire audiences follows the story (very old and overused trick).I mentioned theme exploration earlier; well, let me return to that. Benjamin Button has very strong themes, I can't deny that. They are sufficiently explored through some interesting (albeit simple) motifs: e.g. man getting hit by lightning, hummingbird etc. Despite this, I felt the themes of life and death could have been explored much more in-depth through the plot. I mean, this is a supernatural story- the makers had a lot of artistic license and could have used this to their advantage. I finished the film feeling that the point of the movie wasn't used to its fullest potential.I will end this review on a high note: the directing and overall cinematography. First, I will do what I rarely do and compliment the special effects; the make-up used on Brad Pitt was extraordinary (especially towards the end where he easily passed for 17- very subtle touch of special effects there). Second, the directing was excellent and there are several very beautiful shots in the film, so kudos to David Fincher; the directing was often enough to divert my attention from often-times bland dialogue. As a piece of film-making, Benjamin Button is unique, interesting, and simply very-well done. Hollywood hasn't made a good period-piece in years (I mean, one where I actually believe for the entire film that it takes place in that era); The Curious Case of Benjamin Button comes close (if it weren't for some unrealistic 21st century-esquire lines).Overall, I would recommend this film to anybody who doesn't mind watching something that isn't mindless action for almost three hours. It won't keep you glued to the screen the entire time, but I found that the movie had my full attention most of the time. If you liked Forrest Gump, I think you will find Benjamin Button enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story you can believe...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think anything is believable; it's all in the way the story is told. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is just such a story. And besides, we want to believe in that which touches the heart, scares us half to death or brings sidesplitting laughter. This is why we love to watch movies. It is why the best of them appear to be timeless.This film is excellent on every level. The story was handled perfectly. It is a rich and expansive tale. One might think that time is the subject here, but in truth, it is nothing more than another great love story. 'Nothing more' because it doesn't get lost in it's circumstances. The direction of David Fincher wrings every bit of energy and emotion from the cast that allows this story to thrive.Brad Pitt crafts an unforgettable performance as 'Benjamin Button'. It is perhaps, his finest work to date. He creates an even-tempered, and sophisticated man. A man who thirsts for a knowledge and understanding of a world that seems upside down, but that also has dropped great compassion on his doorstep.Taraji Henson is outstanding as the mother that recognizes beauty, the future and the hand of god in her son's disposition. Mahershalalhashbaz Ali compliments Hensen's 'Queenie' as 'Tizzy', the other man in her life. Jared Harris is 'Captain Mike' who in the proverbial split-second decision becomes Benjamin's mentor in the ways of the world.Menageries of characters pass through 'Benjamin's' world. It is they who are rambunctious and animated. They show Benjamin the aspects of life that can easily be missed, and thus bypass the great experiences that life offers. It is Benjamin who realizes that one must be brave enough to grasp these opportunities.'Benjamin Button' was a movie I had read about, seen the trailers for and was convinced I shouldn't see. I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know already. It wasn't long into the film that I knew I was wrong. With the end credits came the realization that I had just experienced an incredible story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much to say. I loved this movie with great performances by both Brat Pitt and Cate Blanchett and also Taraji P. Henson, who was great as Benjamin's 'mother'. The special effects and the make up department are great and the directing is superb, overall it is the best movie of 2008.The story is about a boy called Benjamin Button who is born as an old man and gets younger, and gets raised in a retirement home by Queenie.This movie would have deserved all the Oscars it was nominated for especially best picture, best director and best actor in a leading role, adding to the ones it won, although Slumdog Millionaire was a great movie too.The best movie of the decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story based on such a simple concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button boasts a very good storyline taking place over near a century with a simple but interesting concept: a man growing younger instead of older. It did not seem long although it lasts almost 3 hours. It did make me think of Forrest Gump, specifically how you see the characters in the historical context although Benjamin doesn't really meet famous people. Cate Blanchett in simply sublime in every possible way as the female lead. So beautiful, gracious and soulful. Brad Pitt in the title role is adequate but sometimes lacks enough emotion to truly relate to the audience.The directing is sober but very strong with several beautiful cinematographic moments (it did win the academy award for best cinematography and also for visual effects). I would have liked in general if the film had been more melodramatic because it sins by excess of moderation. I would have liked to be moved to the point of tears. The potential was there. It is possible the director David Fincher simply respected the spirit and story of the original novel but I somehow doubt the movie is that faithful. In finishing, was I the only one who was a bit disturbed by the somewhat artificial appearance of Benjamin when he was young (when he resembled an old man)? It's just my opinion and the film did win the academy award for best makeup which is deserved considering how well the aging or de-aging of the characters were done. It's worth buying unless you're allergic to Brad Pitt. Rating: 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Button up or Button down ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been films that have had their protagonists relive the defining moments of their lives on their deathbeds. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' adds a fresh clause to the aphorism that 'lives reflected upon are lives fully lived'. Would the experience be more fulfilling if relived by a person aging backwards ? David Fincher and Brad Pitt team up for the third time (Se7en, Fight Club) for this loose adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's short story. As with the earlier films, the result is nothing short of brilliant. Using the ingenious device of a recollection within a recollection to enhance the rapport the audience has with the characters, the movie traces vignettes from the lives of Daisy (Cate Blanchett) and Benjamin (Brad Pitt), two people whose lives are inter-twined in a manner that has them in nearly every conceivable facet of love. It helps then that this is a pair that genuinely understand each other as actors and that their previous outing - Babel, featured a harrowing journey for the couple that eventually strengthened their bond. Their screen vibes form the crux of the film. Through them, the film examines a number of themes ranging from the human obsession with physical appearances to the idea that some bonds defy the most long-standing establishments. In that regard, the casting of Pitt and Blanchett with their matchless lines and physical grace makes perfect sense. Pitt, in particular, leaves no doubt as to why it has to be him as Benjamin and nobody else. With a deserved Oscar nod, his no-hassles acceptance of his peculiar condition is the highlight of the film. That it holds its own amidst the fantastic work by the make-up department is testimony to the performance.Giving them great company are Taraji Henson as Queenie, Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abbott and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. Many performances, short albeit, deserve a mention but these are the three that stick with you. Straddling the performances is technical wizardry of a kind and degree that doesn't come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with Fincher's style. So much so that some of his fervent critics have pointed out that this aspect of his films often takes priority over the human concerns that the script raises. His work here is a triumphant no. There is style but it never glosses over substance. If anything, the former accentuates the latter, be it the montage demonstrating the purpose of the 'anticlockwise' clock, the sepia drenched visuals or the narrative technique for the Paris segment.The sheer variety of visuals lingers long after the viewing. Theodore Roosevelt ("I wish I had had a war to fight during my presidency") taking his hat off at the stated purpose of the 'anticlockwise' clock, Daisy's ballet performance in New York, the U-boat sequence, the Hummingbird fluttering on the hospital window. Ultimately, it's the fact that a film that could so easily have become what the title suggests, merely a curious case, instead goes on to strike a chord with audiences. That is its biggest triumph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With 13 Oscar nominations and three wins, and almost as many BAFTA nominations and wins, there is no doubt that this is one of the best films of last year.First off the makeup and visual effects and sets and cinematography and sound were all superb as one would expect of a film of this caliber.The acting? Well, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, and Tilda Swinton were all absolutely amazing. Yes, there was a huge cast of supporting characters, both playing the above at different ages, and there were others interacting. They all made this a most enjoyable experience.It was Eric Roth's screenplay and David Fincher's direction that pulled it all together into one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen. The lines in the film were some of the most thought provoking imaginable.What a beautiful love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best narration based film I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies which would make you laugh. There are movies which would make you cry. There are also movies, which would inspire, there are some which would raise your hidden romanticism for a while. But there are certain movies, which, however hard one tries to qualify, would feel that the effort keeps falling short of what it deserves and makes you feel that if you hadn't watched it, your life would be a failure. I had a few such movies in my personal and recommended list, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Crash and others. After watching this movie, I had no doubt that the list is going to be increased by a unit.One of the key strong points, I felt about this movie, is the way it has been narrated. Shawshank Redemption was one such movie, which had produced such brilliant narration skills. Certain events were shown in the film, and along with that via narration analogies were drawn and often conclusions were derived, an add-on feature that enriched those particular sequence of events and makes you remember them for a long time. This combination of scene and narration was observed on several occasions in the course of the movie. One such occasion was the description of the accident of Daisy Williams ( Cate Blanchett) which describes a full sequence of events leading to the outcome. Another was the narration that followed when Benjamin carried his dying father to the porch to see the the rising sun. I feel that after this film, Brad Pitt has joined the group of elite actor narrators of the Hollywood industry which includes Morgan Freeman, Robin Williams and Tom Hanks.A very unique aspect of the film is that, it moves along according to a description as provided in a diary written by one person, but often that is intersected by a few comments or description of another person who is an important subject of the description provided by the first. While Daisy was being read to by her daughter, the event in which Benjamin had come all the way to France to meet her in hospital, Daisy throws her own comments saying that she was very rude to him; the scene continues where her daughter reads from the diary that Benjamin didn't immediately fly back, but used to visit the hospital without informing Daisy, hearing which Daisy said that she didn't know that fact. So, as it could be seen, Daisy, an important subject of the contents of the diary, adds values to the main theme of the movie by providing certain information not present in the diary, simultaneously realizing certain facts she didn't quite know earlier.The movie begins with a short event description by Daisy, about a clock, that was made by a person, a clock where the time moves backwards. This becomes the central theme of the entire movie. The movie ends showing how one fine day, that clock got replaced signifying that the story about the subject who was born old and died young has finally come to an end. The powerful and unique script of this movie, the very concept of age decreasing with time is of its own an enigmatic one. One of the many reasons, a film is liked by the audience is that they wish to see something new out of it, something that is quite unique, intriguing, something they have never seen before and keeps them riveted to the seat. The movie with its core concept of age reversal with time provides the audience with that exact recipe, it's taste enhanced with the spice of brilliant narration, dialogs and a better as usual performance by two most talented actors in Hollywood. One point however, in the movie, which might steal a few points from its credit is the pace or movement of its event sequences. At times it did appear that the movie is actually going slow, and that it's duration should have been lesser by 20-25 mins. Also the effect of the storm, didn't actually add to any significance of any kind and was something vestigial.I would suggest people watch this movie at least twice in order to extract the complete effect it has to offer. Such films happen after long time, and eventually does turn into a classic because it touches the human heart, goes deep inside it and brings out the emotions thereby making the audience feel for it, remember it and make them think that in a busy life, a two hour forty min was not wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Hurricane Katrina looms in 2005 New Orleans, an elderly woman (Cate Blanchett in very heavy makeup) in a hospital thinks back to the titled character (Brad Pitt), a man who actually lived life physically in reverse from an elderly gentleman backwards to a newborn via her adult daughter (Julia Ormond) reading from an old journal. As Button is born under very strange circumstances and taken in by an African-American caregiver (Taraji P. Henson) in 1918, he sees history unfold before his eyes through the greater portion of the 20th Century and ends up becoming an extraordinary person who leads a somewhat normal existence. Pitt's performance is the stuff legends are made of cinematically speaking. He is so good that most everyone else (except for supporter Henson) somewhat gets lost in the shuffle. Blanchett and female co-star Tilda Swinton (who ends up having a substantial role for a short period of the nearly three-hour running time) seem a bit lost and out-of-place, however. With that said, director David Fincher has still crafted an amazing production which benefits greatly from its adapted screenplay (from a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and adapted by co-screenwriter Eric Roth), cinematography, soundtrack, editing, and subtle visual/makeup effects. Pitt is the revelation which helps to overcome the film's shortcomings and make it a memorable and highly emotional experience at the movies. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very engaging movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about the movie, I was not interested in watching it at the first place, the plot of it seemed awkward and the trailer looked boring. Friday night is not the time for such slow paced drama. But I couldn't get hold of anything better and started watching this movie as the last resort.After first few minutes of the movie a thing struck me about it. The very idea of the movie is enough to engage the audience to linger on(I was wrong about the 'awkward' story), I became so curious that, I didn't care about the plot any longer. Just see how the director possibly can make it believable for viewers to see a man growing younger against time...I would say it is a very well made movie, it was so natural to see an old person grow, slowly into a young man. I stated liking this old guy, he was simple, friendly and lovable.The initial relationship between two kids, looks strange, the guy is an old man and the girl is a 7 year old kid. But if you can remind yourself of Button's real age and try to imagine how he feels, it won't look bizarre to you. Thats the secret, if you can look beyond what is seen, try to think the way Benjamin would think, nothing actually looks stupid to you.As long as this guy kept on becoming better and better, I happily believed in the story, but the later part when this guy starts shrinking into a boy was really too much for me. That was the sad part and somewhat difficult to believe (physically, it more natural to grow tall than to shrink!). You would already have seen him as an old kid and now to see the old him become a kid, have amnesia is too depressing.The way this story is told to his daughter, though not new (death bed story full of secrets) is also quite alright. The performances are very good, Cate Blanchett as usual shines. Overall, I would say, give it a try, it a good movie, despite giving you pain in the end, worth watching for curiosity! ciao, Pallavi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a treat to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching this movie yesterday. Going into the theater what I had mostly heard from people was that it was one of those movies that induce deep slumber. I had a couple of beers down and it was a late night show, I have a reputation of falling asleep at late night shows so you can do the math on what I was expecting to happen. Here's the thing though. I enjoyed the movie. It was beautifully shot and acted in with restraint and intelligence. At about 3 hours,it is a tad too long but then how can you do justice to an epic saga in less time? Adapted from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this is the story of a man who was 'born under unusual circumstances'. There is wit,humor and an element of mystique in the movie that makes it a treat to watch. Watch out for the vignette involving a man who claims to have been struck by lightening seven times in his lifetime. It drew the maximum laughter in the theater. I think the movie deserved the nominations it received and should probably have snagged at least some of the major categories. Go watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands out for Artwork, concept and Brad Pitt&#x2019;s effort!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not all stories flow the same way! This is one curious case where we see the life of the protagonist move backwards. It isn&#x2019;t really an uncommon feeling for many of us that we don&#x2019;t really want to age quicker. Also, it is sometimes funny to wonder what the world would feel like if we started growing younger! Believe me, after watching this Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Julia Ormond starrer, you&#x2019;d feel better off living life the normal way.Born an octogenarian geriatric but the size of a baby, little Benjamin is abandoned to the care of an old age home. Unbeknownst to why he looks that way, the growing geriatric thinks that he is one among them, but has the curiosity of a child. Curiously though, as time passes, he doesn&#x2019;t die as people expect him to but starts getting fitter and younger. The Oscar winning make up guys ensure that Brad Pitt unfolds on screen in a slow flow.Romance too starts there when the blue eyed grand daughter of an old woman arrives to live there. The little girl, played by Dakota Fanning&#x2019;s sister too seems to recognize that Benjamin is mentally her age. Soon, a teen&#x2019;s mind and a fitter body takes him places as a member of a tugboat crew where he experiments wine and women, courtesy his Captain. By World War II, he has lived through war and has had his first love in Russia.Returning home, he finds Daisy grown up into Cate Blanchett, a ballet dancer, already in love with another man. Years later and an accident wise, she finds the two to be of the same age; romance blossoms, they live together and have a child. Benjamin realizes that his age trend would make him a playmate to his daughter than a father; he gives up his material wealth, including the old Button wealth for the two and goes globe trotting.Top class art direction, make up and visual effects make the nearly three hour movie a work of art coming live in a believable way but with a touch of fantasy. Spending five hours on make up each day, Brad Pitt fit into his role seamlessly. His acting and his looks during the younger stint deserve a &#x2018;wow&#x2019;. Cate Blanchett&#x2019;s act is as impressive as ever. Others like Tilda Swinton and Oscar nominated Taraji Henson stand out too! Well, if the movie is so well made, then why not more points? That&#x2019;s simply because stories just go on through time on screen and lack the zing somewhere. This reminds me of &#x2018;Bicentennial Man&#x2019; that had the accomplished actor Robin Williams playing a robot working its way towards becoming human that also has a similar flow. Putting this aside, I would still safely recommend this movie for its story creativity and visual appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed yet technically brilliant achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked out of the theater after seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I really had no idea how to describe it. On one hand, it is a technical masterpiece with jaw-dropping visual effects and perhaps some of the most realistic makeup in any movie I've ever seen. The process of seeing Benjamin Button (played with brilliant subtlety by Brad Pitt) and his lifelong love, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) grow younger and older, respectively, marks an astonishing revolution in the technology of the movie-making industry. There is not a single scene or moment that does not look just spectacular. Unfortunately, the visuals were so great that the story itself did not quite rise to the challenge.The screenplay, written by Eric Roth and based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has striking similarities to Forrest Gump, which was also written by Roth. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly contains plenty of clever, original dialogue and touching scenes, but it's impossible to miss the connections to the 1994 Best Picture winner. Of course, there are many similar elements between the two movies (both show the aging and growth of a man who is, in some way, a bit of an outcast; they tell important messages about life and death while channeling several different eras in recent history), but the quality and tone of the film itself is different enough to make it feel unique. While Forrest Gump focused mostly on the intricacies of the characters and plot, Button puts more emphasis on the overall themes and morals of the story. In fact, the main flaw in the screenplay is not its similarities to Forrest Gump, but in its structure. Like Gump, the central story is told in a sort of flashback form and frequently returns to the present. While these scenes do occasionally help with the story and emotion, many of them, particularly at the beginning, feel unnecessary and interrupt with the flow of the story. If the script had stayed more focused on the actual plot, the emotion might have been stronger and, perhaps, it would've been easier to truly get to know and connect with the main characters.Aside from the visuals, Benjamin Button does exceed in other ways. As mentioned before, Brad Pitt gives a terrific yet subtle performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy straight while bringing out the more troubled side of her character. The result is an interesting dynamic between the two actors and a convincing romance that never strays into formulaic or too-familiar territory. For me, many of the movie's best scenes were the ones showing their relationship and how it grows and changes over time as the two characters head in completely different directions only to inevitably meet up again. The supporting cast is solid with noteworthy performances from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother and Tilda Swinton, who plays a married woman with whom he has a brief affair, but the movie never really delves into the finer details of their characters, so that they never feel quite as deep or real as they could have. Even Benjamin Button and Daisy have an almost enigmatic aura about them and, even with the voice-over narration, we never truly get into their heads and find out exactly what they're thinking.One other thing worth mentioning is David Fincher's direction. This is his first PG-13 rated movie and, being someone with films like Fight Club, Zodiac and Se7en on his resume, he is venturing into unknown territory. However, he seems confident with the material and he lends the film a unique tone that is alternately fantastical and somber. He manages to display the groundbreaking visual effects without ever making them distracting or overly showy. Even the makeup and CGI used to age Brad Pitt 80 years over the course of the film never say 'Here! Look at me!' We automatically recognize how revolutionary they are and they blend in perfectly with the film. Also, he has a way of making the quieter scenes both intimate and strangely detached at the same time. As viewers, we feel as though were merely observing the characters and we don't necessarily feel entirely absorbed in their world, but, partly because of the talented cast, we come to care about what happens to Benjamin and Daisy.The film concentrates heavily on themes of mortality and living every moment of life to its fullest. While it occasionally comes on a bit too strong, it is really a moving message and it is delivered powerfully, making viewers start to reflect on their own life and achievements. It teaches us to cherish every moment, every opportunity and person that comes by because we never know when they might be gone. "Life is a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." And if Benjamin Button had anything to add to Forrest Gump's now iconic saying, it would be this: You should treasure every individual piece in that box, because before you know it, that box will be empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic case of IMDb-hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so it's the big movie of this Oscar-year. But is it justifiably as good as the mountain of nominations should imply?I don't think so. Granted, the storyline is good and the movie makes you feel for the characters that are involved. But the material on hand is not that of an instant classic, straight into the top half of the IMDb top250 list. Maybe the general consensus of 8/10+ ratings on this movie is linked to the hype connected to the Oscars. Even if the movie looks great and holds its own against other films, the story just isn't THAT good. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie a lot and enjoyed watching it, but I don't believe that it warrants 13 nominations. Rant over.The acting is thoroughly enjoyable. Cate Blanchet gives 'Daisy' a real zest for life and makes her instantly likable. Her recent form as an actress really underlines the feeling that we are experiencing a class act. Move over Meryl Streep! As for Brad Pitt?Other reviews have highlighted that he has no expression in his face, or rather just the one. However, he plays Benjamin with a certain innocence that suits him well, "the charming do-gooder". Button as the main protagonist is a success, but I wish that the experiences he gains and the moral of the story could have been a bit more diverse. Jason Flemyng, Jared Harris and Tilda Swinton also deliver solid supporting roles that add much to the movies appeal. Cudos to them.Not as Wow(!) as Gran Torino, Milk or Slumdog Millionaire, but a solid and enjoyable movie. Go see it, just make up your mind in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I would've given B.B. more stars if it wasn't directed by David Fincher. But, being a big fan of his, I have to say that I thought this movie was not up to his level. OK, there is the wicked element in the story that he usually likes, but this is nothing compared to stories of Se7en, Fight Club and Game. OK, knowing that the script is a more conventional one (except for the wicked element), you cannot expect much more. But it's still Fincher... I guess the point is that, knowing the tag-line, you pretty much know the whole plot. There aren't too many surprises, exciting or weird deviations from the main storyline, etc. There was only one detail that I loved, but I promised that I would not reveal any spoilers. All the other elements in the movie are done well, no question about that, but the film lacks that little something that Fincher got us used to. This way, it's just another love story of the year, with a quirky element, but nevertheless an easily forgettable one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How's it going to end? That's the question you can't help asking yourself, despite the fact that the film starts with an end, at a hospital bedside. Like all great love stories, The Curious Case... wraps the central couple in a the most inevitable of tragedies, which takes on extra poignancy by the palindromic nature of the individual's histories.This is a good film but, overlong, overwrought and over-stated, it is not Fincher's greatest achievement. The tacked-on background of hurricane Katrina approaching might be emotionally attuned but it's clumsy. A central sequence in Paris and a clock-as-Dorian-Gray's-Picture should have been consigned to the cutting-room floor. There is clutter.However, I was entirely convinced by the love affair of the central couple, Brad Pitt's eponymous Benjamin and Cate Blanchett's Daisy, both in fascinating make-up. It's also an awesomely photographed film - it's hard to imagine one in which Brad Pitt will look more desirable on screen. It's a peculiarity of this film that Benjamin is more of a spectator than a participant (not least as his story is told in voice-over as narration-after-the-fact) and consequently his acting can be a little inhibited. Cate Balchett however is utterly captivating: whilst the entertaining Taraji P. Henson as Queenie is a reasonable Oscar nominee, Blanchett, thought studied, is reason alone to watch the film.A 21st century Lovestory 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It certainly is a curious case. David Fincher, known for putting killers and nihilistic terrorists centre-stage, brings us an Oscar-baiting, love epic. Centring on Benjamin Button, a lovable character who finds himself born into a body that ages backwards, the film travels the globe, spans decades and takes into a wide range of characters and emotions as it explores exactly what it is to be human.Brad Pitt, well-hidden CG and top-class prosthetics combine to form Button, a man always struggling to fit in. Not much is asked of Pitt's acting ability. All he really needs to do is maintain an air of loneliness and look solemnly into the middle distance from time to time. It is his interactions, even the most minor ones, which really do the work, from his love for Cate Blanchett's Daisy, to his relationships with the crew of the tugboat 'Chelsea' on which he works and his feelings for his family, both adopted and biological. It is these small relations that do the real work, connecting with the audience and maintaining a pull on their emotions at all times.These background characters, each intended to be quirky and memorable, too often slip into cliché. For every irreverent old man at the retirement home, there is an Irish sailor straight out the book of Irish sailors. Enjoyable characters yes, but an extra dimension to their personality is expected.The film immerses itself in quirky detail, which despite being largely unnecessary to the plot, are rarely a distraction. In one scene, Fincher creates a whirling ode to chaos theory, climaxing in a major plot event. Most films would simply show the event itself, after all, that is all that's integral to the plot, but seeing the way that tiny occurrences come together to create a significant moment makes it feel neither forced nor unimportant, despite its irrelevance.But amongst these asides and whimsical distractions, what really is the main point of this film? It is a billed as a film about life, in its entirety, with no emotion or experience left unchecked. The truth is, it is really about old age, or at least the facade of old age. It concerns itself far more regularly with how Button deals with being a young person in an old body than the other way around. Button's later life is shown mostly in montages, and his feelings about being old but appearing young are never really addressed properly.The centrepiece of the plot, although not the entirety of it, concerns itself with the love between Daisy and Benjamin, but there is too much going on to call it a love story. It is designed to portray human emotion on a grand scale, which sometimes tends towards the pretentious, but more often than not leaves a sincere mark on the audience.Despite the length it is never tedious, and the bevy of interesting characters makes up for the films faults. Curious Case will delight and entertain audiences more for the intriguing and memorable asides than for the core of the film, but it is nevertheless a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of a boy aging backwards is as simple as genius. We are brought up saying that it is the aging that is the pain: so is growing. We also are taught that it is primarily the aging of the body we need to cope with as we grow old: this movie proves us wrong. Growing up mentally can be as hard as growing up physically. And growing "young" is apparently tied to as many consequences and sacrifices as growing old. The movie IS long, and more than once it becomes a problem as the scenes borderline on boredom. What gets you through, however, is the curiosity about the ending, which is not disappointing by any means. There are so many good movies out there and out of all the Oscar nominees this one would be my #2, right after Doubt, which I found far more captivating. The acting is great and that's obviously no surprise. Pitt gives a very good performance, but it's Blanchett who steals the moments with her mastered skills and stoic beauty. Even the smaller parts do not disappoint. Altogether it is a movie worth watching, as long as you're prepared and willing to lose interest in the story once or twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Story and Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewers here either love it or hate it. Well, I cannot say that I loved it. I certainly did not hate it, but I liked it a great deal. I found it a superior story with equally superior acting from all involved. The makeup was extraordinary. The tale of a man who goes from old to young rather than from young to old. Really no difference, or is there. I thought Brad Pitt did a fabulous job in the role, and I was really into the story or plot. I do have one thing I thought was rather unnecessary---that was the whole sequence of how things went amiss so as to cause the car to hit Daisy--that whole thing how one was late, one had a fight with a boyfriend, a shoe lace broke----all that, I felt, was unnecessary. Just show her getting hit by a car; that whole sequencing thing should have been cut. In any case, I enjoyed this movie, found it entertaining to watch and behold. The acting was excellent and a fabulous story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie,not only because i'm a fan of Brad Pitt but because i thought the story is great.I can't really say that i was disappointed by the movie but i expected it to be a little bit better.At least the ending.Ending ruined the whole movie for me.It was really an excellent movie until the end.The ending is really far too long and far too stupid.I mean,OK i get it.The entire movie is about how he goes younger and all but i expected an ending to be a little bit more surprising and shorter or sudden.I don't know,perhaps i'm wrong but i think that they should of killed Benjamin when he was looking like he was twenty or something because it's just stupid that someone disappears.At my opinion he was supposed to die in an accident or anything but naturally.That is if you can call the way he died naturally.And if they would of killed him while he was looking like twenty the movie would definitely be more memorable.Everyone would be asking their selves what would of happened if he didn't get killed in that accident or whatever.And it would give a bit more mystic in the movie.Anyway the movie is very well directed and acted and the story is great.But i just can't explain how much i think that movie would be better with the different ending.If the ending was different i would give it ten but like this i give it eight.Watch it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take away the gimmick and what's left?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography is top-notch, and Cate Blanchett is luminous as only she can be -- which might eventually become boring if it were all she could do, but of course she can do much more. The narrative is initially absorbing, but as it unfolds what emerges is a soppy, sentimental, feelgood yarn with not much of a point to it -- make that no point at all. I enjoy fantasy, but it should compel belief, not disbelief, and details count. The notion that an American tugboat could have been working in Murmansk prior to the involvement of the US and the USSR in the Second World War (or even during the war) defies belief, and so does the fact that the hero survives his boat's ramming of a U-boat with his spectacles intact. But is anything better to be expected from the writer of Forrest Gump? Brad Pitt turns in his usual wooden performance, though to be fair the role is so insipid that his casting may in this instance be ideal. I gave the film 5 stars, but I'm regretting my generosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The curious career of David Fincher...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He must be selling out" lots of people thought upon hearing David Fincher, one of cinema's great masters of darkness (he directed Se7en and all that), had accepted to direct a Forrest Gump-like epic love story, based on the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, that had been considered by Ron Howard and - wait for it - Steven Spielberg. Surely he must be out of his mind? Of course not. After all, he was accused of repeating himself when word hit the streets he was making Zodiac, and that turned out to be a completely different opus.Using Hurricane Katrina as a framing device (typical Fincher boldness), the film opens in a New Orleans hospital where an old woman named Daisy is spending her final moments with her daughter (Julia Ormond). At her mother's request, the latter agrees to read a journal written by Daisy's great love, while the hospital staff around them is busy organizing evacuations. The journal begins like this: "My name is Benjamin Button, and I was born under unusual circumstances...".The story shifts to 1918: the first World War is over, and a blind clockmaker (Elias Koteas) celebrates by building a clock that goes backwards, saying it embodies his wish of things going differently. The man disappears and is never heard from again, and in another part of town Mr. Button (Jason Flemyng) is shocked when he loses his wife in childbirth and the baby is revealed to be horribly deformed. He abandons the child outside a retirement home, a most fitting choice since medical examination reveals the little boy was born with all the characteristics of an 80-year old man. Years pass, and Benjamin (Brad Pitt), as he's called by his adoptive mother (Taraji P. Henson) discovers he isn't very normal: while everyone else around him has a tendency to die of old age, he gets younger. As time goes by, he travels around the world and keeps running into Daisy (Cate Blanchett), who was his "childhood" sweetheart. Their relationship is inevitably complicated because of Benjamin's reversed aging, and as his life reaches its paradoxical epilogue he comes to realize that nothing ever lasts.Yes, the line about things never lasting does remind of Forrest Gump's speech about chocolate, and given Eric Roth wrote both movies and Pitt's Southern accent is reminiscent of Tom Hanks' Gump tunes (especially during the narration), it's far too easy to label The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as just another shameless Oscar bait (that Zemeckis triumphed over The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction is still a sour memory). But there's a lot more to the film's credit than meets the eye: firstly, the story is a much more epic deal, with additional kudos coming from the literary source, and a smart, thoughtful reflection on mortality and doomed love (so there is some darkness, after all); secondly, Benjamin is a more complex and intriguing character than Forrest, and Brad Pitt's understated performance enriches him even more (and Blanchett is, as always, extraordinary).Furthermore, the film allows Fincher to explore one of his favorite themes, featured prominently in Fight Club: film as a medium, an artificial product. Not only does he enjoy recreating pieces of cinema at its earliest stages (the flashbacks from circa 1900 are shot as if those scenes had been filmed in that very period) and toying with the on-screen notion of time (the backwards war sequence, which plays out as a reversal of the most technically impressive part of Zodiac); there's even a hint of deliberate irony in the casting of Elle Fanning (Pitt and Blanchett's daughter in Babel) as Daisy aged seven (and that's without mentioning Pitt's opportunity to relive his Thelma and Louise years, thanks to a remarkable mix of make-up and CGI).So yes, it's the kind of film the Academy tends to notice, but that might just be their way of apologizing for overlooking Fight Club (and Zodiac). And yes, there's a love story, but one that goes hand in hand with a not-so-cheerful theme like death. And yes, it may be the director's most mainstream project to date (complete with PG-13 rating), but rumor has it he argued with Warner Bros. over the running time (166 minutes) and fought to keep his vision intact. Now, who said he is selling out? 9,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)Top 10 - 2008The film is based on the 1921 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgeral. David Fincher's film is about a man born with the characteristics of an 80 year old, apart from mental agility, and ages backwards, until he once again diminishes into the physical form of a child, while he suffers from dementia.Benjamin Button was born on Armistice Day 1918 in New Orleans, Louisiana as a deformed child - his mother died in childbirth and his father horrified by the monstrosity of the newborn takes it away and drops it at the doorsteps of a elderly people's home, where Queenie(Taraji P. Henson), an African-American worker at the house raises the child and calls his 'Benjamin'. The New Orleans residence plays a key part in the film, with so many lives passing in and out. That is also where Benjamin meets Daisy and it becomes the central love affair of the film between their older counterparts (Pitt and Blanchett). Benjamin and Daisy have a very similar fade in and fade out relationship as Forrest Gump and Jenny, a film with many parallels to Button. No surprise since both were written by Eric Roth, who won an Academy Award for his great translation of Forrest Gump onto the screen.The film begins with Daisy (Blanchett) in her hospital bed, ready to die in New Orleans, right before Hurricane Katrina hit, where her middle aged daughter reads her a thick diary, which centres around the life of Benjamin Button and her existence in his life. The structure of the film is successful and while there are a few flaws resulting from perhaps one or two overextended scenes, the 166 minute film is still probably a masterpiece.While many have called 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' a well made film, with no real point, one critic unjustifiably calling it a 'dumbed down Forrest Gump', I disagree. The film itself is a testament to great film-making and David Fincher firstly must receive praise for constructing such a difficult film with great detail, dark tones and appropriate artistic flair. Furthermore, while the film can be labelled as a fantasy, it still a poetic journey about life, love, the process of ageing and humanity, and how as the film's tagline states (and the film itself shows) that life is measured in moments not minutes. Particularly, the last 45 minutes of the film are emotionally intense and somewhat haunting. Lastly the film passes one great obstacle that many other films fail to encompass - it is a big budget, main stream film, but also a quality motion picture.A fine film8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things last, as the film proves testament to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when it increasingly appears the wells of Hollywood's creativity have dried up, continually resorting to reworking tired cinematic and narrative clichés, films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button emerge to unexpectedly rekindle faith in the industry. Intriguing enough by its mere storyline core (a man is born a senior citizen, and 'ages' backwards throughout his life), what could have resulted in an overly gimmicky excuse for a melodrama is seemingly effortlessly transformed by the delicate directorial touch of David Fincher into something far less contentious and volumes more poignant and lyrical. A haunting, resonant exploration of time, life, death and the transition from one to the other, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button miraculously manages to be sombre and emotionally draining without once becoming excessively dour, with sublime bits of charm, humour and hope peppering the profundity and making it a true cinematic experience for the ages.To call The Curious Case of Benjamin Button close to a contemporary masterpiece would hardly be overstating things, and yet such praise feels out of place, not because the film is not deserving of it (far from it) but that it makes no claims as to aiming for such heights - were it not for the enormous budget and stars, the film could easily have been a small, independent production. Few films prove so enormously ambitious and yet ultimately unassuming, with such vast scopes, and yet such simple aims all things considered, and Fincher toes the line between the grand and the intimate with remarkable precision. Moreover, it is interesting to see perennial cynic Fincher tap into such unbridled emotional resonance (the film is unlikely to leave a single dry eye in the house), and yet such moments are pure sentiment trimmed of all sap and Hollywood tear-jerking cliché, making them all the more gently genuine and lasting. If his past films such as Fight Club and Seven appeared to be expunging hidden depths of suppressed rage and bitterness, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button appears an attempt to tap into more tender feelings, and the result is in no way less magnificent. While on very first impression the film might be sized up as overlong, rambling and full of extraneous subplots, over time it becomes increasingly clear the film's intent is not merely to tell the story of Button, but, to the best of Fincher's considerable ability, to live alongside him, complete with all the highs, lows, and little bits in between. This not only provides incredible empathy and pathos for Button's unconventional situation, but allows the story through the character to extrapolate and explore deeper existential themes, reflecting upon the notions of time and its fleeting potential, the overlap of life and death and the importance of living life to the fullest regardless of adversity. While it can be argued that despite this the script still has the occasional clunky bit of exposition, with storytelling so operatic yet paradoxically quiet and unassuming, such concerns only register as rare minute breaches in the film's incredible quality. Fincher's flair for stunning visuals also carries through in fully force, from the luscious period costuming and sets to the bold visual contrast between the exhilarating (a tense second world war sea battle) to the amusing (boyhood/elderly man Benjamin discovering alcohol) to the heartbreakingly dramatic (Benjamin's quietly horrified meeting with his father) and the seamless flow between them. Alexandre Desplat's luminous musical score and Claudio Miranda's grandiose cinematography ably reinforce the lyrical content. This all, of course goes without even mentioning the film's most central hook, the visual effects and prosthetic 'reverse aging' effects. At first startlingly convincing, the greatest testament to the incredible visual talent on display is how near immediately the viewer forgets about it, remaining so engrossed in Button's bizarre story to extract one's self from the narrative enough to properly appraise the incredible work put into it - a sign, if any, of masterful film-making. As the titular Button, Brad Pitt is simply a marvel, delivering a performance which is quiet, ego-less, unshowy and all the more supremely effective and credible for it, perfectly convincing no matter what age or contrasting physical appearance. Infusing unassuming heart and unspoken pathos into a character stoically resigned to 'unusual' circumstances rather than milking them for all their emotional worth, Pitt's Benjamin Button becomes an unforgettable underdog for the ages, all the more effective from Pitt's continual refusal to adhere to cliché or Hollywood showboating. Cate Blanchett proves just as marvellous, also essaying a character over the course of over 70 years of her life and proving completely convincing and heartwarming every step of the way while delivering a tremendously emotional performance with the utmost precision and grounded care. Rather than delivering a typical female romantic lead type, Blanchett's Daisy is a fleshed out, enormously credible human being, making her romantic struggle with Button all the more achingly affecting. Supporting the lead duo and their simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking relationship, Taraji P. Henson gives an enormously powerful yet understated performance as Button's surrogate orphanage mother, and Jason Flemyng proves a perfect combination of quirky and hauntingly credible as Button's estranged father. Finally, Tilda Swinton delivers a performance layered with emotional volumes and nuance as a fleeting romantic interest of Button's, managing to both capture the audience's heart and contempt simultaneously. Despite demanding nearly three hours of the viewer's life, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button makes every last second more than worth it, its power and incredibly uniform quality made all the more appealing by its lack of pretension and vehement avoidance of cliché. While the story or length may not appeal to every last audience member, it is all the more of a shame, as such unanticipated cinematic mastery deserves to be enjoyed and reflected upon by as many as possible. -9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My opinion is that this is an excellent movie, because it is so different: in it's story line, in it's concept and in making you think. It doesn't follow the regular predictable chronological outcome.you cannot anticipate how BB will react in every event that accrues in his life: according to his physical or mental abilities, and what are those at this point? The love story is beautiful, in it's way that you need to fill blanks by yourself. It is told for you to interpret, anyway you want. the acting is very good especially by Brad Pitt and Taraji P.Henson (I found Cate Blanchett - whom I admire- too bombastic here). The movie was purely enchanting and beautiful,- in my eyes;the humor was great; and I was surprised that the movie is actually long. I thought,afterwords, about the fact that our life just passes so fast, and it leaves you at the end - if you die "naturally" from old age-helpless as an... ugly baby. Benjamin Button was born as a monstrous baby, abandoned by his grieving father, but he died as a gorgeous baby in the arms of the woman he loved, who during his life was his friend; his lover; his mother. So, was he lucky? It depends on how you accept life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Times irreversible gift of splendour and magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cinema does not come as epic as this new David Fincher two hour and fifty-one minute masterpiece. Not since the days of Kubrick's Spartacus (1960), Wyler's Ben-Hur (1959) and Kusturica's vision of the break-up of Yugoslavia that is Underground (1995) these full length features are truly magnificent in their own right and with a production value second to none it is the stuff of magic and extravaganza that Cinema has come to expect.Growing foreword but aging backward, it is the tale of a man whose growing process is seen in reverse. This feature starts with a poignant prologue to express the uses of time, and what if time can run backward to replenish lost chances and to right wrongs that would, in time, hold no regrets, taking back what might have been lost, second chances and first opportunities. The regret of the tugboat captain never becoming the artist he wanted to be and the first female swimmer to have never succeeded in finishing crossing the English Channel are victims of life's regret and who cannot take away the fact that time is ever marching forward with chances lost, or are they? We see this theory within the first moments of the film, as the blind clock builder builds his clock that ticks backward so life can learn to run its course with no regret. It is time itself that is the redeeming factor that centres around Benjamin Button living and at the same time dying in reverse and the people that he comes across in his life. Francis Scott Fitzgerald's (1896 ? 1940) 1921 short story has been given its contemporary feel by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord, who has taken Fitzgerald's concept and made it their own, the charming vision here is only propelled by its visual intake of soft tones and tranquil dexterity of Claudio Miranda's eye. It all makes for a visceral experience that throughout his life the sombre mood takes relevance over the computer-generated imagery and detracts not in the slightest to the narrative. We see the changes in the man and we see the changes in his environments and the people that grow alongside him. Where the crossroads of life meet, we too see the simple tale of Benjamin and Daisy, and it is a simple tale, any tale that life can tell, but it is the execution in the telling that holds the attention. Of course, like its older siblings, it is pure cinematic mush and this is no bad feet of engineering, which uses its modern technology to place The Curious Case of Benjamin Button at the height of Cinema excellence. Going for the ultimate, yet inevitable, conclusion, as with its peers, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, throughout his life, grows on you and never looks back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie but far away from the excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally start watching very long movies with distrust,because various of them try to betray us,making their story unnecessarily longer than what it should be to cover fails from the screenplay or the simple fact that they do not know what to say.On the other hand,there are long movies we wish they would never end,because every second makes the previous one richer and the characters become on something like old friends from the spectator.I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is on some intermediate point.This is a good movie,I do not deny it,but it is far away from the excellence and,although I liked it,it has various fails.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tried to be a version of Forrest Gump for 2008.The main characters of both movies see the world from a different sensibility and they also have a physical condition which makes them different to the people they interact with.And what The Curious Case of Benjamin Button also shares with Forrest Gump is the very good manufacture.On this movie,director David Fincher shows a deep attention to the details, and the special effects are excellent,not only because they are perfectly done,but also because they work as a support for telling the story.I also appreciated on this movie that the narration from the voice of the main character results likable and appropriately subtle.But,at the difference of Forrest Gump,the main character results too bland.I mean,there is nothing which makes us emotionally connect to him.I think that the screenplay failed in constructing a deep character.Besides,this movie occasionally falls on cheap sentimentalism which was unnecessary.The consequence is that that moments do not feel honest...they feel forced.And there are various parts on this movie which felt irrelevant.On that parts,it seemed the film was going nowhere.I think the best element from this movie are the performances.Brad Pitt made a good work but I think the best performances are on the supporting cast.I usually like the work of actress Cate Blanchett very much and she did an excellent work in here.But I think the member of the cast who mostly stands out is Tilda Swinton.She completely becomes on her character and she could perfectly transmit all her emotions.Taraji P. Henson (who had left me astonished with her performance on Hustle and Flow),Jared Harris and Julia Ormond also bring solid works.I did not totally understand the main point from this movie...is it a romance?,is it a magic fable?,or is it simply a collection of vignettes without too much meaning,made with the only porpoise of winning Oscars?.I honestly do not know.I think it is a little bit of all that.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a good movie but it is far away from the excellence.Although I liked this movie,it did not result very memorable to me.</fullReview>

So i go to watch it the day it comes out, expecting a lot.The film lasts just under 3 hours, however i felt like they made the film 3 hours just for the sake of making it something big. Because the first hour and a half included unnecessary and to much about what he did, that just got really boring and was hardly anything to do with the story of the film, i also noticed quite a few people leaving the movie at this point.But after about the first 1 and a half hours of the movie it started getting really good and became a really emotional and beautiful story, i cried at a few points as well, and it takes a lot for me to cry in a movie, so thats all good.Overall i was pretty disappointed because this movie has over 10 Oscar nominations and they could have done such a better job with the storyline, and the movie dragged to much. I don't think Brad Pitt was an amazing actor in it, i think Cate Blanchett was a better actress than him in this movie.</fullReview>

Also is not a completely waste, there is many characters very interesting and strong, the woman of his first romance, his mother, Daisy as child was very good. But there is too many things which don't contribute to the development of the story. I don't understand what the hell was the matter with the storm, or the man with seven thunders over him... the fact of the war....

		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is by far the best movie I have ever seen in the Year 2009 (Well it's still January and there would be tonnes of good movies coming up). What fascinated me about this movie is, first of all, its storyline.Its main plot is about the life of a 'very strange man' Benjamin Button. He was born on the day when World War I just ended, a lucky and memorable day for all citizens in America, but also an unlucky and unforgettable day for Benjamin Button. He was born so differently, bearing the body of an old man yet the mentality of a new born child. His father had fears over him and abandoned him shortly when Benjamin was born. Luckily, he was raised by a kind-hearted black lady who treated him as dearly as her own son.The story proceeded by telling the story of Benjamin Button, how growing up as an old man in the beginning and gradually turning 'younger' and 'younger' as he ages. It is such an extraordinary experience in accompanying Benjamin through his life inside a comfortable cinema with a good company in 166 minutes. Through his series of encounters, actions and reactions, often times you would reflect and think about your very own life.I especially liked the tag lines that Benjamin include as he narrates throughout the movie. They are like short summaries to different points of life and different viewpoints when you are in different dilemmas. "You never know what's coming for you." was a common line that Benjamin uses with his dear 'mama', which is very encouraging and forward-looking. Life is short and full of uncertainties, since you will never know what will be coming up for you, to treasure every moment and grasping every opportunity that you have to make wonders is a form of life that you should never miss.About the cast, personally Brad Pitt (Benjamin Button) is at his finest performance once again since "Twelve Monkeys" and "The River Runs Through It". His touch of acting has solidified through his experience in both life and movie career. Cate Blanchett (Daisy) also proved herself as a Oscar-winning actress, giving well-rounded performance and acting out the charisma of the lady whom Benjamin deeply loved. The supporting cast also did a wonderful job.Check this movie out! You will not be disappointed. Why? Because "You never know what's coming for you."</fullReview>

But all through i just did not want to switch it off. Brad Pitt is a brilliant actor in this as you really feel his pain of being born a old man and getting younger instead of older. His love for Daisy (Kate Blanchett) is also a emotional journey. It was a real tear jerker at the end. I would recommend this film if you want a serious drama for adults i say, as teenagers will find this very boring and are most likely to switch it off some point during the film. Also, if you are into films that have some sort of 'reality' in it, you wont like this. As this is pretty much not realistic. The start of this film, was a stomach turner as Benjamin was a born old man and did not look healthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I personally think the movie was something unseen before. It was also very moving and makes you feel how good you life really is. I think you should view this movie it was well worth the 2hrs I thought the animations looked realistic when he was older. They did very well to make him look 18yrs old. When he was young they made him look the same as he did in previous movies when he was younger. I enjoyed it. I have seen The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

		<shortDescription>Benjamin button's Epic Journey of Life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An old lady lying in the hospital bed with her daughter besides her is counting her last hours. It's pouring outdoors and the weather report on the Television news channel warns of a hovering hurricane, the destination of which is not known. In the midst of this turbulent backdrop ,the old lady requests her daughter to open the thick diary kept in the corner of the room. The daughter starts reading out and an epic memoir unfolds.Rewind to the year 1918.....The story of the life of Benjamin Button, a man who was born old and wrinkled, and ageing backwards epitomizes and philosophizes with a high degree of subtlety the transience of human lives, their relationships and mental faculties. It's like that painting which at first glance you would find vague but on closer examination you can interpret the meaning of each and every stroke made by the painter and admire its true beauty. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (TCCOBB) is a wonderfully crafted painting, the brilliance of which you can appreciate only if you use all your senses and truly feel the movie.It is inevitable that while watching this, you are reminded of and draw comparisons to that very endearing film ? Forrest Gump. Characters of both the movies are naive, gullible, are essentially all alone in their journey of life and have a steady and inextinguishable flame of love for the girl they met and befriended in childhood. But David Fincher's treatment of Benjamin Button is passionate, very artistic and not as feel good as Forrest Gump. David Fincher departs from the dark movies like Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac which he is known for.Life is all about those magical moments ? your first breadth, the first step you take, your first day at school, the first time your heart skips a beat, the first kiss, the first love, the first heartbreak, the first pay cheque, the day you tie the knot, giving birth and raising your own kin and alas facing the inevitable. Benjamin Button's life wonderfully captures these events in reverse order. It is the implausibility of the storyline which brings about the beauty and essence of the film and what it is trying to convey ? "Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments." The only problem with 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is that for all its artiness, one is never actually at the edge of their seat. The plot and series of events are quite predictable. Don't expect or wait for a scene that'll make you hold your stomach and laugh out loud. Instead what you will be served from time to time is heart warming moments that will emotionally move you.The casting of each and every character is perfect and their performance brilliant. With so many dimensions to the title in character of Benjamin Button and the time-line of the story it is a very difficult role indeed. But, Brad Pitt does justice to every layer of this character and simply outstands in his portrayal of Benjamin Button. Cate Blanchett also proves why she is one of the most critically appreciated leading actresses around.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is also an excellent endeavour in cinematography, background score, dialog writing and screenplay. With the Oscars round the corner it will certainly be in the middle of all the action!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Story Well Executed - Not For Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this film I compared it to 'Big Fish'. The a wholly unrealistic story told through the narrative device of a parent talking about their life to their child on their deathbed. Not to criticise it, after all I did think this was a good movie but as a twenty something male urbanite not really my thing. I don't think that I am the target audience for films that include 'feelings' and 'emotions', my girlfriend however cried at the end and no doubt enjoyed watching Brad Pitt getting (as she put it) younger and fitter throughout the movie. A good date flick as it will show inner depth as you fake your aw-ing and ah-ing sounds to show what a deep emotional guy you are when it comes to love stories. Having said that I was not completely switched off by it, and it was very well executed as a production of a fantastical (as in fantasy not fantastic) movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as its title character reverses the process of aging - beginning as a wrinkled old man and ending as a smooth-faced infant - so too does "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" reverse the quality arc we've come to expect from many of our movies - that of starting off strongly in the developmental stages then coming a cropper in the dreaded "third act." Instead, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" falters through much of its early and middle stretches, then achieves something akin to greatness towards the end.The main problem with "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" - which has been loosely adapted from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story by scenarists Eric Roth and director David Fincher - is that it's trying so hard to be great that it frequently forgets to be good. To begin with, the movie frames its tale within what is possibly the hoariest storytelling cliché of them all: the dreaded deathbed confession. The dying person, in this case, is an elderly woman named Daisy, whose secret love of her life was the aforementioned Benjamin Button. As she lies in her hospital bed barely clinging to life - while Hurricane Katrina, of all things, batters away outside - Daisy has her understandably disconcerted daughter (Julia Ormond) read the journal detailing the couple's ill-fated romance. The story proper begins in 1918 New Orleans with the birth of Benjamin, a child with all the physical attributes of a dying old man. Abandoned by his father (his mother having died giving birth to him), Benjamin is taken in and raised by a compassionate black woman who lives and works at an old folk's home. As time passes, the strange child, rather than dying as predicted, slowly becomes younger and healthier, till finally he is strong enough and mature enough to venture out on his own to explore the world and make a life for himself. This includes a couple of key romances, the main one being with Daisy, a young girl he initially meets when he is still a boy trapped in an old man's body, and a stint working on a tugboat which lands him unexpectedly smack dab in the middle of World War II. To relate anymore of the story would be to do an injustice to both the movie and anyone interested in experiencing it for himself.The most serious weakness of the film lies in the assumption on the part of its makers that just because something interesting is happening TO the character of Benjamin Button that there must be something interesting ABOUT him. On the contrary, Benjamin remains such a bland and passive person throughout the course of the story that we really don't learn very much about him - this, despite the fact that Benjamin has been called upon to narrate the tale in his own words. Unfortunately, the narration has such a you-are-there, Confucius-say banality to it that Benjamin comes perilously close to slipping into Forrest Gump territory much of the time. Much more detrimental is the fact that Benjamin really doesn't act or speak all that differently when he is a man/child from when he is an older "young" man. We see him changing physically, but not nearly enough psychologically, rendering the premise, finally, more of a gimmick than a gateway into enlightenment. Moreover, the film suffers from a built-in episodic structure that weakens the drama and vitiates the tension.All that being said, there is still much that is good about "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" and that makes it worth seeing, starting with the originality and cleverness of the premise itself. In addition, there are fine performances by Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton and, most notably, Faune A. Chambers, as the woman who raises Benjamin to believe that he is really no different from the rest of us whose biological clocks just happen to be moving forward rather than backward. Needless to say, the CGI effects and aging makeup are expert throughout, and when it finally settles down and focuses on the romantic relationship between Benjamin and Daisy, the movie becomes a thoughtful and tremendously moving meditation on aging, the inexorable passage of time, and the importance of living our lives in - and for - the present. In fact, so effective is the final third of the movie that, for all intents and purposes, it makes us forget the restlessness we may have experienced at other points in the story and leaves us feeling notably elated at the end. It is here where the movie finally begins to achieve that greatness it's worked so hard and taken us so long to get to. But achieve it it does - and that is accomplishment enough these days when you get right down to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Curious" Why This Film is So Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" had great performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, and the rest of the ensemble. Kudos to the sets, the make-up, and the spectacular special effects. The film was original, inspired, and contained brilliant symbolism on both the ominous presence of the ticking clocks of our lives, and on the people who guide us along our twisted paths. Yet, all of these spectacular variables do not create harmony in "Benjamin Button" for one reason that continues to deflate films in these modern times: its length. This movie is way too long. Some have said that the greatest art is created in the editing process. In some films, I believe this to be true. Yet, it is hard to test that hypothesis for "Benjamin Button" because it seems not to have had an editing process at all. I was captivated by the film initially, but once I hit the two hour mark, I was checking my watch. This was not a two hour and forty five minute story in the slightest. The film does not feel short, it does not feel crisp, and it does not feel succinct. It feels really, really long. And "long" is the only word now that I can use to describe it. Walking out of the theater, I have forgotten the performance, the sets, the symbols. All I can think of is "whose ego trip decided to make this film so lengthy?" If anything, "Benjamin Button" is worth watching for the performances, and its scenic beauty. If you must see it, definitely rent it. This way you can turn it off when its length becomes unbearable, or perhaps you can watch it in installments like the painful miniseries that it is.</fullReview>

Anyone who watched this movie to its entirety did so just to see what happens at the end, not because they enjoyed the ride.Also, why so long? Everything could have been condensed to no more than 45 minutes.

		<shortDescription>Not So Much an Emotional Experience As It Is a Tremendously Impressive Technical Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the procedural but audacious Zodiac, this film shows Fincher on his own reverse-evolutionary course. The story opens with a man who has suffered the loss of a loved one, putting his talent to creative and profound use in a way that wishes for those who we've lost to return. And then we see the concept of his work put into practice, and though there are miraculous aspects, elements and moments in the unique subject's life, it has the same well of tragedy, heartbreak and loneliness, just different kinds, making them harder. And we see that no matter who one is, life is defined by its tragedies.In spite of this, I never shed a single tear, never felt my heart sink. David Fincher's questionable epic, really his first non-thriller, to me, is not so much an emotional experience as it is a tremendously impressive technical achievement. There is not a single frame that could have been better shot or edited. Atmospherically, it is a masterpiece. In the creativity of envisioning the character of Benjamin Button throughout all of the stages of his life, it is a masterpiece. But that is essentially the aim of the film, rather than having you leave it with one of many life-affirming cathartic experience under your belt.It deliberately spreads its scope wider than necessary. We begin by seeing the elderly Daisy, a barely recognizable Cate Blanchett, on her deathbed with her daughter in a New Orleans hospital as Katrina approaches. Daisy then narrates perhaps the most incredible sequence of the entire film, of a blind clockmaker played by Elias Koteas, who was contracted to construct a clock to hang in the New Orleans train station. Subsequent to the news of his son's death in The Great War, he sustained an even deeper occupation with his clock, which he deliberately conceived to run in reverse, perhaps to artistically honor the grief of mourning parents of soldiers, or with the dream that it actually would bring back those who died in the war.Back to Daisy. She asks Caroline to read aloud from a diary containing photographs and postcards written by Benjamin Button. Caroline begins to read as the story transitions to Benjamin's point of view. For a film with such a transcendental concept, and one with such import, this narrative format is quite stale. If only it could've simply told the story without the stretched scale and let us be Caroline, let us react the way she does, rather than detaching us to watch Caroline dramatize the emotional worth for us. Brad Pitt, in the virtually monolithic title role, goes through many changes but at a few of them looks very much like himself and at some points even younger. I don't know what my Kinsey rating is, but he simply is one arrestingly beautiful man.At any rate, we go into a movie or a book with the supposition that it will tell a story in sequential time. We understand and discern flashbacks and flash-forwards, even when the signals are very subtle. If a story moves in reverse, its scenes indicate a chronological progression seen backwards. Even if a scene recurs, it has its place in chronology. If time is splintered into diverging avenues, it is about how the characters try to have power over their existence. Even 21 Grams, The Time Machine, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, et. Al. require the inescapable command of time.There was another film in 2008 that isn't nominated for Best Picture or anything secondary or tertiary in importance, or listed among the favorites of the year at all, and it's an admirably extreme contemplation of the procedure of existing and getting older. But people en masse need time for it to grow on them. Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York will be beheld and treasured in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher deserves an Oscar nod</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really love movies with a narrated story that takes you through a lifeline. This entertained me like Tim Burton's "Big Fish" - just not as whimsical and with a slightly sadder ending.Blanchett was great as the artist who lived "in the moment" before realizing that love doesn't stand still. A great performance as I could feel her pain of loss almost every minute she spent on screen.I'm not convinced that Pitt deserves an Oscar nomination here although he does a fine job in a character that moves throughout the movie like an eager little boy on a candy store tour.Ted Manson's character as an old senile story teller has the funniest lines in this movie as he continually describes the instances in which by he was struck by lightening throughout his life. I laughed out loud each time I saw him on the screen and say "Did I ever tell you that I was struck by..." While I have not read the F. Scott Fitzgerald short stories, the screen story and director deserve the acclaim here. This is an epic-like undertaking and the story moved like a good book does -- removing you from reality into a fictional world you some how believe is real until the credits roll. Fincher does a great job. Were it not for Slumdog's Danny Boyle, he'd be a slam dunk for Best Director. And same for Cinematographer.I always love a movie that entertains with a solid story or leaves you walking out feeling grateful about the people in your life and encourages you to live more. This movie does all that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher is no Ingmar Bergman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with the protagonist aging backwards is going to be about what?... Can you guess?... Life, of course. The life of a man with a rare disease of being born old, first, and he grows down, instead of up, so to speak. The man is Benjamin Button, played by different actors, but particularly Brad Pitt, who also narrates the story.Benjamin is born the day World War I ends, with people celebrating in the streets. His mother dies in childbirth, and his father, frightened by the baby's bizarre wrinkles, abandons him by leaving him on the stairway of an old folks home. (What a coincidence.) From there, he's taken into care by a young Black woman, who works as a servant.Over the years, Benjamin does, indeed, grow down. He learns about love, death, friendship, and, oh yeah, life... or at least this is what Brad Pitt's narration goes on and on about. Even though Benjamin is an ordinary man, the narration makes his life (there's that word, again) appear to be grandiose. Why? If there's going to be narration in a story like this, can't it at least be subtle? Actually, the reason there's narration is because it's being read from a book Benjamin wrote. Read by a young woman in a hospital, with her dying mother, who was Benjamin's lover. (No surprise, there.)The acting is not the problem. Everyone here gives good performances, but it doesn't save the film, except for the first hour, which I *did* like. Also, the film is not predictable, but there are definitely no surprises along the way. OK, the scene about chaos theory with the taxi is clever, but that's it. After the hour mark, the story just feels like blah, blah, blah. So what if Benjamin's an ordinary man, except for his aging disorder? To be fair, it's good that he *is* this ordinary person, because making him as some kind of superhero would've probably been way too hamfisted.I mentioned Ingmar Bergman in the summary. He was a famous Swedish director, who passed away a couple of years ago. I've only seen two of his films, ("The Seventh Seal" and his epic "Fanny and Alexander") but they work much better than this film, in my opinion, as they deal with similar themes. Well, at least "Fanny and Alexander" does.Maybe this film would've worked better without Brad's narration. Again, it became too much for me. The length of this film is another problem. Since it's almost three hours long, and Benjamin's life is only so interesting, why not cut the film down by, say, an hour and a half? How much harm would it do? I like David Fincher's films, but this one, frankly, feels like pap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While everyone is saying how Benjamin Button is a reaffirmation of life (which it is, I agree), I can not help to notice just how alone this movie makes you feel. The film tracks the life of Benjamin, and how unusual it is, and explores the desires of everyone in the process of growing old (which btw IS everyone!). The over riding theme is that everyone who wants to be young again be careful, you may just get what you wish for! And the alternative to growing old, namely growing young, is just as alienating process as the one we all must experience. Button, like everyone else, is at the mercy of time. And I'm sorry, but the image at the end of a child feeling as if he's forgotten a life is somehow exponentially more tragic than an 80 yr old experiencing the same thing. This is an epic tale, filled with love, losses and life. And somehow the one thing that can not be escaped, can never be escaped, is the overwhelming sense of helplessness against the effects of time. btw.... anyone think of BB birth being an answer to the clockmaker's prayer? Pretty horrific and telling. You can't avoid the tragic nature of the passage of time, one way or the other.</fullReview>

What i thought they where going to do here is have him aging up to about 90 or 100 years of age staying fully aware mentally! Then stopping and starting to age backwards but only physically! This i think would have been more acceptable to an audience! For as fantastic as it all is to begin with! Having done it this way would and or could have put it into a Forest Gump type category!

		<fullReview>I was quite impressed with the movie because it had such a positive message about getting older and death. For instance when Daisy was dying (during Hurricane Katrina) she said to her daughter *(not much of a spoiler here because it happens at the beginning of the movie) that she was 'curious to see what came next'. Benjamin was old and grew younger, which most of us can relate to wanting to be younger not older, but since he began his life old he said that being old wasn't so bad because he had experienced it. Other things, like not being able to be a father to a child because he was growing younger...etc. really helped you put things into perspective that life goes the direction it is supposed to. *(Still trying not to spoil anything)But mostly, the main thing I came away with was the feeling that it's never too late and getting older is no excuse for not wanting to do what you want to do. I left the theater feeling younger than ever. And darn it if I don't want the same make-up &amp; lighting that made Brad look like he did in Thelma and Louise! However, Benjamin is right, "There is nothing wrong with getting older". Not much like F Scott Fitzgerald's story, but a very good improvement I believe. Really liked the clock maker's backward running clock addition. Spoiler here...beware... *Now, someone did point out, and I do agree, that if Benjamin was born an old looking baby and the size of a baby then he should die the same size as an adult that only had the features, actions etc. of a baby. He shouldn't have turned back into a baby.Cate Blanchett's wardrobe in this movie was awesome as was all the background pieces that took you back in time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film but do think it was rather long winded. It was pretty cheesy in places and almost too well done if you know what i mean. As you would expect the acting was flawless. The special effects were incredible. The idea is genius. The story is a bit too long and kind of predictable, not that there's much to predict. I think the message could have been expressed within 2 hours and being longer kind of ruined the film for me, however being the whole story of someones life, you can't complain too much. Put the effects and idea aside and you don't have too much of a spectacular film, I wouldn't want to see this one winning too many awards. I have seen some much more interesting and better films in the last month and wouldn't put this one up there. As Benjamin gets younger the story gets less interesting and the novelty wears off, you can see where the story is going and I personally felt a bit annoyed knowing I would have to watch another hour of it. I wasn't exactly going to stop before the end, mainly because I wanted to see how they would make Brad Pitt look like a teenager but the message had been made and the story had pretty much been told. All round, this is a watchable film and definitely worth going to see, but certainly not one of the better ones this winter, and most definitely not worth being in the top 250 on here (as it currently is)I'd rate it a 7.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Episodic Script's Lost Opportunities Prevent Emotional Involvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is blessed with impressive special effects in the aging of Brad Pitt, and a clever MacGuffin: a man's body ages backward, from old age to infancy. The movie's episodic structure and the script's lack of depth prevented me from forming any emotional reaction to the material, though. It ended with a whimper and I left the theater unmoved.The film is episodic: a character comes on, has his moment in the spotlight, delivers a soliloquy, and then departs. The characters are eccentric in a way that serves no larger purpose than for them to be eccentric. One such character designs a clock that runs backward. Another has been struck by lightening seven times. Another character is very fond of hummingbirds. Another character tried to swim the English Channel but was thwarted by bad weather. None of these characters meet or interact. They stand alone in the narrative spotlight, depart, and then another eccentric character takes their place. Their stories add up to no larger point. "Ain't Life Funny" seems to be the film's main point.The aging of Brad Pitt is praiseworthy and will be the most remembered feature of this film. Unfortunately, during several brief but key scenes, the filmmakers inexplicably decided to jettison the aging techniques and cast another actor in Brad Pitt's role. Many viewers reported losing their emotional attachment to the film at that point.In characterization and performance, Brad Pitt's Benjamin Button is little different from Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump. He's a blank slate, a wise idiot, who says little, reacts mildly, and drifts through a lifetime of meeting random eccentrics. There's material here that BEGS to be plumbed by a worthy script. Does the scriptwriter really want to give Benjamin NOTHING to say about aging backward? No outrage, no poetry, no cri du coeur, no "God, why me?" There are important scenes between Benjamin and his parent. The scriptwriter does nothing with these scenes.Other characters are also clichés. Benjamin's adoptive mother is a one-dimensional saint who says more about white guilt than about any real life black woman. Cate Blanchett, as Benjamin's love, is never developed. Their relationship is also never developed. This is meant to be an epic love that withstands the test of time in a way that no other love has ever been asked to do. And it's boring.Really ? the chances that anyone will ever again write a love story between a man who is aging backward and a woman aging forward are pretty slim. Why couldn't the script writer have at least tried to give voice to the extraordinary agonies and ecstasies, fears, hopes, and unique vows and commitments that would have arisen from such a love? Was the script struggling so hard to get the audience to buy its unique premise that they didn't want to draw attention to its implausibility by having any characters talk about it at all? Or is this just a post-verbal script, in which the frequently repeated phrase, "I've been struck by lightening seven times" is supposed to do all the work of expressing every feeling that every character feels? There was one scene that works beautifully. Benjamin, perhaps ten years old, but looking like a seventy-year old, hides under a table with a little girl. They are lit by candle light. I may look like an old man, but I'm not one, he says. That moment is poignant. There should have been more moments like that, instead of just another dead-end episode with yet another eccentric character.Hurricane Katrina is also harnessed and not made much use of. The hurricane is never seen, which is a shame, because nothing is more cinematic than a hurricane. Rather, shots of TV screens showing radar images of Katrina's path are shown. I have to wonder at a director who would choose TV shots of weathermen talking about radar over actual footage of frothing waves, wind-whipped palms, and houses being ravished by tides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an ambitious movie, and it will enjoy I believe success especially with the American audiences and with the academy members grabbing a number of Oscars (but I hope not the one for the best film deserved I think by 'Sinedoche, New York'). It is Oscar stuff with a story located in America (New Orleans filmed at its best) spreading over decades, with greater than life characters. Or I should say greater than time in this case.The ambitions exceed even the usual American saga story. The script written by Eric Roth, script-writer of 'Forrest Gump' and loosely inspired by a short story by Scott Fitzgerald tries to tell deeper things about the relativity of the passing of time, the inevitability of death even if time runs for the main hero from old age to childhood, about the power of love to transcend time. Yet the ideas as interesting as they are do not all find a cinematographic equivalent on screen, the result being a film with many memorable parts but also with failed ones.I did like the story telling in the first part of the movie, the many simple stories and moving characters coming together, but I had the feeling that there were too few new elements or surprises in the second part to justify the almost three hours film length. I loved the setting of the city of New Orleans, which filmed across many decades provides a fabulous landscape of color and passion, sounds and mist where all legends are possible. I liked the acting of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, each of them would deserve an Oscar, but overall they did not come together perfectly in a story that needs intense emotion and perfect chemistry in order to overcome credibility problems. Most of all however the feeling on mission incomplete derives from the fact that not all the ambitious philosophical messages found a cinema equivalent on screen.At the end this film does not stand the comparison with Forrest Gump, the other story of a different type of hero located in the Southern hemisphere of the American universe. The reason is maybe the fact that while Tom Hank's Forrest Gump carried the innocence of permanently rediscovering the purity of the world through the eyes of his character, Benjamin Button's recession into young age and childhood lacks such innocence and keeps a taint of sickness and uneasiness failing despite Pitt's magnificent acting to take us viewers with him into his universe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are limits to stretching a short story and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is definitely off its limits. Fitzgerald's brilliant idea turned out to be an endless story in Eric Roth's, Robin Swicord's and David Fincher's hands. If they fall in love with what they are doing, it is hard for the creators to spare some of their work, but I wonder what else was the editor busy with! It's a pity that as the film got longer and longer, even that beautiful story, those wonderful actors and magnificent make ups became harder to appreciate. I really wanted someone to sit at the editing table and trim the excess scenes from the film. Than, I would love it by all means!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, here is a film I was nervous about seeing. I am a huge fan of David Fincher. I love Fight Club, Seven and Zodiac most of all. The Game, Panic Room and Alien3 are pretty good too. He is my kind of director, cold to the touch but a master of precision storytelling. Zodiac in particular was an astonishing film and left me giddy with the sense that I'd found a modern Kubrick and I couldn't wait to hear about his next project. But Benjamin Button is not what I expected at all. It is as if Kubrick suddenly decided that he wanted to make a film about a boy called Elliot and an alien called E.T. Just, a complete change. I decided a while ago that I would always follow David Fincher's films closely but from the earliest discussions, something didn't feel quite right. It just didn't feel like, his field.Now, having just come back from this 3 hour epic, I can reluctantly admit that my earlier worries were well placed. The film is certainly not without merit, in fact individual scenes and moments sparkle with a magic rarely seen in films nowadays and could only have been delivered by a perfect blend of writing, direction and performance. However there is something essentially unsettling and unfulfilling about Benjamin Button as a whole and unfortunately, these issues must take center stage.When I mentioned Kubrick and E.T. I was close but not exactly so. Benjamin Button has much more in common with Spielberg's flawed A.I. There was a director of warm sentimentality attempting to tell a bitter story and moving in the cold world created by Kubrick. The end result had the feeling of someone attempting to fit his size eleven feet into size nine shoes and the style and story did not blend with the heart. With Benjamin Button, we have a director who has found his cinematic voice in cynicism, chaos and obsession, attempting to tell a story, albeit it a strange and surreal one, of life and love. However the film when viewed as a whole actually feels devoid of theme. What lesson are we supposed to take from it? Is it about love? I guess. Is it about life? Well, obviously. But what about life? Rather it comes off as a meticulous exercise in following the inevitable process of aging. As such, the film avoids forcing any dramatic situations and rather flies from place to place, through the years, as we encounter our characters getting younger or older as the case may be. Therein lies the problem, the shoe doesn't fit the foot. While there were certainly parts of the film that plucked the heartstrings, particularly the final scene, for the most part I had the overwhelming sense that I was watching characters I didn't care for and a director without a message. Important encounters would fly by and I was left with the impression of Fincher missing the sentimental mark, or rather scenes didn't seem to have any greater meaning or point. Rather, the audience responds to the astonishing sight of Brad Pitt as a young geriatric or those moments when Pitt's voice-over combined with the right piano keys causes the eyes to inexplicably start to leak salty liquid. Tonally, Benjamin Button wanted to be Road To Perdition and I think Sam Mendes might have been the man for the job.On the plus, Brad Pitt plays the part perfectly and Cate Blanchett was a revelation for me. It is their scenes together that work best. The awkwardness of a mature man in a young body and an immature girl in a young body is a touching realization of the nature of growing up differently. The film also looks beautiful, the world is vivid and alive and Fincher's talent ensures that eerie yellows rooms, icy blue skies and dark, shadowy faces make up for the lack of emotional clarity. In conclusion, Benjamin Button is a unique experiment, which fails to blend into a decisive whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Mans Affliction As A Metaphor For Love And Loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I am struck by the originality of this story. I mean it's frickin' brilliant. But, the real brilliance is in the detail of telling a preposterous story that serves as a perfect metaphor for life's journey of love and loss.There must have been tremendous hurdles to telling this in a way that was not sensational - to make it seem relevant and not fictional. Yet, the digital effects are so natural and the seamless transitions so well done they merely serve the story and never get in the way. Brad Pitt is shear perfection, Cate Blanchett is absolutely transcendent and elegant, and Tilda Swenson is so wonderfully loving that the viewer can't help but be drawn into the shear humanity of it all. Direction and cinematography are certainly up to the same high level. I would vote for this in just about every category for the year's best.Bottomline: In a year where there are some very strong contenders for best picture I feel this is the one that rises to the top. If you miss it you will deny yourself something very special. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm conflicted on this one. Though I cried more than I usually do - I haven't sobbed so much since MOULIN ROUGE - it was still kind of lacking, and hokey in its attempt to inspire a FORREST GUMP kind of love in its audience - there was even an omnipresent hummingbird as pretentiously symbolic as Forrest's feather. Benjamin's mama is even a font of Southern wisdom, not going so far as to compare life to a box of chocolates ("you never know what you're gonna get"); her shtick is that you never know what's comin'.(PS: it didn't even click with me when reading the credits that it was written by the screenwriter of FORREST GUMP; I only just now discovered that on the IMDb, so my comparison is pure and I was in no way prejudiced.) Yes, there were some universal truths, for which I'm a gigantic sucker: it's never too late to be who you might have been, and you're only "perfect" in your life during a very brief window. Not enough of us appreciate that, and that youth is wasted on the young. There were some colorful characters with stories to tell. But too often director David Fincher (who brought us SEVEN and ZODIAC!) seemed to be channeling P.T. Anderson MAGNOLIA-style. Lofty Capra aspirations creep to mind as well.Then there was the off-putting narration, too reminiscent of FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, jarring with its abrupt cuts from lyrical scenes of life as lifted from a diary's pages to the present day where Hurricane Katrina whips around outside a dying old woman's New Orleans hospital room. It's a confusing juxtaposition with no metaphorical raison d'etre. It makes even less sense considering this is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Poetic license aside, the narration comes across as a lazy editorial decision that consistently interrupted momentum and the insertion of a devastating modern day disaster is arbitrary to say the least.The make-up and CGI effects are mind-blowing, but serve to overshadow the acting abilities of the two leads. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are beautiful to look at, but they never really say or do anything. When Blanchett's Daisy explains how a dancer emotes with their body and they are only as good as the line they project, it's a wonder she didn't see the irony. Here, long looks are meant to replace any real emotional connection between their characters. Tilda Swinton actually has the most poignant scene, towards the end.Out of a possible ten, I give it 8 hankies and 7 toes up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film, Fincher and Pitt do it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I am a big fan I am a big fan of the David Fincher/Brad Pitt combo. Se7en was outstanding. Fight Club is on my personal top 10 list. I was going to see this movie, regardless of what it was about. Those two films alone were enough to make that decision for me.When I first saw the trailer, it was obviously very far removed from the aforementioned films. It was a very different concept for the dynamic duo to tackle. However, I was not terribly worried for two reasons. One, I think that both are masters of their craft. And two, I thought the concept of the film was fascinating. A man who is born old and ages backward. I had never heard of anything remotely like that. It was instantly thought provoking. I was going to see this movie, with high hopes.I had heard from certain sources that had seen the film prior to its release that the film turned out quite boring, and that there were better options out there. I had also heard that the film was brilliant, and would cement Fincher's legacy and be a serious Best Picture Contender. I was very pleased, that upon viewing the film, it turned out to be very much the latter.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was genuinely captivating throughout every one of the 168 minutes that it was on screen. Every shot was beautifully done. The effects were so seamless and stunning. It can not be easy to make portray a 7-year-old you looks 85 on screen. The special effects and makeup department deserve to be commended.But even more praise should go to the cast of the film. Each actor owned their character. Each one playing a role in Benjamin's life, keeping the story fresh, at times humorous and never boring, a rare feat in a film this long. Brad Pitt, who I believe is one of the most under-rated actors working today, proved to me once again how great he is. There are too many characters to mention here, but I simply must mention the terrific job done by Taraji P. Henson in the role of Queenie, the mother who took Benjamin in on the night of his birth. It was her role that made the film move me from the very beginning.The story itself unfolds as a lesson in love and loss, from the very beginning. It does a brilliant job of portraying its theme that we will suffer losses throughout our lives, they will be very difficult, and we must press on. This film will captivate your mind. It will not be soon forgotten once you have left the theater. I am still mesmerized. As I sit here and write down my feelings toward the movie itself, I can't help but think about the deeper meaning, the issues that the film brings up. I know a lot of people that feel like a movie can't be great unless it makes you feel like this after you see it. I am certainly not one of those people, because not every film aims to do this. However, after seeing this film, I can see where they are coming from.I strongly urge you to see this film. It is one of the five best I have seen this year. I would certainly call it a must see. I feel so much better off for having seen this film. David Fincher tackles an unfamiliar genre with ease and completely knocks it out of the park. If The Dark Knight does not win the Oscar for Best Picture (and I assume it will not), I would have no problem with seeing this film be recognized as this year's best picture winner. It was that good.</fullReview>

While Cate Blanchett plays Daisy, a young girl growing older and older.The movie deals heavily with loss and time, which are executed brilliantly. It also has a few interesting characters that break the movie up and give some humour to the story (The Dingy Captain, The Man who was struck 7 times by lightning).I left the theatre feeling good that i had seen a movie of this calibre.Extremely recommended 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to talk about this movie, because it frustrates me. I loved this movie, and I wanted to love it. It was a gorgeous film, with a well developed story. Cinematography, music, art direction, editing, costume design, EVERYTHING was of the highest quality. And the acting was great throughout. Cate Blanchett played a woman torn between choosing for love or choosing for eventual convenience. She effectively conveys her feelings using her voice and every single look. Brad Pitt clocks in a performance that, though mostly digital, turns out to be surprisingly clever, funny, and well nuanced. He injects just the right amount of comedy into the film without being too subtle or too over the top, and he holds the message to the movie: live now. Don't take any chances. Don't hold back. Though he is headed through life in the opposite direction as Daisy, Benjamin must still find ways to appreciate his situation. He must also decide whether or not he is the right thing for Daisy.And yet.... though all of these things were very very well done, it STILL felt like something was missing. It's not often I come across a movie that I know has an element missing but I can't pinpoint what it is. Sadly, I don't think I will ever figure it out. Maybe after many repeated viewings I will come to discover it, but for now, I will leave that assessment up to the viewer.So, with that being said, a 9 out of 10 (for that missing elusive element which makes for a truly great film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic tale about love and loss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Button" is a movie that takes its time. It tells three different tales--the story of the titular hero who ages in reverse (Brad Pitt), an introductory yarn about a very special clock, and the framing tale of a daughter preparing to say goodbye to her elderly, dying mother (Cate Blanchett). That the stories are all connected should be no surprise, but what is surprising is how much time Fincher is given to weave his tale. This is a big, intimate epic. It's a sprawling movie that sets out to tell a life and grapple with mortality. The special effects are dazzling, but I was more astounded by the storytelling chutzpah. The director is working with a huge canvas.David Fincher will fare very well in future critical surveys of his work. He has already made a perfect film in "Zodiac" and other than the serviceable "Panic Room", his films are consistently ambitious, visually assured, and gripping. "Button", however, is the first film he's made that will get the awards folks to take serious notice and likely find broad appeal among women. (His previous works also include "Seven", "The Game", and "Fight Club".) The film uses its special effects well and they strengthen the story as opposed to overwhelm it. Seeing Pitt as both an infant senior citizen and an elderly teen is fascinating, but it serves the story. (And seeing Brad Pitt look as young as he did in "The River Runs Through It" is mind boggling.) The film will be compared to "Forrest Gump", both of which were written by the same screenwriter, but "Gump" frequently seemed to be about its special effects. In "Button" the make-up and computerized effects blend more seamlessly and accentuate the story. The logistics of the reverse aging will also please the sci-fi and fantasy geeks in the audience.But the aging is a device used to tell a story about longing, regret, and trying to hold on to others in spite of the inevitable. It's a necessarily sad tale, but it also heartens the audience and gives us appreciation for our loved ones and own lives. And for that it's a movie to be cherished and admired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard for me to describe exactly how I feel about this film. There were parts that made you want to laugh and others that made you cry. It was heartwarming yet heartbreaking all at the same time. The story line is truly one of its kind and unlike any other, both creative and curious. At first I really loved the idea of a person aging backwards but I underestimated what exactly that would mean, like watching everyone you love grow old and die or losing all of your precious memories and forgetting all those years of your life, the people you met along the way and the journeys you made. Still, it was such a beautiful, unique story of life through the eyes of Benjamin Button. Both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were phenomenal and made wonderful chemistry together. And it seems as though Brad Pitt gets younger and more good looking with every role! I thought their love story was one of the greats, spanning through decades of time. It was nice to see Julia Ormond back on the big screen too as Caroline, living proof of the love they shared together throughout a lifetime. The make-up in the film is amazing as they take us through the aging process of Benjamin Button. I also thought the scenery to be quite beautiful as well. There were a few scenes that I did not care for because I felt they took away from the film and clouded the story but overall it was a truly great movie. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit sad but tugs at your heartstrings. The film gives you a different perspective on life and ingrains in both your mind and heart that time is precious and that you live your 'life in the moments, not the minutes.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON certainly has no trouble living up to its name. It is very curious indeed, for instance, how a man can be born to this world the size of an infant but with the physical affliction of a man at death's door. It is remarkable that a two and a half hour epic can be so consistently beautiful to behold and breathtaking until its final moments. While it isn't the least bit unusual to catch Cate Blanchett on top of her game, it is certainly impressive to see Brad Pitt exhibit such restraint and internalized inquisitiveness. It is definitely intriguing to witness a director as dark as David Fincher (ZODIAC, SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB) abandon the genre that made him who he is and side step into such a grand, romantic piece with such apparent ease and enthusiasm. But it is perhaps most curious how this film, where every element is so delicately placed and nurtured to a point where it borders on technical perfection, can be so cold and empty an experience despite itself.Of course, within the context of the film, the curious thing about Benjamin Button is that he is aging backwards while all of humanity is progressing naturally. Benjamin must suffer through his childhood in the body of an old man who has already lived his life when he is really just discovering it. Too frail to participate, he must watch life happen from the front porch of the old age home that has taken him in. Here, he bears witness to life in its final stages and grows accustomed to the constant presence of death. His perspective is undeniably unique as he is always moving forward despite the reversed nature of his physical growth. Yet, this view and the wisdom it could bring are not shared with Benjamin's most ardent observers, the audience. We are here for his story and the meaning it could bring to our relatively uncomplicated existences but instead, all we are given is the story itself. This amounts to little more than the long life of Benjamin Button, which would not be particularly different if it weren't for the whole aging backwards thing.It is one thing certainly to have all of the characters who encounter Benjamin accept him for who he is but that expectation is mildly unrealistic to ask of an audience. Still, this film has been bouncing around Hollywood for years for a number of reasons, not the least of which was figuring out how to make it look realistic. Fincher finally settled on having graphs of Pitt's face drafted onto actors of different sizes and stature playing him at various stages of his aged infancy. The results are entirely believable and the makeup work, which so often detracts in such extreme cases such as these, is quite complimentary. And so visually, we buy into it. The performances also guide us to do the same as they are natural and heartfelt. And as if this weren't enough to transport us to this historic, fantasyland, Claudio Miranda's rich, contrasting cinematography does everything needed to fill in whatever gaps were left. With all this effort spent to make sure we believe what we are seeing, it is an awful shame that equal time wasn't spent on giving us something to believe in. I blame Eric Roth. With so many things going for THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, I have to lay the blame somewhere and Roth is the easiest person to point at. Roth's script is epic in proportion but minute in terms of purpose and meaning. Having proved his ability to carry people on long life journeys, such as that of FORREST GUMP, it is clear why he would be chosen to expand F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story into such a long film. In the process though, he took an unconventional concept and told it as conventionally as he could (did I mention that Benjamin's entire story is read from a diary at Blanchett's hospital deathbed). He created a character that is not so unlike the na?ve Forrest. Benjamin is an observer of life; he watches it move forward from a perspective that none of us can truly comprehend and one that sadly, Roth and Fincher never allow us to see.</fullReview>

It could have been a 10 out of 10 if the movie was 20 minutes shorter (some scenes were unessentially prolonged and the movie had a slight drag to it after the first half. Mentioning of the passing of the "time and date factor" should have been important in this movie, at least 3 times so the aging factor of all characters would seem more noticeable since the movie has a lot to do with aging factor/s)and last but not least, the 2 children's roles that were supposed to be Benjamin in the last scenes, did not resemble any thing like his character (as he aged backwards)thus the director could have done a better job in finding roles of children who played Bradd Pitt's character, who physically resembled Bradd even as a child (even though people DO loose their resemblance a lot as they grow old but when you make a movie, you must try to stick to resemblances in a sequence pattern to make the audience and viewers say "WOW!!! What a resemblance, ALL the way through!!!". Every thing else in the movie was just amazingly perfect, including how they made Bradd Pitt look like a teenager!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curiosity indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the most innovative literary writers of all time, would have never thought that a brief short story about a man that ages backwards would become an ambitious effort from Se7en director, David Fincher. However, as fascinating as it seems, the implementation of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wasn't as successful as one would have hoped. It presents itself as a Forrest Gump hopeful which surprisingly enough is written by the same man, Eric Roth.The film stars Brad Pitt in the title role as the curious Benjamin; at first, a young boy with no understanding of his condition or of his future and in the later years, an adventurous, inquisitive man dealing with the changing world and comprehending his love for his childhood friend Daisy played by Cate Blanchett.Fincher's direction is the strongest part of the picture. In control and understanding film-making, Fincher interacts and lives within his film as in his previous works, making his mark and showing his promise from his earlier years. Artistically the film plays like any romantic epic, however, more like a wannabe and never placing a firm hand on the subject matter. The makeup, which one would think to be a strong point, is very disappointing. Pitt, Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson who plays Benjamin's surrogate mother, Queenie, all go through rapid and extensive age changes. Pitt at the age of 45 going for a 20 year-old looking boy is a bit far-fetched. But proud to say, with the exception of Pitt's performance as Jesse James last year, this is one of his strongest performances to date. Helming the character in the same manor Tom Hanks controlled "Forrest," Pitt holds his own in this tale even though the performance is subdued and doesn't demand too much of him emotionally.Blanchett is always good in anything she's in yet I didn't find her as appealing as I often do. Daisy goes through a lot of changes like "Jenny" but unlike Jenny we don't feel for her character. She doesn't hold any emotional value to the viewer to help us engage in a relationship with Daisy. Blanchett doesn't represent herself the way I'd hope she would. Her beauty is as evident as I'd ever seen (especially in a dance belt) but as an older woman she's quite annoying and as a younger woman she's plain obnoxious. This is her weakest performance in years.Henson as the Sally Field-like character, Queenie, is equally affecting as Pitt is but her character is abruptly taken off screen and leaves the viewer disenchanted. The rest of the supporting players put forth valiant efforts especially Julia Ormond who's brief showing gives a needed poignant touch.Overall, Fincher's film is disappointing and with a 2 hour and 47 minute quest, there's a good film that could have been one hour shorter (literally). Oscar may come knocking on the door for Button and Fincher is probably in serious contention for the directing win but as a Best Picture winner, I can't seem to fathom the idea.***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club), this chronicles the life of a man named Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who ages physically in reverse. A fairly original premise that touches lightly on messages of life and death, this is a charming, often touching little movie.Brad Pitt gives a quiet somewhat subdued performance. His character of Benjamin is always quite reserved, presumably to the inevitability of death. His introspect is mostly limited to the notes he makes in a journal, which is unfortunate. Cate Blanchett plays his main romantic interest Daisy. They have a sweet and (at the end) absolutely heart-breaking relationship. Yes, this is a tear-jerker, and your liking of the film depends on your taste for having your emotions manipulated. Personally I have no problems with that.This film is strongly reminiscent of Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, and Forrest Gump. With the same writer of the wonderful Forrest Gump, Benjamin Button treads a lot of known ground. It's told in the "hospital bed" manner that most of these films share. This is lovely to people that enjoy more of the same, but annoying to this reviewer given the uniqueness of the film's premise. The beginning and end of this film are very interesting. The middle could be picked from any number of biopics. No one outside of his immediate relations ever seems to notice that Brad Pitt's character ages in reverse. It would be an interesting twist if Ben was grabbed and experimented on. It would be interesting to explore how a 20 year old in appearance would be with a 55 year old's personality. Alas, the film does the Hollywood thing, takes an original premise and sees how close it can get back to the usual thing people expect.This is disappointing considering it's David Fincher, whose previous films look nothing like this. It's a pretty good film, whatever my misgivings might indicate. Fincher has the taste for sentimentality, but his inexperience with this sort of film has made him toe the line to retain the box office and a chance at the Oscars. There might be one in the future of Best Make-up, but that's all I can see. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button gets a B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely Disappointing And Not Pitt's Best - To Say The Very Least</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing about this film is believable to me. The story's premise - someone growing young instead of old - is interesting but its execution here is faulty to say the least. It is internally inconsistent, in other words. The writers didn't think this premise through carefully enough, to make it play out as it likely would (even as a fantasy) - and Pitt failed to think it through, too (because his acting did not sell the premise).In fact, Brad Pitt's acting in this movie is incredibly poor - and it makes you wonder about Brad Pitt's level of taste as well as his depth as an actor. Is he only cut out for emotionless action movie leads? Pitt's delivery seems to change over the course of the film and often seems put-on and stiff. I only sat through this boring and preposterous film because someone dragged me to it and wanted to stay until the very end. After seeing it I remember sitting down with the person with whom I'd seen it and ticking off detail after detail that didn't ring true or was done really poorly. Even Pitt's makeup and costuming was jarring and amateurish - and I don't normally pay attention to this kind of thing. If you can look at Pitt as an old man and not feel like yelling at the screen some criticism like, "who put on that makeup?," you're not invested in watching a film. I wanted to like this film. I'd often told my friends it was cruel that we grew in wisdom only to become more frail as we get older - I'd often posited how it would be if we could somehow become more youthful with time. So I wanted to give in to the fantasy in this film but the concept was poorly done and impossible to enjoy on any level - for me, anyway. I tell you this - my idea of torture would be to have to watch this film again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Epic Bore of Benjamin Button ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My eyes have beheld TV episodes with much richer plots concentrated in less than sixty minutes of thrills or hilarity, sometimes dramas, sometimes comedies, always entertainments. But when they had to endure David Fincher's "The Curious Case if Benjamin Button" in the movie theater, I wished my popcorn box was a remote control so I could have the power to change the channel. Like Benjamin Button, I was doomed, forced to watch a fantasy biopic drama whose genre-bending atmosphere succeeded in elevating boredom to epic proportions. "Benjamin Button" is the kind of films whose publicity relies on respectable arguments that turn out to be fallacious when you grasp the true content of the film. The film features Brad Pitt, who proved to make a great tandem with Fincher in the second half of the 90's. It starts with a creative concept, adapted from a short farce written by F. Scott Fitzgerald: a man whose life goes in reverse, born as an old person and getting younger as time goes by, talk about a 'wowing' concept, promising if it wasn't so scary. And the film is very long and is made like the kind of epic dramas that satisfy the tastes of the Academy members. But after watching "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" (damn, even the title is long), I found something distastefully pretentious not while watching the film, but after finishing it, as a second thought that never left me.I consciously use the word 'pretentious' because of the following dilemma: I wonder if the film overestimates our patience or underestimates our intelligence. Granted it has some qualities: the acting does justice to the believability of the story, with a honorable mention to the members of the nursing home where Button grew up, Brad Pitt takes his role seriously and does his best trying to convey the illusoriness of a life whose direction is in total opposition with all the other persons. And there is no doubt that the cinematography, photography, editing and directing, although not transcending, correctly serve their purpose to improve the awards nominations' statistics. But even the most appetizing plates can have an insipid taste, "Button" looks, sounds and feels great but it lacks something vital when it comes to movie making: writing. Eric Roth, who won the Oscar for "Forrest Gump", wrote the screenplay. When I learned that, another dilemma started teasing my mind: is it accidental or logical that the script here didn't work?I vote for logical. As original as the plot is, it needed a less ambitious format, yet Fincher stretches it for three endless hours starting the story from a deathbed flashback set right before the Hurricane Erika events, just to put the story in a chronological map and trace a clever parallel between Benjamin Button's life and history. It worked for "Forrest Gump", because he was a fitting character for that kind of narrative while Button's condition is a story in itself and can never distract from whatever happens in his life. Roth tried to rewrite the typical picaresque story like "Forrest Gump", I could also have mentioned "Barry Lyndon" or "Little Big Man" but in the case of Button, it quite simply doesn't work. I don't know if it could have worked anyway, maybe the film was victim of its own concept, after all: how can we possibly sense the profound effect the course of events has on us when our very conscience evolves from a sort of precocious wisdom to amnesia. Or maybe this is the key of Button's torment but since when does a handicap build empathy or cement a heroic status? The script tries to exploit Button's unique condition by framing it in a romance with a little girl who grew up to become the love of his life, Cate Blanchett as Daisy, an ambitious dancer, but Daisy is not Jenny, there was something quite unlikable in the way her ambition flirted with a sort of bitchy cockiness. Anyway, she never did it to me, although she inspired a very cleverly written sequence that seemed to belong to another film, if only half of "Button" shared this quality. But no, the rest of the film was a bunch of redundancies enrobed with boring existential torments stretched like a chewing gum until it loses its taste. While it could have been adapted in an entertaining way, the film is just an assemblage of many little episodes deprived from emotions and scream for Oscar nominations ? did I use the word 'pretentious'? I couldn't escape from the uncomfortable feeling that "Benjamin Button" was just a wannabe Forrest Gump, that recycled many plot clichés that would have been unnoticed if the movie found the time to be entertaining, instead of filling it with pointless gimmicks and situations that don't go anywhere, damn even the encounter with the father who abandoned him left me cold, when I expected an emotional Himalaya, I got a hill. No seriously, "Benjamin Button" could have been subtitled "How to Make Best Picture nominees for Dummies", in terms of casting, of story, of writing, of cinematography, of editing, everything is handled with a remarkable marketed precision, but at the end, all you have is an empty creation whose emotional core again required less than one hour and half to grab the interest, "Memento" or "Groundhog Day", movies based on similar concepts, had the common decency to be short. And the film features probably the most badly written concluding lines in recent history, with the whole "Some people do this and some people do that" when it finished with the sight of Blanchett dancing and the monologue ended with "? and some people just dance." I was like "give me a break", if that is the punch line of the whole thing, it means that just because we watched characters talking and acting during three hours, Fincher took our empathy for granted, and that also is pretentious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literally watching paint dry would be more lively that this movie.While the visual tricks and sepia are all wonderful, this film is a massively tedious failure. The characters are less alive than slabs in a mortuary and they move through the scenes like wooden props. And it's all so solemn, as if life's lessons are delivered in homily style.Benjamin Button is like Forrest Gump but with all the life, action and wit and humor sucked out of him.The reason lies with the script which has removed any action and turned it all into reaction. The script is executed in reported style, so Benjamin tells the audience what is happening, as the actors do it but without any agency. The problem is fundamental as it starts the film, with the book reading and the old woman in the bed: the story is narrated not acted. A basic lesson from film school and scriptwriting is not to make this mistake or the end product is this dull. Benjamin is not the agent of his life ? things happen to him. Another lesson fro drama and script wring, the protagonist must be the agent of their own life.Due to this failure in the script the actors are all redundant ? it's a novel with pictures. And ultimately the musings on life and time are just pretentious and incomplete.Go outside to a lawn, get a chair and a drink, sit down and watch the grass grow. That will say more about life and time than this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>String of Events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I look for character, plot, and some insight into the human condition. None of these elements were present in this movie. It was essentially, a string of distantly-related events in a life lived backwards. OK - I get it. An episodic movie: "Forest Gump" with a plot twist. It may have been a nice short story, but there just isn't enough content to fill up an almost 3-hour movie. We never delve beneath the surface of any character. People dance, make buttons, or play the piano because that's what they do. Now, there are many highly charged moments, and they are portrayed with stunning visual poetry. The tugboat, for instance, almost becomes a separate character because of all the angles and focal lengths at which it's photographed. Outside of the plot device of a life lived backwards, it's a rather plain tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Kitsch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrible film, almost unwatchable with its greeting card dialogue, its Hallmark cinematography, its goofy moralising, its nauseating music. But what's worse about the film is this: it pretends to be about a man who is constantly "out of sync" with the world (he ages in reverse) and who learns that love can transcend both time and the gradual deterioration of the human body, but in reality it does the complete opposite.A film like this should show us how the mind and heart can defy the limitations of the flesh, but instead it shows us human being who are defined entirely by their bodies. Observe how the film never celebrates the fact that Brad Pitt, now in a youthful body, possess the wisdom of a seventy year old man. Instead of finding value in knowledge, the film focuses on the dissonance between Pitt's beauty and the wrinkles of his lover's forehead. This is a film which celebrates youth and outer appearances, which mourns the losses of the flesh, the deterioration of Botox injected skin, the greying of hair, the ugliness of old age, the passage of time, and instead celebrates healthy bones, good knees and the sexy face of Brad Pitt. Pitt's youth is what we're instructed to long for, not Benjamin Button's wisdom.The body is just the vehicle for the far more valuable thoughts and feelings it contains, but this film is more interested in pandering to the usual Hollywood fantasies.4/10 - If Tom Hanks from "Forrest Gump" met Will Smith from "The Legend of Bagger Vance" and used the horse from "Seabiscuit" as a surrogate womb to carry their artificially inseminated baby, then that baby would be Benjamin Button. Which is not to say that all four films are nauseating examples of kitsch, egotistical vehicles for their stars to take part in hokey modern fables, no, quite the opposite, for Benjamin Button is literally the lovechild of a retard, a black man and an overachieving horse.Worth no viewings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted plot device, wasted characters, and wasted time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, this movie bored me. Surely it was pretty to watch; but for nearly three hours of my time, I wanted a little more.My biggest gripe is that the screenwriter wasted the most interesting aspect of this movie: a man is born elderly and grows into a child. A life lived in reverse seems the ultimate fantasy, a true curiosity, a source of constant inner conflict. Yet we never see Benjamin grapple with his existence. Instead, as Benjamin's growing younger by the day takes a back seat to the romance between him and Daisy and -- even more unfortunately -- the production value of the film. To take such a brilliant plot concept and perpetually discard it over the course of three hours is simply irritating.In addition, the use of Hurricane Katrina as a backdrop struck me as gratuitous and unnecessary. I have yet to reconcile the Katrina storyline with the story of Benjamin Button. In fact, the melodrama of Daisy and her daughter in a hospital room strikes me as something you'd fine on "The Bold and the Beautiful." Overall, this film is pretty disappointing. THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS FILM: -The cinematography -An outstanding musical score -Make-up, costumes, and set design -Clever flashback scenesTHE DEFICIENCIES: -Character development -A viable plot -Emotion</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely crafted, but ultimately superficial and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is its gimmick. It relies on the concept of Benjamin Button's reversed aging to stand out, but yet, throughout the nearly three-hour runtime, this very concept is never explored in any depth. When Benjamin is asked what it's like to grow younger, he gives a bland response about only being inside himself looking out. Likewise, all the people Benjamin encounters seem to immediately adapt a natural acceptance of his condition, calling him "unusual" and leaving it at that, which does little to add to the immersion of the movie. "Oh, so you can fly, breathe underwater and lift locomotives, oh my.. what an unusual boy you are".In fact, so little effect does this reversed-aging process have, which has undoubtedly become the main attention-gatherer for this film; that you could essentially do away with the entire idea, and it would come out just about the same: a story about a man who is shunned as newborn, grow up under somewhat poor conditions, go out on a see-the-world adventure and returns home and eventually develops dementia and dies.It's not exactly a poor story, but neither is it very remarkable. An "ordinary extraordinary" life-story, if you will. Forrest Gump did this in a better way already as several reviewers have pointed out. The one thing to make this movie different was the reversed aging, but as said, that issue never really gets any screen time. No one questions its causes, no one contemplates its implications, and even Benjamin himself doesn't really have anything to say about it.So in the end, the one thing that could have made this movie interesting ends up as a sideshow. It's like going to see a movie about aliens and outer space, and realize it's actually a standard love story that's been done 100 times before, only in an outer space setting that's never really touched upon, with an alien cameo somewhere in the middle.I guess this was always the intention of the people behind the film, but it just doesn't appeal to me. Have the courage to focus on the parts of your idea that are unique, instead of desperately clinging to the warm, common ground of relationships and love so that everyone can relate to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, but well-made....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is a fantastic director... 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' proves that! But does the aging-backwards fare impress? The answer is, yes and no! The problem here, is the length and its unique treatment... every cine lover won't enjoy this one. Some will love it for its niche, while some will hate it for being a long-long biopic. Fincher brings the short-story to life beautifully with his epic direction... but script wise, the film has its loose ends. The tale of Benjamin Button leaves you curious as well. Final words,, watch this man's journey only if you're a die-hard fan of Brad Pitt and unique themes.Pluses of the film: Fincher's direction is outstanding. His Oscar-Nomination was meant to happen. Production value from all sides is A class. Performances are superb: Brad Pitt is fantastic as Ben Button. He plays his part with remarkable ease. Cate Blanchett is excellent. Taraji P.Henson is equally good. Others are good in their parts.Minuses: The theme might not attract many + the film is too lenghty.on the whole, this man's journey is entertaining,boring and adventurous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and Interesting But Not Amazingly Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the problem I have with Benjamin Button: It's not amazingly different or special in its own way. I think a friend of mine summed it up as a slightly mystical and more tragic cross between Forrest Gump and The Notebook. On one end, you have the man whose life spans many great moments and scenes and his disability (mentally or aging backwards) actually barely plays a role in what would be a great life for anyone. No doubt the use of imagery, period costumes and music, and time passing are key elements in telling the story. On both ends to some degree you also have the life long romance, from friendship to lost romance to finally capturing it and there is even the story-telling from a 3rd party aspect going on.What problem I don't have is that both of those films happened to be good and while I'm not saying Button rips them off, it hardly does anything that makes it powerful in its rite like them.What does it do well? Of course the aging-CGI is impressive and the makeup for everyone is excellent. The costumes are top quality and this movie does a better job of portraying time passing without the 'in your face' historical notes and blatant music overkill that Gump used. While the lead acting is good (Elle Fanning has a nice little part), it's largely out shown by the underrated Taraji P. Henson and an excellent side role by Tilda Swinton (who has not lost a step since Michael Clayton). Some of the side and smaller roles of this film do a better job of defining his life and experiences than the character himself. If you're into amazing, panoramic scenery with impressive makeup, CGI, and period sets and costumes, this film is a solid 9 out of 10.What is it missing is pop. The seemingly deep devotion and realistic portrayal of young and unbridled love pushed the Notebook along strongly. In Gump, not only were his unintentional involvements in historical and popular events funny but it also flowed as smoothly as the metaphorical feather in the story. This story...well it didn't flow for me. The slightly tragic and pained romance, to me lacked magic. It lacked punch and in the end, it was a story that really lacked "Oomph". It had lots of scenery and beauty to it but plot-wise didn't deliver. It hung several times out there and yet disappointed me each time. Instead it stuck to a rather bland, mystical and magical sort of tone to his life and an unconventional romance.I'd 9/10 for elements from costumes, sets, cinematography, and makeup. A 10/10 for aging effects. The acting is a 7/10 with most great parts being smaller ones and a 6/10 for plot. It has a nice hook but the actual plot lacks originality or anything special to it.If you want to watch a movie for its visual aspects at a very high level, this is a new classical must see. If you want a truly great romance, there are many better out there. I won't say this is a bad movie, it's definitely worth seeing but it's not the instant classic some paint it as. It's a great movie for appealing to a sense of wonder and ones eyes and maybe ones spirit but certainly not to the romantic heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A haunting and forever lasting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one film that has defined watching films as a whole. It's emotional, clever, witty and epic in all the right ways possible. The film makes audiences think of the value of life and how important a special moment is. As the tag line states-"Life isn't measured in minutes but in moments" which brings the film to a more profound and dramatic level of a cinematic experience.The concept is viscerally brilliant to watch as is the unique and bold direction led by David Fincher. The acting though of coarse, is something beyond the extraordinary and is accomplished in great leaps and bounds by the two leads. Up to this point in his film career, Brad Pitt has served his most emotional and boldy moving part to date. I couldn't honestly think of another actor of our generation who could have done a better job, and Pitt absolutely nailed it. Every line is spoken in an extremely emotional way as if it were him actually there.The direction is a masterpiece in it's own accord and thoroughly brings Fincher to master status and one of Hollywood's brightest directors working today. Every scene is composed in thought and emotion and clearly delivers Fincher as a director of huge importance.Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a forever lasting film that will be remembered for generations to come.</fullReview>

DO think this is 2009 one of the best movies, if not one of few I really loves to watch since forever. The intro is in slow pace just like the storytelling of oldies, however, it perfectly and slowly seep into the real story. I really love the Clock concept at the beginning and the end. Don't want to spoil anybody so wont go into details, the movie it just go better and better every scene is memorable, maybe its some kind of sad and making some feel old and time passing.Its long time since I watched The Notebook in 2004, and Into the Wild in 2007, this year 2009 the Curious Case of Benjamin will be my Film of the Year, and just hope it will grow old but be Infinity like time into human history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, is should say that this is a lovely movie. it's one of those films where you come out of the cinema feeling that you got more then your moneys worth or where you have no real second thoughts to buying it in high def blu-ray rather then DVD because you want see the fantastic cinematography in every bit of glory. My main issue with the film is it could have been much more. For a man in such an awkward predicament we really don't see much of what he feels about it, the most we understand his feelings are in the opening 30 minutes of a 2 hour, 45 minute film . It would have been great to feel whether pitt is sad or happy about the whole thing. Rather all we see is a general biography of the man, a narration of events rather than an analysis into the character of benjamin button. Despite pitt being the narrator, it may have well been an outsider. in most case we get told the obvious, what is happening in that scene and the emotion in the characters but it never goes beyond that. we're rarely told how key events impact his core thoughts, whether they are life changing or unimportant, what he thinks of what's going on around him and such. If we got deeper insight into pitt's character this would have been a magnificent film Performances are good all round but people who say that this is pitt's finest performance are clearly wrong. not much is demanded of him, other then to look sweet and humble. you cant compare this to him in fight club and se7en.without doubt it's a very good movie. a lovely story that you will get hooked to, and fall in love with (Believe me, DVD sales will me massive) and i can recommend that you really should see it, but it's simplicity in storytelling stops it from crossing from good to great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really one of the best movies I've ever watched lately, It's really almost optimum in all (Performance, makeup, photography, selection of the characters, places and decorations, ...) really this masterpiece deserved all it was nominated for ..The story is mainly about the reading in the dairy of Benjamin Button, these diaries were read by Caroline (Julia Ormond) - A young lady - to her dying mother: Mrs Daisy (Cate Blanchett) in the hospital under a quite threat of a nearing twister heading to this hospital ..The dying mother Daisy mentioned the story of the great clock in the station which was designed and manufactured by Monsieur Gateau (Faune A. Chambers)in 1918, as a result for his great sorrow and pain for the loss for his only son in the great war, he had designed the clock to tick backwards in the reverse direction and he went away ..The diaries were dated on 1985 and were written by Benjamin Button, he talked about his strange and curious case since his birth, his mother died after she gave him birth in 1918 after the end of the great WWI, his father was obsessed by the idea that the baby is a freak, got rid of him by leaving him at the door of a retirement care house, A maid in this retirement house called Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) found him and took care of him as a son to her as she has a problem and can't give birth to a baby ..It was found that he baby had all the diseases and look of an aging dying old man (An old man of about 85 years old !!) like the cataract, deafness, .. etc and the doctor predicted that the baby won't last living more than days or weeks at most!! The baby lived .. and had grown up under the care of the kind Queenie to be like a very old man like those in the retirement house .. as he was 5 years old he looked like an 80 years old aging man ..By time it was clear that Benjamin Button was getting younger in body and look while he was getting older and more mature in mentality over the time. he had regained the ability to walk normally, his hearing became better and his sight became sharper .. he met Daisy (Cate Blanchett) as she was a little child living with her old grandmother Tizzy in the retirement house, Daisy liked Benjamin and liked to be closer to him since the first time she saw him ...Life went on with Benjamin who was getting younger and younger .. and he gained the experiences of life as he was getting younger, he learned to drink, make love and relationships and to work .. he faced a lot of situations like facing a German U-boat on the boat he was working on .. he found his father Mr Thomas Button who told him the truth about his life before he die ..Finally he found Daisy again .. she was working as a famous Ballet dancer and living a dissolute life and ignored him .. she had a terrible accident in Paris and everybody left her except him .. this made her love him in return .. now she was 43 years old while he was in the form of a young man in the middle of 30s of his age .. they lived in a continuous love .. she became pregnant and gave birth ..They realized that time is stronger than them .. Daisy became older and Benjamin became younger and he realized that he can no longer live with her and take care of the baby Caroline .. and so he left them and went away ..At last Benjamin became an old boy and then a baby .. old Daisy took care of him .. at the end of year 2002 .. the old station clock made by Monsieur Gateau was replaced by a new one .. in the year 2003 and in a tragic scene .. between the arms of Daisy, Benjamin dies .. after the end of the story the dying Daisy dies in peace ..Really a great picture and performance and one of the best ever movies I had ever seen to Brad Pitt who reached the top in his performance in performing the different ages of Benjamin Button and also by Cate Blanchett which was in her best roles as Daisy as a teenager girl and a dancer with no sense of responsibility then a lover then a mother and an old lady ..also the makeup, directing and decorations were excellent and returning us back to the days of the 30s, 40s, and 50s with high professionalism .. also the great human meanings and scenes .. You are you .. you are your soul and not only your body .. love has no age or era ..Thanks Braddie !! *** Lo'ay</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The central premise of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that the title protagonist doesn't age, but rather grows steadily younger throughout the film. He is born the size of a newborn, but his body is racked with the ailments of an old man ? - arthritis, cataracts, wrinkles, etc. The story follows his seven decades of existence as a backward ride through a forward moving society, until he progresses/regresses and dies as an infant. It is a bizarre and strangely pointless concept, which seemingly would have to carry with it a message about life and living, otherwise, why bother telling it. But for all of its lush storytelling and sometimes strikingly beautiful imagery, BENJAMIN BUTTON is a very long film with nothing of any real relevance to say.There are several problems here. One, though the film can illustrate his physical change through make up and special effects, it can't ? or at least, doesn't ? capture the emotional and psychological effects of such a development. To be a child, with all of the expanding wonderment that entails, but to be trapped in a decrepit, aged body, would have to carry with it a remarkable psychological burden. The story, as penned from F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story by Eric Roth, sidesteps this by contriving circumstances wherein young Benjamin is raised in an old folks home. Thus the story gives us a character, who by his very nature is an outsider, but places him in a cocoon during his formative years where his malady is seemingly perfectly natural and accepted. He is an old man raised in an environment of old people. Where is the drama in that? In his middle years, aged twenty to fifty or sixty, his age isn't that important to what he does; and his last years, where he shrinks from a teen to a tot, are rushed through with little concern for their importance.But the retirement home isn't the only place where the film negates Benjamin's curious condition. The film details his growing younger and the other characters are always noting the change, but no one seems particularly surprised, let alone shocked by it. Though years pass between the times Benjamin sees various characters, there is no questioning that the suddenly younger Benjamin is who he says he is and only the mildest of confusion about the situation. And given the uniqueness of his condition, it would seem that it would be a biological anomaly that would warrant genuine scientific study, perhaps even popular notoriety; but that isn't the case. The story plays out like an unrealistic fairy tale set against a realistic background, yet its only moral seems to be that it is painful to outlive the people you love -- which is true with or without the backward growth gimmick.For all the purpose it carries, the story could just as easily have abandoned the anti-aging tricks and it wouldn't have had much effect on the events in Benjamin's life; with little change, the same story could have been told had Benjamin aged naturally. Maybe, free of the central gimmick, the film might have been more interesting, or more honest anyway. As is, the film contains little wisdom about the joys and pains of growth and even less about how one's age is reflected in one's environment.The film's biggest problem however is that Benjamin Button isn't that interesting as a character. At least, not as played by Brad Pitt. The incredibility of the story could be accepted or forgiven if Benjamin was a person worth being concerned about. But there is nothing larger than life about Benjamin; and other than his wartime adventures, there really isn't much that happens in his life that is all that remarkable -- falling in love, losing love, becoming a father, facing the death of loved ones, etc. These everyday joys and tragedies could be powerful if presented as part of the life of a colorful and caring character, but in Pitt's hands, Benjamin is a quiet, polite and even docile person. Pitt gives us a character who is simply rather banal. If the point of the story is that Benjamin's biological oddity is what makes him distant and aloof, then the film does a poor job of making that clear. The most curious aspect of Benjamin Button's existence is that after spending several hours with him, and experiencing all the ups and downs of his life, one is likely to be at a loss to remember him at all.What makes BENJAMIN BUTTON a curious case is trying to figure why it was even made. Devoid of an intriguing center in Benjamin and wrapped in an elaborate and meaningless gimmick involving his reverse aging, the film is a harmless, if long-winded trifle. BENJAMIN BUTTON is like its protagonist, a pleasant enough acquaintance, but one that will pass through your life with barely a ripple of difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitt best work very</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" would seem to have everything going for it - major stars, an enormous budget, and a conceit that can't be beat. However, in the end it's that very conceit that hamstrings an otherwise wondrous piece of movie-making.Fincher's characters tend to be psychos, paranoiacs, obsessives, some of whom struggle vainly against the darkness in their own souls, but many others who have embraced it. Benjamin Button is none of the above, and that's perhaps his problem. Button, born "under unusual circumstances" in 1918 New Orleans, spends his early life literally surrounded by death, raised, as he is, by an orderly in a home for the elderly. As a prematurely old man himself (an effect achieved by fantastic MOCAP work from Pitt), perhaps it's not surprising that as he grows into a body with which he may truly engage the world, he is more content to observe appreciably.Now, this may be true to the spirit of the character, but unfortunately for Fincher and his screenwriter, Eric Roth, it doesn't make for very interesting cinema. At a recent screening, Roth referred to Button's character as the "anti-Gump", a classification that seemed both apt and problematic. This film will certainly earn comparisons to Robert Zemeckis' modern classic(also written by Roth), but where that film had a truly fascinating central character, who experienced as many mistakes and tragedies as victories and happiness, Fincher and Roth's protagonist is a cipher. There's a telling sequence around the middle of the film, where Button, by now a merchant seaman holed up in a dingy hotel in Murmansk, strikes up a relationship with a bored wife of a minor British official (Tilda Swinton). Unable to sleep, they meet each night for tea and good conversation (and later, sex). But instead of letting us hear what those conversations are about, he simply creates a montage, set to music, of various meetings fading into one another. By the time Swinton's character departs the film, we know next to nothing new about Benjamin other than that he has trouble sleeping and likes hot tea. The fact is that even Swinton's character, on screen for perhaps fifteen minutes, is more engaging. It's a frustrating glimpse of what might have been, had the filmmakers chosen to put the character before the gimmick, instead of the other way around.Which brings us to Cate Blanchett. As Daisy, whom Benjamin meets as a young girl and who grows into a luminously beautiful and troubled ballet dancer, Blanchett shines as brightly as she ever has on screen. Unlike Benjamin, Daisy is not content to simply accept whatever life throws her way - she has dreams and attempts to act on them, and does her best to lead a normal, interesting life. Benjamin, passive as always, must quietly observe as she grows out of the playmate of his "youth" and into a somewhat headstrong woman who nonetheless possessed of enormous potential. His loyalty pays off, though, when circumstances bring them together again at a time when they both happen to be the same age - a fleeting moment, and one they will cherish. But again, the relationship between couple and audience is one-sided, because while we can see why Daisy would wish to return to the rock-steady loyalty of Benjamin, it's unclear what he feels about her other than a regard (she's certainly lovely enough). We are told in rather soggy voice-over narration (spread throughout the film) that Daisy is "the most beautiful person I'd ever seen", but that's all we'll get.And so it goes, for nearly three hours. We cut frequently, and irritatingly, back to a modern-day hospital in New Orleans, where a dying Daisy asks her daughter (Julia Ormond) to read to her from Benjamin's diary as Hurricane Katrina pounds on the windows. There's something being said in these scenes about regret and the passage of time, but the appealing Ormond's character is one-note, and Blanchett seems nearly suffocated under pounds of old age makeup. It's from this diary whence springs Benjamin's narration, but, as Mr. Roth pointed out, Gump this ain't. Suffice it to say that the budget is up there on screen as we go on this strange trip through the twentieth century with Brad Pitt as our guide. A possibly unintentional (I doubt it) laugh arises mid-film when Benjamin finally reaches something around Pitt's own age. He strides into a garage in the mid-50's, decked out in leather jacket and shades, and whips a tarp off a motorcycle, on which he speeds out to the harbor to do some bare-chested sailing on a boat he builds himself (the shades remain on his head). It's a knowing wink to the wish-fulfillment of the casting - who wouldn't want their old crotchety husband to get younger and younger until they looked like Brad Pitt? - and a clever way to underscore the underlying tragedy of the situation. Sure, he looks like Brad Pitt in "Fight Club", "Se7en", "Thelma &amp; Louise", but eventually he's going to look like Brad Pitt in "Cutting Class", and then Brad Pitt in seventh grade, and finally Brad Pitt as a toddler, and that's not so sexy.Pitt does a fine job. It's a pity that Fincher, who has used him to such great effect twice before, didn't let him cut loose. Instead this is his most low-key performance since Meet Joe Black, in which he played Death, who was really just a nice young man curious about the world. Come to think of it, that's pretty much all that Benjamin Button is, and, if nothing else, he knows more about death than just about anybody around. Too bad that a film that means to affirm life turns out to be rather lifeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film, but no masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to see this movie, my expectations where high. I am a huge fan of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and Fincher's C.V is highly admirable. However there is something missing in this film that prevents it from entering the dizzy heights masterpieces. There is no denying that I enjoyed the film a lot, as the plot was interesting and deeply moving at times, and the effects to make Pitt look old and then young are unbelievable. But as I said before there is something lacking in the complete package, where as a film like Forrest Gump, I feel was as good as that film good be. It is common to mention the two films in the same breath and for me Forrest Gump was the more accomplished piece. I couldn't help but leave the cinema thinking that it could have given the audience more, not much more, but that cherry on the top that truly makes movies stand out. I highly recommend this film based on its terrific story and great effects, however don't set the bar too high, which was perhaps my mistake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher is well known for his Thrilling pictures like Seven or The Game (Alien 3 is not counted) and others but i feel that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is something different. some story of reverse growing up and the problems based on it.I by myself did'nt expect this movie . this year's Academy Awars Nominated pictures are rarely good . as i understood the subject,every year the choice of Academy is based on movies which have been shown in December. because of that movies like this and The Reader ,Frost/Nixon ,Milk and Slumdog Millionaire are chosen.i declare that the absence of Revelutionary Road is deeply felt.but somehow this year's movies are perfect.Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt)'s life starts with a disaster.when he Born's his face and body condition declares the strange condition . he looks like a 90 years old man.he is thrown out of his house by his father Thomas Button(Jason Flemyng) after his mother passed away.and he is raised with old people with a kind black woman Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who Benjamin considers her as his mama . later he visits a young girl Daisy and he kind of like her.as time going by,Benjamin grows younger and he leaves the house . he goes to sea and he works on a boat . Daisy(Cate Blanchett) is now a well qualified Dancer and she comes back to visit Benjamin.and they fall in love with each other ,but the problems and troubles are on the way...hack of a storyline.this movie is going on reverse way itself.and i am sure that there are people in world that have the same condition of Benjamin.some of us really grow younger than do it on its proper way.the movie really attracted me.this tragedy of growing young and its weird kind of life .as Benjamin declares the actual consequences of such lifetime.and for that this is a great movie . but rarely deserves the award for best picture of the year.Brad Pitt performs some of the Best Performancrs in his acting career.i do admire the couple of Brad/Angie for their this years pro choices of roles and it fitting for them .Pitt's Benjamin Button is one of the best roles he has ever performed . his way of talking and behaving plus the growing young shows that the man is proved for being a decent actor. Cate Blanchett is as good as always.but in this movie her performing is under the influence of Pitt's strong acting.Cate is good.and for the record Taraji P. Henson is thrilling.as Queenie she gives a great job and shows a heartbreaking performance.after all i did'nt expexct a good movie from David Fincher.starting your way of directing with Alien3(1992) may give a hard backbone fall to any director.but Fincher separate the path by making Seven(1995),Fight Club(1999) and this picture from rotten directors and shows a outstanding kind of job.great movie. 9 from 10 ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love epics. Movies should be made like that: sweeping tales that light up the big screen. But they're not, at least not the ones that the Academy seems to like these days. The Reader, Milk and Frost/Nixon- all of which have been nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars- are more HBO-style made-for-TV movies than Epics (which is not to say that they aren't well-made). The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is unabashedly epic, and had it not been for Slumdog Millionaire, it would have, despite its shortcomings, been my favorite film of the year. I've always suspected that the really great looking actors &amp; actresses suffer from an acting- handicap: their perfect good looks lead us to think of them in terms of gods &amp; goddesses, and therefore any effort by them to play human beings is seen as flawed. This works well for those who can't act at all- like Salman Khan- as it compensates amply for their lack of skill; but for those who can act- and I mean, really act- it's nothing short of a curse. Brad Pitt falls in the latter category. He is perhaps the most underrated actor of our time- principally because of his extraordinary good looks. No wonder he opted to act in a film in which the first-shot of him is as a horribly deformed baby that even his father doesn't want. And then of course, he begins to grow younger and also, more and more like the actual Brad Bitt...The trick, I guess, was for Mr. Pitt to look the various ages he portrays in- and as- Benjamin Button. The wizardry of special effects can only do so much; the rest was up to him, really. (Remember Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man- back when they didn't have this kind of technology.) He has terrific company in the form of three extremely gifted actresses: his mother (Taraji Henson), the love of his life (Cate Blanchett), and his fling (Tilda Swinton). Julia Ormond plays his daughter, but she hardly ever leaves the room. In any event, we remember them all having done these kind of roles before- but not so for Mr. Pitt. (Not that he hasn't but we just don't remember him doing them.)The entire premise of the film, taken from a 1920s short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, seems to me to be needlessly weird; despite going through great pains to make it look believable, it simply doesn't. After all, wouldn't a man who defies the most fundamental law of nature- that we must all grow old and die- attract our news-obsessed society's attention? Mr. Button, however, does not, leading a relatively uneventful unnoticed existence. Also, the whole business of a 90 year old man falling in love with a 9 year old girl edges a bit too close to bigotry for my taste.But the single greatest flaw with this film is that we've already seen it before. Not one with the same title of course, but the way the tale is told. In case you are wondering, let me give you a clue. Two words: Eric Roth. He was the guy who wrote the screenplay for Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump. The only real difference between the two films is that while Mr. Gump grows older; Mr. Button becomes younger. Everything else- every single scene, every single character they come into contact with, every single shot, even the plot- are almost identical. The Academy has already honored Forrest Gump once before; there is, in my opinion, no point in doing so again.</fullReview>

There were some parts where he was in his 40's for a very long time and also when suddenly he started getting young extremely fast towards the end. I didn't enjoy the ending that much.

Why would he be afraid of what's under the stairs as a kid if he had the mind of a 70 year-old? And while the film milked the aging effect with every phase, it left out the one that I was most interested in -- how did he deal with the transition from adult body to child body, while having a fully mature mind? Bit of a cheat going gaga so early, I thought.... Though i suppose the simple answer is that it would've been to much for a child actor to handle...Again, very Twilight Zone ...but i liked that show</fullReview>

Unfortunately I was right. I can't say anything for acting. The story was interesting too, but typical Hollywood found a nice story and just exaggerated it. The movie is too long and after all that waiting you don't get anything in the end. The idea was interesting like I said, but the movie was all that, nothing more. I couldn't believe that he became a baby at the end of the movie. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, but it doesn't deserve 8.3 rating. I gave 7 for good acting and different idea.

		<shortDescription>Stunning film but hindered by slow pacing and excessive duration - 86%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Working yet again on Valentine's Day meant that I had to surprise my Better Half the following day and seeing as she'd been keen to see this, I bought two tickets and we went for it. Judging by the reviews, it seems a real Marmite picture - some love it while others hate it. In truth, it isn't as bad as some have said but this is a real achievement of a film. Everything from acting, direction, story and soundtrack is spot on but somehow, it just fails to come together. It felt like a pocket watch, relentlessly telling its story with absolutely no change in pace at all.At the end of the First World War in New Orleans, Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is born in unusual circumstances - his new-born frame has all the features of a eighty year old man. Abandoned by his father Thomas (Jason Flemyng), Benjamin is raised in a nursing house by the kindly Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) as an old man but soon, he becomes stronger, taller and the symptoms of his "old age" start to reverse. As Benjamin Button grows younger, he meets and falls in love with a flame-haired young girl called Daisy (Cate Blanchett) and eventually, he sets out to discover more about life, the world and the people around him.Essentially "Forrest Gump 2", "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" is one of the movies cleaning up during this awards season, at least if "Slumdog Millionaire" wasn't. But it's easy to understand why - this is a true epic, lasting a bum-numbing 3 hours plus and covering some ninety years of (mostly) US history. And in case you were worried about the look of the thing (like me) then worry not. The sheer amount of effort that went into making the characters age was not wasted and not one character suffers as a result. Naturally, Pitt is getting all the plaudits but in truth, the entire cast is near flawless led by Blanchett, Henson and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. And all of the cast are helped by a stunning script that rarely lets your attention wonder, despite the excessive duration. However, it is very predictable - at no point does the script deviate from what you expect. But as a study of love, life and death then this will be hard to top.My problem, besides the over-long duration, was that it was way too predictable. Like a clock, you knew what was happening next and when it was going to happen. It reminded me of a car journey I once took in Scotland where we were following the coastline of various lochs and weaving around mountains, forests and white-water rivers. It was all very pretty and very enjoyable but it took us about five hours to get to where we were going, by which time I'd had enough. "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" is exactly like that. Don't get me wrong, I fully understand why it is getting awards and nominations and the like but if only it was better paced and more surprising, this would be a stone-cold classic. But it's still a great film that serious film fans would do well to watch - just make sure you go to the toilet first and stock up with snacks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand all the critics attacking this gem of modern cinematography accusing this movie to be too abstract, too unusual, too unrealistic to be intense, moving, beautiful. Who said that cinema is all about telling true stories, about true events or true characters? We have emotions inside, and, as humans, we need to have our emotions, our feelings, touched by a movie that sometimes makes us think about things greater than us, like life, like all the tiny passing moments of pure joy, like the people we love, like the people we loose during a lifetime. This, and much, much more is "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". There is so much stuff, so much content beneath the surface of this wonderful adult tale.The direction of David Fincher is absolutely amazing. We've got already a demonstration of his talents with perfect movies like "Fight Club", or his underrated vision of "Alien 3", the research of perfection, the colors always gray-shaded, the perfect photography of the scenes. This movie is no exceptions: it's perfect. All the scenes in all the sceneries (from old New Orleans, to Russia, passing through a moving set in the ocean).The special effects are incredible: u can't tell where there's CGI here and where there's only an incredible makeup work to transform Brad Pitt in an old man then in a teenager, or the makeup work on Cate Blanchett (acting beautifully in her role).The movie is long, yes, but it's about 3 hours of poetry, an hymn to life and to people we love,and about the short, but intense,pure moment of life. All moving backwards, like the clock at the train station at the beginning of the movie. Poetry moving backwards.All this magic is decorated with a beautiful soundtrack performed by Alexandre Desplat.In conclusion, "Benjamin Button" wants to tell us a story: a story about life seen with the eyes of a man aging backwards, of an almost impossible love, and a story about the endless, infinite, cycle of life.It's impossible to not appreciate such ambitious, yet strange movie. It's impossible to remain cold at the end of this intense, magic voyage through time. It's a movie everybody must see, because everybody must see life through the eyes of Benjamin Butt once...at least...10/10</fullReview>

It is a shame that this is slipping down the Top 250, it should be right up there, certainly with Slumdog Millionaire.

		<shortDescription>Its a curiouse thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as directors go, David Fincher ranks among thoses I idolise. His gentle interplay with dark and light, fun and sorrow and most importantly the real and the surreal. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't his greatest movie, his most lavish movie, but not his greatest. What's striking is the way Finchers worst still manages to be better than most director's best attempts. Despite some negative criticisms, Benjamin Button is a beautiful movie, both tender and tremendous. If not overly emotional. It manages to sustain both style and substance where something like "Australia" dropped the ball. Finchers movie is well worth the wait and a certainty at this year's Oscars.One thing that resonates wonderfully is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, reunited after starring together in the 2007 movie "Babel", there characters show development and while there not all going in the same direction you can feel them growing, learning with age, or youth in this case. It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy, old-school movie -- employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop -- did it for me.David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's story, re-teams the director with Brad Pitt, who takes on the title role. What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. Brad Pitt gives a bravura, Oscar-caliber turn in Fincher's modernist epic yet lyrical tale, which bears resemblance in structure and magical realism to Forrest Gump (both penned by Eric Roth), but without that film's simplistic morality and sentimentality This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness. Cate Blanchett co-stars along with Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond. If there's one thing this films is going to be remembered by its the beautifully subtle yet equally frightening make up effect sued on both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The creators blended both visual effect with make-up effect to create some of the most awe inspiring visual effect to dat. You believe in these characters because the actors playing them are shown at every stage of their life. Aptly for a film so concerned with time, Button is 13 minutes shy of three hours and just flies by. If this is Fincher selling out, can he sell out more often please? An epic, melancholic romance that employs a multi-generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects. It's a testament to Fincher's skill as a storyteller that the film actually works, albeit sporadically. There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses.Verdict: Touching yet never tedious, sensitive yet never overly sentimental. Button balances all of its elements perfectly and while the running time may scare some, the movie flew by in manner of seconds merely due to the charm and charisma of its leads. Tantalizing, touching and timeless - an epic fable revolving around mortality. For my overall rating I give The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie has very interesting and moving theme and is very well made. I really enjoyed the lost-and-found father of Benjamin and his father, the lost-and-found love of Benjamin and Daisy and even the stepmother's love.In the beginning I was a little bored because it seemed to me the movie would turn a cheap comedy or worse soap opera movie but I was absolutely wrong.The horde of simple themes connected together in such a light and touching way made me become Benjamin.I enjoyed the true mother love he was given by a totally strange woman. I really felt very strange being a child in an adult body and I really wished to be useful. And so I underwent all the adventures on the sea, the public house visits. (Enough the story-line.) The second thing I truly fancy about the film are the actors' starrings. Mr. Pitt is really good actor and shows again and again he can handle a lot of roles not looking strange and unnatural, he was just the opposite.Also Mrs. Blanchett poetric acting and almost higher sphere's apparel made the film just something better than the average films.Anyway, there was one thing that spilled my impression and it was the unnatural body change of Benjamin. In the beginning it was fine, but when he was old and started becoming smaller and smaller, I didn't believe something like that could be ever possible (and yet don't believe so). I would rather appreciate him staying big and just getting the childisher and child-liker look. This way it looked like a fantasy to me and didn't fit the whole story line.There's another thing I want to write about and its the similarity with Forrest Gump. I didn't find any, actually. Maybe there were some moments you can see something similar, but you have to try really hard. I saw the movie before reading any review on it and not being told about the Forrest I would never think of similarities there.I enjoyed it really much and sincerely advise everyone to try it and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whimsy and eloquent dance on life, beautiful and tragic whilst human and fantastic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fairy tales and fables come in all sorts of different forms, the least of which certainly not being the film, and while the novel may have came first, there still remains a certain extra-dimensional beauty to seeing a good piece of fantastical fiction being pulled off up on that giant silver screen. At risk of over-romanticising what is nevertheless a fairytale grounded deeply in the human spirit and heart, I submit that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is exactly that; it's a rare example of an eloquent dance synchronised along to the melancholic keys of a piano played within a rustic bar on the edge of New Orleans. It's tangible, real, and yet ethereal and poignantly larger than life at the same time. Yet there remains one key aspect to Benjamin's story here that most fables fail to resolve - that is that a key theme, in fact, the absolute idea behind his story is the idea of the entirety of life, death and everything between; not just the happy parts, or the struggles, but the whole of that journey in all its details. Of course, Benjamin's case isn't exactly what you'd call "normal", and yet despite its somewhat fantastical façade and makeup, there is still plenty of humanity on show here that always plays first and foremost to the backing of Mr. Button's curious, but harrowing tale.For director David Fincher, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button represents a dive further into long, grand pieces of character-driven work largely dominated by larger than life statements. Indeed, as was a somewhat unfortunate flaw within Fincher's previous work Zodiac, the only problem prevalent here is that his feature tends to get overwhelmed by the size, scale and scope of the story to which he is trying to tell. Granted, telling eighty years of mans life, and doing so backwards -in a sense-, is no easy thing to do, but it remains a testament to the ambitious director and indeed the movie itself that much of the scrawling runtime is paced evenly enough to avoid any major disjointedness. Despite this sporadically distracting flaw, Benjamin Button showcases Fincher's ability to draw human characters out of surreal situations to the point where emotional response is consistently drawn from the audience without resorting to cheap ploys and devices. Instead the feature builds characters, and relations which transpire within a somewhat meagre plot, telling their stories in an eloquent, refined and subtle manner; this, in contrast to Benjamin's unique disposition in that he ages backwards, provides a fairytale that caters to the viewer's romantic and realist sides in ways that only the best of art can claim to do.Like the best of fairy tales however, there remains a poignant mix of styles to Benjamin's story that reaches beyond just plain character drama and romance. There's action, comedy, even a little bittersweet lust for life in there too, and while much of this would be easy to misplace and in turn spoil the coherency of the story, Fincher does well to keep things consistently engaging regardless. Most of this of course lies ?for the most part- outside of Fincher's direct control however, in the form of Brad Pit who portrays Mr. Button here in what is undoubtedly a career defining performance. He, his co-stars and his romantic interest played by Cate Blanchett reflect the majestic nature of Benjamin's story without loosing touch of their distinct human qualities. Sure enough there remains some degree of ill-fated dissonance to Benjamin and Daisy's romance as a direct result of their tragic dispositions, but despite a somewhat anti-climactic uniting of the couple of during the movie's middle act, the movie retains its whimsy, airy charm throughout. It's not a perfectly constructed romance by any means, and this again is a detrimental result of the movie's extremely large scope at trying to tell a fleeting romance within such a large time scale, but the emotive power of the story is not without its impact during the first and last hours.While it would be presumptuous to walk from a showing of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with the rose-tinted view that it represents cinema and storytelling in perfection, such an occasion is only rarely and briefly awarded to cinema goers. Yet, despite the fact that Fincher here delivers a film that has quite a few failings that more discerning viewers will be disgruntled with, there is nevertheless no denying the simple power of Benjamin's Forest Gump ¬tinged biographical story. What it represents is a whimsy and eloquent dance on life, beautiful and tragic whilst human and fantastic. Indeed, by the time the curtain closes on Mr. Button's curious case, the impact of his story remains with you long after the credits stop rolling; it's the kind of film that is imperfect but not at the expense of making a statement so poignant and hard hitting that the movie as a whole succeeds in being irrefutably futile to resist in its warm embrace. Most importantly and somewhat ironically however is that Benjamin's story provides an almost ageless and unforgettable tale that simply uplifts and emotionally resonates without overly romanticising the small nuances of life. Reflected during one of the movie's strongest sequences, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button takes to heart that life is a strange series of events, ostensibly random and yet poetically beautiful; indeed, somewhere between the chaos theory and that of predestination lies Benjamin Button- and sure, it can be a bumpy ride, unpredictable and seemingly cruel in design, but Benjamin ascertains that that's just life, and that's exactly what Fincher and Roth deliver here.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweeping odyssey, Fincher's epic is film of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is often clichéd that Oscar-winning films should be complex, questioning and deep yet Benjamin Button is a outstanding rebuttal to this cliché. Fincher's film is extremely simple whether it the direction or the story, this is because this is a simple story of a simple man living a simple but ultimately tragic life. This premise was constantly interesting; the thought of being born old and growing younger, certainly a mind-blowing concept. Button experiences both love and sadness as he watches his family and friends age older and he age younger.This film achieves on both a technical level and a cinematic level. As the film progresses, the astonishing visual effect and make-up allow for a truly realistic and believable depiction of what an older and younger Brad Pitt would look like. In fact, the special effects were flawless. Cinematically, the audience is thrown through a plethora of emotions including pity, laughter, sadness and happiness. In that sense, the film is well-rounded. The plot was enticing, the art direction was stunning and the performances were excellent especially Brad Pitt.Overall, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' can be perceived as a tragedy, Button's outrageous disease holds him back from leading a fulfilling life that he deserves and wants. This is what made the ending provoke shock, poignancy and reflection of life as a whole and how we should live and appreciate it.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a 21st century epic; concentrated, illustrious yet outstandingly simple. A tour de force of cinema that is no doubt the best picture of the year.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was born my mom said I looked like an old man. Like everyone else, I turned out to be pretty normal, unlike The Curious Case of Benjamin Button where he's physically developing in the opposite, suffering from common aged ailments like cataracts, hearing, and arthritis first, but mentally developing in proper chronology. One can imagine the challenges of everyone thinking you'll die soon enough, before a miracle actually happens and you're like having drunk some elixir of life, probably a little too much too.Some would compare David Fincher's movie to Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump. Both have charismatic characters living out a dream of a life despite the challenges that life had unfairly laid out for them, one being mentally slow, the other being physically not quite right. Like Gump, Button (Brad Pitt in various astounding make up and effects) lives an extremely fulfilling life, having their tale peppered with significant ground breaking events, some of which they get involved in, others just serving as bookends in a narrative that span lifetimes. These become wonderful stories to tell, like Tim Burton's Big Fish, and actually, quite inspiring too to live a life seizing any opportunities that come your way.Similarly, Ben Button has a strong mother character to take care of him, and here's where Taraji P. Henson's Queenie gets her supporting Oscar nod. Working in the home for the aged, Ben's father Thomas (Jason Flemyng) abandons the odd looking infant at the footsteps of the home, only for Queenie to show extreme compassion, and to bring up the infant like her own, full of love, blind to the fact that he is physically very different from everyone else. And Love is something Ben isn't falling short of, having to meet and love the very captivating Daisy (Cate Blanchett), where their initial encounter being very much frowned upon, like a dirty old man trying to take advantage of a sweet young thing.It is this love that anchors the bulk of the second act, which makes it touching yet sad as you know of the collision course where this love is heading toward. I recall a scene in another movie, and you may have heard variations of this tale, where a woman asks her husband whom he preferred to meet their Maker first. The man says for his wife to kick the bucket before he does, only so because he wouldn't want her to suffer from a broken heart before her time, and to let him be punished that way instead. It is this nagging feeling that the characters experience, and both Blanchett and Pitt's performances allow the audience to empathize.David Fincher is best known for his darker movies like Panic Room, Fight Glub, Se7en, and Zodiac, and I thought The Curious Case of Benjamin Button continues this trend, in that it's draped in melancholy through and through. There's always a sad tinge to the events in Ben's life, because growing up with older people around you would mean that you experience death a lot more than growing up with peers. But that's not to say it's always doom and gloom. There are certain lighthearted moments thrown in to break the heaviness, and those lightning stories will certainly be fondly remembered way after the end credits roll. Fincher too displays some deft storytelling techniques here in keeping the narrative from turning stale, and one extremely well executed scene involved plenty of What-Ifs that lays out what Fate would have decided for anyone.To some, Benjamin Button may seem boring, but they are totally missing the point. The 166 minutes here were paced fabulously, never wasting any time, and yet providing enough breathing space to pause and appreciate the story, the characters, the art direction, and to soak in the wonderful cinematography. And not forgetting an ensemble supporting cast to prop and pad the central relationship between Ben and Daisy, from parents to friends, to everyone else that pops in and out offering life's lessons through fated encounters.The people that one meets define your life in a certain sense I believe. Through Fate we know each other, and little episodes spice your life up in ways that you cannot imagine, until you look back and wonder just how much had gone by, and how much one had experienced. The latest Facebook meme on 25 Random Things had made me recall some wonderful moments shared with people who have entered my life at various points, and to those who think their lives are not rich, I encourage them to dig deep, and find certain joy in recalling those moments. Here, we journey with Jula Ormond's Caroline as she reads through a diary and co-narrates the story of Benjamin Button, in little episodes that grab your attention throughout.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a delightfully fine film, with an engaging story about life in itself, and deserves every single one of its 13 nominations in this year's Academy Awards. It's up against some stiff competition, but I'm fairly confident it will hold its own and not return empty handed. Definitely highly recommended, and easily an early contender as best film of the year thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curiously (Dull) Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get one thing clear straight of the bat - I love David Fincher as a director. "Fight Club", one of my favourite ever films about male-empowerment, is a post-modern masterpiece. "Seven" - the most effective Serial Killer movie of its generation featured an unhappy ending totally at odds with the typical conventions of narrative cinema, while (more importantly) being a terrifyingly dark and effective thriller. "Zodiac" on the other hand, was a fascinating period-piece study on obsession that subverted the genre to make the investigators as flawed by obsession as the criminal they were hunting. All fascinating films, all compellingly brilliant.So I was really looking forward to "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", the adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's Short Story, starring Ladies favourite Brad Pitt (who had, of course, worked so effectively with Fincher in Fight Club).Instead, after nearly 3 longish hours of admittedly beautiful cinematography I was curiously... underwhelmed. And the main problem is that Benjamin's life, though going backwards, is not really an interesting enough existence to warrant this amount of screen time. Pitt plays Ben as an observer rather than a protagonist, a watcher rather than a doer, and as a result he never seems to get particularly angry, elated, emotional or upset, even whilst being dumped, finding out his father abandoned him as a child, dodging bullets or watching his friends die (often right in front of him). This makes it hard for the audience to engage with him emotionally, and so the romance between him and his dancer love "Daisy" (Cate Blanchett), which is supposed to be the simmering hot focus of the story, barely reaches a Luke-warm temperature.It doesn't help that the writer (Eric Roth) has clearly borrowed a large chuck of his "Forrest Gump" screenplay to pen the script. The whole thing is narrated in the Deep South accent which is an unwanted and uncomfortable reminder, while heavy-handed symbolism (like the humming bird) reeks of that annoying dancing leaf. Still at least Forrest had gumption (so to speak) and was involved - sometimes ridiculously so, in the events of his own life, and that of history. Ben just sits on the sidelines, his face a perpetual blank, and whether it's caked in CGI animatronics as a wrinkled old man (pensioner) or sporting a silly grey wig with glasses (middle-aged), or even decked out in quiff and Leather jacket (early 20s) he's just not an interesting enough character to make this film a worthwhile effort. A disappointing shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good lord, this was so pretentious, it hurt. TCCOBB is the absolute dictionary definition of "self-important. Confusing length with quality seems to be an increasingly common problem (see also Dark Knight, No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood), and when it's 2 and a half hours of sixth-form debating society-quality cod-philosophising, it simply won't do. Of course it looks amazing at times, and the set design/attention to detail is pretty impressive, but the same could be said of any number of recent films at which a large CGI/SFX budget is thrown (parts of "Hotel for Dogs", for example...). Other reviewers seem to have seen this as some sort of perfectly encapsulated and realised life-lesson/fable; if so, you must have led very insular lives so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I went to see this film, I was with my whole family, we were about to see a different movie (I forgot what it was, possibly Bedtime Stories...), but I was completely thrown off my feet when I saw it. It was touching, funny, dramatic, told a great story, and had its share of action. The story tells of a man, who is born at around 85 +/-. He grows up in reverse, taking his first steps out of his wheelchair, going for a day downtown, and going on a tugboat, from which he departs the USA when he looks around his late 60's. While in Russia, he meets a woman who he falls in love with. He is put in the war on the tugboat. As he returns to the USA, he finds a girl he had a crush on when he was "young", who has since grown up and found a career. After many events, the girl falls in love with Benjamin and they are married. They have a child, and that is where I will stop. I don't believe I have given a spoiler, so I'll sum that up into fewer words. Benjamin is a nice character, he was raised that way. He has amazing adventures, interlaced with others' interesting, sometimes humorous, adventures. I know many people who cried during this movie, and rightfully so, this story will have you thinking about the movie for the rest of the week. It has many memorable quotes, some being "You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went. You could swear, curse the fates, but when it comes to the end, you have to let go."- Capt. Mike "Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?"- Mrs. Maple Among others.I can honestly say, without a doubt, this is my favorite movie OF ITS GENRE. The genre of Benjamin Button is quite unique, being mostly a drama, but also an "old-fashioned" sort of genre, and seeing the lifestyles and backgrounds change is quite interesting and fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Hollywood production of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is the best Hollywood production I have seen since King Kong in 2005 and a brave and succeeded attempt to combine visual spectacle with meaning. Finally an America movie that deals with what it means being human; living and growing old, and remembering the ones who crossed our paths. Some of those people were memorable. Even more than the ballet-dancer for me the person of this movie was the wonderful swimming lady with the dreamy eerie voice, who couldn't help but redo her attempt to cross the Channel. That was the moment for me, also in the end when she came back. I love movies with breathtaking ends, and this one had, with a small sum-up of all the people as they were through the ages. Any movie that has memorable moments for us is worth the test of time, isn't it? It all looked great and certainly it was big budget money well spent: the scenery, background was lush and wonderful, like one big art deco hotel through the ages. Of course, this as almost any movie, had its problems, too. I think the beginning was awkward. Somehow due to a clock turning backwards we are supposed to believe it's credible babies are born that way. Also the end, which would normally be interesting ? how do you cope with a baby getting younger and younger ? was left out to speed thing up. The focus was clearly on the most interesting part; that of our young lives where we do the most things we later remember. From that perspective, the aging backwards would have been an unnecessary element. The movie might have been just as good with Bradd Pitt aging normally. Probably that is a compliment for this flick, since it seems I was also accepting this normally contrived idea of Benjamin aging backwards. Of course, the movie could have been cut here and there, too. I thought it had its best part from the end of the middle on to the title score. That also happened to be the part where Benjamin was an adult in his prime. But then again, maybe the power came from what had been told in earlier parts, so one never really knows. I never really felt this movie had a sagging part. Many reviews call it magical, and sometimes I agree it was. With a price though, since we are never part of the dull ordinary working days of the characters. It truly is the axiom of Hithcock's movies: life with the dull parts taken out. Life as seen from this story seemed like an endless stay in a youth hostel through the years, chatting and meeting interesting people, filled with the nicest pictures as recollection of Benjamin's life. We all know it is not like that. It would also have been interesting to see how this movie would work out showing life how it was with the best parts taken out! I also think telling this story as a flashback from a diary in a hospital was too cliché. It could easily have been solved by maybe interviewing people who directly or indirectly knew him, or something in that style. Sure some Hollywood writers could have come with something better than that. Also the hummingbird was too contrived, too much put in. And maybe after all the CGI and effects, Brad Pitt didn't have to do that much. But Benjamin was still a memorable character, and he happened to be Brad Pitt. So well, an Oscar nomination is deserved, I think. Overall this movie certainly had a great cast, lovely scenery, and a resonance of life being precious and wonderful, themes we all know, but so nice to see again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically brilliant slow crawl to nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first things first, there is no doubting the skill of David Fincher in creating what is a visually stunning spectacle; the acting is top notch, especially Brad Pitt, but the movie is sooo long and based on a premise that is innately ridiculous. Are we really expected to feel anything other than revulsion when old man Button falls in love with 12 year old Daisy? It's just not right. Thankfully we are spared any sexual congress until our romantic heroes meet half way through their respective lives and get down and dirty without the audience needing to reach for the sick bag.The movie is scripted by Forest Gump scribe Eric Roth and the similarities are clear, long journey through life learning valuable lessons along the way from an assortment of eccentric characters and situations yadayadayada. But whereas Gump was filled with a poignant entourage of fabulous characters and thrilling set pieces, Button crawls along through a turgid treacle thick layer of cloying and banal over-sentimentality that alienates rather than captivates the viewer.A raft of wonderful acting talent is wasted on characters with which it is very difficult to empathise. Tilda Swinton plays a pointless and irritating rich English woman who conducts a brief affair with Benjamin. Yet she is so shallow and egocentric it is difficult to grasp exactly what life affirming pearl of wisdom Benjamin and the audience are supposed to take from the episode.There are also several plot points that beggar belief. Are we really supposed to believe Daisy waited 40 years before asking her daughter to read Benjamin's diary to her as she lay on her death bed? Why is the Benjamin character allowed to drift into semi-vagrancy by those who love him as he gets older and more childlike? Wouldn't the social services who found him and read the diary believing him to be a child, find it worthy of investigation that he reports having sex with a 40 year old woman, least of all leave him in her care? I accept that as a fantasy, some level of belief suspension is necessary but as a plot conceit it just fails, it is just too much like hard work excusing the story's ridiculousness and as such the film fails. I am reminded of Tim Burton's far superior Big Fish. A film that took outlandish fantasy elements and a story retold from the death bed, but still managed to weave them into a touching, believable and ultimately satisfying fable. Over long, over earnest and over hyped, and will probably over achieve at the Oscars at the expense of the worthier Slumdog Millionaire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been historic. re-edit please.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quirky and fun, with outstanding visuals and the roundabout storytelling that is characteristic of Louisiana, where much of the film is set. The actors are outstanding, the premise is interesting and the cinematography is superb. The best parts of the film, in my view, are where the story jumps from one seemingly unrelated sequence to the next, until finally you find out how all the pieces connect. However, there are a few major issues that I think drop this film from outstanding to merely above-average.First and most noticeably, the film seems to be interspersed with Forrest Gump moments, which (unlike the original Forrest Gump) do not seem to fit the storytelling style. The myriad historical references and ongoing catchphrases come off as forced and corny after awhile, because they are repeated ad nauseum by characters who are supposed to be evolving (or devolving) over time. Unlike Forrest Gump, this story is supposed to be about the evolution of a man and a woman, not the evolution of a country or the world. The film is not edited to reflect this. In addition, the 'man hit by lightning' subplot is never finished, and the story of the step-sister is given short shrift. Meanwhile, the film runs on for nearly three hours and loses its momentum every time someone stops to repeat a catchphrase or comment on a hummingbird.This is still a good film, but it could have been SO much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Its an interesting idea. And it has little funny moments, and others of true poignancy. ( VERY minor spoiler in the paragraph ahead ) Some of it feels like dead air, but the movie is interspersed with occasional strokes of genius-- The scene of little insignificant events that led to Daisy's accident, the "struck by lightening seven times" parts and Benjamin's letter to his daughter are all nothing short of perfection.But the film, on a whole, was less than perfect. The characters lacked complexity and some subplots seemed unresolved. It simply failed to move me, or make an impression. I felt like the special effects and cinematography, while they were great, were running away with the picture, dragging the actors and director behind them.I recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. But it is not the best film of the year, and its not even the best work of Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchette, Eric Roth or David Fincher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, but too much for something so simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is curious, but not the best interesting thing that you could be expecting.First of all, it's curious the fact that David Fincher is the director, because he's the wizard of kick asses like Seven, Fight Club and The Panic Room, so you could never imagine that someday he would just jump into something that is too much Chris Columbus, Robert Zemeckis or even Tim Burton for him. But that's OK. Maybe he's just trying to dive into something a little different to express his eclectic taste or also his versatility as a director.For someone that built an entire career as an outstanding director of amazing thrillers and was responsible for some kind of revolution into the genre, Benjamin Button seems a little vain in his hands. This kind of story holds dense feelings that David Fincher is not able to express intensely, failing at times that other directors like Columbus or Zemeckis would probably care a lot more than he did.Getting 13 nominations for the Oscars doesn't mean anything because this is the movie that Academy's waiting for so long since Titanic because it's romantic and perhaps intense over an uncommon story, and everybody loves it. So, this is the kind of thing that Academy will always receive and announce with open arms even if it ends up with none of the statues.The story is simple and everyone already thought about dying young once in a life, but it happens so slowly and suddenly it ends so fast as an attempt to make you feel together with the character his perception of time passing by with the ages, so there are times that you just want to skip all the intense narrative and jump right to the point that everyone's expecting since the beginning: how will it ends? That line connecting fantasy to reality riding you naturally thru the movie like happens in Forrest Gump fails a lot even Fincher trying hard for it sometimes.For sure it's a beautiful movie that makes you think about all the meanings of life for hours, but it's a long-long movie that sometimes seems going to no where. The best parts of it are when Pitt's character is not alone because Benjamin Button is a curious character but he's not interesting enough to hold entire movie up on his back. Brad Pitt is a lot different from everything he did and he's a lot convincing as an old child during the first half of the movie, but that's it, because he backs to his comfort zone after it. Cate Blanchett has a very supporting role in a story that's about Benjamin but surrounds her all the time, anyway... any comments about her are dismissed because, you know, she is Cate Blanchett! The make up is outstanding most of the times, but it's kinda bizarre that they had so much care about Pitt's character that the same cannot be said about Blanchett's.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, I just think that there are too much in it than is needed and most of its success are for the important names in it than for the story itself as it's told. Maybe if things were a little different like being produced, written, directed and performed by different people the results could be a lot better but it also would never get 13 Oscars nominations and probably would never be a massive success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How we all want more time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an interesting tale that attempts to capture the "big" things of our own existence. Life, death, love, family, youth, age and the preciousness of time are all put together and to varying degrees examined in this delightful tale of what it would be like if you were born old and aged backwards.Brad Pitt delivers a remarkable performance but it is Cate Blanchett and the supporting cast (especially Taraji Henson as Queenie) that allows Brad Pitt to shine as the central character, Benjamin. Cate is magnificent (and extremely unlucky in my mind to not have received an Oscar nod) and her chemistry with Brad carries the film throughout. Having starred together previously in "Babel", there is a believability and realism between Cate and Brad's central characters that allows you to suspend belief at the notion of someone aging in reverse.The most powerful moments occur between these two and for anyone out there who is a parent or grandparent, the ending scenes between Benjamin and Daisy carry a gravitas that will strike at the very core of your being. So much so, you leave the cinema, wanting to do more, making the most of what you have and seeing the "Big Picture".</fullReview>

Pretty ironic if he is, considering the thrust of his film-making career has been completely within the multimillion-dollar blockbuster range, replete with A-List stars (most notably his repeat collaborations with Brad Pitt). Yet Fincher is one of the most unlikely, unassuming directors working today, probing the dystopian ("Alien3"), the grotesque ("Se7en"), and the darkly satirical ("Fight Club") on a level that backhands the notion that Hollywood can only pump out light, easily-forgotten entertainments.A story about a man who is born old and proceeds to age backwards, for instance, seems like the recipe for trite sentiment and Oscar nods, and while "Benjamin Button" will certainly be up for the latter, Fincher manages to transform it into a meditative?and remarkably mature?record of life itself, in all its highs and lows.In his third turn as Fincher's leading man, Brad Pitt plays the title character, born to a button tycoon's wife in 1918 New Orleans, abandoned on a doorstep of a rest home, and raised by a black couple who acknowledge Benjamin's condition as miraculous and heaven-sent (one of the film's most stunning setpieces has the wrinkled, midget-sized man "walking" for the first time at a tent revival). A decrepit old man at the age of seven, Benjamin meets Daisy, the axis on which his life will revolve. The film unravels in a grandly classical way, framed by the dying Daisy's daughter (Julia Ormond) reading journal passages from the hospital as Hurricane Katrina rages outside.Through the conviction of the performances and Fincher's deft handling, the notion of "wrongness" at a physically older man falling for a young girl (while the two possess an equal maturity?or lack thereof) is curtailed into something affecting and true. The extent to which the relationship between Benjamin and Daisy (played as an adult by Cate Blanchett) is pushed (both literally and figuratively) is the central unpredictable element that keeps "Curious Case" from falling into shopworn sentimental pap. This is probably the first time I have fallen so deeply in love with characters whose experiences impart lessons both genuine and sincere, and reflect people as they truly do change with age.That being said, Eric Roth's heavily-expanded adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story becomes too obliquely ponderous at times, particularly Benjamin's adventures with a tattooed tugboat captain (Jared Harris) and an English spy's society wife (Tilda Swinton) with ambitions of swimming the English Channel (after an unsuccessful attempt). While these interludes do enrich Benjamin's character, just as much could have been imparted had they been abbreviated.But the love story is the driving force of "Curious Case," and it's a testament to Fincher's versatility as a filmmaker (and the palpably passionate performances of Pitt and Blanchett) that he stages every shot in a manner to evoke the greatest emotional impact without coming off as plaintive and sentimental. Furthermore, his love of state-of-the-art visual effects remains on full display (he still wields CGI better than any director working today), particularly in the backward transformation of Benjamin, culminating in a scene of "birth" that is at once painful and beautiful.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A faulty structure reduces this from a great movie to a very good one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Forrest Gump" and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" (both screenplays by Eric Roth), things HAPPEN to the protagonists; they don't so much make things happen. Gump was a fascinating simpleton whose presence often brought out the best in people. Button is a fascinating guy, too, whose presence mostly confuses and disarms people. What makes him fascinating is that he's aging in reverse . He's born old and wrinkled, although he's small enough to slip through a vaginal canal. This part of the premise is a cheat. In the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Button was born big. His poor mother would have had a few interesting stories to tell, but that's another movie in itself. Actually, this "cheat" isn't a bad thing; it makes things a little more realistic and streamlined (relatively speaking). The first hour of the film is beautiful and filled with wonder. Director David Fincher ("Zodiac", "Fight Club", "Seven") and his team of special effects artists make us believe that Button exists. Watching him interact with other characters is amazing to behold. He has Brad Pitt's face, sure, and he sounds like Brad Pitt, but it couldn't possibly be Brad Pitt because Brad Pitt isn't three feet tall, no matter how low he squats. This fact doesn't matter. The special effects erase our doubt. The movie magic never detracts from our enjoyment of watching Button as he heads out into the world and bewilders everybody he meets. Like Gump, he forms some great friendships and has two key relationships. The one he has with Tilda Swinton is the most interesting one, and it is responsible for great growth in the character . Kate Blanchett (Daisy) is his first love, the love that scars him deepest and gives him the richest taste of reality. Button's relationship with Daisy is also the vehicle through which the movie drives home just how painful it would be to get younger while your loved ones are making a bee-line for the grave. This theme is not explored nearly as thoroughly elsewhere in the narrative.I wanted to love this movie. The trailer raised my expectations and the glimpses of Brad Pitt's Little Man That Could seized me by by the heart. It is certainly a very good movie, an entertaining movie, and it didn't feel too long when it was focused on the Button story. But the bridging structure -- Button's memoirs are read to an old woman on her deathbed -- seriously damage the film's emotional possibilities (at least for me). In "Forrest Gump", writer Roth had Gump sitting on a park bench telling the story of his life to passers-by and folks resting their backsides on the seat beside him. It worked. It worked because Gump himself was telling the story from his own mouth. In "Button", the story is read from a diary. When we learn the precise identity of the woman reading the diary, it is no surprise. Unfortunately, these reading scenes are more than just reading. The old woman is in a New Orleans hospital. Hurricane Katrina is bearing down. Will the storm destroy the hospital? If the filmmakers thought this gimmick would give the film more urgency, they're wrong. This stupid gimmick simply interrupts what is already a great story. Did someone think that a tale about a guy who ages backwards isn't interesting enough? Come on. Have some faith in your subject matter, people! Your little gimmick robs the film of its emotional pay-offs. We constantly cut away from the core story, at pivotal moments, to return to the old woman again. Who cares about her and the approaching storm!? I certainly didn't. The film is almost three hours long. It's not like it needed padding. Or even narration, for that matter. If the bridging sequences had been cut, the film would have clocked in at just north of two hours. The loss of one thing would have been the gain of the other.Brad Pitt is just fine as Benjamin Button and Kate Blanchett is equally fine as Daisy, Benjamin's first and last love. Tilda Swinton, though, brings a weight to the story that lifts it to another level. It doesn't stay at the level, but a very moving epilogue to her tale (in news story form) is a welcome gift.What is most curious about "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is that its filmmakers permitted its heavy-handed structure to rob it of its core emotions. We get to know Button, and we get to understand Button, but we don't get to feel what he feels because his internal journey is constantly interrupted. Gump didn't have that problem because Gump always told his own story his own way. Benjamin Button was robbed of that luxury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious....lovely, touching, well-acted, but, indeed, curious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the night World War I ends, a male child is born in New Orleans. His birth also coincides with a clockmaker's creation of a timepiece that runs "backwards". Rushing through a festive crowd in the Big Easy, the father of the child does not make it home for the birth. Instead, he finds his wife dying. The father, a Mr. Button, promises his spouse that he will find a place in the world for his son. But, when Button lays eyes on his child, he is horrified. The little boy is a baby with characteristics of a eighty year old man, wrinkled skin, cataracts, etc. In complete disgust, Mr. Button snatches the child and runs into the night, leaving the baby on the doorstep of a home for the aged. There, a kind nurse, Queenie (Tariji P. Henson) takes pity on the infant and claims him as her own, naming him Benjamin (Brad Pitt). The doctor for the home declares that the baby will not live long. Nevertheless, the infant does live and, as he grows, he appears younger at each birthday. At age seven, he finally can leave his wheelchair and walk, although he still wears thick glasses and looks quite ancient. But, to those closest to him, it is apparent that as he gets "older", his body grows "younger". Curious. Around this time, also, Benjamin meets the granddaughter, Daisy (Cate Blanchett, as she grows up), of one of the home's residents and he forms a strong friendship with the little girl. They will meet again and again over the years. Although Benjamin eventually goes out into the world, finding work on a tugboat, traveling to far away places, falling in love with an older woman (Tilda Swinton), his appearance grows ever younger until he finally becomes quite, quite handsome. A chance encounter with Daisy leads him back into a relationship with her. But, with Benjamin and Daisy traveling into old age in different directions, what kind of future will they have? This is a most lovely film, but it remains, throughout, a curiosity in movie making. Based on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, its story is so different and, told so leisurely, that it may not suit everyone. In truth, the tale must unfold at a slower pace, for it is meant to simulate the complete life of a man whose years run in the opposite direction of everyone else in the world. As such, the special effects which allow Pitt to look like a "wrinkled little boy" are amazing. But, first, the cast is terrific. Blanchett is wonderful as Daisy, a high-spirited dancer whose love for Benjamin is challenged by the circumstances. Indeed, she also appears, quite wonderfully, as an old woman, telling her tale to her daughter, Caroline (Julia Ormond), at diverse intervals throughout the film. Pitt, likewise, gives a heartbreakingly fine performance as a man whose life is extremely challenging, to say the least. Henson, Ormond, Swinton, and all of the other actors are absolutely terrific as well. As one might expect, the settings, costumes, cinematography, script and direction (by David Fincher) are sensational. But, for all of its weighty attributes, the film still remains an odd, curiosity piece in the realm of movie making. If you love Pitt or Blancett, you will not want to miss this one. Make that a ditto for those fans of fine film making who hold an admiration for bold, unique film ideas. But, for those who get restless during period pieces or slow, involved story lines, you may have to watch this one in several sittings and might be better off to rent the film sometime in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impeccably produced but a little syrupy for my taste. A bit Forest Gumpy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected to see a great movie and saw a good one. Brad Pitt was effective, Kate Blanchet, as usual, impressive. The supporting cast also acquitted itself well. However, even within the context of implausibility, which I, as a viewer, easily accept, some of it was a little too convenient for me. Even within the realm of so-called magical realism I need something a little more concrete.No plot summary necessary here - most of us know, when we go (from the previews) where the movie is headed. Perhaps the film could have been a little less self-consciously philosophical. Anyone who doesn't get the message after 2+ hours of watching this... I don't know, there can't be anyone! Nothing to be ashamed of here. I just prefer something with a little more teeth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The short story is way better than the film adaptation!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm one of those people who for months anticipated seeing this movie only to leave the theater disappointed. The film's producers took a great idea and ruined it by making a 2.5 hour movie about nothing.The drawn out scenes and bland performance from Brad Pitt makes the movie feel 4 hrs long. The main characters are less likable than the supporting characters. To avoid giving up spoilers, I'm not going to talk about the plot holes.The only thing that makes the film adaptation of Benjamin Button worth watching at least once is the cinematography and the special effects. It's one of the most beautifully filmed but boring movies I've seen in a long time. But watch it when you have time to kill.I initially rated this movie a 7 out of 10 but after reading the short story that the film is based on, I had to knock the score down to a '6'. Why the film makers didn't want to stick to the original story, I don't know but the F. Scott Fitzgerald version would have made a heck of a more interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing computes in this movie, but my overall rating is for the mythical, magical feeling it generates. It is simply gorgeous to look at with little side trips to nowhere to titillate the senses - the man being struck by lightening seven times, the stay in Russia, the battle at sea.I didn't read the reviews, as the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story on which it is based is one of my favourites even though speculation has it that is was originally a story of Zelda's, his troubled wife.I'm glad I didn't, as it is one of those movies which either gets you or doesn't. It got me and most of the crowd that were in the theatre at the Saturday night showing I was at.The premise is weird but is underlaid at the outset with the premise of a backward clock invented by a father who lost his son in WW1, a man trying to make sense of his loss. Wishing to roll back time. So a man is born old but with the sensibilities of a baby.Along the way he is rejected by his father, mothered by a black woman, has a connection with a 10 year old child who later turns into the love of his life as their ages fall into synchronicity.The love story arc is predictable and haunting, scenes of Paris and New Orleans are CGI'd beautifully as is the spectacular dancing of the lead, Cate Blanchett.The two stars, Brad Pitt and Blanchett do an admirable job of portraying the star crossed lovers and the makeup artists will surely get an award for the work it must have taken to both age and youthify the two.Tilda Swinton as an older lover of Benjamin is outstanding, breathtaking in her performance. The story is of course predictable and as some pointed out Forrest Gumpish. But sometimes you just have to suspend the disbelief metre.The not compute thing? ****SPOILER ALERT****(1)Why on earth did he leave when he was 47 when the child was one and the mother was 43? He would have only been 29 when the child was fully raised? (2)Why didn't he know his mother was dead? (3)Why was his sister dropped from the plot and his life? (4)Why did his father look so young when he was meant to be dying at a good old age? (5)Why on earth did the child Daisy become attracted to an old man? (6)Why didn't Daisy have a relationship with her own daughter. ie. the daughter didn't know her mother was a famous dancer in her time? (7)Why did the youthifying of Benjamin seem to accelerate to the point that he looks 19 when his daughter is maybe 12? (8)Wasn't Caroline aware of her mother taking care of the child Benjamin for 5 YEARS? And many more, too long to list. ****END OF SPOILER ALERT****Overall: it engaged me with the story treated as mythical (hummingbird as leif motif)and based on love lost, regained and love lost again. Anyone looking for an exploration of the cult of aging and eternal youth will be sorely disappointed.And:Oscars will be given.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film made me think about the meaning of life once again. Even if your life runs backwards, the most important reasons to keep living it is to meet your true love and to have children.The plot didn't sound awkward to me as old people and children have a lot in common. What shocked me is the idea that not the body but the mind get's older and older with the time.But I must confess that to me it looks much better to die looking like a baby and not an old wrinkled man or a woman. The saddest thing in the film was that Benjamin could not spent his life with his Daisy-girl. Blanchett and Pitt: Bravo for the wonderful play! You were really great!I strongly believe that the movie will win an Oscar!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to keep this short and sweet, as the other comments have already provided lots of in depth analysis.Good, enthusiastically made, well meaning film, but too long. This is an interesting story, well acted, well made, and contains a great positive life message. My feeling is that it is a lot more "Forrest Gump" than "It's a Wonderful Life".The movie was slow enough for me to really think about the quality of the seats I was sitting on, and just how much popcorn the people around me were eating.

		<shortDescription>More simple than one would expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say right away, that for me the movie was a little disappointing. Only because it is David Fincher (director of Fight Club) and I expected something a little more bizarre and a little more stylish. Aside from the completely random draw to the movie here, which is the fact that Benjamin Button was born old and is growing younger, what we have here is a very simple love story/tragedy and nothing more than that. But putting that personable flaw aside from the start, what we have here is a very impressive love story. First of all, whatever kind of make up effects/digital editing they used to make Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look older and younger was f***ing phenomenal. Just after the old man baby phase, when Brad Pitt is a "100 year old man in a body the size of a 7 year old" - it is ridiculous looking! In a good way! Also, when Cate Blanchett is supposed to be about 23 years old, i don't know HOW they did it, but they made her look HOT! Normally i think Cate Blanchett is hideous, but somehow they altered her face just enough to do it. Of course all of the performances are impressive, but that is expected from these two. The script and story is heavy and emotional, I dropped a tear a couple of times. We get a nice character out of that creepy redheaded guy with the moustache in the movie Happiness. He is probably the best comedic relief in the film. The movie works. You feel it throughout. The ups and mostly downs. I didn't get bored in the 2 1/2 hour running time, although some people I went with did. It was interesting to watch how things unfold mentally for a withered old man with a little boys brain, and vice versa - but I felt that it wasn't enough. They should have dug deeper into these perspectives instead of rushing through them and focusing so much on the basic love story between the two characters. If you're looking for something psychologically challenging, you can skip this one. If you want to see good acting, feel a couple butterflies in your tummy and a couple tears in your eye, then this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried going into the movie with an open mind, as I'm not a huge fan of most of Pitt's work.The concept of the movie was definitely original and interesting. To see the reaction of people while interacting with Mr. Button was the most intriguing part for me.One flaw that bothered me was the lack of age determination throughout the movie. It was simply too hard to judge at times how old he was, and distracting from the movie while trying to figure it out.Another flaw was the length. Definitely a solid 1/2 hour too long.....at least.Pitt was pretty good, and they did a good as him as an old man and changing his appearance throughout.Worth seeing for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Button left me incurious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be absolutely possible to forget all the logic errors and gaffes in this film if they had done a bit more with it. Unfortunately, they didn't. After about an hour my girlfriend and I lost interest without realising and found ourselves pottering around half watching . On reflection we put this down to the film being based on a plot that would only work with an appropriate level of emotional gravitas tugging it along - but it lacks this and the execution of the plot is emotionally lightweight and farcical. There is no depth here and you need depth to take you through 2 hours and 40 minutes. Benjamin is an unlikeable character. Actually, that is too strong as it suggests you might invest some emotion capital in him in some way. The lack of emotional oomph means when we encounter (sadly inevitable) symbols representing fate and a more mystical side to the story these are laughable as this film will not sufficiently move or engage you enough to buy in to this cheesiness. Case in point: the hummingbird motif. A hummingbird flying by in the middle of the ocean somewhere North of Russia just because someone who talked about hummingbirds has just died is plain silliness. The motif-for-the sake-of-having-a-motif hummingbird does of course crop up at very vaguely poignant moments later in the film (as you would tiresomely expect). The whole 'Bratt Pitt looking old' thing is slightly entertaining for about 3 minutes though.</fullReview>

The execution was disappointingly tacky with playground techniques used for showing past events, including the sort of sepia effect you would expect from a schoolboy's first forage into the genre. Sound was appalling so that the Titanic-lady lookalike was impossible to hear, although that might have also been down to the incredibly unsubtle switch of mood lighting at the hospital bed (gosh, we've never seen that before have we?!).

		<shortDescription>The not-so-curious case of Brad Pitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most disappointing movie of the year, according to me, would be this one, mainly because I did find the beginning to be made very nicely and the end too to be told in a wonderful manner. But its the entire journey (especially when Benjamin starts growing younger) that lacks the charm and wonder.The movie's performances do not enrich the film unfortunately. There are some fine performances by Tilda Swinton and Tajari but the rest of the cast, including the lead pair, is just mediocre. The biggest problem in the movie is Brad Pitt, who remains so shallow that he doesn't even make an effort to dig deep into his character. Just sporting an accent won't do it.Benjamin's childhood was a wonderful journey and that was when I liked Benjamin, mainly because the computer effects helped Brad. But when the computer effects aren't needed as he is growing younger, Benjamin becomes Brad and this movie becomes bad.There were many scenes in the movie that I had issues with. For example, when Benjamin has sex with the prostitute, he is shown to be too active and wild in bed, which is annoying since his character was shown to be very different in the beginning. In some of the scenes, he is shown as a fine, responsible man but in the others, he suddenly becomes a playboy.Plus, he never seems to care for Cate.Cate Blanchett too remains shallow surprisingly. Her character is not written properly as she is given a half-baked role. The chemistry between Cate and Brad looks so superficial that I had to pause the DVD to take a break, since I started to find the story to be fake. However, the chemistry between Brad and Tilda is really good, especially due to the great performance by Tilda. Its funny that I found the chemistry between the aged Cate and the child Brad to be better than the chemistry between the two when they were in their forties. The whole story reminded me of Forrest Grump, which got 10 stars from me, but the characters were written so well in FG that I found this movie to be rather a rip-off the the movie. Tajari too does a good job as Brad's adopted mother who treats him like her own son. The thing that was shocking was the Brad did not even shed a tear when she died. In fact, Cate looked more concerned than Brad when Tajari passed away. Characters close to Brad departed yet there was no feeling of sadness at all in Brad.The man who got struck by lightning 7 times reminded me of a character from Forrest Gump. The whole movie felt too similar to Forrest Gump. The death of the mother, Cate's return after leaving Brad, Cate's attitude towards Brad when she joins the ballet group etc had a strong resemblance with scenes from FG.The story isn't above ordinary, especially as Brad's life is so normal. The actor didn't even try to explore the character and lives like any normal person. 5 out of 10 for Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This year i have been under the misconception that the films nominated in this years "Best Picture" category at the Oscars are not up to the standard of recent years. Don't get me wrong , "Milk" and "Slumdog Millionaire" are good films but are they great? Not in my opinion , but last night i watched a movie that blew me away.A stunning film that lives up to it's hype and goes straight into my top 10 films of all time .That film is "The Curious case of Benjamin Button". As soon as i heard those words "I was born under unusual circumstances." i was hooked.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans from the end of World War I in 1918, into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man's life can be.Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Benjamin Button is a grand tale of a not-so-ordinary man and the people and places he discovers along the way, the loves he finds, the joys of life and the sadness of death, and what lasts beyond time.I love films that bring out emotion in me. I'm not the most open person at the best of times as friends and family will confirm I'm sure! So when i get emotion over a film it has to be good.Watching "The Curious case of Benjamin Button" makes you realise how lucky you are to have the love of friends and family and to have a lifetime of that support. The idea of a baby being born an old man who gradually gets younger is a brilliant one yet tragic. It instantly raises so many questions. questions that do not always have pleasant answers.Brad Pitt is fantastic as strangely youngering ( is that a word or is there a word that is the opposite to ageing?) man. His screen presence is mesmerising throughout which is not easy considering the length of the movie.There are been many plaudits for the special affect and they are totally deserved but it's not so much the affects of when Benjamin Button and Daisy are old it's the ones when they are young. How they got Brad Pitt and Kate blanchett to look 20 is amazing. There is one scene in particular that rang so true for me. It was when Button explains the circumstances of how Daisy broke her leg and how if just one single thing like a Taxi Driver being delayed by 5 seconds because of a series of trivial events had not happened , her life could have been so different and that is so true for all of us .What if your father had not gone out the night he met your mother because of something trivial like a car breaking down or a minor illness? Think about it.As Benjamin Button says " Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss." The last twenty minutes is gut wrenchingly sad .When Button goes from a young man to a child and he loses his memory of Daisy i found myself filling up.The curious case of Benjamin Button might not win the big one tonight at the Oscars but in my mind it has already won. It's such a magical , mystical , gem of a movie that will live with me for a very long time. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Boredoms anticlimactic life story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the masses comparing this to Forest Gump. There are many connections between these two archetypes. But Forest Gump did something that Benjamin Button could not do-he was able to get the audience to fall in love with his character. Even if it was a mockery, Forest Gump is still more of a house-hold name than Benjamin Button would ever hope to be. This is not a review about Forest Gump. So I'll leave that to rest. The character of Benjamin Button is played by a consistently dazed Brad Pitt. There was no crying of him losing someone, no sense of humor when comic opportunities arise or anything maddening coming from him when he should get angry. Benjamin Button merely represented the idea of a reverse aging southern gentleman. There was little texture to his personality even with a southern accent. Benjamin Button only remains a lifeless puppet of this movie.Daisy portrayed by Cate Blanchett had some life in her. But her performance as an aging and struggling dancer/dance instructor can only do so much when her lover Benjamin is not providing the same mutual emotions as she has. The connection between the two was "so- so" and their epic romance made for a rather poor climax in the movie.The story was grand and all as it shows Benjamin Buttons life during the 20th century. This movie has strength in showing many different scenes and atmospheres as it was appropriate to reflect on one's life story. The character development was real well done outside the protagonist Benjamin Button. The captain and crew of the tugboat, along with the nursing home folks who took him in, his lover in the Russian Hotel and Benjamin Buttons father were all nice additions in the movie. However, the character development and additions in the movie stopped around half to three quarters of the way.The last fifteen minutes of this movie was absolutely agonizing. I felt the directing slapped it together out of uncertainty but it was mind numbing to watch.The make up and visual effects made this movie credible in every way and this is perhaps its biggest strength. Age progression (or regression in this case), is flawless on Brad PittI recommend watching this once just to see the movie as it is a visual masterpiece. Don't expect much more than the previews, the tip of the iceberg will only continue to show you its tip. Be prepared for bathroom breaks because this is one epic story. I agree with this movie being well deserved for Oscar awards for best screenplay and make up/visual effects. But Best Picture? I don't know about that...You might like it or you might hate it. I thought it was a mixed bag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddest love story ever filmed, but there is also a positive message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one were to condemn this masterful piece of film-making as far-fetching, as some critics have done, one may as well condemn all science fictions, all fantasies and all films that require a little imagination to appreciate, such as "Big Fish".There is indeed a lack in symmetry, if you really want to be particular about it, in the three elements (not two, as some may think) of Benjamin Button's lifeline. In his mental development, he is normal ? born as a baby, develops and matures like any other human being and ages (loss of memory etc), "becoming like a baby again" as we describe many normal elderly person. In terms of SIZE, he is normal through most of his life, born as a baby, grows up and bigger. It's only when he gets really advanced in age that he begins to gradually shrink, all the way back to the size of a baby, and dies. Strangest is his physical conditions (not counting size) ? he is born like an 80 year old man (cataract, failing heart, malfunctioning internal organs etc) and rejuvenate as he grows up and dies ? and it is not totally clear here in the movie ? as a normal, healthy baby. Accept all these, or go see another movie.Distracted by this bizarre abnormality, we easily lose sight of how sad a love story this is. We have been moved in movies where lovers are separated by death or other circumstances, some as strange as what happens in "Somewhere in time". We have also been touched by stories of sacrifices where one lover doesn't want to be a burden to another, such as "An affair to remember" (but that has a happy ending). Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) and Daisy (Cate Blanchett ) face all of these problems but sadly for them, they know all along that there is no way out of their doomed fate.Again, the bizarre abnormality distracts the audience, and even critics, from seeing the beauty of this love story. Don't let the outward appearance blind you. Inside, it's a normal development of a normal love affair of two normal persons through their normal age. As kids (and Daisy sees Benjamin as a kid, despite his appearance) they share a normal infatuation. In their early twenties, they are true to their character ? Daisy flirty and reckless while Benjamin introvert and more matured. That is why in one of the most beautiful seduction scenes that you'll ever seen in any movie ? Blanchett's bewitching dance to the background of the ethereal mist of the lake ? Benjamin remains unyielding. It's when they meet again at their forties, after so many things have happened, that they have reached a maturity of knowing that despite their doomed fate together, they have only one life to live, together. "Sleep with me" she says. "Absolutely" he replies. Not cryptic one-liners to get few cheap laughs. There's poignancy there. They have finally decided to make the best of their time together, despite the certainty of the tragic end awaiting. Think back at this towards the end of the movie and you'll feel the immense sadness.But that's not all. This movie is so rich that I could almost borrow Hemingway's book's title to describe it: "A moveable feast". The sequence of a relationship with a diplomat's wife (wonderfully played by the inimitable Tilda Swinton) has such a feeling of other-worldliness, transporting you to a dream-like world that seems to exist only after midnight. The absolution a father who abandoned him as a baby is punctuated by a stunningly beautiful sunrise scene. The fateful accident that ends Daisy's career as a dancer is brilliantly recounted by unveiling a series of haphazard events heading towards a collision course (literally). Equally brilliant is the ending montage, parading characters that Benjamin has encounter throughout his life, with a message that is subtly whispered (where a lesser director would have shouted out) ? whatever happens, make the best of your life.I'm not even going to say anything about the makeup and special effect which is going to win an Oscar that is more deserving than any that have come before. And in addition to the original music, the use of familiar songs is at its best: "If I love you" (from "Carousel") as background for Daisy's performance that mesmerizes Benjamin, "My prayer" as background to montages depicting a short period of Benjamin's carefree life (sailing etc), and "Twist and shout" for the scene where Benjamin and Daisy finally throw away their inhibitions and come together.Brad Pitt has been working hard on un-Pitt-ness, most noticeably in "Burn after reading" where, despite the familiar face, he is all but recognizable in a new persona of an idiot. In Benjamin, we first see a child in the body of an old man. As he grows younger outside and older inside, he retains much of his childlike innocence. As the ageing process creeps up inside, and he looks younger every day, he feels more and more the heavy burden crushing down, the burden of how to reconcile his destined doom with his love for Daisy. Pitt has done all these, and well. As to Cate Blanchett's, she'll be charming, surprising and delighting and the cinematic world for a long time to come, long after everything has run out of praises to heap on her. Then there is the marvellous support cast, Julia Ormond and Taraji P. Henson the best among them. Enough said. A movie as fine as this one you don't get every day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Benjamin Button!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this over New Years and absolutely loved it. I thought it was the kind of epic movie that Hollywood used to make back in the day. It was smart, classy, timeless, beautiful, subtle, moving, sweet, endearing, powerful and thought provoking. David Fincher stepped out of his comfort zone and the risk payed off. He did an amazing job with this film. The sets, the costumes, the score, the acting...all add to the power and magic of this film. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are stellar. I alway absolutely love Julia Ormond's performance. It was soothing, nurturing and helped tie the story together wonderfully. It really is a terrific concept for a movie, a man aging backwards, and makes you evaluate your own life and what you want to make of it in your limited time here. So so so so great!!! See this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the most important awards for the Americans are right on the corner and that means that in commercial cinemas here in Mexico City interesting films, well at least on the paper, will be released before the ceremony takes place. Last Friday came finally to city both the new David Fincher feature film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and the first part of Steven Soderbergh's take on the revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara The Argentine. On the paper both looked really interesting to me, finally in 2009 I really wanted to go to the cinema to check some specific picture and not just the one that was going to be showed right away. On Friday I went to see Fincher's and on Saturday Soderbergh's. With Fincher's I was there more or less because of him unlike with Soderbergh's since The Argentine was going to be my very first Soderbergh film. Anyway, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has a fine cast, certainly a fine, really big budget and a really interesting story, after all I liked the film, found marvelous things, very interesting and complex parts yet I think of Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, this last is definitely my least favourite and certainly I have yet to watch (and I hope to enjoy) Alien?, The Game and Panic Room. Overrated, fine, perfect adjective for this film. The story is interesting, a fine love story, there are parts that are more than memorable, really worked to create a marvelous love story. Benjamin Button and Daisy, certain points in their love story, as I guess you know Benjamin born and he was not really a normal baby, he born and he was already old. He was certainly just a kid and he enjoyed the time with another child, with Daisy, they relation as friends was not allowed. These two will certainly meet again, they will have a normal relation, is again interesting when their daughter born, is great because it lead us again to an interesting moment, they know their love is impossible but the love of each one to the other is forever. Now is more the love of a mother the love of Daisy.Overlong, another fine, another perfect adjective for this film. At one point Daisy was in Paris and he suffered a really bad accident. Why not say that, just that? But instead we have the explanation of certain things that happened, things that could change the fact that now Daisy suffer in a hospital. Anyway, many write about Forrest Gump (I remembered the 2005 version of King Kong) as they write that this is the very best work of Fincher and Brad Pitt. For me this is not the best work neither of Fincher, Pitt and Cate Blanchett and if you talk about awards, more specifically about Oscars I can say that Benicio deserves more after the recognition in Cannes yet he doesn't need any award.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it was interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie but after seeing it I should give you all a warning. I left the theater thinking, "well maybe I'll like it tomorrow after it has time to sink into my head" but the more I think about this film the more disappointed I am.The story itself was a great idea, a guy who ages backwards. Sadly though this movie wasn't that good. The story had many holes and the characters didn't draw the audience in. The actors were of course great but the script was not.I feel that the only reason this movie is getting all the awards and all the critical acclaim is simply because it has all the making of a instant classic. Sadly all of this was stolen from other great movies and not done really well. Of course though the Hollywood snobs would leads us all to believe we must love this movie because it is going to be a classic.I understand it was a fantasy but I don't see why a little science couldn't of been put in to explain a possible reason for his condition. What would doctors say if they met a man like that? I am also surprised that no one in the media didn't catch on to this "amazing" man. Not even the local media. In real life he would of at least shown up in "Ripley's Believe It or Not." Now all that aside the story really was a love story about two people from different worlds falling in love. Sadly however even this part of the movie was shallow. Despite the two actors great performances I don't feel for their relationship or sense any chemistry at all. There entire relationship even when they finally end up together seems like stolen plot points from other movies. The only difference being; he ages backwards.My biggest problem with this film though is how it seems like they tried to squeeze in scenes from dozens of other great movies. This tactic left the movie too long and the scenes to choppy and short. It was almost impossible to get into their lives because their lives kept changing to quickly to get to that next, "Oscar winning scene." People who say this is the new, "Forest Gump" must be referring to how many scenes were stolen from it. I know its the same writer but really, "stolen" is the right term.Great director, great writer, great actors, great makeup, great special effects, not a great movie. Its defiantly worth the rental but don't be fooled by the awards it is winning. If you do get a chance to go to the movies soon skip this one and see Slumdog Millionaire. You'll see a great movie about a life story there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is delightful.It is the type of story that a parent would read to a child: a man who ages backwards in a world where everyone else ages forwards.It contains many classic elements of a child's story: the baby bundled up and left on a doorstep for a kindly woman to adopt, the pretty cute girl who does ballet, the swashbuckling adventures at sea, the old woman on her death bed recounting her past, and so on.But, like a child's story, there is nothing beneath the surface of Benjamin Button.I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. The movie is still a beautiful one. It is just nothing more than a "story".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Button is a very much overrated film about a man who is living out his life backwards, beginning with an old man and living out his life until his death as a baby. The film was based on a short story as I recall and in my opinion should have stayed as one, the film spans out to approximately 3 hours and depicts many insignificant moments in his life. Along with the most boring footage I have ever seen in a Golden Globe nominated film, it carries some exiting yet impossible moments (despite the fact that the concept as a whole is unbelievable which is completely understandable). The film in my eyes is a cross between Zemekis' Forrest Gump, and Cameron's Titanic, except even The Titanic was better than Ben Button. Despite my dislike of the movie, I would have to admit that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were decent, and the production quality of the film is high. The only thing that this film lacks is substance and in a film like this, it is the most important part. I voted this a 6 out of 10 only because of the acting, which as I said before was decent and the quality of the film's production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny idea going nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember gaining respect for Brad Pitts acting abilities in 12 Monkeys as he broke his calm eye-candy type casting. I've been following him ever since hoping for him to be involved in a project where he stepped outside his comfort zone. I understand that he does movies like Oceans and Mr &amp; Mrs Smith and that's all good but when it comes for him to pick movies with substance he always fails for some reason.Right now I'm asking myself whether it's because of the projects themselves or it's because he gets involved with them? Babel was in no way near to how good it could have been after I heard the pitch. Burn after reading is nothing but a over-hyped mess and now we have ole Benjamin Button.After watching the trailer I thought it might be a pretty cool story and it actually looked like Mr Pitt would be doing some acting overall. Alas the story struggled to combine a life and love story with a quirky but great original idea and failed.You will know that you have been tricked from the first scene with two women in a hospital and they start reading from Benjamin's journal. From then on the story continues to test our ability to stay alert and interested. We get excited about seeing just how well faces can be digitized and there are other great cinematic achievements within the movie but we can't very well say that the acting is one of them. Brad Pitt just goes with the flow, like Forest Gump only without the personality, and basically just stands around looking good. Cate's character is so all over the place that you never get any indication of what type of person she is, there is no depth to her at all. When all is said and done you leave the theater thinking "wow, they could really make Brad Pitt look old and young". As for the movie itself you will remember it as boring and full of clichés desperately trying to cater to our emotions but it just can't get there.It was a funny and original idea, it just didn't go anywhere at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's hear it for F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story: it's positively moving, and it's a definite winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blanchette, Fincher, Pitt, Roth and a stellar cast make this film work. It is a masterpiece, spellbinding, and makes one really think about the miracle of life. It is a privilege, and we only go this way once.I used to think that aging, and watching most of your family members and some of your friends die, and leaving you behind is one of the most sad things. And, yet, when I saw this film, Brad Pitt's character was getting younger, but he was still facing many of the same things-- in reverse.The film left me with some very beautiful things. It's not about death. It's about life, and the fact that we have been touched by some truly charismatic, dynamic, and lovely people--in our journey through life.Did I tell you the one about the fact I was struck by lightning seven times--and survived?!? Ah, the miracle of life! I rank this film a 10 out of 10. I don't know whether there will be Academy-award winners from this film, but I can only exclaim that this film is a definite winner for me. It touched every emotion, and there are some empowering lessons to be learned from this film. By all means, go see it. And, if possible, be with someone you love, share and pass-on the valuable moments you experience from this wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say I loved "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" would almost be an understatement. First off, I tip my hat to the special effects team and makeup team. They did an extraordinary job and the special effects left absolutely nothing to be desired. The casting was also very superb. The chemistry between Blanchett and Pitt was almost tangible. I think everyone, no matter race, gender, or stage of life can get something out of this movie. It dealt with ideas and relationships that we've all experienced. Love, loss, friendships, etc. I found myself tearing up at a lot of parts because I felt exactly what he was going through because I'd been there with a lot of the relationships I've had with people so far in my life. And the ongoing joke with one of the elderly in the home, cracked me up and everyone else in the theater were laughing as well. I loved this movie and it really made me think. I doubt my boyfriend went as deep into it as I did, but, he did enjoy it, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting concept, but ultimately leaves us with too many meaningless details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!) Like a lot of people I saw the trailer for this movie and became intrigued with the idea of a person aging backwards. Then after it ended up on a lot of critics' top 10 lists and getting a lot of Golden Globe Nominations I decided to go see it. It was an OK movie, but only just OK. Satisfactory, mediocre, nothing special. I expected a lot better from all the buzz, and the strange thing was it felt like there were a lot of different things that were supposed to be set-ups/foreshadowing for later developments and there wasn't any payoff. For example: 1) The approaching hurricane in the hospital scenes. Sure, in the end, we get the return of the hummingbird from earlier (the death of the sea captain during WWII) but wasn't that hummingbird supposed to be more of a symbol of the sea captain. With it appearing outside the hospital window at Daisy's (Cate Blanchett's) death did it symbolize her, Benjamin, the random occurrence of nature/God...? Uh...it didn't make sense or, at least, was clumsily done. Why have a hurricane? Was that really necessary? Isn't having a hummingbird appear out of nowhere to say "Hi!" Disney-style outside a window coincidental enough that you don't need F10 winds blowing at the same time? 2) What was up with the guy who got struck by lightening 7 times? Now I laughed every time we got see one of those seven times (by the way I felt gypped out of two of them) and about mid-way through the movie was more interested in when he would pop up again than anything that was happening to Benjamin. I felt like Lightening Guy would be the reason why the hurricane was coming to get Daisy. I felt that somehow those two things were connected, but that didn't happen.3) Why have the father leave the button factory to Benjamin and then kind of leave it at that. Benjamin never did anything with the factory. Why not? If you're going to start your movie with a fancy shot of the two movie studios that produced the movie done up with buttons, why wasn't it more integral to the plot other providing the protagonists last name. Once again: set-up and no payoff.4)What was the point of the affair with Tilda Swinton in the Russian hotel? Sure, later on we find out that she fulfills her goal of swimming the English Channel, but it never really affects Benjamin much other than to keep him away from Daisy for awhile. It's not like her abrupt departure is explained or given any profound meaning to Benjamin's life. And when he sees her on television many years later, it doesn't inspire him to achieve some goal he had put off, so...why? But I could keep going (If the blind clockmaker's backwards-running clock caused Benjamin's unique condition, why wasn't anyone else affected? Why Benjamin? Why the last day of WWI? Why'd the black preacher die when Benjamin took his first steps? Why did the nursing home re-open? Why was Daisy living in a nursing home with her Grandmother? Why'd she come back after her Gandmother died? When Benjamin was old, why didn't anyone in the nursing home notice a backwards aging child (aging backwards at old age would be more gradual and none of the residents would notice because they'd be dead before too much change, but at the end of his life Benjamin would have to go through some rapid shrinking in the last five years of his life for anyone not to notice) Overall I'm nitpicking on details, but it felt like at least one of these details would add up to a better payoff or at least more meaning for what turned out to be a very straight-forward story. Most of it felt like the story would have been the same even without the backwards aging. Still it was okay. Cate Blanchett was really good with what she had to work with and I really liked the scene that explained the events leading to her accident. Overall, I'd say see it but go see something better if you can find it. Nothing special here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Curious Case of Over Hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad movie, but, like There Will Be Blood last year, it's not as good as it's been hyped up to be.Granted there are good performances from the leads, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, excellent support from the likes of Tilda Swinton and Taraji P. Henson (fabulous in last year's Talk to Me. I have no idea why she wasn't nominated for something) and the make up and special effects that are used to age Brad Pitt are brilliant, and yet, and yet...... I can't get that enthused about it, try as I might. The movie takes far too long to draw the viewer in. The first half an hour is really inexcusably slow. And, like so many films of the last two years, it is simply too long.The basic premise, as surely everyone knows by now, is that Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born an old man and ages backwards. Now if that was the backdrop for some profound adventure, it might be more interesting, but the whole basis of the film is simply that, a man living backwards. He goes through much the same life circumstances that everyone else does (or did at that time), watching friends die, getting a job, war, fatherhood etc. He just does it in the wrong order.I'm sure we all know the aphorism that youth is wasted on the young? That's certainly one of the ideas at work here, that as Button 'youngs' as opposed to 'ages', he can use the wisdom of age to enjoy his youth, while at the same time tragedy waits in the wings, because, after all, how can he burden the woman he loves with having to watch him grow younger while she grows older? How can he expect her to care for him? Certainly one of the underlying messages, is that you take the hand life dealt you, and make what you can of it. OK. So far so good.There are certainly some very nicely constructed scenes in this movie; Cate Blanchett's Daisy becoming a dancer then suffering a terrible accident which changes her life; or Button serving as a merchant seaman on a tugboat during WW2. (The zinging bullets when they are attacked by a submarine will have you diving under your seat, it's that well done.) But the scenes in the hospital in New Orleans as Daisy lies dying with Hurricane Katrina approaching, are marred by a rather ordinary performance from Julie Ormond as Button's daughter Caroline, and by Blanchett being forced to mutter through so much aging make up that I struggled to hear quite a lot of her dialogue. More could have been made perhaps, of the profoundly disquieting effect that discovering her weird ancestry might have had on Caroline. It's very underplayed.Benjamin Button is one of those slightly off kilter movies where you wait for the drama to build and the crescendo to approach, and it never quite does. It's a fantasy about a man aging backwards, and that's about it. Beautifully made, nicely constructed and very well acted, but nowhere near as profound as it would like to be.We went to see this on Christmas day when it opened, a rare outing for our whole family (both genders and an age range of 18 to 60.) We all enjoyed it, yet I think I wasn't the only one who felt that it wasn't quite what it could, and should, have been. Personally I don't feel it is Oscar material, except for achievement in make up where it's streets ahead of anything else I've seen this year (it's hard to tell where the computer effects end and the make up begins, which is exactly as it should be: seamless.) But as best picture? No. Wallee was a far superior movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this movie good? Eh, sure.Was it "out of this world" or "a true rarity"? Absolutely not.I went and saw this movie with great expectations, and they simply were not fulfilled. An interesting concept, to be sure, and the movie did not do a bad job relating Fitzgerald's story. Of course, if you're willing to pay 8 or 9 dollars to ogle at Brad Pitt for a few hours, you won't be totally disappointed.However, the relation between the two characters was not well developed and the direction was slightly lacking. I couldn't feel sorry for the supposed tragic lovers, to me it seemed they weren't really sure why they loved one another, they just happened to feel that way. The tie in of hurricane Katrina was tacky and pointless, and wasn't well developed enough to make the audience even slightly curious about the fate of the daughter. This movie strongly reminded me of Forest Gump, an average love story between people (one of whom hails from the Deep South) who are destined to remain separate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mind-Blowing Film That Demands a Second Screening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen some bad reviews of this movie, Ebert (a God to me) among them, I wasn't sure whether to take my 13-year-old daughter to this one or not. She's a romantic at heart, and loves to cry at movies, as do I, so we went. We weren't sorry. I won't give anything away except to say that whoever cast this movie was a genius, as there are many "lesser-knowns" who simply jump out at you with their brilliance. I loved Captain Mike, because Jared Harris has really come into his own. This guy deserves a star role in something bigger than an indie film, folks! You can see a lot of his late father in him, but he's become such a good actor now that the first time I wasn't sure it was a Harris boy! (I'm a Richard Harris-phile). Still, his Dad would have been proud. The photography is gorgeous. Yes, those Gulf of Mexico sunsets/sunrises really ARE that beautiful. I was there this past April.The Tom Button character was intriguing and might have been fleshed out a bit better. And what of the mysterious clock? Were others affected by it? It gets fuzzy in the details.However they managed to trick us into believing that was Brad Pitt in those scenes was much more impressive than any big blockbuster space or superhero movie. I'm not a huge Cate Blanchett fan, as she comes across as cold and indifferent in nearly every movie I've seen, and this one is no different. The "Queenie" character was just wonderful. I agree with another user commenter who said the fancy flashbacks and stuff sort of distracted from the story, but in the end, it was still riveting. Stock up on popcorn and don't drink a lot of fluids before going, or else you'll miss something important! I certainly plan to see it a second time. I predict many awards for this movie, and certainly one for Brad Pitt. There are enough great quotes in here to fill a book, oh, that's right! F.

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button provided a unique performance from Brad Pitt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While my friend wanted to watch this movie because he's a big fan of Brad Pitt, I was simply more interested in the premise and the fact it was shot in my neighboring city of New Orleans whose scenery is breathtaking here (the fact that present scenes are set during Hurricane Katrina was also a fine dramatic touch). Pitt is quite touching as a man aging backwards in time and I loved the romantic scenes with both Tilda Swinton as the middle-aged wife of a spy and Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend Daisy especially her dancing scenes. Those scenes on the tug boat with that tattoo captain were also good especially the wartime sequences. If there's one quibble, it's that I didn't see enough of Queenie's daughter to really discern how she got along with either her mother or her brother Ben. Otherwise, this was a fine piece of work from director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth who mined similar adapted territory when he previously worked on Forest Gump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Enjoyable Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable fantasy of a man born in his 80's who gets younger rather than older.The makeup and special effects that make the lead character decrease in age are subtle and realistic, and although it is the story rather than the effects that shine in this, they do make you think damn but brad pitt looks good in this-which is annoying to me as i really want to hate him for his good looks, but this film just makes them better than before lolI expected it to be a tad too long and therefore get boring, but at no time did i feel this the case, and I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone. Even though it is abit far fetched it doesn't come across as unbelievable.(Granted a 5ft something human skeleton shrinking to a child's size but perfectly formed is not the most feasible thing in the world,but like anything that happens gradually over time you do tend to ignore this while watching it slowly take place during the course of this movie).I have not far as aware given any film a rating above 8, however the subject matter/story in this is well told, the acting spot on, and i left feeling i had my moneys worth in every respect-and that's got to deserve a 9 in anyone's book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Idea That Could Have Become Great....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But it doesn't really. I give this a five for the promising premise and great makeup, effects, and production design. But unfortunately this goes nowhere. It gives no real insights that it claims to make, and doesn't really have any interesting plot lines in the entire almost-three-hour running time. It'll probably get the makeup Oscar, and there was some good cinematography work, but really, it is a dud of a movie that fails to deliver anything interesting in the end. It's all premise and no substance. Though many others have already done this, I have to compare it to Forrest Gump. They both promise similar things, and are both often overly sentimental. Gump delivers, though, and that's what makes it the one to watch. Button doesn't deliver.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the third time, one of the best director-actor collaborations try a completely different essence of a movie with director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt reuniting to create a masterpiece on par with their other two films: "Se7en" and "Fight Club". Cate Blanchett is brilliant as usual, while a good supporting cast bring their A-game and Fincher works with writer, Eric Roth effectively.Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born under unusual circumstances, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" tells the story of a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards with dramatic and strange consequences. Along his journey, the viewer sees the people, the places and the hardship that he encounters; we see the ones that leave him, and the ones that he loves. However, their is no one that he loves more dearly than he's treasured childhood friend, Daisy (Blanchett).While some complain about the 159-minute runtime of David Fincher's "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", I found myself praying that the film would never end. So that, the poignant and touching tale of Benjamin and Daisy would stay with me forever and engulf my emotions. I found myself thinking how nothing lasts, and what a shame that is.</fullReview>

If you are a big fan of Fitgerald's short story novels, you will find this movie very satisfying. I felt the movie started out very slow and there were some parts that did not seem necessary and only made the movie longer. For instance, they stopped too many times in the middle of the story and showed us the dying woman and her daughter scene, which at some point distracted me and cut the flow of the Benjamin story.

		<shortDescription>Vapid But Not Totally Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is Oscar bait. But whatever awards may or may not come, it is a film with a clever premise but absent an engaging story. It is a good film with a few great moments and characters. However it is not a great film. This is going to be the first David Fincher movie I will not buy for my personal collection.Benjamin Button is a bit Titanic and a bit more Forrest Gump as if it were made by Jean Pierre Jeunet. Naturally David Fincher, a Jeunet contemporary and associate, would typically be the best thing for this type of film. Zemeckis was probably a bit too, happy-go-lucky with Forrest Gump, also written by Button scribe Eric Roth, who seems to love overwriting multi- character historical epics. And while the stories are vastly different, there are a multitude of similarities in tone and execution to Jeunet's "A Very Long Engagement." And like that film, Button suffers from the same issues of pacing, redundancy. Also, both films try, often without success to be too clever and end up being much too boring.One facet of the story that deserves notice above others, are the supporting characters. Sure Pitt and Blanchet are decent. But they are hardly the main attraction. Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's mother and Jared Harris as the tug boat skipper are clear standouts and deserve recognition for their work.Benjamin Button is most enjoyable in the first section, when Button is an old man. His early years are by far the most involving and pay-off the gimmicky premise the best. I don't want to reveal too much of the story, because it is one worth seeing in general. Unfortunately the second half of the film fares, by design, more predictably and far less involving. Many attempts at drama such as Benajmin's time with his father fell a bit flat and the humming bird metaphor felt weak and contrived.I would say my most obvious reaction to this film was that Fincher simply did not seemed very interested in these characters, nothing to invest in their emotions. There are numerous scenes that are filmed very artfully, but never felt more than filling time and empty space. Fincher's camera, and thus his eye, are far more interested in Button when he was young and at his most curious. The later years of love and loss, are endlessly bland and procedural and an ending that seemed more at home in an episode of ER than in an epic love story. The truth is the film had probably ended about 20 minutes earlier and by that time, everyone involved had overstayed their welcome. So no I would never buy Benjamin Button for my Blu-Ray player. I have been following Fincher ever since Alien3. I found his twisted visual sense to be enjoyable to the last drop. Seven and Fight Club are wondrous in their trickery and The Game and Zodiac are moralistic troves down dark alleys of the mind. Even Panic Room is one of my favorite thrillers because it was full of life and unexpected turns. But with Benjamin button, Fincher has strayed from his flock. We feel every turn before we get there, because of the premise, we know the way to the end and its not much interesting when we get there. Sure its a sad story, but it isn't a very interesting one. And no matter how well the film is made, there is a feeling of disappointment one cannot ignore. There is really no reason to watch this more than once. If you wish to see a deliberate story of love lost and a life unattainable, I point you to Kubrick's timeless Barry Lyndon. One last thing is on the technical side. Being a photographer, there are some points I will pick at. This is the second time Fincher has used the Viper digital camera system. The film is purposely desaturated, but just like with Zodiac, the digital capture just cannot capture light in a truly luminous manor. Almost every image just looks flat, devoid of snap. And just like Zodiac and some pieces of the Viper-filmed Miami Vice, the images tend to be a tad soft, probably because the Viper cannot resolve the same level of detail of film---yet anyway. So props to Claudio Miranda for his craft, but the equipment still has a ways to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring Case of Attachment Disorder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Fincher. 'Fight Club' and 'The Game' are definitely on my favourites list. This movie left me cold. At least I was knitting so I don't consider those nearly 3 hours as wasted. But alas! such a nice idea utterly destroyed...The plot has many inconsistencies let me name just few:1# I don't see the reason why Benjamin's mind is getting old too. Dementia as we all know has biological causes and has a lot to do with our bodies getting old. It would be much more fascinating if instead of being a demented child he would spread wisdom of his old age as a three- four years old. If there was any deep experience in his life, that is... 2# Although every single relationship in his life is supposed to be very deep and meaningful it is very hard to believe so because he doesn't seem attached to anybody including 'love of his life' - Daisy. Yes, they meet now and then and have a child together but it looks mostly like a fling nothing more. It's far too easy for him to leave her, as if he knew that getting younger he would be even more irresistible for her :) I caught myself thinking that maybe it's because his mother died at his birth and his father abandoned him. But we are to believe that this black woman was born to be mother (despite putting him inside a drawer at first) - if she was such a good mother - how come that he had such a blank stare at her funeral? 3# Daisy never tells her daughter about her dancing career despite the fact that she has a ballet school, so I assume she was claiming no experience whatsoever to her pupils, right?In general I think that Brad Pitt's acting was terrible. Frankly - it wasn't probably his fault because out of this boring droll of a cinematographic art only 15 minutes or so where suited to his personality but sadly those 15 min consisted mostly of him riding motorcycle in a nice landscape or shacking up with the most cold and wooden chick around. Their passion was as believable as his peculiar condition. And his condition makes him never really old or young and never ever getting a pair of balls.As somebody nicely pointed out - no conflict whatsoever - it's not a surprise when there is no attachment. There was no grief, no anger, no real suffering. He is dull and alone but doesn't even develop any interesting addiction. How about trying to stop his fate? He is never growing up and acquiring any wisdom. At the end I drop some tears and in retrospect I think it was my gut reaction to see 'mother' with a dying baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Godawful Case of Conflict Avoidance, and at almost 3 hours long too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ouch. I never thought I'd be giving a David FINCHER movie a rating under 6 stars. As it turns out... you really never should say "never".Like I said, I love Fincher. I watched this movie primarily for the fact that he directed it. That, AND the fact that Cate Blanchett is in it. Had Blanchett not been in it, it would have been a zero star rating, if I could give it that!!! The movie was bad right from the start. First off, the old lady was so over-acted and WAY over exaggerated. I have NEVER heard an old woman talk like that before, and I was there when my Grandmother (on my mom's side) was sick in the hospital. Add the obligatory Hurricane Katrina reference to that and, yep, it was clear this was going to be one VERY bad movie. Should you encounter a start as bad as this, I ask that you eject the disc from the player, drop it in a bucket of ice-cold water, and call the poison control, as you have something very toxic on your hands! The plot was rubbish for two reasons: One being that it was just a remake of Forrest Gump. Ferchrissake, it was written by the same screen writer! Another being that it was just nonsensical, despite it sounding interesting. For starters, he is a FREAK. He was born an old man. He was adopted. He should have had a rough life but no, he has it all wonderful and what not. There were several parts where I just fell on the ground and flailed around laughing because it was just so hokey and over-the-top.The BIGGEST problem with the plot was that there was not enough conflict. I mean, come on, this movie is almost three hours long, and whatever conflict there is, it gets resolved in 2 minutes. This got on my nerves. Come on, with the whole "Midnight lover with Tilda Swinton" and "Pursuing Daisy" story, there should be a conflict. Simply put, there isn't. It got on my nerves.The movie is simply WAY TOO LONG too. Come on, it runs 167 minutes. The same story could have been told in about TWO hours or less! But no, Fincher had to overflow it with so much unnecessary crap (like the Tilda Swinton plot) and 5 minute shots.Oh the ending was lame too. Come on you drag the plot out for THAT LONG and then suddenly try to end with the *GROOOOAAAANNN* inducing "Some are mothers, some dance, some get struck by lightning" lameness. Way to rush the ending to a very unnecessarily long and slow paced movie. Can someone also tell me why the humming bird was important??? I was just face-palming when it appeared at the end.By the time the movie was over, I just left the theatre feeling depressed and sick. Come on, too much lame-ness and bleakness, it wasn't even uplifting-depressing, it was just plain draining and depressing.Overall, this movie is a total plagiarism and a very overlong and unorganized mess of a film, and I love Davind Fincher. Let's hope his Dragon Tattoo adaptation turns out good. As for this, AVOID!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youth is wasted on the Pitt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the longest time, I held off on watching this movie because I thought it would be as depressing as rain on a Monday morning. I was wrong. It's worse; like pouring molten lava over your genitals, like seeing police lights in your rearview mirror, like finding your lover in bed with someone else, like watching an American IDOL winner attempt a career in music? THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is horrifyingly painful.David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB) directs - no wonder it's so disturbing - from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald.1918: At the end of WWI, a boy is born to Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng), the mother dying in labor. The baby Benjamin Button is somehow age-wrinkled and scares the pants off Thomas, who leaves Benjamin on the doorstep of a senior's retirement home, where Queenie the caregiver (Taraji P. Henson) adopts him.As the boy gets older, he gets "younger," that is, even though he looks like a wizened old prune at age seven, his mind is that of a seven-year-old. During this period, Benjamin befriends a young girl named Daisy, even though, from an outsider view, it looks like a dirty old man cultivating an agenda with a seven-year-old girl.Disturbing.Benjamin grows (i.e. gets younger) until he is Brad Pitt, and Daisy becomes Cate Blanchett. Somewhere in the middle of her aging and his youthing, they move into an apartment together and do the nasty continually.They even birth a child, normal in every way, until Benjamin (considering his bizarre fate) leaves Daisy without a word one morning.Depressing.Benjamin spends much of his screen time traveling the world and having non-sequitur adventures that have no bearing on the main theme of his horrifying brain malfunction. It's like FORREST GUMP for opposite-aging freaks.The filmmakers aim for relevancy by inserting "life messages" into Benjamin's travels, but these messages of "power over one's destiny" are unoriginal tropes.The aging makeup is seamless and we never question the actors are doctored. The movie-making process is actually more transparent: For the sake of the narrative to flow, characters talk to themselves, or do voice-over, with Daisy's daughter (Julia Ormond) reading Benjamin's diary for most of the movie, doing that annoying movie device of turning to pictures in the diary that reveal exact moments she is describing.And that's not even as contrived as the overwrought coincidence sequence in which Daisy breaks her leg and derails her dancing career - a woman missing a taxi, a man not setting his alarm, someone leaving one minute later than usual, blah blah - when she could've just as easily been hit by a truck, rather than Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE of coincidences.In hospital, Benjamin visits Daisy, who hasn't seen him in years. She exclaims, "My God, look at you! You're perfect!" Well, he is Brad Pitt.Jason Flemyng and Brad Pitt sit down to a beer, as same-aged father and son, reminiscing about SNATCH, that other movie they did together where no one could figure what was happening either.Benjamin's autumn years get distressing again, as elderly Daisy cares for him when he physically reverts to a tiny, pink, smooth baby - with his mind at the stage of old-age dementia. It is disturbing to watch these scenes of Daisy cradling a baby trying to mouth something (as babies do) but imagining it is Benjamin Button, losing the power of speech, even as he loses his powers of cognition.BENJAMIN BUTTON is geared for tragedy overload, but can we really feel pity for Benjamin Button? For a whole bump-ugly segment of his life, he got to be Brad Pitt. How many people can be that lucky? --Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).</fullReview>

It tries to take on art-house lines, so there are none. In this way, it is something of a deluded mainstream project.The sense of mood that is created as time passes and histories unfold seems muted and unable to give the necessary counterpoint to the dramatic crisis.Beautiful people and some poignant moments did not make this film compelling. The novelty of aging in reverse wears thin and is simply propped up by clever imagery. The love story is curiously impotent. It would appear Hollywood has impressed itself again. But they have mistaken craft for art.</fullReview>

It continues without plot. It ends without plot. The characters are uninteresting and the premise is abhorrent - just as the short story was. A must avoid.It's boring. It's poorly written. Oh, yes, the acting is fantastic as would be expected from Brad... but other than his interpretation, this has zero to offer. It got stars from Hollywood because it's pure crap.

This movie moves so slowly that I almost turned it off before it was over. It was like watching Forest Grump in slow motion. Yes Brad was his beautiful self, even when he was old and Cate Blanchett was good, I guess though I really hated her character at lot. Also I guessed the ending before it happened and the old this is happening during a hurricane thing didn't work for me. Also the clock was just a distraction that really did n't add anything to the story. I wished I had read the original story to see exactly what the author was trying to say about life. I have a feeling that the story about the clock maker was better explained as I think his reasoning for making the clock was the real point; but I think the film maker missed it.

		<fullReview>The film displayed great technical wizardry and for those interested in special effects, this movie might hold some fascination. However, I found the story ridiculous and off-putting and the special effects didn't help because they came off as a distraction which underscored the whole gimmicky nature of the premise. The film tried to "have it both ways," to be based in a fantasy premise, while presumably providing insights into the "human condition" and I don't think this worked because of a repeatedly jarring problem: nobody reacted in a realistic way to Benjamin Button's aging-backwards situation. There were other plot holes too, of the proverbial "you could drive a truck through it" sort but I will confine my criticisms to that first "sticking point," i.e. people's bland reactions to an aging-backwards person in their midst, which in turn undermined any claim to pointing out truths about life, which the various life experiences of Button seemed intended to accomplish. And PS, what was up with that Katrina business?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher's film that follows Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), a man who was born in his 80s and continually grows younger, is one of three my favorite movies from last year along with Gran Torino and Synecdoche, New York. Now when I think of it, all three movies have in common the theme of aging, loss, memory, inevitable death and dealing with it. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the most technically accomplished, refined, and cinematically stunning of the three. It is based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald's short and little known story but it only has in common with the story the title, the main idea, and I believe as a tribute to Fitzgerald's more famous work, the name of Benjamin Button's eternal love, Daisy who was played amazingly by Cate Blanchett. The story in the film is Eric Roth (Oscar nominated script) through and through and it is obvious that he used the same approach and the same device as in his Oscar winning script for Forrest Gump. Does it make BB a bad movie? Most definitely, no. Even if it easy to spot the similarities, BB is a fantastic movie on its own merits. It is a work of art for all its duration. It is a moving dramatic story of love, longing, and losses of one ordinary man with the extraordinary condition. Yes, the film is long and it does not rush. But the film of such beauty can and must be enjoyed even if or when the story would stall for a while. The performances, the virtuoso directing by David Fincher, the incredible flawless work by the teams of make-up artists, visual effects specialists, and by the specialists in Art Direction departments have surpassed any and all possible expectations and achieved an incredible result. According to my rule of thumb, any film with Cate Blanchett is worth watching. I've been her fan for years, and I love her as the actress and admire her as a person and the most beautiful woman in the world. Her work in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Brad Pitt belongs to the best screen romances ever and if anything, the film will be remembered for some of the most beautiful and memorable romantic scenes ever filmed. The night scene in NYC with the silhouette of dancing Cate has entered my personal vault of the most beloved film treasures. I loved the film. I know it may not be perfect story-wise but I don't care. There is much more to it than the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film was so long and slow I found myself just waiting for it to end, rather than hoping it wouldn't.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I saw the trailer for this film i was intrigued. The idea of a man born old and growing younger seemed like an interesting concept and I looked forward to seeing exactly how this would be included in the story.In the end, the fact that Benjamin Button gets younger was about the only thing I brought away from the movie. The story was incredibly weak, with very little really happening other than Button and Daisy being together, then apart, then together, and so on and so forth. The film was so long and slow I found myself just waiting for it to end, rather than hoping it wouldn't.There seemed to be parts in the film that there was either no need for, or just didn't make sense. Why did we need to see Benjamin going to a brothel? Why was there a random hummingbird in the middle of the ocean, and in the middle of a storm at the end? I understand the relationship of the hummingbird with Buttons captain, but why have the bird at the end. It had no relation to the old woman other than through Button. What was the point of Hurricane Katrina at the end anyway??? It just seemed pointless to me. But most of all, what was the significance of the clock in the beginning and the end?? It might have made sense if the clock had been involved somehow. I was expecting that once Benjamin died, the clock to stop at the same time to show some sort of connection between the two. But no the last thing we see is that clock still going. Maybe I totally missed something but it seemed pointless to me.The movie wasn't a total disappointment though. I thought the acting was good, and the special effects couldn't be faulted. However, acting and effects count for very little when there is such a weak storyline. In the end I was glad I saw it, but I wont be watching it again (and definitely wont be buying the DVD)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The parable of backwards time and a backwards dancer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an indulgent ramble!This was a loose string of vignettes gathered together around the fantasy of one individual for whom time runs backwards, a child born old and growing younger. Put together over this huge length of time it was supposed to somehow give us enlightenment and a bit of universal truth about the the nature of life, the universe and everything. That is the function of a parable, and it seems that Fincher set out to make one, but forgot that parables are usually pithy and to the point. I haven't read the F Scott Fitzgerald short story, but maybe at 20 pages (according to some contributors here) that's just what it is.Let's look at a couple of these vignettes. Firstly the Monsieur Gateau story, which was totally apt and to the point, the magnificent clock he made to run backwards in the hope that it would wind back time and undo the carnage of WW1, returning his only son from his grave in a Flanders field. That was very moving, especially the run-backwards shots of the fallen soldiers rising up out of the mud and gore, and made me hope for good things.Amidst Daisy's death bed mumbles I never quite caught a link between the backwards clock and Benjamin's life running in that direction, and maybe none was made. Perhaps it was just a "what if?" statement as a foreword to the main story. But then that main 'story' simply got lost, hopelessly so.Take the vignette about the sequence of chance events that led to Daisy being struck by a Parisian taxi. Utter irrelevance, adding I don't know how many minutes to an already overlong movie. Every road accident has 101 elements of pure chance, and hers was no different, and let's face it, if you are going to dance backwards into a Paris street from behind a parked truck, you have a damn good chance of getting run over, and if you don't, you are left with a 100% certainty of stepping in a dog turd when you reach the opposite pavement.I stepped in an hugely overlong dog turd called 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'.I'll give it 3 for a few good moments, especially M. Gateau, but I think I'm being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but a classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this expecting a good movie, and that is what I got out of Benjamin Button. The film-making and direction are obviously amazing, and Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett turn in commendable performances. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel an emotional connection to the story until over 2/3rds into the movie.I don't put too much stock into comparisons with Forrest Gump. I'd say Benjamin Button and Gump deal with very different themes, although they both have a lot of plot elements in common. A few of them were very apparent and annoying at times, the most egregious being Button's mama's favorite aphorism: You never know what's coming for ya'.The biggest problem I have with Button is that in spite of the fantastic direction and acting, the story and the main character just don't elicit a great response from you until the end is nigh. The last 40 minutes or so are the best of the film, and the most touching. But in the first two hours, Button's character is an enigma, and we learn nothing at all about what he thinks or feels, beyond his love for Daisy and his mama. The final 40 minutes are a triumph because through his actions, we finally learn something about Button - what he thinks of his condition, and what kind of life he decides to lead. It doesn't hurt either that Button's character has a diminished role in the final part, with Cate Blanchett taking a more prominent position.This is an unusual Hollywood epic, that much is certain. We don't see movies like this from Hollywood very often - a movie with great direction and acting, a long epic of consistent quality. The problem is that the story and the protagonist just come off as a bit too flat, a little too 2-dimensional, for most of the movie. I liked Benjamin Button, and it's sure to be remembered for quite a while, but the storytelling just doesn't work quite well enough for it to be among the best. It is really hard for fantastic acting and directing to rescue a shabbily-written story, and unfortunately, I don't think even the great team on Benjamin Button was up to the task. Do watch Benjamin Button, but don't be surprised if you find the storytelling a little lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fantasy is only a detail in a stunning film about the wonder of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had wanted to see "Benjamin Button" since I found out what it was about. I had read Fitzgerald's short story (the inspiration for this) and wanted to see just how that would transform into a three-hour film. Incidentally, the short story and film have very little to do with one another save for the title and a man named Benjamin Button who ages backwards.Incidentally again, that curiosity turns out to be the least magical part of this amazing movie. The story begins at the end of the first World War. I imagine had the story began in modern times we would have watched something akin to a Discovery Channel medical mystery in which poor Benjamin is studied by a myriad of doctors and scientists along with a handful of others who also age backwards with every fascination focused on what in the world was going on. Not here. This is a story of a man's life first and foremost. The oddity of his age is merely a detail.And that is where the magic truly comes in. I happen to be a sucker for the story that inspires me to live life to the fullest. If Benjamin is such a freak, why is it that so much of his life is relatable? Love, adventure, family, loss? I'll step away from the sentimental now. This is a finely crafted gem of a movie with first-rate acting and a direction style that prefers to mosey along with random tangents to backwards clocks and men struck by lightening. Frankly, I walked into the threatre expecting something depressing. Save for the theme of life that always seems to include death and loss, this was quite charming and even funny in spots.I thoroughly enjoyed "Benjamin Button". It is a beautifully made film with a stellar story. I don't know if it will be up for anything in particular when the Oscars come around, but it was satisfying, haunting, and therefore should deserve something. Bravo, all those involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rough cut presented as finished product</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really having a difficult time trying to understand what happened here. I do believe there may be a great film somewhere in this mess, so why couldn't Fincher and Co. find it? It seems like they just went ahead and shot the very first draft of the script without much deliberation. I rarely complain about film length, but considering the slow nature of the story, this really was far too long. Uninteresting and unnecessary scenes take up way too much of the running time. Cutting at least a half hour might have drastically improved the flow of things. The entire structure was extremely uneven. Episodic storytelling is a great device, but fails when it all of a sudden feels like a completely different film (and one that you'd rather be watching?) The most inspired scene of the movie comes out of nowhere. The events leading up to a traffic accident are picked apart piece by piece in an energetic, detailed analysis of cause and effect, but there's nothing else like it in the entire film. Cate Blanchett is fantastic and Brad Pitt performs a great balancing act considering all the technicalities of the role and scattered story, but the problem with the character of Benjamin Button is that he's really not a very interesting person. His condition takes the place of any real personality and you never really get to know him. The title fits. Curiosity will likely draw a lot of people to see this film, and it is worth seeing, once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie might have cured my phobia of dying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So...to be quite honest I wasn't sure of what I was getting myself into when I went to see this based off of the mixed reviews that I religiously read. My conclusion? This movie was a magical, complacent, gorgeous, classic and timeless journey that needs to be taken at least once by it's audience. This movie was more then I expected to be. I won't go so far as to say it is the best movie that I have ever seen. But to say that I left with tears in my eyes and memories in my mind is to be modest.I don't know if others have such phobias as I but dying is something that honestly plagues my mind and literally distracts and prevents me from living part of my life I have yet to live. When the woman whose name Benjamin doesn't remember puts losing others as eloquent as she did my judgment began to change. I believe she said something similar to....we need to lose people in life or we will never know how important they were to us...yeah, sheer poetry.This movie I hope will be praised decades from now and stand the test of time. Did I cry, did I laugh, did I hurt, was I mad, was I in suspense, and did I leave the theater a bit changed, perplexed and reassessing my life? Yes to all of these. Go see it. But with an open mind. Let this movie into your heart and you will be happy you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Film Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the film last night and liked it. It's got some very poignant moments and is a thoughtful reflection on life and love. The aging backwards is an unusual technique but not a distracting one, as some would have us believe, and ultimately the film stays with you, and you leave the theater reflecting on your own mortality, grateful for the time you do have... My only real complaint is that the dialogue with a few different characters (the dying Daisy, for one) at different times was inaudible--a problem both with the miking and the actor's delivery. On such a sumptuous production this was very irritating, as all other details had been tended to. The director should have had a grip on this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technical gimmicry fine, acting OK to very good, but what a BORE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoilers everywhere. Any resemblance between this movie and Scott Fitzgerald's slight, whimsical short story, which, from its peculiar perspective, allowed its author to make some wry comments about filial piety, marriage and family ties, is non-existent.This is one of the most tedious films I have ever sat through. Spoiler:Particularly insulting, was the spelling out of all the minute factors which led to Daisy's accident. For the script to borrow only a single motif from Fitzgerald, namely, a life lived from old age to infancy, and then steal his title would be bad enough. But to purposely make your film an "over the years" biography with the history of America for backdrop and then get ALL the details(big and little) wrong is preposterous. The numerous "goofs" made in the film have been recounted elsewhere on this site. But what dwarfs comparison is the blatant ignorance about race relations in America for most of the twentieth century, especially in the South. Spoiler:Presenting an openly inter-racial couple in the Jim Crow South in 1918 would have been impossible. Afterward, a white baby is adopted by a black couple. OK. Even if we accept Benjamin as theirs,what follows is impossible. This apparently black man is discovered by a white grandmother concealed under the table with her grand-daughter, without any consequences. (An actual child, Emmett Till, was lynched for whistling at a white woman.) Queenie's dialect is black; her "son's" is not. The entire relationship between Benjamin and Daisy, or Benjamin with the old white people in the nursing home in the 1930's and '40's would have been impossible, given the premise made by the screenwriters. A white tugboat captain fraternizing with a black man?(Benjamin still thinks he is Queenie's son or her sister's at that point)Let alone taking him to a white brothel?In the pre-WWII South? Get real!An old lady in the nursing home plays a superb Scott Joplin rag on the piano. Possible, but not likely. Composer Virgil Thompson once snapped on TV that, when he was a child, respectable (white) women in Kansas City did not play "The Twelfth Street Rag," because they somehow knew what went on on Twelfth Street. Somebody said this already on the goof site: Tugboats on the high seas? In WWII combat? Impossible. If they decided to make an over-the-years movie of America, how could they have been so stupid or so arrogant as to set it in eras which members of the audience had to know better than they did? Watching this movie was like having an accident you witnessed described to you by someone who obviously never saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read after watching the movie only (SPOILERS) To Help you all understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All of you are critiquing this movie and have no idea what a good film is. When telling a good story or directing a good movie, you must leave things up for discussion or interpretation. This wasn't transformers, it was a film that allows different people to grasp different feelings from it. Many themes can be found in this film such as "Don't judge a book by it's cover" - People assumed that Benjamin was an old man who was going to die any day but inside he was as young as a baby."The separation between body and mind" ? Although Benjamin's BODY had aged backwards, his mind had been aging forward just like everyone else. Which can be seen by the fact that a 5 year old child has Alzheimer. This shows you how powerful the mind is, that even when everything is reversed it is still strong enough to function properly.Ingenious ? To have a child grow up backwards, all alone with nobody to relate too. He is with the old people who have seen it all and are content with the confines of their nursing home. Benjamin can't sit still like that, he has the mind of child and wants to explore his surroundings. He seeks the opportunity to take chances, like working on the boat for a day or having drinks with his real father, traveling the world and joining the navy.Due Date ? Other than terminally ill patience, nobody ever knows when they will pass. Benjamin knows his whole life, how much time he has left in this world. As he gets younger and younger, the countdown continues to the point where he knows he will eventually run out of time. 0 ? infinity is how we look at a normal life but Benjamin's was 80 ? 0. He knew that barring some type of tragedy that he had exactly so much time left.Relationship ? Benjamin begins his romantic life in a backwards fashion as well. While many older men find themselves incapable of procuring a women based on their looks or abilities they have to pay for the company of a stranger. All the while Benjamin is having fun but longs to be with Daisy the one he loves. The only problem is that Benjamin and Daisy both love each other and at one time or another when they do consummate their love they both want to feel good about who they are at that point. ( This can be seen when Benjamin turns down Daisy when she visits home initially because he feels old and she looks beautiful. The reverse happens when Benjamin looks younger and Daisy is all banged up in the hospital after her accident and spurns Benjamin.) But finally when she is well she finds Benjamin and is ready to be with him.Love ? Benjamin and Daisy love each other when he is an old man and she is a child and all through their lives the continue to love each other all the way through to when he is a young child and Daisy is taking care of him. Love knows no bounds and no age.Symbolism ? Every time Benjamin's life is about to change or progress there, is some type of clock in the picture or the noise of a clock ringing or changing an hour.The clock in the beginning that roles in reverse seems to be directly connected with the life of Benjamin Button. As the clock roles backwards so does Benjamin's life. The only other person place or thing that is on the same page as Benjamin is the clock. It is almost like a countdown to the end of his life and the only person place or thing that Benjamin can relate too.Another symbolic point is the introduction of the humming bird. The Humming bird's wing pattern is that of a figure eight, which is the symbol of infinity. After the boat captain passes away in the attack Benjamin looks at sea and sees a humming bird fly in his direction. This symbolizes that even though he is dead, that he lives on in Benjamin because he shared his stories with him. Later on in the movie after Daisy's daughter figures out that Benjamin is her father and that she had unknowingly met him before she finishes the book and we see the humming bird. This is symbolic that Benjamin now lives on through his daughter because she has heard his story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", it is a sweeping epic of a motion picture, and is superbly executed by all involved. The film is very touching, and you become quite taken with the characters, particularly Benjamin, wonderfully portrayed by Brad Pitt.Much like "Meet Joe Black", it's such a good movie that you hardly notice the long running time, about three hours. To me, that's one sign of a movie very well done, when it's long, but still feels short because of how good it is.The scene with Benjamin on the Triumph motorcycle is absolutely iconic, and I think the film is testament to how talented and versatile Brad Pitt is as an actor. I would definitely recommend this movie to others, that's why I felt compelled to write this review! I am very much looking forward to seeing what Mr. Pitt has in store for us next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button...... Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me start by saying that a 10/10 is not enough. Never have I cried so hard at the end of a film. I even cam home no more than half an hour ago and cried on my bed. This movie really gets to you, and I know that this may sound a bit cliché, but it has everything an excellent film could want. Comedy, drama, romance, mystery. I know some people out there may not agree with me, (like that butt - hole roger ebert who only gave it 2 and a half stars!) however I am finding it difficult to put into words how great this film is, as emotion has swarmed over me. The Curious Case Of Benjamin button is now easily in my top 5 greatest movies of all time. To not see this movie would be a grave mistake. I am so yearning to read the original book. I know this review/comment may sound like someone rambling on but this movie, without a doubt, is perfect. That's the only word I can use to describe The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button...... P-e-r-f-e-c-t. I don't just highly recommend this movie, I hearteningly implore you... nay, beg you to at least watch this film once, as it will leave you swept off your feet with vast amounts of emotion. And that's all i have to say about that.Adios ! Y'all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Coming for You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. No doubt headed into this one with inflated expectations of greatness. While the basic theme fascinates me, the execution of the storyline just didn't quite keep my interest. Mostly I just kept asking why. Why do so few people realize what is happening? Why is BB attracted to Cate Blanchett's character (most guys would have run away)? Why is Cate's character attracted to BB (he seems quite dull)? David Fincher is a stud director with a resume that includes Zodiac, Fight Club and Seven. He seems to do what he can with Eric Roth's adaptation of Fitzgerald's short story ... I just felt it needed more detail and more happenings. Our only real glimpse of BB's travels are on the tug boat and those are probably the highlight of the film, next to the uniqueness of the make-up and special effects. Contrast this to the far superior Forrest Gump, also penned by Mr. Roth.Brad Pitt plays the role in a disarmingly quiet mode, while Cate Blanchett and Tarij P Henson go overboard. The New Orleans setting and other set design were outstanding. The flashback scene from the hospital death bed is given a nice twist with Katrina bearing down. Seems to be a movie many would enjoy, I had just hoped for a bit more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I have to be honest with myself. I think that I am trying to like it more than I actually did like it. The plot was a new and fresh idea that kept we wondering what would happen, but the thing is half the fun of the movie is the wondering. After you find out what happens after all the loud music and the build-up, all you're doing is waiting for the NEXT loud bout of music and build-up. The quote about the journey being the better part of the destination truly embodies this movie. It was almost....anti-climactic. Which in retrospect defeats the purpose because you already know what's going to happen! If you have a brain stem present you can peace together quickly that he is going to die at the end of the movie, and that he's going to be very young.

Pitt, Blanchett and many others give excellent performances in the film, the film is beautifully shot however it never gets you to shed that all important tear. I stilled loved the film, and I think it's a front runner for best pic, but I can't help but wonder what could have been with a few minor tweaks. My take away is that life is composed of many subtle things that ultimately shape how we end up, and this movie delivers that.

		<shortDescription>Not really my cup of tea, but this was brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to make a movie with this material (and I can think of a lot of reasons not to, "Forrest Gump" being at the top of the list), you really need to take your time setting up the world these characters inhabit, and David Fincher is in the position where he can...take his own sweet time.I would recommend that if you're ambivalent about this at all, go when you can surrender three hours as well as yourself. Sentimental and romantic (an excerpt from the Broadway musical, "Carousel" is recreated here and it fits perfectly), the tone Fincher creates is pitch perfect and amazingly sustained--with the help of Brad Pitt's performance--from beginning to end.Using the Fincher bag of cinematic tricks to seduce the viewer into accepting without even trying to understand the hook here, the main character's aging backwards, the film packs several emotional wallops, particularly the long end sequence with the amazing acting of Cate Blanchett.The audience I saw this with was stunned at the finale. And so was I. Likely the film that will sweep the awards season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why on earth do they inflict these terribly long films on us? It is pure self-indulgence and, though this film was nothing like as bad as that awful 'Titainic' film, it suffered horribly from bloat. They could easily have cut two hours out of the film and have been left with a reasonably good one.The first hour wasn't bad. Actually there were some interesting episodes. The novelty of the age thing was played fairly well - by the middle of the film, in his forties, it was sagging badly, no longer novel and not really working.They should have had more actors. The makeup wasn't bad, it's true, but trying to make people in their forties look as if they are in their twenties simply doesn't work, even though it was clear that they'd tried very hard with their photoshop style special effects.I was dragged to this by my wife - I'd recommend resisting it if yours tries this! It really is far, far too slight a plot with actors too insubstantial to carry all that time.Voice overs are lazy - with a very short film you can understand that they are there to overcome the time limitation with this long tedious film there was no such excuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most empty viewing experiences I've ever had.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several nice technology tests in Button. There's also some nice makeup and cinematography.Sadly, there is no protagonist, antagonist, story, anything. Benjamin gets younger. And he meets up with Cate every now and then.I can only express how truly empty this exercise is by using SPOILERS: So ~ here there be spoilers...Brad is somehow born an old man. This neither will be questioned or explained.Soon Brad is a walking around and there's the wonderful gimmick of "hey, they digitally shoved Brad's face on an old guy's body!" Been done plenty of times before, the last Indian Jones saved Harrison Ford from quite a bit of heavy stunt work by digitally pasting his face on stuntmen. But Indy didn't age backwards so I guess it didn't warrant the attention.Soon Brad meets a little girl ~ there is no chemistry but never mind, this is the start of the relationship for the entire 3 hours. This is the first movie that has made Cate Blanchet boring. I didn't know that was possible. Her scenes (not her fault, it's the screenplay and direction) grinded the movie into more of a halt than I thought possible.And I can now wrap up the rest of the movie: Brad keeps getting younger and bumps in the the girl, who is getting older. They don't talk about much nor experience much, just wistfully look at each other like they're filming "Gone With The Wind". The scene with the most action (I'm not talking action as in explosions but where something happens of some sort of consequence) was the boat scene. Benjamin's character passively watches the whole thing happen. Like every other scene. Oh yeah, there a bit character who's flashbacks show the several times he got struck by lightening. I'm not sure if those were supposed to be funny or what, got old after a bit...The end of Button makes Spielberg's "A.I." and the final "Lord of the Rings" look like some of the greatest film endings of all time. I ran for the exit at the start of some sort of montage.For reference: a couple of my favorite films are "Barry Lyndon" and "Grapes of Wrath" so it's not like I'm a Michael Bay fan expecting something else. I just wanted a well told story with some interesting scenes and compelling characters. Button didn't not offer one moment of interest for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I neither hated nor loved this movie. It was beautiful, as everyone else has said, and did make me at least shed a tear or two at the end. But a lot of it didn't seem to add up. And for a movie about time, unfortunately a lot of what didn't add up had to do with time. For one thing, why did his real father, near the end of his life, still have almost jet black hair and not look very old at all? Did they have Grecian formula for men back then? Also, why did Benjamin hook up with Daisy, get her pregnant and then decide when the baby was a year old he needed to leave? Because if the child and Daisy meant so much to him, he still could have stuck around for at least 10 more years. He comes back about 12 years later and is a young, but still grown man. It's better than he wanders around India rather than trying to raise his daughter and be with the woman he loves so much? Completely illogical! And more than anything, the stupid hummingbird thing was just completely ridiculous and was something even a child would groan about in an animated Disney movie. It reminded me of the feather in Forest Gump, but that feather was a lot more plausible. In fact, this definitely seemed a Forest Gump want-to-be in a lot of ways, as others have noted. Just doesn't quite live up to that standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Benjamin Button is a good film and a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It looks beautiful, sounds beautiful but we must all be really starved of good film-making if this movie gets people waxing lyrical. It's a great high concept idea, but what do the film-makers get really out of that besides the "life is unpredictable... you never know when change is gonna come" theme that permeates the movie. Well, dah, there's nothing that profound about that. Also, while Brad Pitt is gorgeous to look at, and a very likable movie star, his performance somehow left me a little cold - it doesn't hit any deep emotional chords, and while you could praise him for being subtle, he just doesn't have the everyman quality, that sense of human anguish anyone can relate to, that someone like Will Smith does. I wish he would just let go a little more like he did in Babel, and really show us the man behind the beautiful veil. David Fincher got gritty and great in Zodiac, but he gives in to style a little too much in Benjamin button - too many beautiful shots of Brad Pitt on motorbikes with sunglasses on, in front of a magnificent sunset. I wanted the whole movie to feel more real. Don't get taken in by the hype, Oscar voters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good characters, fun storyline, but feels empty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie brings us along the life story of Benjamin Button, who is born as an infant with all the problems of an aged man. The first half of the movie was very fun, he met fun characters, but it all turned downhill a bit once Benjamin was too old to not have a personality anymore. His character seemed completely devoid of anything resembling humanity other than the love the old, dying daisy had for him. Much of this can be accounted for the fact that he did not fit in with anybody throughout his life and all of his relationships were forced to be sporadic and seemingly surreal, which was a nice effect, but beyond this he simply seemed like a hollow person and his emotional depth made him seem inhuman throughout the movie. The screenwriter seemed to have had a dream of seeing the world and wanted to express that adventurousness in his film. Having Benjamin live on a tugboat and visit majestic places, but there just wasn't any meaning behind it, because it seemed more like a training montage but instead of training boxing skills, he was training his character's emotional depth. Regardless, it seemed empty and thus had no effect on me. And I felt the part about him moving to India and living as a peasant there was inappropriate. another point certainly brought up by others already is Benjamin's irresponsibility. obviously we are supposed to have sympathies for Benjamin, but if he is going to have a child with someone when he is not going to be responsible enough to take care of it, that makes him just as bad as his father. Now I can see how the movie might want to show his humanity by showing similarities between him and his father but the fact that Daisy forgave him so easily perplexed me. I wanted to see anger and hatred when he showed up at the ballet class, but instead was treated to casual sex with an awkward separation at the end. Maybe because our society's morals today are slipping the director deemed this to not be completely inappropriate, but I felt otherwise. After feeling cheated by this scene, the movie transitioned into Daisy taking care of Benjamin, and as I was still a bit jaded by the previous scene, my experience with this part of the movie was negatively impacted, to say it lightly, making me leave the theater with mixed feelings toward the film, especially since the entire story was read out of a diary to give Benjamin an aura of "mystique" as a special person of the past, when I felt he did not deserve such recognition.</fullReview>

"Big Fish" for instance, is one of my favorite movies and the story is told pretty much the same way this one is. What got me disappointed with how "slow" the movie develops. The whole aging process went too slow. Making this movie pretty heavy and tough to watch.The example of "Big Fish" is a very good one because it tells a great story, during the main character's aging, yet without betting boring by any way.This detail is the only reason why I gave this movie a 6 star and not a 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally Overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointed I was. After being thoroughly excited to see this film ever since I first caught wind of it, I left the theatre in a state of bewilderment. How could such a masterful director and a bevy of talented performers and crew produce such meaningless and pointless drivel? More than that, how could they have fooled damn near the entire population into thinking they had actually made a good film? At this moment the film is #71 on the IMDb top 250. The #71st best movie of all time? Are you kidding me?Brad Pitt fails to register a single honest emotion. Pitt utters every single line in exactly the same manner. I don't think his facial expression changed once throughout the entire 2 and half hour run time. Benjamin Button himself is not even remotely close to a fully developed character. He plays piano and likes Daisy. That's all we know about him. Oh, but he ages backwards. Yet that fact lends absolutely no circumstance to the entire picture until the very end of the movie when the writers needed a cheap copout in order to get out of the complete mess that they had put themselves in, it's like "Wait a minute, we can't possibly earn an Oscar if this thing actually ends happily, let's make our main character do something only a complete S.O.B. would do to create some tension and then completely excuse him for it." It's cheap, easy-way-out writing.The special effects are superb, do not let this review diminish the efforts of the technical team. The characters change drastically physically, yet they do not go through a single change mentally. They are all static. It's almost as if the performers put too much faith in the make up and effects teams and didn't even bother to put a different edge on their characters. In my opinion, Benjamin and Daisy were utterly boring, the Clockmaker who is given two minutes of runtime was a far more interesting character than those two. Every scene in the hospital halted any momentum that the film was gaining, they simply brought everything to a dead stop. There was absolutely no point to the scenes at all, the moments of revelation were completely predictable, and how many times do we need a film that is set up by somebody reading a diary? And holy crap, Daisy's southern accent miraculousy became about ten times as thick as she lay dying in the hospital than it did in the early years of her life. Weird....All told, the film seemed like it was brewed in a lab to win awards. However, the filmmakers forgot a couple of important things: developed characters, meaningful scenes, conflict, and a believable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a over-hyped, boring , dull lousy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I resented the fact that I wasted almost 3 hours of my life watching this. The screen writing was a disaster. The premise wasn't tight. There was so much bad about this flick. The only redeeming feature was some of the acting and the scenery. The way the story was told screamed similarity to Titanic - an old women telling the story. And in some ways it was like a bad - I mean really - bad take on Forrest Gump. Which is fitting since it made me want to "run, Forrest, run" out of the theater. So there's a diary being read to an old lady on her deathbed. A diary that began being penned around the time Benjamin was 6 years old. At no point do we ever see him write a word. And penning a diary simply wasn't believable. So there is this apparently magical clock and we are supposed to believe that Benjamin's unique birth is somehow tied into the clock simply because he is born on the same day it is unveiled. I would imagine then that all babies born in New Orleans that day were born old. Where was the tie-in? It took seemingly forever for the story to even beginning to gel. There was no early "hook". I was almost sleeping by the time the old kids is revealed. Frankly, after 2 hours I was wishing Hurricane Katrina would kill the old lady or her daughter would put her out of her misery.This was so miserable I would have rather endured the nauseating banter over the stimulus bill. At least it had "stimulus". Academy awards material? Not on your life. This is right up there with Pennsylvania 6500.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tired and trite clichés propped up by digital wizardry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had such high hopes for this film. The previews for it were visually stunning and it looked like David Fincher had crafted a modern masterpiece. Fincher was coming off the artistic triumph of Zodiac and I assumed this film would follow suit. As a director, Fincher seemed to have shaken off his obsessions with fashionable nihilism. In this light The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fascinating yet ultimately very hollow film. Fincher is obviously a gifted filmmaker, so it is all the more disappointing that he has tethered his story to banal sentiments that would be better suited to a greeting card.The first hour of the film holds up quite well to the high standards set by Zodiac. The digital cinematography of the piece is murky, but appropriate in that I believe Fincher wanted it to look like an old photograph. The central conceit of the main character aging backwards is clearly and cleanly established and we are in immediate sympathy with Benjamin Button. Anyone who is related to or knows someone who struggled with a horrible illness at a young age will respond to the early scenes of this film very strongly. Benjamin's wide-eyed naiveté as he tries to grasp the complexities of his special existence is very touching and delicately dramatized. These early scenes have real unforced charm. We get to know not only Benjamin, but the kind African-American woman who shelters him. We are also given a small window into the lives of the other residents of the rest home where Benjamin resides. There are very few movies that have even dared to explore the hardships and also the small compensations of advanced age. These things are not usually discussed in popular entertainments. David Fincher and screen writer Eric Roth should be commended for even broaching some of these issues. Unfortunately, time and again a challenging idea or issue is raised and is then immediately dropped in favor of forced uplift or is simply glossed over completely. Every time things get interesting, the plot kicks into gear and the film falls back on movie logic. The premise of the film is so provocative, that I had real hope after the first hour that we were going into uncharted narrative waters. Sadly, we are then given the usual pseudo-revelations involving doomed romance and familial ties.Benjamin Button is the window through which we view the other characters. His condition sets the stage for the more colorful characters to behave in eccentric and idiosyncratic ways. The film is essentially a reverse coming of age story. As the film progresses narrative problems start to crop up with alarming frequency. The central issue is that Benjamin never really drives the story. He is a reactive character and because of this you lose interest in his goals. Pitt tries to invest a sense of humanity. However, the blank cipher that is Benjamin Button remains stubbornly vague. We know that Benjamin loves Cate Blanchett's Daisy, but are not given anything further to define his character. Benjamin appears to be a pleasant companion and not much else. As Pitt gradually morphs into the Greek God matinée idol that we all know him to be, the movie deflates like a balloon. Benjamin's relationship with Daisy is endless and largely drama free. There is a sense of going through the motions with everything that happens in the second part of the narrative. The lovers experience a short idyll, a child is born, and then the narrative demands that Benjamin leave Daisy and go on a vision quest or something. The film does Cate Blanchett few favors as her character changes from scene to scene depending on what the needs of the narrative are. Like Pitt, she is playing an idea rather than a real flesh and blood character. The two of them are so attractive and movie-star like that it actually detracts from what the tragedy of the film is supposed to be. You can't help but wonder why these two are not more thankful for the obvious gifts they have been given? The rote, glamorous Hollywood fantasy is like a tow line holding this film back from the darker waters that it obviously needs to plumb.The film employs a ridiculous connecting device of having the elderly Daisy dying in a hospital bed in New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She requests her daughter, a haunted looking Julia Ormond, read to her from Benjamin's diary. A diary that neither she nor her daughter have apparently ever looked at before. This subplot is squirm-inducingly awful. We can see every supposed secret the diary holds coming a mile away. When these plot points are revealed Fincher skips past them, denying them emotional weight and trying to camouflage their utter banality. One would expect that the rapidly approaching Hurricane Katrina would figure into the plot somehow and one would be wrong. Like every other provocation in the film, the enormous human rights disaster that was Katrina is introduced and then shied away from. This bungling of a potentially provocative theme is unforgivable. Fincher and Roth should be ashamed for the short dramatic shrift they give Katrina.The more I thought about this film, the more I disliked it. Fincher is too intelligent a filmmaker to embrace this sort of dishonest, Hollywood, twaddle. On a technical level the film is second to none, which makes it all the more of a let down that it contains no real ideas about anything. Why is it that entertainment must be so bereft of commentary relating to the real world? Is escape all that filmmakers and audiences aspire to anymore? We live in an era of unprecedented global tumult. I am sorry, but escape is just not good enough for these times. One need only look at the politically and culturally engaged films of the seventies to see what we are missing now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From a visual point of view, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is superb. Through the use of digital effects, the past (beginning with Armistice Day, 1918) is brought to life in an extremely realistic way. But unfortunately 'Button' is nothing more than a series of beautiful images. Its story is truly an empty vessel, shallow and ultimately lacking in drama.'Button' is the story of an infant who is born as an old man and ages backward. It's really a fable of sorts and it's not intended to be based completely on real history. Hence, from the very beginning, the viewer is forced to accept its absurd premise.The screenplay was written by the same writer responsible for "Forrest Gump" and the stories are strikingly similar. They both focus on an odd protagonist who doesn't fit into mainstream society. They both go through a series of adventures that shape the protagonist's character. Benjamin Button is even more passive than Gump. Everything happens to him and he initiates very little.While 'Button' is a fable, history is still given short shrift. It's a film that pretends to encompass the entire sweeping arc of American history from World War I to Hurricane Katrina. History however is only alluded to through brief asides (like FDR's Pearl Harbor speech on the radio or the Beatles popping up on TV). Although Button is reared in New Orleans during the Jim Crow days, the issue of racial prejudice is never dealt with.If you were to take away the entire 'gimmick' of this film, the novel idea of a man aging backward, you're left with a story that isn't even half as good as some of those Douglas Silk melodramas of the 40s and 50s. All the characters in Benjamin Button are weak and completely underdeveloped as people. What do we find out about the British woman Benjamin Button is having an affair with while he's staying in Russia? Nothing except that her husband is a spy. Button has an affair with her. So what! And what of Kate Blanchett's Daisy? She's another bore who's a ballet dancer, is hit by a car ruining her career and eventually getting married to another man. Why should we care about any of these characters? I ended up spending much more time paying attention to how the filmmakers applied their special effects to Brad Pitt's face than concentrating on the story. If one ends up concentrating mainly on the special effects to the detriment of the story, I think it's safe to say that 'Benjamin Button' is a failure.I'm willing to give this film four stars due to its magnificent art design, music and overall look. Given its plodding plot and pessimistic view of life (Button ends up with Alzheimer's!), the Academy Award for Best Picture is not a lock. Let's hope it's soundly voted down!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Concept; Disappointing Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For special effects and make up, this movie is incredible. However, the length of the film causes one to believe that there is a lack of overall substance. Its message is cluttered by a series of life moments that are reminiscent of Forrest Gump without the humor.As advertised the plot of the picture is both simple yet intriguing. The movie traces the life of the main character Benjamin Button born as an 80 year old and growing younger every year and his life's intersection with Miss Daisy first seen as a young lass who recalls the story in flashback form as a dying elderly invalid. The intersection of their lives when both are substantially the same age forms the tension in the movie.The ending is the strongest part of the film. One should try to stay awake for the first hour. I was underwhelmed by Brad Pitt's performance. Given his incredible acting ability as shown in the earlier Burn After Reading movie, Pitt relies on the special effects and make up to carry his role.The elderly Daisy character recollecting her past is reminiscent of the elderly female character in Titanic. The story telling devices used in this flick have been used before in more memorable movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most dismal, pointless films of recent years. Had this been made by a lesser director or with a lesser cast, it would have been roasted. But instead it is hailed as a fantastic movie. God only knows why.The storyline is utterly pointless. It plods along at a pace that is so slow, its almost in reverse. At the point where it describes Cate Blanchet's character's accident, I found it hard not to shout at the screen. That section alone could have saved a good 15 minutes of movie time. Despite almost 3 hours long, I could not warm to any of the characters. I should point out I love movies, good and mediocre. But this movie tested me like no other.The only laugh I got from this movie was the speed in which the audience left their seats to leave the cinema.

		<shortDescription>Forrest Gump without a heart (or a brain)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie irked the he11 out of me. It annoys me further that this dirge of a movie is getting better ratings (and reviews) than Revolutionary Road.Let's start at the beginning. There's this bit of tedious exposition clumsily explaining *why* Benjamin Buttons might experience life backwards. Then the narration herkily-jerkily jumps to the daughter who while reading a diary, is supposedly articulating Benjamin's accounts. The choppiness of this narrative was unoriginal and poorly executed. Like the time-jump cuts to and from Forrest at the bus stop, this movie time-jump cuts to and from a supposedly dying woman. Except that she only narrates the beginning. For the rest of the movie, she makes guttural noises to let us know she's holding out until the end of the movie to die.Next, there's the problem with the movie's magic itself. I have no problem suspending my disbelief, but the rules of a magical world have to be honored--or at least make sense within that world. Benjamin is born a very old, gnarled, and ugly baby. Fair enough. But according to that logic, he should have ended his life as a very smooth, chubby, cooing and drooling adult--NOT as a baby again. If he was going to end up a baby, he should have been borne into the world as a full grown (albeit hunched-with-age) adult.Next, there's the lack of believability in the connection between Benjamin and Daisy. No way for a second did I buy that those two should have or would have had a connection to each other when he was an old youngster and she was a young youngster. Mostly, this is because Brad Pitt's characterization of Buttons wasn't youthful enough mentally or emotionally. Did he need to go as full-blown regressive as Tom Hanks in Big? No. But he didn't go far enough to sell me on the idea that those two would have had any connection. And anyway, it smacked of the whole Forrest and Jenny relationship--but with none of the backbone.After that, there's the repetitious use of the hummingbird as a symbol. Okay, it makes sense for us to see a hummingbird far, far out to sea, because it symbolized the spirit of the tugboat captain. It was the tugboat captain's avatar--not Benjamin's. Why then would we see a hummingbird at Benjamin's passing? Only because it wanted to employ the same tonal continuity thread as did the feather in Forrest Gump. Trite at best.I was also left dissatisfied by the premature Benjamin's abandonment of his true love and their child. If he wanted to leave, fine--though wouldn't a person who'd experienced so much personal rejection and abandonment issues as a "child" not be more sensitive to this issue? Why tug cloyingly at our heartstrings one more time by bringing Benjamin back one more time when he's like 17 and his daughter's in her early teens? Surely he had six more sane years left in him to see his daughter through to adulthood. But no. It's more dramatic to have him leave and go on his Gumpian romp through foreign countries than to actually have his character make sensible choices.Also, it was disappointing to see the National Guard's "Citizen/Soldier" ad campaign so brazenly product-placed in the movie. Not only was this ad campaign the sponsor of the pre-movie's trivia reels, but it also had a full-size placard out in the lobby. This kind of commercialism zaps every ounce of artistic integrity I *may* have been willing to believe the film makers possessed. Yes, Gump had lots of product placement--Nike, Apple, Dr. Pepper, etc--but at least it made sense in the context of the story. The National Guard piece was just synergistic window dressing.The movie had a few genuine and genuinely heartfelt moments. But nowhere near as many required to sustain a ~3 hour movie. If you have to, wait for a time-compressed, edited-for-TV version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bad and long for no reason - amazingly long. Even if this movie were likable (which it may be to some, but I really don't see how), it's undeniable TOO LONG. It just keeps going and going, with nothing to justify the length. Several of the scenes not only could have been cut out - they SHOULD have been cut out (the whole affair with the swimmer lady? i get the whole coming of age thing, but that scene seemed like 30 minutes?). The length is not my only complaint, actually my biggest complaint is the story itself -- I didn't find it interesting at all. The storyline is weird, but not weird in an interesting way, weird in a kind of creepy. Honestly, this ranks among the most disappointing (and worst) movies I've seen in a long time.Cut the movie down to 90 minutes, maybe even an hour, and it might be an interesting made-for-TV movie with the reverse-aging thing, but at just short of 3 hrs - ridiculous.</fullReview>

I failed to see the "magic" as one user put it and couldn't wait for it to end.The acting was decent but the story was a repetition of Brad Pitt falling in love, leaving, coming back, leaving, coming back, falling in love again, leaving, coming back, having a kid then leaving again and ultimately coming back.Ultimately I believe this movie was horribly over-rated.

		<shortDescription>Spectacular makeup effects do not make up for a densely boring narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher, as brilliant and astonishing a filmmaker as he is, is a meticulous perfectionist. Some films show this off for the better (Fight Club, Se7en and The Game), while others falter and are weakened by it (Zodiac and Panic Room). So it should have surprised no one when the buzz came in over all the problems associated with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. And unsurprisingly, this film also suffers from that perfectionist stroke.Benjamin (played prominently by Brad Pitt) is born just after World War I with a rare disease that makes him age backwards; appearing older when he is young, and younger when he gets older. He is left on the porch of an elderly home as a baby, and is almost carelessly discarded for how hideous he looks. But one of the staff members, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) takes him in and raises him as her own. Gradually as Benjamin ages, he grows younger and can begin to do more. But he is seen differently by everyone who meets him, leading him down various journeys and paths.Fincher has crafted his second epic (the first being the slow-burn crime drama Zodiac), and has stumbled on the same mistakes he did the first time. He starts off with a great opening and first act, packed with the minutest of details that I doubt anyone could spot everything he is conveying in one sitting. But as the film takes off into its second and third acts, it becomes inundated with too many details and too few interesting moments. The film is a mere fourteen minutes longer than The Dark Knight, but it feels like an eternity longer. As it trucks along, Benjamin Button just slowly becomes more boring when it should become more interesting. What should be focused more heavily on is not, and what is, should not be. It feels like Fincher is trying to up himself over and over again, while still pleasing everyone else. He used to know when to say cut, but here, he seems to have totally lost himself in trying to build an epic that did not need to be as lengthy as it is.A key reason for this is because of a love story between Benjamin and Daisy (played prominently by Cate Blanchett). He meets her as a young boy (although he looks like a senior nearing death), and falls in love. The love story between the two seems cute and sweet at first (despite being a touch creepy because of Benjamin's initial appearance versus Daisy's), but slowly becomes melodramatic and overbearing. Yes, the character of Daisy is integral to the story, but by the end, she seems to be a nuisance. An epic is not an epic because of an eternity spanning love story. It is the storytelling method that makes an epic, and unfortunately, hinging it on something like this is a bit amateur. Surely Fincher could have helped fixed up Eric Roth's screenplay to be a lot stronger?What also does not help is the chemistry between Pitt and Blanchett is not all there. Yes, they work off each other well, but for long lost lovers to become connected after so many years, they do not do a convincing enough job. The chemistry practically emanates between Pitt and relative newcomer Madisen Beaty, who plays a teenaged version of Daisy. How can Pitt make a relationship more convincing with someone who is so much younger, than someone he has actually worked with in the past? Sure, we can chalk it up to the CGI wizardry being used at that point in the film, versus later on, but surely Pitt can act better as himself than as a special effect?Pitt carries the film fairly well, but is not particularly well suited for the role. He does well as the younger Benjamin, exploring and learning about life, but as the wiser and older Benjamin, he seems to waver. Like the film, he is great in the first half, and slowly falls apart as the film goes on. Blanchett has done much stronger work than this, and is surprisingly tame in her performance. It is actually the supporting cast that does a great job. Henson is astonishing in her nurturing mother role, bringing just the right amount of humanity and zest to a character that could have easily been phoned in as a stereotype. Jared Harris does excellent work as Captain Mike, and Jason Flemyng is great as Benjamin's dad Thomas. But the real reason anyone should even attempt to sit through this mess of an ambitious film are the spectacular special effects. Making Brad Pitt look like a feeble old man who looks nothing like the actor is clearly not an easy thing to do. But every scene, whether it is actually the man himself caked behind enormous amounts of makeup (whether to make him look ancient or to look like the golden boy we first remember him as back in the early 1990s), or he is digitally placed in there, looks just as realistic as the next. You will believe that Pitt is really that age. The effects are just that believable. I was simply stunned watching him on-screen, interacting with other people. It is almost terrifying to think how far we have come that something like this could look as realistic as it does (likewise to Blanchett, who spends a good portion of the film behind an endless amount of makeup as well).The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is not a bad film, but it is not the great film it could have been either. It could have been so much stronger if Fincher was a little less of a perfectionist. Cutting a good forty minutes out would have done this movie an immense amount of good. For such an ambitious effort, it makes a lot of silly mistakes.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great movie about the not-so-curious Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I don't think the realist elements have done good to this movie. I mean, if the protagonist is meant to be fantastic why is it necessary for us to know when he was born, where is he going, what (real) wars he fought? Superman is like this movie's protagonist, he defies natural laws, like gravity for example. Benjamin Button is doing the same thing with biological laws when he rejuvenates, but despite the realistic context where he is placed, no-one seems to be so affected by his unusual nature (and that makes realistic characters behave artificially). Just pay some attention to the title: The curious case..., why case? "Cases" exist only in reality. If the movie would have dwelled in the fantastic, fictional, or whatever you call it domain of the narrative it certainly had been better. Secondly, and more important, my opinion is that this movie doesn't eventually say much. During the almost three hours length I questioned myself about Benjamin's nature and what philosophical facts should it reveal. But as I tried and tried to build-up my logic I couldn't reach any destination. In fact, Benjamin looked like a simple, ordinary men that lives his life from start to end. He's different from us only because his appearance evolves from old men to infant child. But he is born a child and mentally he's just like us (as he admits). All my respect to everyone in the production crew because they made a very well-done job, from special effects to acting performances. The story is the major problem here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of an Oddly Unappealing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has made some of the most interesting films of the last two decades, including SE7EN and FIGHT CLUB, both favourites of mine. The last film of his I saw was the overlong but engaging ZODIAC, so I sat down for another epic-length feature film and hoped for genuine quality. Like so many Hollywood films, BENJAMIN BUTTON looks amazing. The technical aspects are top dollar and Fincher's direction is difficult to criticise on a superficial level. Why is watching it, then, such a hollow experience? The reason is down to the story, which starts off with an interesting premise and does nothing with it. Button is a guy who ages in reverse, but nothing is made of his condition. He doesn't live his life any differently, he doesn't become a medical anomaly, barely anyone passes comment on it at all. Why is it even part of the film? I almost feel like a screenplay was written around a totally uninteresting character, then, realising the lack of depth, the writer decided 'oh, I'll have him age in reverse' in an attempt to make things more interesting.Button turns out to be a singularly unappealing guy, one to whom adultery is a way of life, a guy who refuses to engage with the world he lives in and who shirks responsibility at every stage. Pitt plays him the best he can, but even he can't make the guy likable. You end up watching just to find out the next stage of the admittedly impressive SFX work used to both age him and make him younger.Elsewhere, Fincher casts two of the coldest female actresses I can think of: Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton. I can't think of a single film in which either displays any kind of warmth, and there's none on offer here. Don't go looking for chemistry, either, as you won't find it. Combined with Fincher's clinical and detached approach, this is a yawn-inducing, uneventful, non-dramatic exercise in tedium and a massive missed opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that I choose was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The film first takes place in a hospital where character Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is on her death bed. Alongside Daisy is her daughter Caroline (Joeanna Sayler). Daisy ask her daughter Caroline to read her the diary of an friend Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). The diary is filled with Benjamin's extra-ordinary life as he was born an old man and becomes young as time progresses. Benjamin's mother dies as she is giving birth to him, and his father who is ashamed of the way his new born son looks abandons him on the front step of a senior citizen home. Benjamin is then found by the women who raises him Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). At the senior citizen home where Benjamin is living he meets and falls in love with Daisy (Cate Blanchett). As the two grow up, Daisy grows up to become a older woman while Benjamin is growing younger with time. There different paths and walks of life separate them but later on in the film they are reunited and struggle with the age differences.The theme of this film is wisdom comes with age, and age dictates who we are. Throughout the film as Button (Brad Pitt) grows younger and experiences many adventures he learns and gains more knowledge even though he is getting younger. Button is not only born with the face and body of an old man, but the emotions and feelings of an old man as well. Button is also born with the knowledge of an old man. When Button is a newborn he enjoys the company of older men, but when he ages physically but gets younger mentally he is more social and outgoing and enjoys the company of people his age.The lighting in this film has some relevance to the theme. When Daisy is laying in the hospital bed the lighting seems to be more deem for this is a sad time for Daisy. However when the story is been told and in Daisy's younger days the lighting on her face was much brighter. When Button is first born as an old man the lighting in these scenes are more dim but as Button become younger in time the lighting was brighter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a film directed by David Fincher and starting Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett is a story about a man who ages backwards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Benjamin Button is told through his diary as a woman, reads it to her mother, Daisy Williams, played by Cate Blanchett, on her death bed per her request. I have heard others say that the story line for this movie has no purpose. I believe that it show that going backwards in time doesn't necessarily change the results nor make things better. One of the major themes in the story is to appreciate what you have. A lesson everyone should learn.The story starts with the birth of Benjamin button on the night that World War One ends. His mother dies after a hard birth and his father is further heartbroken when he discovers his son is not the image of a bouncing baby boy that he expected. Benjamin is the size of any newborn but is the disturbing vision of an elderly man. Grieving and distraught Thomas Button abandons his newborn son. Benjamin, played by Brad Pitt, while being cared for at the retirement home by Queenie, played by Taraji P. Henson, begins to grow younger as he grows older. While everyone is aging he is going backwards like the unusual clock daisy tells her daughter about before she asked her to read the diary.The story consists of the adventures and misadventures of Benjamin as he continues to grow younger year by year. He has the experiences we all do, losing someone he cares about, his first drink, his first job, his first encounter with a woman and many other firsts that make a life worth living no matter which direction you are going.The Story is told mainly through flashbacks as the woman reads to her mother who happens to be the first love of Benjamin. The flashbacks from time to time are replaced with present day where Hurricane Katrina is just hitting New Orleans. The transition between present day and flashbacks of past events make this film an excellent watch. Not to mention the undeniably wonderful acting done by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in such a heartwarming tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>very beautiful, great actors, but nothing to say. in the "The Tin Drum" the boy who doesn't want to grow makes sens and expectation. here you will not get much more that the trailer says. I've wait and wait and wait for an event in this film, like 40 years... and now i'm telling me: wow, Avatar is such a great movie, and even independence day rocks actually. if you suffer from insomnia this film is the perfect DVD. nevertheless like everybody i love Fincher, Blanchett and Pitt work, but, I mean, OK not much action OK, but where is the romance? and what suspense? I think that you can only enjoy the movie if you had read the story by F. Scott Fitzgeral. not bad but overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tale is spun of a blind clock maker who makes a large public clock which runs backwards. A symbol of forlorn hope that his son can return home from a war in which he died. Later a baby is born, but with the features of an old man. For Benjamin Button - played by Brad Pitt - time will really run backwards.I haven't read the F Scott Fitzgerald short story, but I might. Could well be better than this film and secondly it might fill me in on the clues, meaning and motivations that passed me by (or the makers could not convey clearly).First a word on the acting: Pitt received an Oscar nod (not win) for this, but does he deserve it when most of the acting is imposed by CGI or make-up? Indeed the central problem in casting is that Pitt (today) is not really all that young. So a lot the supposed "young man" scenes had to be filmed in medium shot.(If you think he is not a gym-toned forty something - at his youngest point - you shouldn't be giving descriptions to the police!) While there is plenty going on there is also a lot of meaningless padding. He meets a former long distance swimmer at a hotel in Russia, but I have no idea why this means anything. And given the screen time it must - at least to the various authors.The "old" BB acts young (because he is in his own mind!) and confuses himself and others, but there is no answer and no solution. His life is bizarre and he has no role model or no way of making sense of it. So - in time - he quietly accepts.Naturally long-term sexual happiness cannot be achieved as you get younger to a partner who is getting older. Indeed at some point you might risk being arrested and put in jail!Yes, there are loads of unique dilemmas and crossroads, but Button just runs out of the kitchen every time it gets hot. There is no dealing with it. Equally meeting people that he left when he appeared older (now as a younger appearing self) is dealt with in a matter-of-fact way. Why would they believe it was the same person? Anyone sane would be totally disbelieving!The movie having one big central novelty seems to be a license to follow the road of cliché in most other areas. The romance here ticks every box which was laughed at in the Naked Gun series. The romance montage where they laugh and clown, practical joke and roll like thunder (in the hay) is so old hat that you think they are taking the Mick!Thankfully the act direction is simply first class. Yes lots of stuff made on a computer - including a ballet rehearsal where Tilda Swinton's face has been morphed on to another dancer! Every shot is well framed and thought out. Creates a true sense of being in the past.(And while I am on the subject, Tilden is shown dancing vigorously and later seen stretching. You stretch before you dance - not after!) There is solid acting from the full cast - with special mention to the classy Tilden as the love interest - but I don't understand her particularly well either. While Pitt has a pretty face and six-pack you need more than that to entertain an intelligent career woman for long. BB is weak and totally empty. A drift through life chancer who, as I said before, always runs when things get tough.Three hours is too long to spend with him. He is not worth this extended length of celluloid. Glad I saw it though. If only for the art direction and cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not have much to say except that this movie was impeccable, but who could expect any less from David Fincher? The main reason I am writing this review is to point out that whoever wrote the Storyline on here is obviously a complete moron. It begins with "on the day that Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans". Now either the person who wrote it has never seen the movie or they are just that ignorant. It is obviously set in the early 1900's. Hurricane Katrina was in 2005 and when the movie begins everyone is on the streets raving about the end of the war. Now, what war ended in 1918? hmmm...WORLD WAR 1. Definitely not Hurricane Katrina. I'm sure this assumption was made due to that fact that the setting is in New Orleans but it's none the less completely idiotic. Someone should fix the story line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons" is not so curious after all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons" is not so curious after all. Based on an F. Scot Fitzgerald short story bearing the same name and set in New Orleans, cutting edge computer character generation is the vehicle used to tell a story that is all too human. This fantasy endeavor stars Brad Pitt as Benjamin Buttons, whose lot in life is to age backwards from a newborn with all the infirmities that are attendant to old age, to terminal infancy. Cate Blanchett is Daisy, Benjamin's lifelong love interest and Taraji P. Henson is Queenie, Benjamin's surrogate mother who finds him on the stairs of her boarding house, takes him in and loves him unconditionally. Contrary to what may be popular belief, the film's best acting is found in the performances of Taraji P. Henson and Cate Blanchett, although director David Fincher makes masterful use of digitized character creation and manipulation. The computer generated Benjamin in the earlier scenes does show some lack of fluidity of motion and is reminiscent of Yoda from the Star Wars Series. However, the movie is edited well enough such that this is not an insurmountable issue.One of the major themes of the film is the unpredictability of life Queenie told Benjamin as a child, "You never know what's coming for you." This is played out over and over as Benjamin takes a job, fights in World War II and enjoys an active sex life all the while growing younger. Benjamin does show some understanding to the extent possible when after Daisy is hit by a car, (crushing her dancer's legs) he makes a statement about life being a series of occurrences that are related and result in us being where we are supposed to be. Another strong element is that of water which possibly reinforces Queenie's philosophy. Water is ever changing and has the ability to change what it comes into contact with. Lastly, the film addresses the concept of time, how we live our lives (spend our time), and what it means to live a meaningful life. In a letter to his daughter Caroline, Benjamin says "Be who you want to be, there are no rules." Most importantly, "It's never too late to start, if you're not living a life you are proud of?start over." Words of wisdom spoken by a very wise "young" man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a coming of age story about a boy who is born with a rare disease that causes him to age in reverse. The story takes place in Louisiana during hurricane Katrina, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is on her deathbed and asks her daughter Caroline to read a Benjamin's diary (Brad Pitt). The diary tells the story of Benjamin's life, how he was born and left at a nursing home by his father and a woman named Queenie, played by Taraji P. Henson finds him and raises him as her own. As a child Benjamin looks like he is one of the residents at the nursing hone, even though in reality he has only been alive a short time. While at growing up at the nursing home Benjamin meets Daisy and he instantly falls in love with her. Due to his much older appearance, nothing can be done but he keeps in touch with Daisy for years after he leaves home. They do finally come together again when Benjamin looks much younger in appearance and when Daisy. They have a daughter named Caroline, but due to complications with Benjamin's condition he decides to leave Daisy to raise their daughter alone. In the end Daisy takes care of Benjamin until the end of his life. The theme of this movie is that true love will withstand anything including time. Benjamin loved Daisy from the moment he saw her. While reading his diary, Caroline says to her mother "Do you realize that this man Benjamin loved you from the moment he saw you?" The story is told with many montages showing the different phases of Daisy's and Benjamin's lives, they both took very different paths and I believe it was Benjamin's love for Daisy that allowed him to let her live her life until the timing was right. In addition to the montages the director made sure that we saw all the characters as equal and in an indirect-subjective cinematic viewpoint. You feel close to the action but not as though why is happening in the film is happening you. This film reminded me of another movie I love, The Time Travelers Wife, in it lovers share the same obstacle as Benjamin and Daisy; time. The main character in The Time Traveler's Wife has a disorder that forces him to travel through time without notice, which makes maintaining a relationship with the love of his life difficult to say the least. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, is a great movie the actors were great, and even though there is a lot of make up used due to the wide span of time captured in the film all of the actors and actresses showed through in there performances, I would imagine that it would be difficult to convincingly act with so much costume make up on. In the beginning I had a hard time believing that Brad Pitt player the "young" Benjamin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is directed by David Fincher and screenplay by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord. This movie is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This film stars Brad Pitt as Benjamin, Cate Blanchett as Daisy, and supporting actress Taraji P. Henson as Queenie. The main theme of the movie is to appreciate what you are given because each day is a gift.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button begins as an elderly Daisy is on her death bed in a hospital in New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina is about ready to hit. Daisy asks her daughter, Caroline, to read a journal from a man named Benjamin. Caroline begins to read the journal and it tells of the life of Benjamin Button. Benjamin was born an old man and aged backwards. Benjamin's mother died during childbirth and his father, very angry, placed Benjamin on the steps of a nursing home. The caretakers of the nursing home, Queenie and Mr. Tizzy, took Benjamin in and raised him as their own. The story follows Benjamin and the people he meets throughout his life to include Daisy, the first girl he ever loved. The story follows Benjamin on his unique journey of life. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is like the movie The Time Traveler's Wife because the main character suffers from a rare genetic disorder that makes him travel through time while he attempts to develop a relationship with the love of his life. This is similar to the theme of The Curious Case of Benjamin button which is to appreciate what you are given because each day is a gift. The movie uses camera angles and lighting to highlight the memory of Daisy when Benjamin first met her. Benjamin recalls remembering how beautiful Daisy's blue eyes were. The camera angle and lighting highlighted the blue eyes giving less color to everything around Daisy making her blue eyes seem to pop off of the screen. These angles and lighting tricks make young Daisy's image stick in your mind just as Benjamin remembered her. This relates to the theme because Daisy does not visit her Grandmother very often and Benjamin would appreciate every opportunity he had to spend with Daisy.The characters were easy to relate to in the movie and the theme, to appreciate each day you have, is apparent throughout the movie and is a great message for anyone regardless of where they are in their life cycle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>aims for greatness, but ultimately this is a slight tale blown up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benjamin Button is a moderately interesting idea for a movie with a few very good scenes and a lot of forgettable ones. The central idea of a man whose body becomes younger as he ages is presented pretty well, and Pitt is quite good in the title role. The movie is occasionally effecting.But there's really not much to this. Take away the central gimmick, and this is just a story about a guy living a fairly ordinary life, growing up, falling in love, getting old, losing his mind. The central gimmick is often irrelevant to the story.Clearly the filmmakers think they have something truly profound; why else would they make it so damn long? But while the odd aging of Button offers a slightly different way to think about growing old, it's not *that* different.This movie reminded me of Forest Gump (which turned out to share the same screenwriter), in that it was just sort of a guy living his life, and in that I found it dull. I liked Benjamin Button better than Gump (in spite of all its admirers I found it quite dull) but I still just never felt there was much to it. While it's perfectly watchable, I wish I'd spent that 2 hours and 45 minutes on a better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good 'little' movie but just never fell in love with it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually I'm quite fond of the type of movies that follow the entire life span off a person over the decades. It shows how he matures, finds love, his place in life and eventually dies. This movie also does that but instead all backward. The main character in the movie is born old and instead of growing older, he's only getting younger and younger over the years. But as this movie shows; it doesn't matter how you start life, you'll end up making the same wrong and right choices and it doesn't matter if you do it when you're young or old.Sounds all good so far and by all rights it should had been a type of movie that I would love, especially since it also had director David Fincher at the helm, who is among the best directors working at the moment and is also one of my favorite ones. But no, this movie to me was just lacking a certain spark that would evoke a sort of magical or adventures sense to it.Thing with the movie is that it doesn't pick a very entertaining approach to things and instead plays things out way more straight-forward and serious. I'm sure I would had liked this movie way better if it had some more light and relieving comedy in it, like for instance a movie like "Forrest Gump" had. Now there is a movie that works out as both dramatic and entertaining at the same time and sort of uses a similar concept as this movie.But yet I really wouldn't want to compare this movie to "Forrest Gump", unlike everyone else seems to do. If I have to compare it to anything else it would be "The Notebook" really. Both of these movies are love stories that use a gimmick to become an original one in its genre. In this case the gimmick is that the main character instead of growing older is only becoming younger, while everyone around him is aging and dying.But perhaps because I was able to see through its gimmick, I didn't end up loving this movie as much as most others seem to. In essence- and its core this movie remains the same as most other genre movies and its gimmick just wasn't adding as much to the story as you perhaps would expect.It doesn't take away that this movie remains a real accomplishment and perfectly watchable one. Even though it really is a big budget movie, it feels like a small, warm and humble one. It doesn't try to brag or impress with anything and also the acting performances within this movie are exactly that way as well and I say that as a compliment.What this movie of course foremost impresses with are its visuals. Not only does this movie has some great cinematography and art and costume design in it, it also features great looking make-up effects, that mostly came out of the computer. This is one of those movies that has more special effects in it than you at first sight will ever notice. But like I said before, this movie doesn't show off with it and only features it to help to tell the story with. It uses most of its effects to make Brad Pitt look either younger or older than he truly was at the time but I think all of those effects look even better and more convincing on Cate Blanchett her character.If I still have to say something negative about this movie it is that it's way too long. I mean, the movie is nearly 3 hours, which is way too long and besides provides the movie with too many slow moments in it, which just doesn't make this movie always a good or interesting on to watch. This is perhaps also part of the reason why I just never felt emotionally connected to any of the characters and events and just was never able to fall in love with this movie, as much as I wanted- and expected to.Definitely a perfectly watchable movie but however not a must-see in my book. It remains too flawed for that, I'm sad to say.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' on UK TV last night (29th May) and, like many before me, found it compelling viewing. Some have compared the film to 'Forest Gump'; however, I was reminded, cinematically at any rate, of two much earlier films: 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', and 'The Picture of Dorian Gray', both of which, like CCBB, have sci-fi overtones, and therefore rely substantially on meticulous application of special effects. All three films are also powerful allegories of their times.If I was so impressed by CCBB, why have I awarded the film only 8 /10? Apart from the narration, I strained to hear what the actors were actually saying. Likewise, the lighting was so poor that one could barely discern the action. For reasons of inaccessibility I cannot see films where they are intended to be viewed, i.e. at a cinema, where, presumably, you can hear and see everything that appears on screen? Perhaps an expert in the field of the transfer of films to TV (and, indeed, DVD) could explain to me why so many recent films are often so lacking in clarity when transmitted via those media.</fullReview>

Everything is here in the film: drama, comedy, romance and tragedy. Off course when a movie contains all those elements it is bound to fail or end up as a cliché but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button blends all those very slim and well and organized it perfectly to give this 3 Oscar win movie it's recognition. This is also most certainly Brad Pitt's best movie yet, Fight Club standing 2nd while Se7en being the 3rd. A highly recommended movie, a movie to watch with a close friend, group of friends, love one or families, any audience is welcomed here for their hearts to be touched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love story and a reflection on the pass of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful movie that tells the story of Benjamin Button -a child born old and ailing who grows backwards into a child- who is abandoned at the door of a New Orleans Afro-American family, and his love story with a childhood friend.The movie is both a love story and a reflection on the pass of time in life, what is important in becoming old and in getting old,. However, the two main elements of the story get lost in the middle of superfluous sub-stories and scenes that don't add anything to the core of what the movie intends to be.The prologue of the movie, a short story tale actually, is brilliant as there is depth, abstraction and magic in it, and is the perfect and necessary setting to comprehend the oddness of the story that follows. The last minutes of the film are also fantastic, poetic and very moving, and the perfect closure to such a creative an original story.Despite being a wonderful love story, we have to wait about one hour for the proper love story to commence, and once it starts all happens in a hurry. The script is based on a short story, so there is not excuse for such a long footage, to wait one hour for the core of the movie to be displayed to the viewer. I think that many of the elements and sub-stories could have been chopped easily without the film suffering much. To put just one example, all the part of old Daisy agonizing in the hospital during the Hurricane Katrina, during more than 2 hours, is overly melodramatic and doesn't add anything of interest to the movie, as the only element that makes sense in that part could have been easily inserted in another way.Cate Blanchet is wonderful as always, very believable in his role as a dancer first, and ballet teacher then. Brad Pitt delights us with glimpses of his old self and acting brilliance in the first half of the film, when he's and old arthritic weird boy; it is not the make-up or the special effects, it is him, the actor, shining. However, once the character gets older and therefore young in the story, when we start to see Pitt in all his corporeal splendor, his acting suffers, Pitt's expression becomes forced and hieratic. It is as if Pitt felt overwhelmed each time his pretty face is the center of attention. That doesn't happen to Blanchet, who is magnificent all the way through.The supporting actors, mostly elderly, are also believable and delightful in their roles as residents in a nursing home. Also wonderful are all the actors who play the sailors. However, I did not like the actor who plays Button's biological father, Jason Flamyng, too stiff and average in his performance.I loved Tilda Swinton and Pitt in their short love sub-story, which is fantastic in mood, atmosphere and acting - 1950s Hollywood glamor recreated to perfection.The sepia-toned atmosphere and the cinematography are extremely beautiful. I found the special effects and 3D animation superbly blended into the actors' faces, especially the young Button and the young Daisy. Aging make-up is especially good on Pitt, not so much on Blanchet.A good enjoyable and original movie with great acting that suffers from the long footage and a script that doesn't know how to focus on the important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Benjamin Button rev</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as directors go, David Fincher ranks among thoses I idolise. His gentle interplay with dark and light, fun and sorrow and most importantly the real and the surreal. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't his greatest movie, his most lavish movie, but not his greatest. What's striking is the way Finchers worst still manages to be better than most director's best attempts. Despite some negative criticisms, Benjamin Button is a beautiful movie, both tender and tremendous. If not overly emotional. It manages to sustain both style and substance where something like "Australia" dropped the ball. Finchers movie is well worth the wait and a certainty at this year's Oscars.One thing that resonates wonderfully is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, reunited after starring together in the 2007 movie "Babel", there characters show development and while there not all going in the same direction you can feel them growing, learning with age, or youth in this case. It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy, old- school movie -- employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop -- did it for me.David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's story, re-teams the director with Brad Pitt, who takes on the title role. What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. Brad Pitt gives a bravura, Oscar-caliber turn in Fincher's modernist epic yet lyrical tale, which bears resemblance in structure and magical realism to Forrest Gump (both penned by Eric Roth), but without that film's simplistic morality and sentimentality This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness. Cate Blanchett co-stars along with Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond. If there's one thing this films is going to be remembered by its the beautifully subtle yet equally frightening make up effect sued on both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The creators blended both visual effect with make-up effect to create some of the most awe inspiring visual effect to dat. You believe in these characters because the actors playing them are shown at every stage of their life. Aptly for a film so concerned with time, Button is 13 minutes shy of three hours and just flies by. If this is Fincher selling out, can he sell out more often please? An epic, melancholic romance that employs a multi-generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects. It's a testament to Fincher's skill as a storyteller that the film actually works, albeit sporadically. There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses.Verdict: Touching yet never tedious, sensitive yet never overly sentimental. Button balances all of its elements perfectly and while the running time may scare some, the movie flew by in manner of seconds merely due to the charm and charisma of its leads. Tantalizing, touching and timeless - an epic fable revolving around mortality. For my overall rating I give The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really makes you think about how you live your life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins with Daisy, a close friend of Benjamin Button since her childhood. Daisy is elderly now and in a hospital bed in feeble condition. Her grown daughter Caroline is in her room with her and she asks her to read the diary of a dear friend to her. This begins the story of Benjamin Button's peculiar life. It is a circle of life very different from that of which we are accustomed to. This circle of life includes living, loving and dying and is the basis for the theme of this movie. In every life, regardless of how it begins or how it ends, a person is faced with living, loving and dying in one form or another.Benjamin's life begins with him being born with all the characteristics of a 70 year old man. There is little optimism that Benjamin will live long after his birth because of these characteristics that he already exhibits; which resembles a body slowly deteriorating. However; as we learn from the diary that is an account of his life, as others are aging and leaving this world, Benjamin is remarkably becoming younger.Upon Benjamin's birth his mother Caroline dies and his father Thomas Button is so overwhelmed with the circumstances that he abandons his son Benjamin. Benjamin is found on a step at a senior home by a black woman named Queenie. Queenie raises Benjamin and loves him as if he were her own; regardless of his unusual aging process. The senior home is where Benjamin meets Daisy and they begin the story of their life.Although this movie included a period of 2.5 hours there were many details untouched that would have made this plot stronger. This movie leaves to many questions unanswered. There was never a determination of Benjamin's disease or any attempt to cure it. It seemed strange that everyone was just willing to accept this disease and the progression of it without any effort to truly understand it. This was a very lengthy film; however this time was not adequately used and this contributed to a very weak plot that left the audience wondering why 2.5 hours was necessary to deliver this plot. The movie Forest Gump also has a theme based on a man's life but it had a stronger plot and did a better job of holding the audiences attention. The theme of living, loving and dying was one that everyone can relate to and was a strong point of this movie but it could have been done in less time with more detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've watched this year! Only the idea that someone grows younger everyday is compelling and although I was postponing every time watching the movie (due to its length and because the genre is not one of my favorites) I finally did... boy am I glad that I did. Brad Pitt's acting was terrific and the story is so seamlessly connected from year to year and decade to decade that you won't find yourself wondering what happened between those years. It is the story of a man's life, a real human being with feelings and desires, who is unique in the sense that he is born old and as he grows older his body gets younger and younger and younger. Sometimes you are happy for him, sometimes proud of him, but the most striking feeling that I had was sorrow! It really bent me at one point (I won't tell which since it would be a spoiler) and started crying...not just a couple of tears but really crying and I watched the same scene over and over until I could take it no more!(something tells me I acted masochistically), it was simply because even though I was expecting it to happen I could not believe my eyes! An unnatural movie but a great one nonetheless! Bravo to the writer the director and the actors for making a true gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher: The best of the ex-music video directors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is stunning. Everything falls neatly into place, sweeping the viewer up on a wave of pure movie magic. The special visual effects are amazing: Benjamin (Brad Pitt) is born old and shrunken, wrinkled and withered, and over the course of the lengthy narrative becomes young and chiseled. Director David Fincher proved that he could handle the epic with his serial killer thriller 'Zodiac', a film which, like 'Button', is close to three hours in length. Neither film seems to drag; the pacing in each case is measured and deliberate.It is great to see Julia Ormond again (in the role of Caroline), after an absence from our screens of several years. She is as beautiful and as talented as ever. Fincher's muse, Brad Pitt (this is their third film together) handles the material well and delivers a mature and well-rounded performance. His passage from old to young reminded me of the mini-series 'Stephen King's Golden Years', but 'Button' is far, far superior to that. If you would like to see what Fincher referred to as the 'Holy Grail of visual effects', here is your chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cinematography, bit length though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw the trailer for this I was reeled in. In fact this is so totally the kind of story I love I am surprised I waited until it came out on DVD.Starring Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt, the film starts with Daisy (Blanchett) on her death bed while her daughter (Julia Ormond) reads from Benjamin's diary. In this we learn of Benjamin's life, loves and travels while Daisy desperately holds on to the end.Amidst the Armitice Days celebrations Benjamin's mother dies while giving birth to him. Thinking his son is a monster his father a wealthy Button factory owner abandons him on the doorstep where Queenie, a kind woman who is unable to have children of her own takes him in and loves him as her own. Despite being born in the body of a dying old man Benjamin defies the odds and grows younger while all of his loved ones grow older around him.We learn of how Daisy and Benjamin came to meet for the first time at the retirement home where Benjamin lived. Daisy as a child visiting her Grandmother sees Benjamin as an old man and instantly they take to each other. While the idea is that he is a child in an old mans body it is still a little creepy that they fall in love on their first meeting. She is still a child and he is essentially an old man.Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald the film has a touch of other films such Forest Gump, Jack and Forever Young, 3 films that really work for me and I loved. The only thing that let the film down was it's length. At nearly 3 hours I found myself getting distracted from the story a little and looking at the time. Despite this I watched the entire film, gladly at home and not in the cinema! The make up and special effects were excellent (hence the Oscar for Best Visual Effects).Nice film to watch if you have a spare few hours but probably not a good idea if you value your time! I give it a 6 out of 10 because I liked the story, the acting and the make up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its strength, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a misfire from a previously exciting director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has established himself in mainstream cinema as a visionary perfectionist and cult director with Se7en and Fight Club; it's unfortunate that his latest effort, which earned him his first Academy Award nomination, is not up to this usual standard, despite following the Fincher/Pitt formula. Though it isn't exactly Fincher thinking within his comfort zone, he takes the conventional crowd-pleasing material from a screenplay by regular critics favourite Eric Roth, creating a life story scratching American history but with a strange twist for the protagonists' circumstance. Benjamin Button ages backwards (this premise taken and modernized from F. Scott Fitzgerald's work). He begins life as an old man and ends it as a baby's form, though his mental age does not follow the same pattern.The film of a fantasy scale works on the basis of sealed fate with consequences destined to happen ? which may be merely an attempt to excuse certain contrivances and also makes us question whether any supposed danger is relevant. It also has the idea and theme of an imperfect balance; "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh" ? ironically I find an imperfect balance between the films use of sentiment and truly poignant moments and, in general, the good and bad points of quality. To understand Benjamin Button we must first make a plausible assumption as to why he ages backwards ? considering it's never directly revealed; otherwise emotional attachment becomes impossible since the characters don't question this miracle as often as one would expect. Within the prologue the audience is presented with the storytelling technique; Button's love of his life, Daisy, or Cate Blanchett in heavy makeup on her death bed with her daughter (Caroline) beside her. Just before Caroline reads Button's mild recollections in his diaries, Daisy tells of a story that occurred just before Benjamin's birth (of which, coincidentally, is exactly the day The Great War ended) where a blind clockmaker sends his son to war only to die soon afterwards. In this angst he makes a clock for a train station that runs backwards ? as if to express his compassion for wanting everyone who died in the war to return; however it is not well received. He dies soon afterwards. With these parallels, it is probable that because of the man's broken heart, Benjamin Button's life corresponds to that of the clock. "The Lord taketh and the Lord giveth".The aesthetic qualities are rewarding enough to save the film from a level of mediocrity for its technical competence cannot be ignored. The cinematography, thankfully, keeps full grasp of the scale and creates a much needed subtlety between the special effects and reality. It manages to fully compensate Fincher's vision with cinematic beauty that's thoroughly pleasing to the eye often taking the opportunity to get an emotional reaction from the audience successfully. However, the colours become more muted and plain as it steps near to the third act around the time Benjamin and Daisy are reunited almost completely changing the tone ? though luckily it returns it within the epilogue. The films crowning achievement remains it's tremendous score, by Alexandre Desplat, where its sheer ambiance is a delight, corresponding to the imagery with precision even if it is rather repetitive. It still makes the experience worth the near 3 hours.After having watched the film it is very clear that Brad Pitt's nomination is merely an apology for snubbing him since Twelve Monkeys, most notably his extraordinary performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. In The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt does nothing. He's not even a blank canvas. But there is no opportunity for emotional range. Benjamin Button is a vacant being, his naivety is clearly apparent by his lack of reaction to anything as contrasted by Daisy's reaction. And this is infuriating for an actor of Pitt's talent and a character of this scale. However, even though it's so subtle it can barely be intentional, throughout all ages of Button's life Pitt manages to form an ambiance of the man by his presence and carry it consistently during the film. Cate Blanchett, however, provides an elegant, focused, controlled and passionate portrayal of Daisy retaining chemistry with Pitt and saving his mediocre effort. It's also impressive that she managed to give the impression of a full character considering the entire life span. Although her character is a complete stereotype, Taraji P. Henson (garnering a deserved nomination), who plays Benjamin's 'mother' Queenie, her enthusiasm is unparalleled and thoroughly compelling ? especially her ability to preserve a sense of nurturing personality since the majority of the first act she isn't acting besides Pitt himself. Unfortunately the rest of the cast are absolute clichés and barely worth mention ? other than Tilda Swinton's brief turn.Overall The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is not a worthy addition to any specific elite. Although potentially a pleasant experience and a popcorn crowd-pleaser, there is no way this film will stand the test of time or even the transition to being shown on television. Let alone the fact that most of the dialogue is often a pain to the ears, Fincher should keep to dark elements with more relevant undertones and experiments with cinematic techniques. The influence is limited and uninspired, often rushing towards ideas of freedom and life lessons and rarely being exhilarating. If it deserves any credibility it'll just be for the technical competence. It's definitely an on-the-surface film but luckily for it, the surface is very pretty.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am curious elderly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" left me with mixed impressions. Brad Pitt's role as a man aging in reverse poses the questions of mortality and lost love. I got the feeling that the idea of Benjamin's approaching his eventual passing mirrored the hospital scenes as Hurricane Katrina bears down on New Orleans, leading to the destruction of the Crescent City and the end of its festive reputation. The idea that Benjamin starts out looking old, rejuvenates to the point of looking middle-aged, and ends up looking like a baby makes me think of something else. There's a certain period of his life where Benjamin can lead a normal existence, due to looking his age. Meanwhile, he has to spend both his youth and old age in nursing homes. He ends exactly as he started. Maybe the implication is that old age is, in a way, a return to childhood.As for the story itself, I guess that it didn't impress me as much as it could have, just since it seemed similar to "Forrest Gump" and "The World According to Garp", and also "Youth without Youth", about an elderly man who gets struck by lightning and starts aging backwards.Overall, I recommend the movie, although it's not one that I would have thought to nominate for Best Picture. Also starring Cate Blanchett, Taraji Henson, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, Jared Harris, Elias Koteas and Tilda Swinton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not convinced by the romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never convinced that Ben (Pitt) and Daisy (Blanchett) were in love, or even that attracted to each other. The director uses a montage to cover the height of their romantic relationship because there is little chemistry between the lead roles.The film is aesthetically very pleasing, stylish etc. Some parts of it are funny, many of the support roles (e.g. the tattooed captain) are interesting but the film hinges on the relationship between Daisy and Ben and how they deal with Bens reverse of age.Mild spoiler below...It works quite well when they are both (mentally) children but as they get older rather than giving us a struggle to care about we watch two characters mistreat each other and fail to love each other, to then finally come together for a montage, and then they split again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, just not extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting premise, a talented cast, terrific effects, and beautiful music. So why, at the end of the movie, did I feel it was a. too long b. lacking and c. empty? Perhaps it is because we never scratch the surface of any of the major characters. In many ways, this movie reminds me of Forrest Gump - we have an unusual character, played by a talented actor, and we see the events of many decades through his eyes (and narration). But in Gump, the simplistic character winds up being quite wise, and his insights, while short, are piercing. Here, Benjamin's insights are superficial. Oh, yes, we do get a couple of moments where we sense there is a larger message the movie is working toward. But they are rare, and not pieced together.The fluidity of the movie, the sweeping scenes, and the beautiful score make this a lovely movie. But it could have been, truly, an extraordinary movie if it had been better edited (did we need such a long Russian montage?) and if the script had delved into the characters better (particularly Benjamin's lover in Russia). His relationship with his mother was heartwarming, and yet her death was abrupt and without emotion from Benjamin. It seems that he passes through life as an observer, yet the plot has him embracing life and doing all that he wants to do. It is a contradiction that doesn't fit the other quality aspects of the film.I would watch it again. But I suspect I would be disappointed, again. Not because of the hype, but because so many of the elements of a wonderful film are there, but not used.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like Forest Gump's life, only backwards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One question remained unanswered for me while coming out from seeing "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"; why did Benjamin Button age backwards? This was the question that drew hyped audiences into theaters to find out. With such an interesting concept surely the revelation of the supernatural mystery of Button's life was going to be epic, if not at least somewhat revelatory. Yet what we got instead (spoilers) was a man's scenic journey through life, and that's it. There was no twist, no Dues ex machina, just a man living his life in backwards order. This was, to say the least, disappointing. Even though director David Fincher created yet another breathtaking film in scope, cinematography, and nostalgia for American history, I felt that for a film with such an astonishing premise, it was somewhat squandered.Maybe the one to blame is writer Eric Rothe, who also scripted Forest Gump, and there are more than a couple similarities between the two films. This connection is what frustrated me this most. The Benjamin Button catchphrase "You never know what's comin' for ya," is too similar to "life is like a box of chocolates" and often shares the-one man-living-an-extraordinary-life-without-knowing-it thing. But the difference is Forest Gump doesn't realize his extra-ordinariness, which makes it that much more enjoyable for the viewer, where Benjamin Button becomes fully aware, and very involved in his forthcoming maturity. The film hints at why Benjamin's life occurs this way, and does offer a fulfilling story about human frailty, relationships, and sacrifice, but besides that there was no clear answer (to me anyway) why he was a man living life in reverse. Maybe it was meant to be this way, and maybe I need to see it again, but I was left unanswered and unsatisfied to what could have been a near perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the movie's production values. The acting is wonderful. The story, while a bit labored at times due to its antiquity, is well adapted. But this movie is way too long. It doesn't take 2 hours and 46 minutes to tell this gimmicky story, and using that much time to tell it is a conceit.Brad Pitt excels as Benjamin Button, showing his range as an actor. Though it should have been clear some time ago that he is more than a pretty boy, this movie erased all doubt in my mind. He shows an economy of emotion that fits the simplicity of the character, and that is well judged.Cate Blanchett is one of my favorite actresses because she seems to become the role. She seems to subordinate herself to the role so well that she becomes faceless. This is the trick of a magician, because her face is actually quite memorable.Nonetheless, this movie is too damn long and the concept too bizarre. If it were not for that, I would give it 9 stars, as the directing, acting, and photography are first-rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forrest Gump remake with a fresh ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One cold New Year's Eve in 1918 Benjamin Button is born. His mother dies at childbirth, whilst he himself a wrinkled deformed baby is left at the doorstep of an old people's home by his panicking father. After seeing this gift from god and a doctor stating that he has not much time to live a black maid Dorothy Baker (Faune A. Chambers) decides to look after the infant. Years pass but instead of dying each passing year sees Benjamin's health improving with age. A young boy in the body of an old man he is set to live his life in reverse.His soul-mate is Daisy (Cate Blanchett), several years younger than him and an aspiring dancer. Life however forces them apart when Benjamin becomes a sailor and Daisy leaves for New York to pursue her dancing career.This won't be much of a discovery and as some people have noticed in a cute youtube spoof Benjamin Button is so similar to Forrest Gump that it is impossible not to notice. This does not only concern story similarities (with differences ranging from Gump partaking in the Vietnam War and Button in the II World War), but also the way the story is structure and told. This feeling of deja vu really makes you focus to much attention on the wrong things. Add to that the not-too-deep story and you have no option but to come to the conclusion that the first 90 minutes of the movie is a waste.Now I must say that after being extremely disappointed by the first 90 minutes I really must applaud the director for the rest. Once Benjamin and Daisy finally come together the movie takes on totally new subject matters, becomes deeper and more thought through. During this part of the movie I must say we have possibly two of the most heart-warming sequences in XXI-century cinema. The first shows Benjamin and his daughter playing outside with a balloon, while Daisy watches them from inside the house. The second shows Benjamin's last moments of life. During these two scenes you really feel like you are watching a masterpiece.I wasn't really convinced by the motivations of Button and Daisy break-up at the end of the movie. It seemed forced and unnecessary. On the other hand the storyline really makes you contemplate what occurred long after the movie finished. Heartwarming and masterful movie, even if too much repetitiveness for 60% of it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have a problem with long, leisurely-paced films as long as they are intelligently written and directed, so for me The Curious of Benjamin Button, while perhaps not quite managing to achieve the greatness for which it quite obviously strives, was an enjoyable film. That isn't to damn the film with faint praise - lofty ambitions unrealised aren't necessarily a sign of a sub-standard film. But my only real criticism is that Button is a film that dwells on questions of fate and life and death without really providing any meaningful insight. The central device, that of the title character (ably played by Brad Pitt) ageing backwards almost seems to be superfluous. His condition is accepted unquestioningly by all around him, and as the film focuses more on the first half of Button's life there is little evidence of the wisdom living one's life in reverse would give Button as his looks grow younger.The story is told on a fairly grand scale while focusing on the importance of human relations (and how they mould a person) and the emotions that play a part in deciding our fate. A melancholic air hangs over everything: we know that Benjamin can only briefly sample happiness because of his condition: his affair with Daisy can only ever be a transient one, a fact they both try to ignore and which Benjamin finally, reluctantly, faces up to. It's at this point that the effects of Benjamin's condition (rather than the emotional impact) take centre-stage. By now the film is over two-hours old, leaving it feeling somewhat imbalanced as the last thirty-odd years of Benjamin's life feel glossed over. Despite this, the poignancy of his final years is perfectly captured.It's long, it's slow, there's a certain sense of self-importance about it, but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't get past the gimmick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most story failures go all the way back to the premise, even and including big budget epics like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Sometimes the failure occurs because the writer doesn't develop the idea properly. For example, he or she may choose the wrong genre. But most often failures of premise occur because the original idea is weak, with huge structural problems lurking under the depths that don't surface until the writer tries to write the script. Indeed, many of the premise techniques that I talk about in the Great Screen writing Class are designed to show you which ideas simply will not work, no matter how good a writer you are.The premise of Benjamin Button is certainly intriguing. A man is born old and ages backward. He meets a girl when she is ten, they have a great love in the few years when their ages intersect, and then their biology tears them apart. But the key question is: what does this idea mean structurally? Writer Eric Roth is trying to write a tragic, epic love story. This very powerful form has become rare because it is so difficult to make the case that even a great love can affect a nation. And because it is so much easier now for lovers to get together and so much easier for them to part.Against such obstacles, this premise immediately feels like nothing more than a gimmick to make tragic love possible. If you can't create real tragic love, just come up with a man who ages backward. Now that guy's going to have some major love problems.Fantasy always involves creating a unique story world with its own rules. But these rules must be allegorical; they must highlight the world we really live in, including its emotional reality. But that doesn't happen here. For long stretches of the story, the two leads could be together. But one of them doesn't want to. This does not have the makings of epic or tragic love. When the two do get together as a couple, they enjoy a number of apparently blissful years. But Roth knows he has to break them apart. And because the story is based on the gimmick of the guy aging backward, he is forced to concoct one of the phoniest scenes in recent memory. Benjamin tells his wife, Daisy, that he doesn't want his new baby to miss having a real father, or his wife to see him as he grows into a child. So he just up and leaves, even though he has many years before he becomes a child.Benjamin Button has an even larger structural problem embedded in the premise. A story that unfolds backward is extremely rare for a reason. It makes story causation virtually impossible. Or, to put it another way, you end up with the ultimate episodic story. An episodic story is one in which each event stands on its own - each scene in effect becoming mini-story - and does not connect with the other events. The whole becomes less than the sum of the parts.One of the only stories to unfold backwards successfully is Harold Pinter's Betrayal. But notice that Betrayal is built on a relationship between a man and a woman. It is an organic unit from first to last. With this as a foundation, the story's backward movement, instead of being episodic, induces the audience to focus on the original causal forces that ultimately drive these two people apart.Benjamin Button is the story of one man's life. But his backward unfolding is based on the lowest form of causation, the biological. That's not what we are interested in when we see someone's life story. We want to see an unfolding based on the character's life choices. We want to see how the character's highest, most human qualities play out. It is these human elements that make plot possible, because plot is based, among other things, on the hero's ability to plot his own course. Because Benjamin Button tracks a man biologically getting young, he becomes nothing more than a freak who can't make any choice at all. He floats through life, an observer of the world who holds little interest for the audience.Benjamin Button, like Slumdog Millionaire, is a myth story connected to a love story. But where the writer of Slumdog Millionaire created a structure that would build inevitably to a convergent point, the writer of Benjamin Button, trapped by his premise, could only string together moments. We watch myth stories because they give us a lifetime perspective, and therefore let us see a model of how to live a fulfilling life. In The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, the only life lesson we learn is: don't be born old.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting but flawed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the first film I saw in 2008 which would then go on to be nominated for Best Picture and overall in the scale of things I would rate it fourth of the films. 1st would be Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, 2nd would be Stephen Daldry's The Reader, 3rd would be Ron Howards' Frost Nixon and now fourth is David Fincher's 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.' To describe the plot in one sentence it is about a character called Benjamin Button who is born old and grows younger. The film is about his life including some of the people he meets and the love he shares for a character named Daisy. The best performance is by Brad Pitt who gives an emotionally restraint performance throughout the whole film which is quietly beautiful. Taraji P. Henson is also wonderful as Queenie who is warm and lovable. There are elements of the story that are interesting and the make-up and visual-effects are absolutely amazing. There are also memorable and witty side-gags like a character that claims to have been struck by lightening seven times though the gag overstays its welcome. There is many other things to admire but there are some things that drag the film down. The first and foremost problem is Eric Roth screenplay. I can understand that he had to work with a short story about three pages long which had no characters except Benjamin. But I felt that he tried to repeat Forrest Gump's success (something he too wrote the screenplay for) by using the same storytelling techniques which feel more like a gimmick here and unnecessary. Some of the dialogue is also very hockey and cringe-worthy. Another problem is the usually wonderful Cate Blanchett whose performance I found to be rather over-the-top and tedious. There is also a large section of the story featuring a character played by Tilda Swinton which goes absolutely nowhere and contributed to the problem that the film was far too long. Problems aside it was still a worthy piece of entertainment but I would have preferred to see 'The Dark Knight' and 'Revolutionary Road' get nominated for best picture over this and 'Milk.'</fullReview>

The whole cast shines in their roles, with Pitt great as the enigmatic Benjamin, whilst Blanchett as Daisy is the epitome of beauty. Many other varied characters only add to the humorous yet sad story. The film carries a rich sense of nostalgia that makes the length of Benjamin's journey all the more believable. It's considerable runtime flies by in the enjoyment as the audience is swept through 100 years with wit, charm and flair. Even one year after seeing it in the cinema, many scenes still stick in my mind and I'd love to see again just to experience them again.

		<shortDescription>Fincher's Directorial Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB)has achieved the zenith of his career with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, a sweeping and majestic fable that spans almost an entire century. This moving and eloquent story follows the life of a boy named Benjamin, who was born as a baby in his late 80's and ages in reverse. His mother died in childbirth and his father was so horrified at the sight of him that he left him on an anonymous doorstep, where he was taken in by a kindly black owner of a boarding house in post WWI New Orleans. We become completely enveloped in Benjamin's tale as we watch him calmly accept the extraordinary hand that God has dealt him while others do the same or run in terror. We watch the kindly adopted mother who accepts his as he is, though does take him to a faith healer thinking she can "save" him; we also watch his biological father track him down and regret his decision of giving the boy up while he maintains a life long friendship with Daisy, the little girl who he meets as an old manchild, whose lives meet in the middle as she grows into a vain beauty who can't accept the fact that Benjamin grows younger as she grows older. The film is visually arresting and bold in its cinematic scope as Fincher's meticulous direction brings you a story that should make you ponder, but really only makes you behold. Brad Pitt received his second Oscar nomination for his performance in the title role, a role which many feel was all visual effects and makeup; however, Benjamin has a mind and a soul and a voice that Pitt brings to this extraordinary character with a quiet and understated dignity. Cate Blanchett is luminous as Daisy, the love of Benjamin's life who can't quite accept Benjamin's life for what it is and there is strong support from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother and Jason Flemyng as his biological father. Fincher breathes an extraordinary life into this story which could have been buried in visual effects and makeup but has a life of its own and the final act as Daisy becomes an older woman while Benjamin regresses to infancy, is absolutely heartbreaking. A one of kind cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing with time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A philosophical look at life and death and the unstoppable element of time which plagues all our lives. While most people accept the fact that a minute after birth they are on a relentless journey towards old age, occasionally nature plays some unusual tricks on the new born. Call this story a fantasy if you will, there is many a baby born as ugly as hell yet lives to see vast improvements in the facial features. Such is the case here where a rejected child blossoms into the most handsome man and looking younger every day.The film maker treats the subject gently making it clear that the man who is aging backwards so to speak is not without personal difficulties. After marriage to a lovely woman he continues to grow younger while she observes an increasing number of wrinkles in her pretty face. As a couple the future looks unpredictably complicated. We ask ourselves where will it all end?In the Picture of Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde also grappled with time as an intriguing subject. An artist painted a portrait of Dorian and as the years passed the face in the picture grew old but Dorian himself seemed to remain forever young. Somehow or other he seemed to be cheating Nature. And so it is here. Benjamin Button is cheating Nature by becoming younger and younger as the years pass by.How often have we all at some time or another during some happy moment we wish that time would stand still and that we could hang on to that moment forever.. An interesting thought. But time never stands still. It is a one way passage?.forward.What is the end point for a human being whose age is receding? A baby in arms with dementia who does not know his wife or mother? A difficult situation to be sure but the film makers accentuate the importance of love in human relationships.The story itself is truly a fantasy but is compelling to watch. While not believing a minute of the story one is fascinated by the situations and one is left with an impossible question?..what if?..?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has strengths but also weaknesses...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I expected this movie with impatience but it turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment. Maybe I expected too much and it is all my fault.I expected that the main feature of the movie - the fact that Benjamin ages backward - will be used to convey a strong message about common life. It appears that the message is that "it is never too late..". But when you think about it, the aging backward of the main character is not necessary to make that point. In fact the thing I disliked most is that this idea remains on the level of curiosity the entire movie. Also the fact that it last so long is a minus for me because the extra time is not necessary to make any point, it just lasts longer. This comment also applies to "Zodiac" from the same director. It appears that this is his MO. The thing I liked about the movie is the scenery, the atmosphere and also the acting which is superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing Benjamin a couple of weeks. In case anybody doesn't know it stars Brad Pitt in the lead role of Benjamin Button who grows younger as he grows older. I've always found Brad Pitt a very engaging actor who has put in many fine performances over the years. He probably had eyes on the academy when he took this role, but ultimately his only recognition was a nomination. I was not totally convinced about Pitt in this role and think that Blanchett took the honours in terms of acting.It is undoubtedly true that this is an interesting subject for a movie, but for me it wasn't quite realised. Based on it's IMDb rating it seems that I am in the minority on this and I would certainly recommend that people watch it and make up their own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forrest Gump Meets the Notebook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depending upon the mood you are in this movie will either move you or bore you. In either case, it will be memorable because of it's unique script.Simply put, this is a love story. The story is about a character named Benjamin who ages in reverse. We see him at various stages of his life, most of which are centered around his relationship with his ultimate love interest, Daisy. There are various sub-stories throughout the film as we visit various chapters of his life. In each, we see different characters which ultimately enhance the breadth and appeal of the script.Benjamin himself feels a bit like Forrest Gump at times. He's approachable, non-judgmental, adventurous and fully accepting. He's also somewhat simple like the Gump character. You don't get lines like "... life is like a box of chocolates ...", but the similarity can be drawn nonetheless.The story is unique, but you must be ready for the length of the film. The film takes it's time and thoroughly explores big chapters of Benjamin's life. For those who connect with the film the large amount of time spent will be welcomed. For me, I felt the film could have done with 30-40 minutes of additional edits.If you're up for a slow, deliberate, well-told and unique romance film then rent this one. If not, I suspect you too may be enamored with the film's uniqueness but a little frustrated with its length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great start Uninspired ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had some great potential. The first half was very entertaining. It began to die out after his first romance with the wife of a politician. It just seemed to lose heart and emotion. His supposed true love interest and he had no chemistry whatsoever. She seemed to play the aloof dancer OK but she was not very good displaying love or emotion.I was bored and annoyed with the ending and turned it off. Just blah half way through.I think the main problem is they tried to jump to him looking young to fast. There should have been more adventure as an older man and more interaction with the characters he met.The scenes with the wife of the politician was full of passion and should have played a bigger role. How can you have a story with two loves stories.Just some real bad scripting and poor direction. Even Brad showed a loss of interest in the second half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do mildly recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I do think the premise is very interesting, but there's something not quite right about it. It's way too long. I thought it was a tad bit boring. I did find it somewhat interesting. Somewhat dull. It's not that Benjamin Button is a bad film, it's just not the best. It's incredibly overrated. I don't think this is David Fincher's best film at all, it's not one of his worst though. I much prefer Seven or The Game or Fight Club. The Curious case of Benjamin Button wasn't worth the 13 Oscar nominations it got. I'd at least give it one for best visual effects. Because the film had spectacular special effects. The Special effects are very decent, but not enough for 13 Oscar nominations. You can disagree with me, but I think Benjamin Button is a weird film. I think Benjamin Button is a slow, occasionally dull, occasionally boring, somewhat entertaining, film that I do slightly recommend. But Dark Knight deserved more nominations than this damn movie. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is very overrated, but I suppose you could see it if you were that desperate.The Plot: THe story of Benjamin button, a guy who was born old and begins to age backwards, and experiences many things in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an outstanding film from the point of editing, cinematography, screenplay, set design and visual effects. No wonder it got so many Academy Award nominations.The screenplay's story of how ephemeral life is with all its loving and poignant moments makes this film unique and timeless.My only criticism is that the plot is lethargic, and monotonous. This would have been a better movie if shortened to no more than 120 minutes. It boringly shuffles between New Orleans and New York, and a few other points of interest. But the film's journey across the decades is a snooze and largely forgettable, unlike the rhythm, buoyancy and electricity of "Forrest Gump."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, interesting but too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that people are divided into 2 camps-they either love this or hate it. Some find it pointless.Simply put; the film is about our fear of what we will become. What the future holds for us. For the young, they see old people and some probably fear the idea they will become old. In this case, things are different for Benjamin Button. The film also seems to be about timing. How we sometimes meet the love of our life but perhaps aren't ready for it or too immature to realize what is in front of us. I think it's also about caring for the ones we love when they can no longer care for themselves. The film is very well acted by everyone. The photography is beautiful. I think the film could have been shorter though. It does seem to be a bit too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that could have been shortened without affecting the film.I didn't find it depressing and it certainly is a unique idea for a film. If you enjoy drama this would probably be your thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a story by Fitzgerald, a man is born old and gets younger as time passes. Given the silliness of the story, the filmmakers are to be commended for making an absorbing film out of it. Pitt is quite good, particularly in the early scenes as he plays an adolescent who looks like a little old man. Blanchett is OK as his love interest, but is not effective as a mumbling old lady. Benjamin's tale is told in flashbacks, as his love lies on her deathbed, but this framing mechanism seems too contrived. It is meticulously directed by Fincher. Although some superfluous scenes could easily have been deleted, it rarely drags despite the length of nearly three hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benjamin (Pitt) is born and looks about 80-yrs old, the mother dies, and the father hustles it to another part if town. The baby is found, cared for and begins to grow younger as time passes.I did my best not to watch this movie. I figured it would be something like the TV show Mork and Mindy and Johnathan Winters thing back in the day. I just didn't see any sense to it. I was wrong. Oh, I still don't see any sense to it, but after watching it, I have come to see that it is a very touching and beautiful story, great cinematography and extremely well acted by all especially by Brad Pitt. And, if truth be told here, the dialogue wins too. It was fantastic, quiet, respectful, honest and, at times, offered many humorous lines??.some of them the laugh-out-loud variety. Yes, it is too long and to think that it came from a Short Story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Must have been some story to have a movie last almost 3-hours. Looking back, I can see where many scenes could have been shortened, not cut out: shortened. Now, how did this happen, how did Benjamin grow younger with time (and look like the Brad Pitt we know. Sorry, couldn't resist)? Well, it all had to do with a Clock-Maker making a clock in a big Railroad Station run backwards. He had lost a son in the war and the only way to bring him back was to reverse time. So there is your correlation and this gives us a very touching and beautiful story. That is what F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to have happen. And, it did?..in this story. But, he was also telling us that every life is precious. And, we benefited. I would have voted this as Best Picture.I came to think of another movie that took me a long time to watch too. FARGO. Now, it's part of my top ten as is this one. But, they could have shortened it some without taking anything away from it. Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, but really funny when Benjamin looking as old as he does has a hooker gasping for breath as she finds it hard to keep up. You just saw blankets moving. Nothing else. Nudity: Yes, briefly. Language: Yes, one F-bomb released late in the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving look at life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the story of a man named Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who is born in New Orleans, at the height of World War One, in 1918, as an old man who ages backwards. His body ages backwards but his mind is completely instep with the age he should actually be. The film was adapted from the 1921 short story "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.The theme of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is living life to the fullest using the cards you were dealt. Life isn't always perfect but you should really make the best of every situation. In the movie, Benjamin says "I hope you live a life you're proud of. If not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again." Benjamin realizes he is different from other people but he really doesn't let his circumstances hinder him from living life. Although Benjamin is born an old man he defies odds by living despite everyone's belief that he would die quickly. He experiences many of the things a normal individual would go through. He travels the world working on a tugboat, he falls in love with a girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett), and he experiences death. No matter where any of us start, we always end up at the same place, death.This movie will truly make an individual think twice about their life. Everyone is always so caught up in their own circumstances that they don't appreciate what they have. It's important to be thankful for what you have been given in life.The theme of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button could be compared to that of 1994's Forrest Gump. Much like Benjamin, Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) defies odds to truly live life through various experiences.In the movie a great amount of makeup was used to change the appearance of Benjamin. Before seeing the film I was really curious how the changes would be developed. In the beginning of the movie, Pitt starts out as an old man which required quite a bit of makeup. Pitt had white hair and wrinkles put on him so that he would appear to be well into his 80's. I thought the changes were very effective. Despite Pitt's real age, I was able to believe he was older. Later in the film, Benjamin Button begins to get younger. He is going through a reverse aging process. Although Pitt is still an attractive man at his age of 45 he needed to look like he was in his 20's. Makeup was used to make Pitt appear younger. I believe that camera angle's also Played a big role in making Pitt appear younger therefore I can't claim that the makeup was the sole reason for his younger look.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a moving film whose theme will stay with you long after you have stopped watching. After watching the movie you may find yourself thinking about how you can actually experience life. This film will make you want to go out and live life to the fullest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneven, ambitious epic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher's well made film, adapted from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald of the same name, deals with a fascinating premise what would life be like if lived in reverse? The film begins in 2005 in New Orleans, a dying old women named Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is on her deathbed with her daughter by her side. Hurricane Katrina is approaching. While by her side her daughter decides to read her a diary about Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). He tells his story about how he was born an old man in New Orleans. His father thinking that the child was ill leaves him on the doorstep of a retirement home where he is taken in by a black woman in a breakout performance for Taraji P. Henson. While at this retirement home he meets Daisy and falls in love with her. However because of his condition there is no way they can have a normal relationship until the middle of their lives. When he gets younger he decides to travel the world and ends up in a steamboat during World War II and has an affair with an Englishwoman (Tilda Swinton).Once he gets back from World War II is the point where this movie starts to go downhill. We never really get inside Benjamin's head. We just watch as he gets with Daisy dumps her after they have a kid and watch him get younger and younger. The movie jumps into all sorts of random episodes and there is no real thematic unity. It feels like Fincher was trying to say something really deep about life but screenwriter Eric Roth's script doesn't have that. Instead the script is basically a rewrite of Forrest Gump except instead of living an extraordinary life Benjamin lives a rather ordinary life. It's a shame because this cast and crew do a pretty great job with the parts they were given they just can't find anyway to lift this story out of its clichés. It just comes off as an entertaining gimmick, it never overstays its nearly 3 hour running time, with nice cinematography, art direction, and special effects which are among the best I have seen I might add. Overall this is an entertaining movie but it lacks the sort of punch someone expects from a movie dealing with life. Whereas a film like Synecdoche, New York leaves us thinking about our lives and the people in them in different ways a film like Benjamin Button throws us in all sorts of directions that we don't really know what to think.</fullReview>

This movie is almost perfect, but it's not perfect.This film has a basic concept. A guy is born old and as his life progresses, he gets younger. This is based on a short story by Fitzgerald.The acting and directing is phenomenal. Brad Pitt can act! It's amazing how they can transform him into an old man. Cate Blanchett also did a very fine job. Taraji Henson did a great job, too.The two things that stand out are the visual effects and makeup. They definitely made this movie much better. The music added some effect as well.My only complaint is that this movie is way too long and there are some scenes that should be cut because they are boring and useless.Overall, this is such a wonderful film! This is maybe Brad Pitt's best movie ever. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

I haven't seen the making of yet, but people have told me about some things, that they have seen and it sounds amazing.Unfortunately I don't feel as "touched" by the complete story. It does have a strong beginning and the acting is great. But at the end it seems more like bits and parts and not as a whole movie experience. Of course that symbolizes our life as it is (also bits and pieces and many different chapters, with different characters in them). But although I do like this aspect, I feel there could've been more.Maybe Mr. Fincher spoiled us with the movies he makes and I expected more. But whatever it is and although I do like the movie, I couldn't bear to give it more than 7/10 (which isn't bad at all in my book either).</fullReview>

The diary is about a man named Benjamin. Benjamin ages backwards.

		<fullReview>When one looks at the several thousand movies each one of us is exposed to very few of them have really unique ideas in them. I can quickly think of "Being John Malkovich", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", "Groundog Day", "Pleasantville" ... all unique and fine movies."Benjamin Button" falls in that category. This one unique individual, born in 1918, starts out with all the symptoms of old age, a very small person with a body about to wear out, and as time goes by he grows ages backward. He gets younger and healthier. Brad Pitt is Benjamin Button.Meanwhile Cate Blanchett as Daisy is in modern times on her deathbed, but she met Benjamin when she was maybe 6 and he was maybe 12. Daisy and Benjamin were always destined to be in each others' lives forever, but how would that really work? When she was a small girl he appeared to be an old man. When they were in their 40s they appeared to be at about the same points in their lives.The third key character is Julia Ormond as Caroline, Daisy's daughter at her bedside, in New Orleans, as hurricane Katrina was approaching.The movie is a bit long, at 2.5 hours, but it never gets boring and the time passes nicely. We saw it on DVD and took a 10-minute break somewhere past half-way. But a fine, different, superb movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More than anything, Benjamin Button seems like the kind of epic movie made for collecting Oscar nominations. Nominations, I say, because its merits stop short of allowing it to win the big prize. It wants to be this year's The English Patient but is instead more like The Aviator, which was visually impressive but not emotionally.I hate to use Cate Blanchett as a yardstick because of my bias for her but she really is the consummate actress and any 'big' movie that doesn't score her an Oscar nomination is seriously flawed one way or other. Here, I believe it's the story, which never really touched me. It's told like a fairy tale, with wistful narration and glowy cinematography, but it's a story that is bizarre and distant and thus doesn't invite empathy. How does one empathize with a man who's aging in reverse or a woman who loses the love of her life because he's getting too young for her? Actually, done well, a movie could have me empathizing with any character. But the character of Benjamin Button was played with a sort of detachment by Brad Pitt. With most scenes he was more like an observer, watching the people around him. I don't quite understand his Oscar nomination, seeing as how in most of his scenes he was upstaged by his makeup.It is no surprise though, that Taraji P. Henson too scored an Oscar nomination, since she provides the warmest moments of the movie, though unfortunately they're over too early. She plays a woman who's unable to have children and so adopts the aberrant and abandoned Benjamin Button - a very sympathetic role.Blanchett feels unjustly misused here, as she comes across as more like Button's mirror than love interest, serving to just reflect his aging process through the years.The movie does look impressive though, in terms of cinematography and set. It's hard to comment on the makeup, seeing as how no matter how real it looks, you'd know it's not real. While I think director David Fincher did a good job here considering the span of the work, I still prefer him directing thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The curious thing about THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that no one seems to think Benjamin's case is that ...well ...curious. But I'm jumping ahead of myself.This film is really all Brad Pitt (BURN AFTER READING). He so controls the entirety of it that you simply could not picture anyone else doing that role but him. Pitt is, after all, a fine actor. Probably one of our finest out there at present. Things like BABEL, OCEAN'S THIRTEEN and FIGHT CLUB have helped elevate his cinematic chops. But never before has so much attention and time been given over to a character that is purely Pitt's. He is on-screen for most of the film's substantial 166 minutes. And he is fantastic to watch.The curiousness of it is that Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born old. Really old. Arthritic, full of heart disease and wrinkles, Benjamin's early life is wrought with problems. His mother (Joeanna Sayler) dies giving birth to him and his father (Jason Flemyng) is so distraught and disgusted by Benjamin's appearance that he leaves him on a vacant porch-step. He is taken into a house of elderly people where they are cared for in their waning years. And as Benjamin's time passes, his body mutates into a younger and younger man. He finds himself in adventures on the high-seas, and travels the world. But one thing he never seems to forget is his early love of Daisy (Cate Blanchett, I'M NOT THERE). Their on-and-off relationship is the only thing that keeps Benjamin semi-grounded in reality. His life is odd, but not so much for him. Although aging is a natural process, Benjamin just happens to be doing it backward. The big question for everyone is "What happens when Benjamin's time runs out?" Will he vanish into a zygote? It is most disturbing (to me as viewer) that no one in the medical community decided to study Benjamin. They just completely accepted the fact that he was aging in reverse and that was that. No news media hype that Benjamin needed to run away from. No pokes and prods by the medical establishment. Nothing. I understand that time was of the essence when telling this story, and that it needed to be more human interest than anything, but I would've liked to have seen SOMETHING or someone curious enough to think this oddity worth studying.Regardless, this film is quite good thanks to Brad Pitt's amazing performance and the incredible make-up effects (Greg Cannom won the Oscar for Best Make-Up and rightfully so). It is also great eye-candy to see the period sets and costumes through the ages as Pitt and the rest of the cast age into the more modern world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those crazy little Hollywood people! What'll they think of next???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a curious case, alright! A curious case of 'we have made everything into a movie so what now...?' Brad Pitt is a superb actor and that cannot be denied. His performance here, along with Cate Blanchett's is wonderful. I really liked the chemistry those two had on screen. It reminded me of some classic Hollywood on-screen couples and that is a rare find in today's films.The plot was EXTREMELY similar to "Forrest Gump." Instead of a slow man, we have a man who is aging in reverse. Instead of a feather, we have a hummingbird. Instead of 'Jenny' we have Cate Blanchett. Instead of a shrimpin boat, we have a tugboat. And instead of Liutenant Dan, we have the tugboat captain. Not saying it was rip off or anything, I'm just saying; the similarities are numerous.The end of the movie was particularly upsetting, when we see a 'young' Benjamin suffering from dementia and paranoia as a little boy. I didn't really think it was necessary to have the whole 'Benjamin Button is my father!?' thing with that girl in the hospital, but hey: this is Hollywood.Gets an extra star because my girlfriend cried through the whole thing. I guess that counts for something.7 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an intriguing setup but too broad and too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director David Fincher comes this tale of a man born under an unusual set of circumstances. Pitt is Benjamin Button, a man born old who ages backwards and has the difficult task of trying to live a normal life despite his bizarre and inexplicable predicament. Beginning in the early 1920s the story focuses primarily on his relationship with Daisy (Blanchett), and how they attempt to maintain their love despite the tumultuously changing times and their inevitable age difference. Director Fincher (who seems to be taking a page from Robert Zemeckis) creates a world all its own with striking cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and unforgettable characters, but it goes on too long and doesn't seem to exist for any reason other than playing the gimmick of a man who ages in reverse for all it's worth. Pitt is good, though his performance is drowned out by the scope of complex makeup effects, Blanchett is adequate, meanwhile Henson is fabulous as the devout southern woman who 'adopts' and comes to love Benjamin as her own. Some touching moments, as well as some funny ones, but they'd be more effective with a shorter running time. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. One, the movie WAS too long and a good 30 minutes could have been lopped off easily. Second, if you are going to use actual places, events, and people then make sure the history is correct. Third, and I am experiencing this more and more with movies, there is too much mumbling going on, background noise (music, general noise) that blocks out dialogue, and some scenes are so dark you cannot tell what the hooey is going on. Works with horror flicks (the darkness), but not with something like this movie. And fourth, asking an audience to ignore the fact that the characters in the movie do not make any sort of Big Deal out of the fact that this man was getting younger goes well past what one should expect from an audience, as well as the script. This was the dawn of a new age, and advances in medicine and all that. Wasn't anyone curious? Now on to the good stuff. Thank goodness the makers of this movie did not follow Fitzgerald's actual story, as that story was quite stupid (IMO). Visually, other than when I could not see what was going on, this movie was a treat for the eyes. The music was perfect for what was going on. Blanchett carried the movie (though, when her character was a dying old woman in the hospital with her daughter I could not understand a lot of what she was saying), as we all expected, and what little we saw of Swinton was well worth the wait. Even Pitt was okay, and I am far from a fan of his. I do not understand how some people did not get the link with the clock. Think of this story as a fantasy, and it all works. I'd love to talk more about the link between BB's birth (and death) and the clock, but go and watch the movie and figure it out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Fable That Doesn't Excite Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This week, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has come out on DVD and Blu Ray. David Fincher's tale of a man who ages backwards and the adventures and lessons that he learns along the way. Based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and adapted by Eric Roth (who also wrote Forrest Gump which I'll get to later). Benjamin's story is told through his diary to Daisy (Cate Blanchett), an elderly woman on the verge of death by her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond). This film looks like a labor of love by Fincher and Brad Pitt who stars as the backwards aging Benjamin. We share Benjamin's life from his birth as an old man, all the way back to his infancy. What we experience is an unconventional love story that is held together by Cate Blanchett's superb work and Brad Pitt's lack thereof. There are other great performances as well by Taraji Henson, Tilda Swinton and briefly, Elias Koteas. But they are not enough to make this a great film.There are a lot of metaphors incorporated through the film and they all seem to be centered on the affect that time has on all of our lives. I found the prevailing themes of redemption and live life to its fullest as the primary message which could be construed as corny but I found comforting. The ever present refrain of "You never know what's comin for ya." is spoken throughout the film and is a warning to us all. Hurricane Katrina is also a very visceral metaphor in the film and it seems to embody that mantra. Essentially, nothing lasts, but it's choice as a metaphor for this film is...well...curiousA lot of great special effects were used to depict Benjamin from birth until about half way into the film when the real Brad finally shows up. All throughout, Benjamin's voice is narrating to us, sharing his adventures and his simple wisdom for us all. It is because of this that the film has a Forrest Gump like quality and especially Brad's accent and voice inflection is very similar to Tom Hanks who played Gump (I've seen Forest Gump and you Mr. Button are no Forest Gump). Whether it was a conscious or unconscious choice is irrelevant, I personally thought it sounded forced and as we like to say in the acting world, indicated. That is not to say that his acting is bad overall but he seemed to focus too much on his accent and not enough on his the spine of his character. But, to his credit, there are times when he does a decent job of finding the emotional reality of the character, except for a few scenes which his lack of emotion is glaring. The scenes with Julia Ormond staying with Blanchett as she is dying didn't do much for me. I enjoyed Blanchett's elderly characterization but I found Ormond to not have clarity about her character which left me feeling nothing about her relationship and how she really felt about her dying mother. The Cinematography by Claudio Miranda is outstanding. I just love the way the shots were framed and the wonderful use of color. One of my favorite shots is in an elevator with Tilda Swinton...sumptuous.The film deservedly received 3 Oscars for Art Direction, Visual Effects and of course, Makeup. I agree that it should not have won Best Picture but the film's message of seizing life was beautiful and especially as I am entering a turning point in my life, just passing 40, the point is quite powerful for me. I commend David Fincher, (who is a great director) for creating a modern fable and trying to bring magic back into movies. I just wish there was more magical moments to enjoy. But, I was still entertained overall and I give Benjamin 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the Oscar awards and reading these comments, I was not disappointed at all. This movie is a good movie with good style and most certainly, one of the most interesting story lines.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett have done a great job and with any doubt this movie was a great opportunity for them to show their acting talent.However, the intriguing storyline drags a long runtime. The movie lasts for almost 3 hours which can get annoying at some point.So - just an advice. You will not be disappointed if you like these sort of movies. But, if you do want to watch it, find some free time, probably a free evening, ask yourself if you are really ready to watch this movie for 166 minutes (that's the runtime, right?) and if you are, you will have a great time. :D Plus, you can watch the movie by yourself, it's as good as when you're watching it with your friends.

		<fullReview>I found this film to be very enjoyable. With an interesting storyline, a strong cast, and it's enormous budget, it had a lot going for it. For me, the highlight of the film was Taraji P. Henson. I'm not familiar with any of her other work but she delivered her comedic lines flawlessly and rightfully deserved that Oscar nomination this year. Brad Pitt on the other hand, maybe it's just because I'm not a Pitt fan but he was just, whatever. He played the role well I suppose, but there's nothing in the material to justify his nomination. The best part about his performance was the make-up, which he was not responsible for. I also felt the film dragged on a bit too long. There's a lot of ground to cover throughout the film, but there were some parts where I was just wondering "what is the point of this? Can we move on please to something more interesting?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an interesting premise for any movie -and the only thing you need to know about this one-, aging backwards, that's for sure. But is it enough? At times, David Fincher's latest movie seems honest and brings out laughs and even smiles from the viewer; but most of the experience lacks those qualities, and the tale grows colder as Brad Pitt becomes younger. Taking it from its tagline ("life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments"), it's not life that's measured in moments but the film itself. If you measured it in minutes it would be endless.With this contradiction mentioned, there's no doubt that "Benjamin Button" is Fincher's most ambitious work to date and, as it happened with Boyle's recent Oscar winner, the only one that could have ever been truly noticed by the Academy. The good news is that it still has some of the characteristics of the director's cinema, in a world that is, for the first time, not populated by obsessive bad people and full of blood.Fincher's attention to detail is seen completely, as he puts his hands in all the elements he can possibly handle, and getting some things wrong because of that. Narration, always a great resource, is performed here by Caroline (Julia Ormond), a character the movie doesn't care much about. She reads a diary to her mother Daisy, an old woman who used to look like Cate Blanchett and with whom Benjamin Button -author of the diary in question- fell instantly in love.Images are beautiful and breathtaking all the way through, but Fincher never seems to let them breathe, and in moments of quietness he accompanies them with music -which is fine, because Alexandre Desplat's score is terrific- and with Brad Pitt's narration -which is wrong, because we don't need someone to tell us the exact thing we are watching on screen-. The way in which Pitt narrates (attempting an affectionate tone but sometimes sounding neutral) serves the viewer as a great guide for the best "Benjamin Button" has to offer: an infinite gallery of wonderful characters and performances that illuminate the screen, starting from Pitt himself.The actor doesn't raise his voice for one minute. His work is not good because of what he says; it's basically built on the opposite, and his good looks help a lot. In another contradiction, his performance is a careful study of looks and gestures, in the line of 'outsiders' like Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands. But on the other hand, this is a role he can play with his eyes closed; like George Clooney's Michael Clayton, he just has to stand there. However, with all of this, he and the movie are not able to establish a connection with the audience.The film's technical work and his team of makeup artists do everything they can to make Pitt seem ten years younger, and they achieve it as the same time they make everyone else seem more than twenty years older. But it's all on the outside, it seems fake and it's out of our reach even when we want to grab it. As Benjamin keeps coming back home (as "Forrest Gump" did many times, from war and from being all around the world: yes, the script by Eric Roth is too similar to not be noticed; but we can't blame his temptation if that script got him an Oscar and if he's among the best screenwriters alive), time takes away his beloved ones, little by little, and everyone at a big house receives him as a man they've never seen before.Even when he is wiser with time and comes into terms with his unusual situation, Benjamin becomes a stranger, a lonely man; and his life and the film's story, with all of the kindness, love and fascination we've experienced in it, becomes a tragedy. There are two cheesy lines in the script that foresee this: "You never know what's coming to you" and "You'll spend a lot of time alone", some people tell Benjamin Button. It's a shame that I couldn't share his pain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're only as young as you feel . . . . . sometimes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A project long in development and approached from different angles by many different directors and stars, we can only be thankful that the technology has advanced so much in recent years to allow THIS director and star collaboration onto our screens.David Fincher directs, and Brad Pitt stars as the title character in, this bizarre tale of a man born in a prematurely aged body (an infant, but a wrinkled infant with bad hearing, bad eyes and arthritic joints) and who then lives his life, basically, growing younger with each passing year. And yet, it must be said right now that this bizarre premise leads to one of Fincher's most straightforward and accessible movies, strange as that may seem.A fairly flawless cast (including Cate Blanchett and Tilda Swinton as love interests, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng and many other superb actors who I have yet to learn the names of, unfortunately) pass in and out of Benjamin Button's life as he travels and learns more the older/younger he gets. To make a lazy parallel, this is similar in many ways to Forrest Gump with the main difference being that the character here has a physical affliction affecting how he impresses upon the lives of others as opposed to the simple naiveté of Gump.The main lesson on offer is also a very simple one: don't let those one-off chances pass you by and make the very most of them when they come along. But it's delivered in a way that, to me anyway, did not feel like you were being beaten over the head with it. The slight and elegant tale just washes over you and takes you by a hand, be it old or young, to lead you away for almost 3 hours of great cinema.The big surprise here is probably how this doesn't actually feel like a David Fincher movie while still utilising all that he is best at (the attention to detail, the choice of shots, the performances he manages to extract, etc) and, therefore, paradoxically also giving Fincher fans a feeling that they are in very safe hands indeed. Safe hands backed up by some of the best FX used in modern cinema. Yes, there have been better and more extravagant images put before us by now but I have yet to see so many impressive FX details (and, hopefully, I missed many little touches) used for the sole purpose of telling the story. Nothing really that flashy here, though there are one or two standout moments, but everything is simply perfect.Helping the story along - that seems to be the motto for everything here. And that is why I have chosen not to spend too much time raving about the quality of the acting throughout. It IS almost uniformly excellent (the females fare better, with Swinton and Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson stealing many scenes they are in) and Pitt acquits himself admirably in a role that he could have easily let be played by the CGI/make-up. Instead, his character shines through in every scene he has. And that may be the highest compliment I can give him. He IS Benjamin Button.See this if you like: Magnolia, Forrest Gump, Interview With The Vampire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very deep and philosophical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very surprised by the fact that so many people do not understand this movie. And yet, what is even more surprising, this does not prevent those people to criticize it. I will agree that the movie is hard to grasp and slow-paced, but that is it as far as its faults go. Everything else is miraculous. As a student of English literature I have read Fitczcherald, Harold Pinter, Shakespeare (to whom there is, by no accident, a reference made in the movie itself) and many others who deal with the transitoriness of human life. It is an altogether, reoccurring subject in literature, and thus on film too. This movie deals with our speedy passage through life and departure from this world. It strives to teach young generations who are caught up in the "rat race" that there is more to life. As I once read "Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away!!!". I learned a lot from this movie and I feel obliged to defend it. First of all I will start with the title of the movie itself. Benjamin Button was not just a name picked up cause it is catchy, and buttons are not mentioned so often in vain either- they are a reoccurring symbol. There is a play by Harold Pinter named "Peer Gynt". At the end of the play the Button Molder, the play's "judge" of humanity, appears. His commission is to melt down souls in preparation for death. More particularly, those whose sins had been significant qualify for Hell, those who were virtuous qualify for Heaven. But if you wasted your life in vain your soul becomes a non-entity boiling in a vat. So the message is : Live your life! Some choices may be bad and some may be good but anything is better than drifting! Button Molder (i.e God) forgives sins, rewards good, but he doesn't forgive wasting of a life he bestowed us with. As Captain Mike says, and Benjamin later cites "... all is forgiven and forgotten when the end comes". The hummingbird is the symbol of the same thing. At one point captain Mike says that if we were to stop the wings of the humming bird for one moment it would die. The humanity, as the humming bird, has to move forward although we all know we are going toward the same thing- old age and dying. In order to understand our life we must look back but in order to live our life we must move forward all the time. It seems that the author tries to warns us that our obsession to stop the aging process is in vain, even if we go backwards like Benjamin we will also have to die eventually. It is important that when the Button Molder comes to judge our humanity we have something that proves we have lived- whether it be love, experience, art or something else (as Benjamin comments at the end too: some dance, some do Shakespeare, some are mothers, some are lovers). Maybe then our soul can fly off with the humming bird, but the time (big clock that was supposed to turn back time for a grieving father) will go on ticking, and it doesn't matter in which direction, the result is always the same. No one knows how much time he is given- so people start using your time! For example WATCH THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will confess that when I first watched the trailer I didn't get it. I didn't really understand what the movie was about. It wasn't until the third or forth time that I viewed the trailer something clicked and made this one movie I had to see.This was very much a movie about story over performance. I am not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I don't find him particularly talented or, on a more shallow basis attractive, but once you got used to his wavering accent you could become totally absorbed in Benjamin's story.The transformation of Benjamin ranging from his elderly form right down to his younger appearance was amazing to watch. The special effects were seamless. It was hard to point out the stage in the movie where the real Brad Pitt appeared.The supporting cast were fine, the most light-hearted moments came from Taraji P Henson as Benjamin's adopted mother Queenie and Jared Harris as Caption Mike although there is the argument that both roles were playing caricatures and as ever , Cate Blanchett played her part with the usual talent and grace that we have come to expect.Benjamin Button is the nicest and most polite character to have appeared on the big screen since Forest Gump and at times he did come across like Forest with his naive simplicity. Cate Blanchett had the harder job of getting the audiences sympathy as there were times when Daisy was just down right horrid to poor (simple) Benjamin but come the end of her story she had won me around.There were moments were I felt tears welling up and these were mostly the hospital scenes, that at times, interrupted the story telling, as the virtually unrecognisable Cate Blanchett was almost to accurate in her portrayal of a cancer patient.I would give the movie an 8/10. It was a movie that you could totally lose yourself in - you do not feel the long running time.I felt it had to lose a point for the Hurricane Katrina references at the end. It was a nice idea that Benjamin would return for Daisy but if we buy that ending then we really must blame Benjamin for creating one of the worst hurricanes in recent times. The ending could have worked but tying it into a recent real life event just didn't. It was clumsily done.I loses as other point as I am Irish and Captain Mike annoyed me as I don't actually know of any Irish Men who speak in that accent.Overall it is a love story about two people meeting at different stages of their lives and trying to hold on to the time they have together . -aww</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher is a worthy mind. From previous adventures i knew he cares about form, about the shape of his films, about creating a structure, coherent with the intended narrative. With Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac, i felt that structure existed before the narrative line was leaked into it. That is his playground, and it is interesting because there is more to his films than the structure which support them. So we have visual ideas, that convey emotional intentions.Here he tries something new. Well, he still is worried about making a solid structure in which to insert the story. In fact this is his longest form, not so much for the time the film lasts, but for the kind of development in takes. A film that follows a lifetime has to be one of the most difficult things to do in cinema. Why is that? Because that kind of story is totally rooted in literature, not in cinema. It's hard to compress one's emotional evolution over a lifetime into images. Literature has the ability to create instant channels to one's mind. You try to do that in film, and it's usually a disaster. That's why it's so hard to find good films that convey biographies (the so called biopic).Having said this, i think this film is successful because it deals with the disadvantages i referred above. It deals with avoiding the predictabilities, the laziness and consequent failure of placing words as the subtitles for uninteresting images. It's not a perfect film and there is yet to come (or at least i haven't seen) a film that depicts one's lifetime and changes my life.Here there is one beautiful concept that makes it for me. This is a love story, all right. But it deals with time and space as adversities for the lovers to meet. It's a matter of two people who have to fight to find their own common space, the conditions to be together, whether fighting against war or social prejudice (the Titanic model). But, much more interesting, fighting for the right time. The opposite life lines (one getting older, the other getting younger) allow this. For a few years, for a certain period in time, the lovers are allowed to share their love. What a beautiful idea, that a couple has to live in proximity without touching, knowing all the way that they are seeing the love of their lives and yet they have to wait for the right time to come, and than having the courage to separate again. That's the heart breaking idea that moves this Benjamin Button. Fincher had never made such a film, so based on conveying emotions, a film built with a clear structure which we can discard because what matters is what's inside it. In his other films, structure and content were one.This is a love story, remarkable, sensitive tail, that shows in an anti-romantic time. Maybe that's why it grasps the sympathy of the audience so much. Winds of change? Reversed time? My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a very interesting film. Obviously its about Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) a man that ages backwards. It is a very good film, it has good variety. All the way through the film there are hints of humour that will make you smile at least. The only reason this film is good because it is interesting. All the way through I was imagining what it would be like to age backwards. It was also very convincing, it almost made me believe it was a genuine disease, I had to snap myself out of it! However, there are some things I didn't like, the film did drag on a bit. Towards the end there was things the editors could have cut out to make the film shorter. I wouldn't say that this film is one of those films you can watch over and over again, I couldn't imagine myself buying it on DVD and watching it over and over because it isn't one of those films at all, but never the less, it is definitely worth watching! 8 out of 10 in my books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scripting tricks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm concerned about all the hype and favoritism and nods this movie has received, as it is clearly a case of an immature script full of clichés and bad-writing traps. This film shows a lot of gimmicks, that wrap a really-really poor script: in the end, Button's case has no soul (just a visual appeal) and as it has been stated (and as I recalled while watching it), it seems a re-version of 'Forrest Gump' (by the same screenwriter).I'm totally disappointed by David Fincher, as I've always considered his films really interesting: all were visually appealing 'but' also coherent storytelling pieces (an always difficult equilibrium). Maybe none of them could be considered absolute masterpieces, although his dazzling, mature, enormous in scope 'Zodiac' could be called that. The traps I was talking about, which are script patches to make the film artificially engaging for the masses, can be spotted based on this formula:Nothing deep or remotely interesting happens (apart from the Fitzgerald's starting point), so to break this, one of these can occur: 1) A person dies. 2) Flash-forward/back to present/past. 3) A catchy phrase is spoken ("You never know what's coming for you", "Goodnight Benjamin..."). 4) A tale is told (the clock, the car accident). 5) A funny occurrence is told (lightnings). 6) An event/thing/animal is shown as predicted (the hummingbird). 7) Someone comes back from a long absence (Button, Daisy,...). 8) An extraordinary (deus ex machina) event occurs (ship VS submarine).These events are 'tricks' because they are totally gratuitous, as they do not add anything to the whole, they are put artificially in the script to cause instant but forgettable awe. Also, in a proof of Roth's sophistication, the tricks seem to feedback each other. For instance, the ship battle (8) leads to some phrases (3) and deaths (1) and a comeback(7). Button, anyway, doesn't seem to evolve as a character, nor the mood of the film is changed accordingly. These tricks can be easily traced in the 'cousin' film frequently mentioned ('Forrest Gump') and also in Burton's visual bubble 'Big Fish'. Anyhow, just Zemecki's film is laudable as it shows some interest in Gump's character (in contrast of Button's nothingness: furthermore, Button is not psychically impaired as to be so numb) and can be said to be more 'original'.What follows is that all seems artificial and undramatic: there's no cohesion, there's no plausibility, there's no main character's arch, there are no goals, there is no opposition, there's no conflict. As a result, there's no drama and, of course, there is no narrative quality whatsoever. Anyway, it has to be said that the cinematography, the make-up and the mini-tales that are shown are totally outstanding, as are compelling the performances of Blanchet and Swinton. Pitt's performance is somehow remarkable, given the poor character he's been offered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent special effects and acting, but the boring storytelling techniques turned me away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button nominated for numerous Oscars including Best Picture. It is about the life of man named Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who is born in the 1920s. However instead of looking like a regular baby, Benjamin looks like an old man as an infant because of some strange disorder. He is abandoned by his parents and ends up in the care of a pair of retirement home employees. They raise him through his young years as he begins to take his first steps at age 7, meets a beautiful girl named Daisy, and learns a lot about life. Soon Benjamin leaves off to fight in World War II, and afterwards starts a life on his own. As the years go on he begins to realize that he starts looking younger, as his actual age increases. Eventually he again meets up with Daisy (Cate Blanchett), who is now a matured young woman, and begins a relationship with her. As Benjamin gets younger, Daisy gets older. But the love between them only gets stronger.This movie has gotten strong critical praise, excellent word-of-mouth, and many Oscar nominations. While there are many things I liked about this movie, there were still a lot of things I did not like about it. Brad Pitt gives a great, nuanced performance that constantly changes and shifts in interesting directions as the character changes. In fact I think most of the performances in this film were good. Cate Blanchett gives a good performance as usual, and Taraji P. Henson also gives an amazing performance as the woman that took care of Benjamin in his early years. The special effects on the way they age Brad Pitt was masterfully done, very convincing, and really make the film memorable. The best effects were when he was an old man, middle aged, and around his 30s and 40s. They also do a good job making Pitt look a very young teenaged guy. Besides the facial effects the cinematography and sets in this movie were amazing. They really helped give the movie a strong sense of atmosphere. I also liked how the lighting changes as the mood of the film changes.Besides the acting, cinematography, lighting, and special effects, I really didn't care much for the storytelling. The story was interesting but it got very dull after Benjamin goes from being an old man to a middle-aged man. After that the story got boring and the movie became tedious. The movie takes way too long to tell its story, and also takes it way too slow during certain scenes that I found no interest in. Benjamin begins having an affair with a married woman (Tilda Swinton) at one point, which takes way too long. This segment was completely pointless in my opinion, and really didn't help movie the story in any way. The love between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett was a major part of the story, but as it went on you knew from the beginning that it would only end badly. I thought this would really enrich the film and help give it a great, tragic ending. I was completely wrong. The movie ends very stupidly and in the worst possible way. I sat through over two and a half hours for an ending like this (I won't spoil it)! I know the story could really only end one way, but there were plenty of storytelling techniques that could have made the ending better and more satisfying.In the end I enjoyed the acting, characters, cinematography, and strong visual effects. But the storytelling is what really turned me away from the film. The storytelling is too bland, boring, and uninteresting. For a movie that is over two and a half hours that's a really bad thing. The visual effects make the film memorable, and the story is good, but without a way to interest the viewer then what's the point? The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ends up very unsatisfying and anti-climactic, and it was plain disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie thinking one thing, and came out thinking another. I went in thinking, OK, so this is too long and it will be pretentious and Cate Blanchett is going to be the best thing about it. I came out thinking it's just right, it's both engaging and touching, and Brad Pitt is the best thing about it. By a long shot. I never thought Cate Blanchett could get on my nerves, but she does. Her performance as a young dancer bursting with energy is, predictably, easy on the eye, but downright irritating where personality is concerned. As a dying widower looking back on her wasted life, her mannerism is nearly impossible to stand. Brad Pitt, on the other hand, totally pulls it off as a guy who's different from everybody else (he's aging backwards), yet tries to make the best of it. What really moved me is how he doesn't try to outsmart Fitzgerald, Fincher, or even the audience. His character cannot explain his condition, but he isn't as baffled by it as everybody else, simply because he's had it all his life. Throw in the the killer looks of Pitt in his prime, and you've got everyone's attention. Very nice work by costume designer Jaqueline West for making him look so good, especially in his post-war outfits and as a high-fashion hobo exploring the far east on his Royal Enfield motorcycle. Fine guest appearances by quirky Tilda Swinton and gorgeous Julia Ormond. - "Benjamin Button" is so old-fashioned, it looks brand new. Perhaps that sort of sums up David Fincher's art? As the great Welsh songwriter Frank Hennessy once put it: Old men and children understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming and pretty as a postcard when Fincher goes Disney... but awfully conventional and bland!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Fincher almost goes Disney in this crowd-pleasing fairy tale, pretty as a postcard, of the life of the title character (Pitt), a man born in 1918 New Orleans with a most curious condition - he ages in reverse... Charming, aiming-to-be-epic-(and for the Oscars), but awfully conventional picture considering its main idea (and yes, its "Forrest Gump"- comparisons are sometimes quite validated) whose flame burns most intensely in Button's tug-boat period and its moving final minutes, which leaves its main bulk - the love story with Blanchett - mostly bland, sentimental and protracted, which certainly can't be the purpose... and there's no reason for it to be as long as it is. And albeit a fantasy - with a hero that never changes a facial expression, and characters who never ever question his condition - it never goes to the complex emotional depths it could have. If this is team Fincher/Pitt to come, I prefer them so much more when going hardcore a' la "Se7en" and "Fight club"! Very impressive special/make-up effects in Button's early years, though. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Oscar nominations. I heard the hype. Maybe I had too high hopes. I am sure from a artistic perspective it was a great movie, but I kept getting that ol' English Patient feeling. It was a long, long movie, with periods where very little happened. And maybe I am just too little versed in the arts department, but Brad Pitt's performance was left me cold. I might be comparing this film at some level with Forrest Gump, which might be a mistake. If there could be any comparison though, Benjamin would be a bad attempt at similar character growth and narrative. I got bored, and felt that the deeper sentiments did not make up for the attempts at being epic or inventive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie. A very good movie. But not the 83rd best movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't go to movies in the theatre very often anymore. I have a nice big-screen TV and DVD player and most of the time I watch movies like that.So when I do go to the theatre I try to make sure it's a very good movie. The IMDb is a big part of that, I have found generally the IMDb median rating for a movie is a dependable indicator of whether I will like it or not.So I pulled a list of movies playing at the local theatre and fed them into IMDb. Gran Torino and Benjamin Button both had very, very high ratings. Benjamin Button was slightly higher ... and it really needed to be, as I saw it was nearly three hours long. At the time it was something like the #78 highest rated movie of all time in IMDb.I didn't even know very clearly what it was about, but to me it doesn't matter, either a movie is good or bad, whatever genre it's in.So I chose Benjamin Button. I had very high expectations for it, I was really expecting to see a movie that deserved to be rated the 78th (currently 83rd) best movie ever made.There is nothing I think is -bad- about it. The acting is all good, the story is engaging. The movie did draw me in emotionally at times.But there was just nothing stunningly good about it. I can't think of a scene that struck me as being a GREAT scene, a scene that really moved me or amazed me or touched me.Overall I thought the characters were good. Good, not great. The device of having him aging backwards worked, I thought, personally. I'm still not sure why, but there was something touching about watching him grow ever younger, especially as a part of the love affair which was the center of the movie. (And some of my favorite scenes were the ones in the beginning with Benjamin as a very young old man ... to me that was very humorous.) Watching the young/old Benjamin fall in love with the young Daisy was kind of wonderfully strange and touching. (Although, as another reviewer here pointed out, there was also something vaguely creepy about that, in a sort of vaguely pedophilic way.) To me it was all GOOD. Very good, quite possibly.But I could never really call any of it GREAT. I mean if there is somebody reading this who, like me before I saw it, is trying to decide whether to see this movie or not, that's my conclusion. If you want to see a good movie, watch it. But if you really want to see a stunning, great movie, I don't think Benjamin Button is there.I've said i don't think it's great, but I haven't really said much about why.After I saw the movie I looked through other people's IMDb reviews and I found one which I thought hit the nail on the nail.I don't think there is a way to link directly to an IMDb review but it was posted on 15 December 2008 and the title is "Fine-looking and well acted, but ultimately flat".In a lot of ways I would like to just point at that review and say "I agree".As that reviewer says, Benjamin himself is basically a very emotionally flat character. And he's utterly the heart of the movie, so as a result the movie is very unengaging. Because Benjamin has no evident emotions, one doesn't care about what happens to him.Which is such a waste when you have Brad Pitt as an actor. I think it's a shame that Pitt has not, like Johnny Depp, insisted on roles that would give him a chance to show what he can do, because I just can't believe that somebody who could do what he did in Twelve Monkeys is not capable of genius work. But definitely, Pitt is great when he can stretch out and be wild. Exactly the opposite of Benjamin Button.For what it's worth, I can understand a lot of why the character is the way it is. I mean I'm not going to sit here and say the film-maker is an idiot, I think I get what he was going for.TCCOBB is, I think, intended to be a lot like Forrest Gump. Not so much a movie about the character as about the times in which he lived.So I think Benjamin is so neutral because he's supposed to be a neutral, Forrest Gump-style observer. He's watching the times go by, and we are watching them through his eyes.But the thing is, while I can see the logic of it, the fact remains that we wind up with an emotionally dead, unengaging movie.But unlike FG, I don't think TCCOBB does all that great a job of making me feel like I am living through the times Benjamin is living through.Most of the scenes feel, to me, like they could be transplanted to modern times without anything being lost.One thing I will say in favor of the film on that point though, I loved their choices of period music. There was one moment in a restaurant during which a Stephane Grappeli/Django Reinhardt tune plays, set in the 30s I think, which I particularly liked. And the Beatles on TV.But it did not do a great job of capturing a feeling of the times.And in trying to do so, it sacrificed emotional engagement.A good movie, but in my opinion, far from a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This odd story of a man who lives his life in reverse (i. e. from old age to babyhood) is told in a such natural way that we accept it as real. The movie is about the dichotomy between life and death, youth and old age, present and past, time and space, comedy and drama. The images are beautiful, the sound track music is wonderful and the characters move themselves, behave and talk with great delicacy and fineness in an almost poetical universe making us feel the huge drama hidden inside it. It also passes the message that love is such a powerful feeling that it can overcome all contrarieties and fatalities. All the players do a marvellous job making us feel intensively their dramatic roles. As outstanding we can mention Brad Pitt (Benjamin), Cate Blanchett (Daisy), Taraji P. Henson (Queenie) and Jared Harris (Captain Mike). This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the last ten years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the F. Scott Fitzgerald literary piece that serves as the basis for this film but the idea is extremely interesting, and the clock by Mr Gateau that runs counter clockwise is a wonderful figment of the imagination that sets the whimsical tone for the whole exercise. David Fincher's direction comes across as very sound. There is no doubt he is one of the most competent directors around, especially from a technical viewpoint. He keeps continuity fluid, he extracts a superb performance from Brad Pitt and a delicately enticing one from Blanchett, and the photography is gorgeous, including memorable sunsets, Blanchett dancing against the skyline, winter shots and pleasing compositions throughout. The attention to period detail is most impressive, filmed with loving memory and care, down to the flickering pictures of the late 19th century.It is, however, the way that the film conveys the inflexible vagaries of time that impresses me most. With it stems the realization that the oft-stated wish that one should not get old certainly could do without the alternative of getting younger on the outside only. Sadly, all the cosmetic surgery of the current age appears to seek that very goal but, though great to look at, Brad and Kate are definitely worthy human beings capable of love for each other and for mankind. There is nothing cosmetic about their feelings and values but perhaps one flaw is that Fincher needlessly adds 20 or so minutes emphasizing Brad's youthful good looks in particular, and perhaps the scene of Blanchett's accident could do with a little bit less repetitive explaining of the inexorability of fate. That said, I see those as minor foibles.Benjamin Button brings to mind the figure of Forrest Gump as he wanders through the box of chocolates of life -- but he emerges as infinitely more intelligent and perceptive. There is something Christ-like about Benjamin that adds to the subtly religious experience the film offers going back to the pastor that gets Benjamin walking, the passing of the piano teacher, and the chanting at Queenie's funeral.Curiously, as Benjamin Button's brain begins to age and become erratic and forgetful I was also reminded of Hal, the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, as his memory bank was dissembled; and Benjamin's last shot as a newborn but perishing baby brought to mind the starchild at the end of the Kubrick film.All told, I liked it very much. The fact that it made my brain tick, that it ushered in so many possibilities, and that it has stayed with me pleases me no end. It stands as a rare item in this age of mass production and bended knee to technology. I hope it does well at the box office and receives the plaudits it deserves from critics, the Academy and the rest of it. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it takes an unrealistic situation to paint a very realistic picture. For me, the most realistic movie depicting people in love is "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", while the situation (people having their minds wiped clean of an ex) is very unrealistic, it shows very realistically what love does to people. Now this movie, although being very unrealistic at it's core, shows what it is like to lose people, deal with life and death, an trying to find a place very realistically. It depicts human relationships very well, and is very touching at points, it made me feel sad at points, angry at others, and overjoyed for characters during times of well being.The acting in the movie is top notch, starting with Brad Pitt, he is believable as a man in such a peculiar situation. Blanchett is great and all the minor characters are perfectly cast.Overall, TCCOBB is a great film, one to be cherished, and I think different people will get different feelings from it but overall it is a modern epic and deserves a spot in the best of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impeccable acting with flawless film-making quality...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the movies I have seen, I can sum them up in a few words. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is one of those couple of films that I can't explain real well. If any word can define it, I would use the word unique, for everything in this movie is. Plot wise, the film is a romance story, similar to "Titanic" in the aspect that it is told through flashback from a dying old lady named Daisy (Cate Blanchett wonderfully disguised in make up and with a fluent Southern accent) to her daughter (Julia Ormond) about her long lost love. Even though she tells the story, Brad Pitt narrates it and like Cate, he has a fluent Southern accent that he pulls off magnificently. I won't bother in giving the rest of the story since the movie trailers nail it down very well, but that doesn't give it the excuse not see it.When I think the movie would end, it continues. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary it makes the movie unique. For a film that is almost three hours long, I was engulfed by it from start to finish. I will admit though there were times when I had to adjust my seating position.Most of the romance films I have seen are great because of the chemistry between the male and female roles. This movie definitely has that, particularly on Brad Pitt's side. I'm not a huge Brad fan but I loved his powerful work in this film. People have criticized his character as a protagonist who doesn't do much and lets things pass him by rather than taking advantage of the moment, particularly in a scene where he has a chance to sweep Daisy off her feet but fails to do it.I personally liked this about his character. He's a different kind of protagonist; he's passive, shy, yet humble and nice, often not sure how to react in certain situations when things are at stake. To me, that makes him all the more believable. What's also nice about this film is that Brad and Cate don't steal the show like Gosling and McAdams did in "The Notebook." For a long movie, it's not all about them, there's breathing room for other characters to develop and enter the lives of the two leading roles. All of the actors, even Julia Ormond, who's only in the film for maybe fifteen minutes, add diligence to their performances. Besides the acting, the technical aspects of the film were amazing. It was well photographed, edited, scored, and directed. The one thing I couldn't help but notice though in this film was that often, in wide shots of objects, such as people would be blurred like a 1920s/1930s movie. I don't know if this was the cinematographer's/director's intention or if this was the fault of the film projection at the theater I was in. In any case, this added an authenticity to the time period that film took place in. David Fincher, (who I can't help but admire his work for "Fight Club") was the perfect choice for this film as the director. He uses so many different techniques that capture the film amazingly. I was particularly captivated by the long tracking shot he uses in a scene where a WWI battle unfolds. It is captivating to watch, especially when it all happens backwards, literally. I also enjoyed the visual effects used in the film. It may seem that there aren't many, but believe me, there is and they are all subtle, like in "Forrest Gump". They are there but you can't notice them because they're that good. There is also some excellent costume and set- designs throughout the film, adding more to the authenticity of the time period, and the make up design, a definite Oscar there. It not only transformed Pitt and Blanchett into old people, but it made them become their characters. I have not seen such good make up since "The Elephant Man."Despite the amazing acting and flawless film-making quality, I felt the story could have been much more. It was interesting that Benjamin was raised by a black family, (who ran an old folks home), yet there was no racism. In addition, when Ben was a kid, there was never a scene in which he tried to befriend other boys, just Daisy when he was eleven (even though an old man). I also did not understand some of the symbolism that was used throughout the film. Overall, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a unique, yet marvelous film that is a definite contender for the Oscars coming up in February. I don't give too many 10s, so I give this 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Pun Film Review of Benjamin Button!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I turned 40 this past summer, I was craving that some unexplained cosmic phenomenon would cause me to be positively inflicted with a severe curious case of Benjamin-Buttonitis. Is there a remote chance that I might be celebrating my 39th Birthday next summer? Probably not! The premise of laboring a film about a man who ages backwards is undoubtedly a very intriguing one. Director David Fincher has fulfilled our curiosity with that by helming "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin Button, an extraordinary man who is born old and gets younger with time. Benji is raised by two kids who love their pet! Oops! Wrong Benji movie! Benjamin is raised by Queenie, a black woman who is a caregiver at a senior citizens home in New Orleans. However, things get kind of old for Benjamin with time. Therefore, he embarks on a voyage in the high seas as he gets younger and restless. Benjamin then meets Elizabeth Abbott, a bored married woman who finds his lifeline case very intriguing and falls for the younger (or older) Benjamin! I am confused!!!! I she "cougaring" him or not? That relationship turns out to be a short term one! Abbott eventually became the first woman to swim the English Channel. Benjamin's true buttoned-down love is for Daisy. Ben meets Daisy as a child while he is an old man; and as time progresses, he gets younger, she gets older, and they meet in the middle. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" does have some similar themes as "Forrest Gump" but Button's case is more extraordinaire than Gump's; but Gump goes through more outlandish life experiences than Button. Although, hands down, I take the Button deal more than the Gump one anytime. In any sense, the film is primarily Benjamin and Daisy's undying love story. Pitt's timeless performance was very commendable and will grow fonder with age! Cate Blanchett was once again impressive as Daisy, and she continues to gel nicely with Pitt in the screen chemistry department; they played a bickering married couple in 2006's "Babel". Taraji P. Henson charmed us with her maternal Queenie portrayal, and Tilda Swinton was all about the abbott with her swimmingly winning work as Elizabeth Abbott. Pitt's makeup jobs as the young-in-age geriatric Button (smell a massive oxymoron there) was nothing short of phenomenal! I also commend the Art Directors and Cinematographers for their challenging case of Benjamin Button's picturesque appearance. There has been a curious case sometime now in Hollywood on why the acclaimed David Fincher has never been nominated for a Best Director Academy Award. I think that case will be solved once he receives his well-deserved Oscar nomination for his visually-enlightening cinematic architecture of "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". My only age issue with the film was the time itself! It was 30 minutes too long for me, I felt like a year older (or younger, depending if I had Buttonitis or not) at the end of the film. Another minor gripe I had with the Button flick was with Eric Roth's humdrum screenplay; it looked like a copyright infringement of his own 'Forrest Grump" screenplay. Roth should sue himself! Nonetheless, I am still highly recommending for the old and the young to check out "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". **** Good</fullReview>

And when the story started I was interested in it from the beginning. The theme seamed a bit familiar to me but I still can't remember from where exactly. I loved the movie. The story, the love between Benjamin and Daisy, the way he left so that his daughter could have a normal life.. It's a wonderful story about an extraordinary man and his one true love and life. The only remark I do have is about that scene when he comes back when his daughter is 12 years old. Then Daisy comes to his hotel room and they sleep together. She older than him for the first time. But the scene could have been better, they could have been lying together in a bed for a few moments before she started to dress herself. This way, it all seemed a bit cold, and the whole story is so warm, the characters are great and I just didn't like this scene all that much. Anyway, I think the movie is wonderful and I advise everyone to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertains while being surprisingly relevant and unshallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments" is the exacting tagline of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and while the fantastic story of a man that ages backwards (the titular character played by Brad Pitt) is hard to swallow, it entertains while being surprisingly relevant and unshallow.The versatile David Fincher, who also directed Pitt in Fight Club and Se7en, made Benjamin Button as lengthy as his other fab film Zodiac, but he keeps you occupied with the sumptuous visual design and smoothly executed special effects that don't steal the characters' thunder. After all, it's the cast that not only assured box-office draw but also made sure that you are emotionally engaged.It's difficult not to feel for each one of them. As his life is played all throughout, you will share in Benjamin's curiosity and innocence. You will feel the frustration, heartbreak and devotion of his lifelong love Daisy (played by the marvelously chameleonic Cate Blanchett). Julia Ormond's thespic skills didn't seem necessary though as Daisy's daughter Caroline, but Taraji P. Henson deserves a best supporting actress nod for her moving portrayal as Queenie. Also praiseworthy is Tilda Swinton's short but impactful performance as Benjamin's first lover Elizabeth.You will watch it for the commercial appeal but you will come out of the theater hopefully more aware and grateful for each moment you have with your loved ones. At least that's what you should take home with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie just because I heard that the visual effects were stunning. I watched it on a tiny movie screen on my computer. I watched it in segments on different days. And you know what? I was still in tears at the end.I completely forgot about the visual effects, forgot about how that it's THE Brad Pitt playing Benjamin. This movie had a multitude of messages that can be debated and discussed. It's heartfelt and at the end of a day, a very good movie.However people praise it, it was not a flawless movie. Like a crippled old man, the beginning is slow and at times monotonous. The younger Benjamin was, the better the movie became. Placed alongside films like Forrest Gump, I would definitely recommend Forrest Gump.Nonetheless, I really recommend this movie to people who like to be touched or moved by movies. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, if I enjoyed it even on a tiny computer screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at a premier on Friday and although it was 3 hours long I enjoyed it immensely. The premise of the story is of course unbelievable but the way Fincher carries it off is so believable that one forgets. Both Pitt and Blanchett perform their roles to perfection and Tilda Swindon gave a wonderful performance as well. The cinematography is just what I expect from Fincher and altogether the film is very well done. If you go with reasonable expectations you will definitely get your money's worth. It will surprise me if the film doesn't win an Oscar for something. My only reservation is that Benjamin Button somehow does not really confront his handicap as would be expected from such a dire situation and the audience is not given any insight into his troubled psyche.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not perfect but still an amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this film was a wonderful experience. David Fincher's eye for detail and ability to (almost) seamlessly blend computer imagery with live action added a realistic feel to the time periods used. Subtle bits of humour throughout the serious story also helped the time pass by without dragging (did i tell you i've been struck by lightning 7 times?). Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's performances were sensational along with the rest of the cast. Quibbles are small... but lessen what should have been a perfect film (spoilers ahead but, hopefully still vague enough not to ruin plot points). I don't understand why, in reading the diary, Daisy's daughter reads of her mother's (then) pregnancy but doesn't react immediately (like... was that me? or.. did i have a sibling?). it's several passages before she realises that the child of the pregnancy was her... and then the reading changes from being third person to second (for a while). the hummingbird was beautiful after appearing at a sea death but when Benjamin finally gets old (young) and dies it appears again... like a watchful spirit perhaps? if so, why is it the only watchful spirit? he had several deep relationships and those characters should also have appeared in some form or another. The dubbing of Elle fanning's daisy was almost as obvious as Glenn close dubbing Andy McDowell in Greystoke. But, as i said... minor quibbles. The film is fantastic and should be seen by all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from watching this with myself and a few friends as the second of six movies I was seeing for my birthday (This follows the Disney film "Bedtime Stories") and I was amazed at the skill and heart put into the film.First of all, this is based of the incredible short story of the same name written by F. Scott Fitsgerald written in the 1920's and the movie follows his words so well and makes them into one of the finest movies (I would say it was in the top 10) of the year and possible the decade. All the actors are fantastic and seem to know just how much needed to be put into the film, and no one goes to far like in some of the other dramas I have been watching recently.Anyway Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett a great parts of this movie and without them I think it would be hard to think of anyone else who could play them like the did. They share a great on screen presence and I would certainly like if they teamed up again in a future picture.The storyline is a big one, they all take defining moments of ones life and what one can expect to go through in life and really look at this through the eyes of another, who, by chance cant witness things like he would want to.Overall, this is a fantastic film and I will definitely watch it again. If you have not seen it by now you should plan to see it as soon as you can. It is a beautifully written, directed, acted and thought out film. I rate it 84%.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Tale Courtesy of Mr. Fincher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS.At this point David Fincher has established himself as one of the most talented directors out there, with films such as Fight Club, Se7en and Zodiac earning him a great deal of respect from film critics and fans alike. An admirable part of Fincher's films is that they put more of a focus on the story and characters along with the narrative and cinematography revolving around them. This, along with various aspects to his other films has helped solidify him as an ideal inspiration for aspiring film makers. I recently got the opportunity to see his latest offering, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, which I was very interested in seeing since I saw the first trailer. After sitting through this near three hour film I can safely say that this is my new favorite Fincher film.Obviously what drew me to this film was the catch to the story: how the main character ages backwards. My interest in this wasn't so much to see Button's character go through a reverse aging, but more to see how things unfolded around him as he physically became younger. Thankfully for me, a lot happened during the film, whether it centered on Button or simply involved him. Given that the film has a fairly lengthy runtime, I was glad to see that there were a fair number of changes in the setting of the film.This brings me to perhaps the most surprising aspect of the film for me. A film can very easily win me over with beautiful sceneries, and I also have a soft spot for movies that take place during the 50's or any period preceding that point. Since a good portion of the film takes place around the 40's to the 70's I was automatically engrossed. There were also points in the film when the scenery (the winter night outside when Button's having an affair with Elizabeth, the sunrise at the dock with his father and the ship passing his captain's tugboat to name a few), these were the parts that I felt I had left the theater and entered the film.The story, which mostly centers around Button, is one of several stories that works well thanks to the narrative. Parts of the film are narrated by Button's daughter as they transition to Button's voice narrating. The film is told in flashback which doesn't necessarily hurt the film, but I would've preferred a little less emphasis on the present scenario. Brad Pitt, an actor who I've never been particularly fond of, manages to do well with what he's given. Cate Blanchett, an actress who I've held similar regards to managed to do about as solid as Pitt. This is to say I liked their characters in the film, but it didn't change my perspective on them, which is about as much of a compliment as I could likely give either of them.I'd actually have to say the side characters seemed to have a stronger screen presence than Pitt and Blanchett. While this isn't a common aspect to most films, I do like it when the "next-in-line" characters get their fair share; it helps make the film feel better-rounded. The film is very character and narrative-driven, similar to movies like Forrest Gump and American Beauty. And like those films, Benjamin Button does an excellent job in both aspects, helping it unfold into a great story not so much for the events themselves, but what the characters themselves go through due to these occurrences.One part I was very curious was to see how things would wrap up around Button and what would happen during his last moments. The last few minutes and thus, the actual ending to the film was the most powerful part of the movie for me. Just the thought of how Button forgot about his life and died as if just born was a very shattering scene for me to watch and as a result, this became one of the few films to actually bring tears to my eyes. Not remembering your life, not even a single part of your memory, is something that really got to me in this film.Other than a slightly shaky narrative in brief parts and a couple moments that drag on, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button proves to be a very valiant and worthwhile viewing. If you're like me and you love films that have memorable settings and places the characters on center stage then you should have no trouble falling in love with this film. With the exception of The Dark Knight and possibly WALL-E, there aren't any other films released this year that I could put in the same league as this latest effort by Mr. Fincher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously compelling cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not intend to watch this flick, at least on the big screen. Why? The premise seemed a bit absurd.Well, I had family over for the holiday and they all wanted to go see it. So, off we went.I have to hand it to Brad Pitt. He excelled. Cate Blanchett did, too (as always expected). There are numerous other outstanding contributions, including the oddly compelling and mesmerizing Tilda Swinton.To an unsurprisingly large extent, this is a Forrest Gumpish movie, but its abundantly poignant moments are different enough to stand on their own. One can't help but get a sense that Eric Roth tenderly loves the South. To his credit, he weaves this story without resorting to excessive glossing and exaggerated stereotype.To enjoy this film to its fullest, the viewer must suspend disbelief. Doing so is easy once it gets moving. So, relax and pay close attention. Oh, and be sure to take a leak right before taking your seat as the whole shebang (trailers and all) will consume about 3 hours of your life.</fullReview>

My breath has been taken away, thats all I can say.Going away is so hard and Benjamin hit it head on with his emotions. Goodbyes are hard and it seems that is all I am doing. This movie is truly a gift. Please share it with the ones you love.I will admit that this is not a perfect movie, I do feel the ending left a little to be more to hope for. And I do feel the last 45min could have been condensed.But again, just a gift that has left me gasping for words to describe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only there was a way to have someone else empty your bladder so that you didn't have to take your eyes off the screen.This movie is very long, and I, for one, wished the above statement a number of times. In the end I was glad I held on, because I would have hated to have missed the countless beautiful moments that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button lays out for its audience, one after the other.The characters were the clear highlight of this film. I can't think of another film packed with so many likable characters. The two main characters, Benjamin and Daisy, are obviously wonderful, however it is the beautiful mosaic of supporting characters around them that makes the film extraordinary. There wasn't a single one I didn't like, even though every character was flawed and human. It's a very refreshing film for this reason. How many other films show the whole human race as lovable? Despite such positively portrayed characters, the predominant feeling in the film is sadness - but don't let that get you down. It's sadness of the grief variety, not the depressing variety. It's sadness that the film helps you express, and thus releases you from. Grief is beautiful - it is the hole that is left when love is uprooted, and it is the best way to appreciate the love, the beauty, that came before. These are the moments I didn't want to miss - the film expressed pain as a way of framing love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was heartbreakingly awesome. It was a long movie and it did have slow moments, but this movie was amazing. I loved how it was done (which is why it had to be long) and I wouldn't change a moment of it. From early on in Benjamin's story you really feel for his character I can't imagine a single person who couldn't relate to something he experienced, even if it were for completely different reasons. This was so wonderfully different from anything I've seen in a long long time it was a complete reinvention of the lemonade theory. Taking something terrible about life and turning it around in a mess of adventure it certainly puts a unique cap on life and offers a completely different perspective. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.Also the make up and the costumes were insanely awesome. Every detail was on point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Passage of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the traditional concrete story but rather an amalgam of experiences at random but defining stages of age.We all know the plot (a man born physically old and matures physically backwards to youth), yet it is interesting to see old man buttons acting and interacting with the sensibility of a child and progressing towards mental maturity contrasting with his reverse physical development.That is really all there is; aspects of a man's life climaxing in the "meeting in the middle" with his soul mate that he met in childhood. There is nothing extraordinary about him (besides the obvious reverse aging), no adversity to be overcome, no battles to be fought no achievement strived for nor was there any heavy drama yet the story is still so profound and compelling since it is about the most grand, universal themes, which is the passage of time, age, aging and change. The nostalgic aura of these themes and the steady pace create a mesmerizing, mellow mood that allow us, as we slowly witness Buttons' interesting progression, to simultaneously internalize these themes to our own life.This well made movie due to the state of the art make up and special effects that miraculously transform these appealing good actors into different ages, more so than has ever been done before, along with the well imagined love story, also partly as a result of the appealing good actors, overshadow the minor weaknesses. The failure to truly encase us in the various time periods and the simple/easy way out for making Buttons as an aged but visibly youthful child gives the impression that the creators got a little lazy, however, it is mere nitpicking to point out these weaknesses as the evocative mood we feel and the grand themes remain unaltered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While flawed in terms of the writing and length, much of Benjamin Button works.It gives one a set of scenes that linger in the memory. It also provides a new way of looking at one's life. One can see all the holes and see all the tricks of technology, but it seems to cut through things. For this viewer, it may be sets of resonances of the major actors in earlier roles---Pitt in Legends of the Fall and A River Runs Through It and Cate Blanchett in the brief but powerful role she had as Galadrial in Lord of the Rings. Or it may be the way certain moments and ideas resonate in ones own mind. The truths are simple, but resonate. Is this a Buddhist fable of the power of impermanence--I think so and because of that, for this individual, this long, long long film works regardless of its very real and very deep set of flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Enchanting Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is, in every sense of the word, a devastatingly beautiful epic. Inspired by the F. Scott Fitzgerald story and brought to life by the masterful David Fincher, this majestic tale of a man who travels through life aging backwards strikes a special note. With a hint of wonderment and magic, 'Benjamin Button' quietly becomes one of the year's best films. A bizarre but entrancing look at life, death, and everything in between.The beauty of 'Benjamin Button' is far-reaching. Technically, it's practically flawless. Fincher has constructed a film so visually arresting and aesthetically pleasing. The film leaps from the screen like a vivid, colorful dream. It takes us on a journey through time, understood through the eyes of a man who was born under rather extraordinary circumstances. Despite his curious nature, Benjamin is not a hero. His uniqueness does not offer any groundbreaking insights into the gift of life. He is, like you and me, an imperfect being. Living life the best way he knows how, head-on. Quite literally, actually.Though the film tops nearly three hours, 'Benjamin Button' feels anything but. Though it builds gradually, Fincher's ability to tell a story is like few others. With an excellent pace, this sprawling ode to life will captivate you even if you have to sit in the very front row of a sold-out theater. Glued to your seat, you'll simply stare in wonder at this beautiful picture. As it progresses, the life of Benjamin Button sweeps us off our feet as we follow him around the world. Never staying anywhere for too long, but always touched by individuals walking - sometimes swimming - on their own path of life.If there's one aspect of 'Benjamin Button' that keeps it from being a heartfelt masterpiece, it's that it does come off cold and distant at times. It's hard to say why, but it's as if we're only allowed to watch at arm's length. It may just be that Fincher has never dared to tackle a film of this magnitude. Like so many, he may still be learning. But one thing is certain, the film never manages to be anything less than richly enchanting and wonderfully told. Adapted for the screen by Eric Roth, 'Button' never falls victim to melodrama, which may have very well rendered this picture as one hot mess. And if you find the resemblance to 'Forest Gump' striking, Roth also wrote the script for that sprawling journey, but remember that Fitzgerald penned his short story back in 1921.Every performance found here is, of course, fantastic. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of the career, a challenging and thought-provoking role. His transformation throughout the film is so well-done and convincing. Cate Blanchett is beautifully cast, and though her character is not always likable, her involvement benefits the film greatly. The performance, however, doesn't come from either of these two leads. Taraji P. Henson, who plays the woman who raises Benjamin as his own, delivers a strikingly passionate performance that's profoundly touching.Ultimately, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' comes full circle to transcend convention and rises as a lyrical celebration of life. It leaves us with a touching and - finally - emotional exitlude. It affirms imperfect nature of us all, the individual quirks that make us who we are. It confronts death, not as the enemy, but so we appreciate how important those people were to us. We're told that it's never too late to be who we were meant to be. If we're not happy, start over. If we fail, try again. Life is what you make of it, the choices you make and what you choose to do with the time that's been given. Live with no regrets, and embrace the magic and of it all.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First thing-this is a lengthy movie, but well sitting through. Brad Pitt is his fabulous self and it is amazing to watch how he changes throughout the movie. Cate Blanchett is terrific also-absolutely beautiful. It did not take me long to find that this film is similar to Forrest Gump-the friendship with a drinking sea captain, parallels with historical events, changing the main character from one unable to walk to one who runs, injections of humor. But still there are some new wonderful messages embedded in this film--life is always subject to change, yet some things never change. Some things we cannot avoid--we are subject to random acts of others affecting our lives. Life is short-sooner than we think we are unable to do what we could when we were young. Older people are fabulously interesting and we can learn so much from them. There are some questionable plot details which take up considerable time-but nonetheless I found the film worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a magical film with performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson that light up the screen with a story that never seems almost three hours long, but one in which you never want the film to end. I have never seen Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look more beautiful, as they both give a wondrous luxe look to their characters that make them seem almost "ageless". The sets, the supporting cast, the technical aspects of the production, all add up to a story and film that make you say, "Oscar!" The last time I saw Pitt and Blanchett was in BABEL, and there is a great chemistry between these two actors that jumps off the screen in BENJAMIN BUTTON. The way the story is told and the introduction of the film in the beginning scenes so beautifully set up the journey of the characters that follows. And, the fact that love takes no face, nor color, to make one say, "you're my mother", is one that shall stay with me forever. BUTTON is a film you want to go back to see, to cherish the tenderness of scenes of old and young, black and white, living, and dying, together as family. Magical is the only word that I can describe is the ride the audience takes during their time with BENJAMIN BUTTON.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of what one gets out of a movie has to do with their expectations going in, and I had read a lot about this movie when going into it. Turns out I think critics, especially negative critics like Roger Ebert, are taking this thing a bit too seriously. What we have here is a warm American fantasy, a magical-realism story of aging both inoffensive in its worldview and unpretentious in its approach. Everyone else is either calling it genius or stupid, and I don't know why. I'd rather just enjoy it for what it is.Lots of names connected to this one, and lots of reading into the movie for them. Here's a recommendation: forget David Fincher. He's a good, visual director, but this movie shares little of his nihilistic sense of humor found in movies like Se7en, Fight Club, and Alien 3. Forget F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose work is much more about the social spectrum and whose original short story was much more satirical in nature. Instead, remember Eric Roth, the screenwriter of Forrest Gump, because that is much more akin to this film--in fact, they share roughly the same structure, with some minor adjustments for a new malady. I'm not complaining, either, because I happen to like Forrest Gump for what it is and this movie had a lot of the same pathos, which made it heartwarming without being trite.Sure, it's not perfect... besides the anachronism of the backward-aging conceit, there's a few anachronisms in the general layout, and history buffs will probably find a lot to nitpick in it. Whatever. It was a fun movie with only that slight unfortunate tendency to believe that everything that happened before 1950 was tinted yellow and brown (why do filmmakers insist on doing that?!?!). There's been a lot of Oscar murmurings and grumblings about this, but frankly I don't really see it. Brad Pitt, for instance, does a great job as an old guy but as soon as he hits roughly his own age, it's all being Brad Pitt from there on out--you can sense the palpable shift in character and worldview from innocent underaged old-man to knowing-he's-a-sex-bomb Pitt re-enacting Brando's Wild One in small asides. The first half of the film feels very different from the second half, though that's not really a bad thing because a lot of things change throughout the film and the perspective is intentionally one of them.I thought it was finely crafted in terms of time and motivation of the characters, and I liked the small details such as the grave without writing on it (because he couldn't remember what the name was). The love story is disappointing if you're expecting the usual formula in two star-crossed lovers who somehow get pulled apart and have to find their way back together, because that happens by the time the movie is halfway done; but it's not disappointing if you're expecting a variant of it. Again, remember Forrest Gump.This movie seems destined to be overrated with subsequent backlash, which is really unfortunate for what it is. It's a compelling tale worthy of escapism and the pathos it generates, that somehow people insist on believing is some Big Art that should win Oscars and Be Immortalized--which basically means that a year from now you'll be hearing all sorts of sass from people who believe that they were too smart for it when it came out, even though they're singing its praises today. I hate it when that happens to a good movie like this one.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

The film starts off feeling a bit like a cross between Forest Gump and Big Fish but then moves into a class of its own. The only thing spoiling the film is the length, at nearly 3 hours it might drain your resolve but watch the end and you'll be duly rewarded. This definitely Oscar material. If it doesn't win something, even best makeup or visual effects you should feel robbed. Compared to some previous films that have done well this is well above the rest.

		<fullReview>A wonderful movie about love, life and death. This is the Forrest Gump of this decade. This is no Fight Club or Seven. This is totally outside Fincher's usual genre.Pitt and Fincher are back together again. Which is where the two's best work seems to emerge from. Not since Fight Club has Brad Pitt shined so much. The only movie that Pitt was good in since Fight Club is The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.The acting was great like it always is in Finchers movies. Brad Pitt was great as Benjamin Button, a confused man who is aging backwards. Cate Blancett gave a grade A performance as Daisy a girl who becomes friends with Benjamin.I recommend it. It was a great movie to end the year with. This definitely deserves a few awards(especially for make up)It is worth seeing and i can't wait to see Fincher and Pitt reunite to make another great movie. HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly a sweeping, aiming-for-grand tale of a man's life and times. The script brings together romance, heartbreak, humanity, the small touches of drama in everyday life that make it so affecting. Ultimately, though, it gets a bit treacly and predictable, and other than Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett's performances, I don't get the award buzz.Brad Pitt really does deserve credit here: He doesn't mug and he doesn't preen, even when it would be so easy to do so. His affectations, especially when he's young of age and old of body, are nearly perfect. Kate Blanchett likewise pulls off a lifetime of nice moments, even if the dying woman seemed a bit forced at times.In some ways, this movie reminded me of "Atonement." Broad, sweeping, romantic, human... and then, predictable, melodramatic and sappy. Both had wonderful production values; costumes, settings, props, sound, all were top-notch.Both also had hunky actors and lovely ladies, though I did find myself torn about whether I would have preferred James McAvoy to Brad Pitt: McAvoy has those dreamy blue eyes, but I suspect this part required the fullness as a man and an actor that Pitt has.As far as treacly, I really did not need the story-telling framework of the two characters in the hospital. It added a layer that felt forced and cheap -- without character development, I did not care about the daughter.This movie would be a wonderful choice for those in need of a good cry. It is appropriately bittersweet and loving. And I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it -- it was much much better than "Atonement," which I felt cheated for having sat through, ultimately.This film was worth seeing, and it definitely made me want to read the short story. But it was just so... usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the movie very different and that's the only way I can describe it (I mean it in a good sense). The idea was fresh and new, not based on the usual movie plots. The movie was admittedly long but kept me hooked on until the end, just curious to find out what Ben Buttons would look like when he reaches the last stage of his life. I have to admit again, it was peculiar to see him as a baby in the end, trying to imagine him being 80+ years old but then again, I guess they couldn't have finished it anyway differently unless they made Ben Button's final stage of life a mystery. There was a moral in the film and it did make you realize how we take things for granted, like the people we love or the little moments in life for which we should be grateful for.Overall, I would recommend this movie to all ages. It's worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm saying that you know a movie like this when you see it! The most creative way to make a character is to have it age the other way. And this is what I mean by age the other way. Something this good since FOREST GUMP proves that this will be unlike any other movie I've seen in the 2000's. For a good role to play Benjamin Button. I feel like I was only going to get younger myself. Before I go any further, I just thought I could say that I support Brad Pitt and he has my vote.This puts a force inside me to feel what Benjamin went through and how it ends. It beings in a dorky way but you start to see more of him and see what kind of person he becomes. I'm more concern about how he felt when playing this character. You could say this is like the Lord Of The Rings kind of performance, but character "I believe" should defiantly be Oscar Worthy. This touches you like a nervous &amp; emotional chill. I can guarantee it! Brad will be remembered as Benjamin Button.I had part of my heart on Oscar-Magnet Cate Blanchett. She makes the most of her acting, breakthrough, stubbing effort. For give my from my nickname of the effort, but it's a good thing. I will one day see Cate as a legendary classic performer, maybe compared to Brad. Can you tell when great things inspire you when running a film almost 3 hours. A golden triumph puts your mind on film like "Benjamin Button". It makes more since to think of it as a special play. But I think a movie is totally better than any play.I would call more people to see "Benjamin Button", but it's too much of a hassle. You just go see it yourself and commit on what you think. I believe in this to fortunately become a winner! How could you say know to this unless you watch it step by step. I can't wait to see what the decision is from the Academy Award Standing Critic! Man I hope something wins for this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Benjamin is sitting at a bench with the "bushman" character, there is a walk by with a man and a Vizsla dog.The time period is the late 20s or early 30s.Vizsla did not enter the US until after WWII.Most of them entered after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.Sorry, Vizsla was the wrong breed for this time period.Since I need 10 lines, I'll also say that the age makeup was astounding, and the look of the movie was great, but there really isn't enough story to sustain that amount of time.Also, the idea of putting film scratches on flashback/memory sequence was really lame, and made me not like the movie right from the beginning.

		<fullReview>"My name is Benjamin Button, and I was born under unusual circumstances. While, everyone else was agin', I was getting' younger... all alone." Living and loving: two ingredients that never grow old. Director David Fincher and writer Eric Roth in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button have taken F. Scott Fitzgerald's fabulous short story and those ingredients to cook one of the best films of the year. Benjamin (Brad Pitt) is born at the end of World War I in New Orleans an old man baby and ages in reverse, a course that emphasizes the ephemeral nature of life and the importance of enduring love.Besides the cautious avoidance of sentimentality and the deft use of a narrative framing device with a daughter, Caroline (Julia Ormond), reading from a diary to her dying mother, Daisy (Cate Blanchett), about the life of Benjamin Button, this film carefully deconstructs Benjamin's lifelong devotion to Daisy as they both face their aging in opposite directions. Pitt's reserve throughout serves as a helpful defense against the arrows of misfortune bound to happen to someone in his unusual circumstance. At the same time the coolness mitigates against emotional payoff scenes with the separations inevitable for someone growing younger while those about him age and die.Quite the contrary is Blanchett's full-throttle rendition of a woman in an impossible love. Her expressive modern dancing serves as metaphor for the silent, lovely emotion that brings her daily dread of future sorrow. The dancing as motif celebrates the physical balance of their love and the nasty reality of fate waiting to cripple their love.The aging-in-reverse conceit is effective because it is really not different from the normal one we live in for our short lives. We all separate at the given time, mostly with regret that we did not have more time with the ones we love, who themselves must confront the ultimate separations of their lives. As Benjamin is fond of saying, "Nothing lasts.""To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born and a time to die . . . ." Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start by saying this isn't a movie that will be liked by everyone. If you're a person who generally enjoys feel-good films that will cause you to leave the theater smiling, this isn't the one for you. Not to say the movie is bad; in fact, I'd almost say it's one of the best I've seen all year. Long, yes, but truly captivating.The movie's length may be a bit hard on a lot of people. It did get a little boring around parts, and some things could have been edited out, but the superb acting kept my attention. All the actors had good performances. The script was well written, and the cinematography was beautiful.This movie is very, very similar to Forrest Gump, or at least that's what I couldn't stop thinking as I watched it. If you liked that, you will probably like this. The premises are entirely different, but the sequence of events and storyline are noticeably similar.In conclusion, if you want a good movie that doesn't sanitize reality to make it seem better than it actually is, with an interesting story and good actors, this is the one for you. It does get a little tragic, but never depressing enough to make you break down and sob. I'd say more, but can't in fear I'd give something away.See this movie on a day when you're ready for something more than a lighthearted comedy.</fullReview>

Personally, I think it was one of the best movies of the 2008, and it was much better than other overrated Oscar-bait films such as "The Reader" and "Milk".The story was strange, but good, and also beautifully filmed. The performances were incredibly good, specially the one given by Brad Pitt.Just like "Big Fish", this movie is a underrated, misunderstood masterpiece that deserves more recognition: It is true that is slow-paced, but it had lot of memorable and heart-warming scenes. The ending has to be one of the best endings ever made in the story of cinema, being powerful, poignant and heart-warming at the same time.This is a incredible film. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An original idea for a super boring movie. Two hours and a half of the same story, nothing changes, no surprises, no unexpected events. And the most bothering thing is that characters do not ever have any doubt or emotion. They're just abc cyborg. There is no questioning of life, no mystery, no life in this movie. It's a story without characters, it's a series of events for 2 hours and half. It's kind of difficult to make such a predictable movie with such a strange set up idea. I was able to watch the all movie only because of the ridiculous 8 stars this movie got on IMDb.

		<fullReview>Seriously, the 200th best film of all time? Are all of you drunk? I liked this movie better the first time I saw it when it was called Forrest Gump. The only problem is that this microwaved turd was weirder than Forrest Gump. This movie was just weird! Weird, I say! Yeah, I get it; there were some cool special effects (but there were also some pretty cheesy ones like the sound stage shots the first time Benjamin goes out to sea on the tugboat). The ONLY reason that we endured the 2.5+ hours was that the actors are all top-notch, and their acting in this particular film was good. Makeup was great. BUT, I don't watch a movie JUST for special effects and makeup. Otherwise, I'd have really loved the Star Wars prequels ... which also stank. My wife and I have an ongoing anti-competition of sorts regarding what the worst movie of all time is. Currently, it's Out for a Kill, starring Steven Seagal. We had a pretty heated discussion about whether Button is worse than that crap and crud omelet. It was the acting that kept Button from taking over the spot from Seagal. (Seagal beat out Bruce Willis's Striking Distance - really? water cops? are you kidding?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic storytelling falters slightly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning there has been much talk and anticipation surrounding The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The story of a man who is born with the qualities of an octogenarian, and who progressively grows younger, has all the makings of a classic nostalgia fantasy. The film's obviously large budget is masterfully used to create a visually rich tale. However, after all has been said and done, beautiful imagery is the high point of Benjamin Button. Director David Fincher is probably better known for his thrillers like Se7en and Fight Club, and in Benjamin Button he continues to prove how innovative a director he is. But with a budget of over US$150 million, it's easy to see how technique and design triumph over story and ideals. That's not to say the film isn't any good. The story, told in flashbacks, opens with a with a hospital scene in which an elderly woman, in her last few hours, asks her daughter to read the diary of Benjamin Button. The story of how Benjamin (Brad Pitt) came into being and the resulting life he leads follows. The journey is long and visually stunning. Benjamin's humble demeanour, as a result of his unusual circumstances, is believable and engaging. Pitt's Southern accent adds character and mood to this elegiac narrative. Daisy (Cate Blanchett) counterbalances the story by offering a straightforward walk through life. She is a prima donna in all the sense of the term and who brought down after an accident ends her dancing career. Taraji P. Henson stands out from these two Oscar winners as Queenie, Benjamin's "adoptive" mother. Her love for her son and his unfortunate situation adds warmth to the gloomy atmosphere of the retirement home. The cinematography wonderfully captures the era of the time and the characters that lived in it. From the retirement home to the docks and the sea to the bitter coldness of Russia and back again, the sets are remarkable and the period costumes are beautiful. All these parts work well individually but they fall short of working cohesively together. Not one particular aspect fails to step up to the hype but there is something lacking. Or maybe, for a 166 minute film, there is too much to keep the story moving smoothly. Benjamin Button is by no means mediocre but it just does not deliver to its full potential. Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of '08</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story begins with Julia Ormond as Caroline sitting by her mother's deathbed in a New Orleans' hospital as Hurricane Katrina approaches. Her mother, Daisy, is played beautifully by the extremely talented Cate Blanchett. Daisy asks Caroline to read her a journal which use to belong to an ex-lover of hers, named Benjamin Button. But Benjamin was no ordinary man, he was born as he was approximately eighty years old, and instead of growing older he began to grow younger.Benjamin is played by Brad Pitt in one of his most emotionally arresting roles. Benjamin is abandoned by his father after his mother dies in child birth. A black couple who work in a nursing home find Benjamin, and decide to keep him and raise him. Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) becomes attached to Benjamin as she is unable to have children of her own. Henson plays Queenie so well, that we feel the warmth and love that he characters emits through the screen. She falls in love with Benjamin, and we fall in love with her which makes her departure later in the film very emotional not just for Benjamin, but for the audience as well.Benjamin meets a young girl named Daisy, and he quickly develops a strong friendship with the girl which lasts a decade. Later the two are separated when Benjamin goes off to work in a tugboat. They visit Russia where he meets a British woman played by Tilda Swinton and he falls in love with her. The British woman is married, but she has a short-lived affair with Benjamin before leaving abruptly without saying goodbye. Benjamin is visibly heartbroken. He soon forgets about his heartbreak after he gets caught up in World War II after the tugboat where he works is enlisted in the army, and they are attacked. The owner of the tugboat and Benjamin's employer, Captain Mike dies along with other sailors.After this accident Benjamin decides to go back to New Orleans where he meets a dying Thomas Button who reveals his true identity. Benjamin makes amends with his father before he dies. Meanwhile Daisy is working as a successful ballet dancer in New York City and she has also fallen in love with a fellow dancer. While working in Paris Daisy has an accident which halts her career, Benjamin goes to comfort her but she spurns him coldly. But destiny brings Daisy and Benjamin together again after she goes to New Orleans and they fall in love. They stay together for some time before Daisy gives birth to a daughter, Caroline. Benjamin leaves after realizing that Daisy cannot take care of two children and that he will not be able to be a good father due to the fact that he will grow younger.Later Benjamin and Daisy meet again. The latter has gotten married and started a life without Benjamin. The two have a one night stand, but they both realize that Daisy has gotten to old for Benjamin. Daisy later takes care of a infant Benjamin who is suffering from dementia. She stays with him in the nursing home until his death. In a very emotional scene Daisy says goodbye to Benjamin as he dies in her arms as a newborn baby.The film has a lot of emotional scenes, like when Benjamin and his father make amends just before Thomas dies, Benjamin's death in Daisy's arms, the scenes with the younger Benjamin and Daisy, Queenie's funeral, and Daisy's death. For emotional people such as myself this is definitely a cry-fest. But it's so much more than just a tearjerker, it's one of those rare films that you can watch a thousand times and still find something new to marvel at. David Fincher shows why he is a great director, this film is so different from his usual work. He usually does suspense and he is good at it, but here he shows a much softer side to his work as he brings a dramatic romance to the screen. Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt are reunited for the second time, the first time being Babel, and no wonder why. They have great and undeniable chemistry. Pitt is also reunited with director Fincher, and his Burn After Reading co-star, Tilda Swinton.Definitely a great film with a great message. It's one of the best films of 2008, and worth the watch. Trust me even though it's long, it will not bore you. Every minute is essential and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful inside and out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that's over two and a half hours long is going to be difficult to form an opinion on because there's so much material to consider. In other movies where characters might undergo changes in the course of two weeks or even just an evening, the characters in this movie go through an entire lifetime of trials and tribulations and it has to be compressed into less than three hours. Naturally, this was a complicated film to tackle, and I have to say, director David Fincher managed to pull so much complex material together into a tidy fantasy. Benjamin Button is the story of the title character, Benjamin, who is born under "unusual circumstances." Born as a sickly, old man, Ben ages backwards and gets younger on the outside as he advances in years. His "childhood" is his old age and his brittle bones and frail external appearances isolate him from the rest of the world. Right from the beginning, it seems the wisdom of adulthood and eventual mental depletion will come hand in hand with the outward appearance of a child. It's something never before seen on film, and it's fascinating to watch Benjamin's life progress, ultimately, backwards. The cinematography itself is gorgeous. The different time periods are presented in such a squeaky-clean manner that the worst actors in the world could be put in front of the camera and the movie would still be beautiful. The thing that makes this story so special is its message and its honest, sincere performances. The acting, which is humble yet moving, makes the movie not only superficially attractive, but also emotionally deep. The recognizable Brad Pitt everyone knows doesn't appear until over halfway through the film, but his acting has matured so much since his early cinematic adventures that it's hard to believe it's him hobbling around in the beginning. The reason Pitt probably wasn't acknowledged so much for his excellent portrayal is that the character of Benjamin isn't so much a scenery chewer as he is a mild-mannered, regular guy who's trying to make his way in the world. Benjamin is relatively soft-spoken, but Pitt's performance manages to command attention. Cate Blanchett, in my opinion, was criminally ignored this past award season. Blanchett has proved herself an actor with incredible versatility having played such historical characters as Queen Elizabeth I (Elizabeth) and even Bob Dylan (I'm Not There). As Benjamin's love interest, Daisy, she dances her way through the film with grace and poise. I'd go so far as to call her performance perfect. The character of Daisy is written as someone who's so remarkably beautiful and sweet that it's hard to believe she's real. I can't imagine anyone playing that part as well as Blanchett did. She's unreal in her surface qualities, but she still makes it possible for the audience to grow attached to Daisy.The message of Benjamin Button is clear: a lifetime of struggle is worth it if one can obtain true love and just a few moments of bliss. Although Benjamin's life is extraordinary and beyond any of most of our reach, the underlying theme of appreciating life (no matter what the circumstances) is something that audiences will be able to grasp. The movie may leave some a bit depressed and forlorn about the inevitable demise of its two main characters (the final act is not without its heart-wrenching moments) but the purpose of the film is more than just its characters, it's the message that each person should take away from it. Fincher takes on a heavy subject matter and makes it accessible to the average person while simultaneously raising the bar in epic storytelling. My grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really curious is the case of Benjamin Button, a movie that, besides being, of course, improbable and really strange and besides the extraordinary effectiveness in rendering the passing of time on the faces and bodies of the characters, is able to offer many significant and by no way banal stimuli of thought. The most interesting one is the choice to leave history in the background, focusing attention on the "small" histories of the protagonists, who do not seem to be affected by what happens outside their lives. The impression we get is that "great history" is always there, doing its inexorable course, but that our personal story has a force and a value of its own, able to overcome the greatest events. Wars as well as Katrina will bring death and destruction, but our story will remain our greatest and most powerful bulwark of self-defence, something which nothing and nobody will be able to erase. Within the long (but never boring) time run the curious life of Benjamin is displayed with delicacy, arousing feelings of tenderness and authenticity, as to underline the complexity of human life, along a line where TIME is the essential point, always there to remind us of the shortness of life and the necessity to catch the moment, being however this universal warning never stressful or annoying. Female performances are really outstanding: Kate Blanchett, Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton prove to be three great prodigies of acting and hit the mark in an impressive way. Less convincing is Brad Pitt, sometimes victim of his own timeless handsomeness, and appearing entrapped in a sort of monotonous face mime. A movie that gets to engage the audience, just by touching some very sensitive chords of the human soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A life well spent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A sweeping, touching and honestly tear-jerking fable. A future classic?The great Mark Twain once remarked that "the best part of life was from the beginning and the worst part was the end". This was soon the inspiration of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald for his short story THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (which was then retooled by screenwriter Eric Roth for this brilliant screen adaptation), which took Twain's remark as an inspiration, then it contrasts it. Instead of living life from young to old, Fitzgerald questioned what would life be when lived by a man who aged backwards, having it the other way around. What would life be if, while this man was born as an old man then aged backwards into a younger being, all his loved ones aged until their untimely death arrives? And most of all, how would he feel when he slowly witnesses his loved ones grow old and die in front of his very eyes as he slowly ages in reverse? This is the strange alternate reality (the "curious case", if you may) of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who was strangely born as an old man, abandoned by his grief-stricken father (Jason Flemyng) and adopted by a nurse in an retirement home (Taraji P. Henson), where he slowly ages from a strangely deformed old man that resembles a gnome to a young, handsome man, then younger. But the in-between moments is what really matters in this "curious case", where our odd companion Benjamin discovers love in the eyes of the charming Daisy (Cate Blanchett), experiences pain in plight of the tragic death of his loved ones and basically, life itself as joyous and unpredictable, and spending every moment of it while it lasts.It's hard not to feel a wee bit misty-eyed in such emotionally-powerful moments in the movies, especially if they are as sincere and honestly true-to-the-point as the ones in THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, a life-affirming tale which is the best of its kind since Roth's own FORREST GUMP. First, I look at "THE CURIOUS CASE" as a technical accomplishment that it is. But "CURIOUS CASE" proves to be an even deeper experience as a movie. Long after I saw it, I wasn't simply remembering how beautifully detailed and eye-filling it was, I was recalling its message about life and love and how to live them. The excellent screenplay by Mr. Roth is that kind of material that stays with you long after the experience is over, and every bit of it is still dazzling long after the visual experience has gone. Testimonials such as "Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss." or "We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?" are such lines I won't soon forget long after seeing a movie. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a curious case indeed, a movie unlike any movie I have ever seen before, at least in this season so far or for a very long time.It's imperfect to be sure. It's a cover-to-cover telling and Roth doesn't afford to leave any remaining details behind, making this the 166 minute long experience that it is. The mid-section is especially long, as well as a few moments earlier that prolong this already long affair even more. But "CURIOUS CASE" is that kind of movie that has to be loved, a strong an unique story, that must be judged by the sum of its parts. And to put it lightly, the thing that need to be perfect, are. The performances from the stellar talents meet the intelligence and grace of the characters they portray (especially watchable is Pitt in his age-changing performance as Benjamin and Taraji Henson in her breakthrough role as Benjamin's foster mother Queenie). David Fincher has led a successful career as a director in years, and with "CURIOUS CASE", he never lets his successful career astray. He might not have done anything with the slightly overlong run time or the sometimes sedate pace, but he does bring the movie to life on screen, which is all that this tale needs. The special effects and fine make-up job are put to such good purpose that they blend seamlessly into the background. The movie feels and looks like the technical accomplishment that it is and never for once feel like another dazzling special effects movie. Now that's special effects for a very special movie. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON may be flawed, but it has earned its place in Hollywood history, or if not, it will leave a mark in future major Hollywood efforts that it's not enough that you have a great story to work with (that's a surefire to attract the folks at the Oscars), but that's it's just as important to have a great storyteller who knows how to put it all together on screen. And with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, Fincher proves he is.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

Then forget it all as this film does a poor job of exploring any of it. Instead we are subjected to a few clichéd story lines that never really seem convincing. There are some funny parts, but they are few and far between. The serious scenes seemed to be too 'set' to be effective. A pity, because it could have been so much better.Now, I like long films ? Das Boat, Seven Samurai, 2001 ? but they have to have the structure and content to work. There needs to be a plot line to carry the film along. You need to care about the characters enough to sit there for 3 hours. This film, simply does not have what it takes.Just another example of Hollywood missing the target.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying if somewhat affected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just the premise, a man aging backwards, should warrant this one a shot. In its execution though, it reminded me more then a little of Forest Gump. For instance, the narrative with its humor (some are made to get struck by lightning) and the ongoing love-story. Maybe its a few shades darker, but its overall tone, is largely the same. Its sentimental, episodic, nostalgic, looks beautiful, and reminds engrossing through most parts of the picture, but fails to accomplish anything significant.I though the way they made the character change throughout the film was quite amazing. Brad Pit turns in another good performance, but is clearly out-shined by Cate Blanchett. Likewise, the way the times changes are handled nicely, mostly just hinted at in the background with different trends (just one little misstep in this department: The parts with The Beatles on television).I wish they wouldn't have to resort to the bookending parts where they read his diary on her deathbed. Its length also wore me out and i felt my interest fading for the last hour, but i probably weren't on the right frame of mind, after all, this is the kind of film you watch with your whole family during Christmas and in that context its probably great. So, all in all, this is a typical Oscar winner. For better and worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but unsurprising, it feels like Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is definitely worthy to take your time to enjoy this movie, it is very beautiful and emotional, and it is far from being boring. However, be aware because the bigger surprise you get is to see that it was directed by David Fincher! Actually, better to forget this before start seeing it, especially if you are Fight Club or Se7en movie fan. You do not see Fincher's innovative mind in Benjamin Button, and I personally consider this unfortunate. Benjamin Button brings exactly the same emotional elements and development as Forrest Gump, in my opinion a far away better movie than this one, should be put as IMDb recommendations list for the ones interested in enjoying the same atmosphere and feeling. I rather prefer to wish Mr Fincher and crew all the best luck and brightness when developing the Heavy Metal project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple movie with great underlying meanings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is basically to point out the main/more apparent underlying meanings of the film. 1) Life could be good or bad now, but you'll never know what you're going to get. Life is unexpected, life is like the unpredictable storms which kept the whole film running. Life is of storms. e.g. The hurricane which kept changing directions when Benjamin's diary was read aloud by his daughter. 2) Take the chance and do something you like, because in the end, life is emptiness and nothingness - "everyone will end up in diapers". e.g. The commissioner's wife taking the chance to get involved in an affair with Benjamin and had the rendezvous of her life. e.g. Benjamin going on the sailing trip to see the world and thereafter had many of his first experiences. 3) Appreciate everything for what they are - some people are born to make buttons, some dance, some are mothers. Life never goes the way we want it to be, we have to accept things for what they are. e.g. Benjamin was born odd, his father couldn't accept it, didn't love him as he was, thus he led a guilty life and had a sad ending even though he was very rich. The black woman loved Benjamin as he was, and was happy all her life even though her job was to take care of old people.4) Life sometimes isn't about hard work, it is also about luck and taking chances ? "Life is determined by the decisions you make, and those you didn't". e.g. The commissioner's wife tried to swim across the English Channel when she was young and ambitious, only to give up because of a storm. When she grew older, her ambitions began to fade away. But when she grew really old, she tried again to swim across and she made it. 5) "I was struck by lightning 7 times in my life." ~ Old man on wheelchair. Interpretation A: Everyone will encounter roughly more or less than 7 disasters in his/her lifetime. Interpretation B: This statement could instead be "I could've been struck by lightning 7 times in my life." Perhaps this old man ever witnessed situations where others were struck, when they were doing very routine or ordinary things, like feeding the cow or getting the mail. He keeps thinking that those people who were struck could've just been him, because he could've just done those routine tasks too, therefore he said that he's just lucky to be alive. The nostalgic lightning 1-second clips and the old people in the nursing home, all serve as teaching material for Benjamin, to take life easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish epic which looks fantastic but lacks punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this recently after wanting to see it for some time when I saw the trailer for it. Firstly, I'm a fan of the director (David Fincher) and love his films such as Se7en and Fight Club etc. Also the story seemed so intriguing and it really pulled me into wanting to see it. The beginning starts off quite promisingly with some lovely photography and slightly quick-paced storytelling after we are thrust into just after the Great War. I loved the small sub-plot of the father who lost his son at war which led to him setting the clock he'd built backwards in hope of the war heroes returning. The make-up/visual effects are also superb when seeing Pitt as the decrepit, ancient young boy. Some of the scenes in which he spends his time at the retirement home he grew up in are too slow and wind on for to long, resulting in interest starting to wane. As the film progresses, Benjamin's body change and maturity follows. As we follow his experiences it starts to pick up and it engages you closely with the character as Pitt narrates continuously. The film holds some effective and intriguing messages in regards to life and growth etc. However, as the film goes on you start to wonder why we should be interested in this man's life. We all know he's going through his life backward but this initial interest starts to fade after some time. The film also kept reminding me of another Eric Roth story (Forrest Gump) in which the central character is narrating us through his story. Also the re-occurring floating feather in Forrest Gump could be compared to the re-occurring Humming Bird in this picture. Another similarity is Benjamin's relationship with Miss Rose (Blanchett) to Forrest's relationship with Jenny (both couples don't quite get together until late on and then something dramatic takes their relationship away) The difference between this film and Forrest Gump is that Gump had a clear and definite idea with what they wanted to achieve in the film. The whole story that Forrest always meets the most famous people of the 21st Century and stumbles across many landmarks in history and unknowingly creates famous brands was a concrete idea. The fantasy aspect in Forrest Gump and him remaining his usual self despite it all was the film's path, idea and message. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button lacks that definite and clear path which results in the audience not knowing exactly why we should be taken across this man's life.Also, unfortunately the acting in the film lacks sincerity and an overall sense of feeling with conviction. I'm not the biggest Brad Pitt fan but I thought he was dignified and showed his experience in this film. He under-played the role and it was the perfect approach. The other main role (Rose) played by Cate Blanchett had a performance from her which was bland, lacking emotion and just not enough urge or feeling in the character. This unfortunately resulted in the chemistry between her and Button to be minimal. I couldn't see the love between them, there was no sign of it anywhere. These aspects normally shape a film and greatly contribute to the power of it, and this film lacked it all. On a more positive note, the cinematography throughout was gorgeous, as was the set design, colour, costume and overall look. The messages and little touches including the man who got struck by lightening seven times and Benjamin taking his father to watch the sunset over the lake as he did when he was a boy were touching and poignant. Overall, I thought the film looked superb including some amazing visual effects and make-up (including when Pitt was made to look about 10 years younger than he is now), was directed nicely with a strong narrative structure, some lovely messages and touches but through the lack of interest in places and lack of acting quality/power it resulted in the film losing some punch and losing the merit of being a great film. Therefore it is a good film but it won't be considered an absolute classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has not cut off the link to the past 1920s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central idea of the film is the fact that Benjamin Button was born old and was thus able to get younger day after day and hence to die by regressing or progressing to his very own birth. If we accept this idea then we can see the potential of the film. It is going to reveal the attitudes of most people around the child who looks old or the old man who looks like a child. Rejection will be the main reaction. It is not made in anyway funny but it is always shown as dramatic, though Benjamin Button is developing a tremendous flexibility and is able to adapt to all situations. He crosses the world, history like a recording beacon and he reveals in his journal what he has been able to see and witness, always from a certain distance because he is never what they think he is, so he is always aloof. The film does a good job at that task and the actor does a very good job at living front side back. The saddest part of the film is the way Benjamin's father rejected him and the way Benjamin himself, for the very same reason rejects his own daughter. His father could not face his child and thought he was a monster. Benjamin does not want to have his daughter witness his regression for her not to think he is a monster, which she will think eventually but not as applied to her father. There is something even more morbid in that situation. The way love is discriminatory. One loves only the persons that fit a certain slot. We do not know the slot most of the time and so we think we are open to everything. This films reveals in very dramatic ways that this is wrong. We only love those who satisfy our most secret, deepest and most unconscious impulses, demands and requests. Benjamin Button is loved by his father only when he has become young enough to look like his son and when he needs him to die. Benjamin Button is loved by the one who is going to be the mother of his daughter only when he fits with her career, with her desire to become stable in life after various accidents and mishaps, when she cannot play the star anymore. She will love him to the end for sure and yet she will raise her own daughter, his daughter, on a lie that she will only reveal before dying in the midst of the famous Katrina hurricane. She will be the one who closes his eyes but that will be done for the world around her out of charity, compassion not love because no one knew her real relation to him. And she accepted that hypocrisy. If her husband was such a marvelous father, Benjamin should have found the proper place in this family, without disrupting it but enriching it with a knowledge that no one should have been ashamed of. In fact I find this film too close to Fitzgerald who was a born representative of the America of before the big crash, vain, hypocritical, self-satisfied and self-righteous, hating differences, cultivating normalcy. The film transposes this short story to our modern world and there is the rub: today we cannot really accept that kind of norm-cultivation. But the actor and actress are so good, the directing is so good that we try to forget that old "happy 20s" gene inherited from Fitzgerald.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Groundbreaking, but it doesn't realise its promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The potential of David Fincher going into the mainstream is seemingly enormous. He is a director of brilliant vision and superb talent. With "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button", the story of a man who ages backwards, he has the chance to explore the full extent of his talents, both as a visual filmmaker and a storyteller. It was an exciting proposition, but, for some reason, he only manages to pull out a solid piece of work, which, whilst being visually impressive and technically astounding, is somewhat lost in its own pretensions.The film's strengths are many in number, though light in weight. The most notable of these are the groundbreaking visual effects and make up which allow Brad Pitt, and to a lesser extent Cate Blanchett, to roll the years back and forward. This is a "Gollum" moment: another brilliant and unexpected leap forward in visual effects technology.No matter how they may have been altered, the cast are also excellent. Brad Pitt delivers a very effective performance and is utterly believable all the way through the film. Cate Blanchett is as good as ever, whilst Julia Ormond is given a thankless task as Blanchett's daughter but she carries it off well, and there is also a lovely little performance by Tilda Swinton. Taraji P. Henson, however, steals the film as Button's mother, and fully deserves her Oscar nomination.David Fincher, himself, excels in his usually way, with his optimum style. Some sequences are breathtaking, such as Daisy dancing for Button which is wonderful to see. The film is utterly arresting as a visual experience. It looks beautiful from start to finish and is magnificently shot by Claudio Miranda.However, for a film which is 166 minutes long it does depressingly little with its time. The central motif of Button ageing backwards feels like it should be doing or saying something, but it isn't and, as the condition is never explained in the story or by a theme, it jars somewhat. There are only hints of ideas in this film. There is an anti-war (anti-Bush) theme which floats in occasionally, but is ultimately too short-lived, but there is nothing else which is really going on. Everything seems to be half-baked ? enough to envelop the viewer, though not to grip.The film is a sentimental tale and is not an unpleasant way to spend almost three hours. It is at times an astonishing thing to see on screen, but it is not a magnificent thing. It promised so much, but it is a disappointment. It lacks a deal of sophistication and depth which the film perhaps deserves. A masterpiece was hoped for, but all we have is a solid, if groundbreaking, piece of film.</fullReview>

I was so wrong. He's acting with female co-star Cate Blanchett is absolutely amazing and touching. The screenplay by Eric Roth is also one of best of 2008. great work. The Soundtracks is made by a french guy named Alexandre desplat. without a doubt the best soundtracks of 2008. Finally i have to give much credit to Mr. David Fincher. Another great film by this guy.

So women don't expect to have your heart strings tugged at for it's full 166 (thats right) minute running time. This is not Forrest Gump (although it does bear uncanny resemblances due to Mr. Eric Roth) so don't expect a lovable idiot whom you fall in love with. This is the story of an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances. This is a totally different film and completely unique because of it. This is The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.The film completely charmed me. It was hilarious. It was heart-warming. It was beautiful. It was everything i could ask for in a movie. I could not recommend it any higher if i wanted to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be honest, I was ready to dislike this film. Notwithstanding the intriguing premise, the mixed reviews I had read had me expecting a degree of cleverness for its own sake, slowness, and excessive sentimentality.Well, it is clever, particularly technically. It is a long film - much time taken to tell what is essentially a small story, notwithstanding the fact that it spans over 80 years - but the telling is leisurely rather than slow. But it is never sentimental. Emotional, yes, but never sentimental.I was thoroughly engaged throughout, and came out having enjoyed it a great deal more than I had expected to. Among the parts that I enjoyed were Tilda Swinton's unfulfilled Englishwoman (and I especially liked the late, and unexpected, capstone to her story arc) and the engagement with the U-Boat.Pitt and Blanchett are both excellent, as you'd expect, but everyone else is pretty good too. The visuals are also first rate - not so much as regards the ageing effects and makeup (though they are astonishing) more as regards the period and location detail).Nice to note that Twist and Shout was the actual Ed Sullivan live recording - and it sounded really good over the cinema sound system! My one major criticism is the sound in the first half hour or so - I found it really difficult to make out the dialogue, although it improved greatly from there on.And the sadness - which was built into the story from the very start - wasn't about the deaths of the two main characters, it was about how short a time these two people had together and the tragic - but right - decision that Banjamin took when Caroline was small.An excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The curious thing about Benjamin Button is that he is born an old man and dies a baby. Born old. Dies young. Geddit?This sets the scene for Brad Pitt to deliver such lines as "I'm seven, but I look a lot older", and "will you still love me when I get acne?". And am reading too much of a Mrs Robinson into it when a latterly older Cate Blanchett dismisses Brad Pitt with an off-hand "Good-night Benjamin"? Need more? I thought not.I found this a wearisome film which perversely aged me disproportionately throughout its 166 minutes. Just how many times can the Daisy or Benjamin characters "return"? I lost count. And interest. This was a short story for heavens sake. Did we really need the trail through U-boats, Presidents, and hurricanes?This isn't going to be a popular review I'm sure.

		<shortDescription>Enchanting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any good critic will tell you that when you write a review you should start by introducing the plot, examine the overarching themes of the film, and then reveal your personal opinion which of course will be grounded in cinematic theory, and I would normally go along with this? But if Benjamin Button has taught me anything it is that life is too short, so I'm just going to come right out and say it. I loved this film! From the intriguing beginning to the heart breaking end I was enchanted.Based on an F Scott Fitzgerald short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button sweeps you up and carries you on an epically intimate portrayal of a life lived backwards. The film follows Benjamin as he makes his way from birth as an old man through middle age to youth. Along the way he meets a fantastical array of characters, he triumphs and he encounters tragedy, he finds love, loses it and finds it again. Like Forrest Gump (also written by Eric Roth) Benjamin Button dances through a life touched by extraordinary events with wide-eyed innocence and naive charm, he meets his 'jenny' in the form of Daisy and their love story is intricately weaved through the history of the 20th Century.It is to David Fincher's complete credit and talent as a filmmaker that the comparisons to Forrest Gump stop there. It would have been very easy to take this film down a path of bombarding imagery and obvious song choices but instead Fincher serves up a film swimming in warmth, sentimentality and whimsical reality. But let's not forget, this is still a David Fincher film; along with the romance we have unforgiving melancholy. Fincher takes his time getting his two love interests together, for the first half of the film both characters flit in and out of each others lives all the while the audience are astutely aware that time will catch up on them. Finally Fincher allows us to enjoy them together by presenting a montage of chocolate box moments but the idealism is soon replaced by reality, their love always will be fleeting. Indeed this is the heartbeat of the film, love in all forms, whether it is a mother's love or friendship, comes and goes. Time does not allow us to hold on and it doesn't matter which way we move through life, we can't rewind it.The visual imagery is spectacular, from the faux 1920s shutter camera to the techniques used to age the actors; Benjamin Button is a feast for the eyes. What is even more impressive is the ability of the actors to make the special effects seem so natural, no more so than Brad Pitt. Is this Brad Pitt's finest performance? No, but I do think it is he's most accomplished. He carries the film with such subtlety and restraint that it would be simple to overlook his character as nothing more than a passive observer, however there are scenes where through Pitt's acting skills Benjamin Button personality shines. The supporting cast are also top notch, leading the charge are the ever wonderful Cate Blancett and scene stealing Taraji P. Henson.So as I said, I loved this film. With Awards season upon us it is becoming apparent that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button will not be winning as many awards as it has been nominated for which isn't a surprise if Brad Pitt and David Fincher's awards CVs are anything to go by. I don't think it much matters; this film already feels like a classic for the ages. Unlike Benjamin and Daisy's love for each other The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is timeless and we as an audience will be able to rewind it and enjoy it forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often a gem of a film comes along that is so beautifully made in every aspect that it leaves you with a warm gooey feeling at the end. Yes the ending is sad, but ultimately you feel like you've just watched something so extraordinary you feel completely uplifted.This is Brad Pitt's best acting appearance, without a doubt, and although the odds are on Mickey Rourke picking up Best Actor Oscar this year, Brad is definitely a dark horse and one to watch.The cinematography, costumes, make-up and special effects all add up to a fantastic cinematic experience and one I could watch over and over even though it is nearly three hours long. The acting is faultless and it is very difficult to find a single criticism for this film OK perhaps it could have been a little shorter but where would you find the bits to edit out, I know I wouldn't be able to choose them.I know all the attention has been given to Brad Pitt's performance but praise has to be given to Cate Blanchett, who plays Button's *childhood sweetheart*. This is film making at its very best and deserves every single commendation it's been nominated for. I loved it.</fullReview>

In total almost 1400 people die in this film.According to this site (http://www.geekstir.com/rambos-kill-stats) all four Rambo flicks combined had only 438 kills so this one is a treasure trove. Despite demanding nearly three hours of the viewer's life, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button makes every last second more than worth it, its power and incredibly uniform quality made all the more appealing by its lack of pretension and vehement avoidance of cliché. While the story or length may not appeal to every last audience member, it is all the more of a shame, as such unanticipated cinematic mastery deserves to be enjoyed and reflected upon by as many as possible.

		<fullReview>There was such a movie once - everybody was talking with southern accent, there were some big events rolling around the plot, and the time was going by so meaningfully that almost every little thing was a starter spark for that big events mentioned above. And that was Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump - very life-cherish story with some nice ideas how to sell so called "village-wisdom" to all the folks "from the city" in a way they couldn't notice. It was done with some bullshit moments, but summing all up - IT WAS ALMOST AN MASTERPIECE."Curious Case of Benjamin Button" tries to repeat that simple form of journey to the deep-down-well-known basic truths about life. But you CAN'T be Forrest Gump just like that - to tell a simple story JUST about life you have to manage staying unpretentious, because an idea of telling such story is pretentious in the first place. Zemeckis nearly achieved it in Forrest Gump, so did - in a different way though - Jeunet in Amélie. Sadly to say, Fincher was much much MUCH closer to it in... Se7en (yes!).In "Benjamin Button" we have everything that SHOULD sum up to that magical mystery tour - Stars in the cast, a story full of coincidences and simple truths, southern accent all over, childly innocent leading character, unnoticed special effects, and epic kick. We even have here a symbol, a logo of the movie (like the feather in Forrest Gump)! But finally we end up with two and half hour masturbation movie for make-up artists, because even though the make-up is truly amazing, there are no REAL feelings beneath it.Summing up: pretentious, empty, commercial-like, boring way of quoting DESIDERATA. I suggest saving money. And time.</fullReview>

In the case of Benjamin Button, the news that Eric Roth, who penned the interminably folksy Forrest Gump, had written a screenplay which David Fincher would direct, raised an eyebrow in the Frames household. The portents were as black as Carol Thatcher's nightmares. Like Gump, Button would chart the lifetime of a boorish miscreant, or cipher, whose job it was to guide us through several decades of American History. Robert Zemeckis, a technocentric director whose movies had been enhanced by bravura visual effects, directed Gump and although being his blandest film, attained a clutch of Oscars for his trouble. Oscars that his funnier, edgier and more entertaining pictures had never stood a chance of winning.David Fincher, like Zemeckis, is a director whose grip on the use of effects as a story enhancing tool rather than a sideshow, is so tight that his direction is almost an effect itself. He gave us Fight Club, one of the most astute and thematic rich satires ever made. Seven was a classic thriller. Zodiac a genre shredding police procedural where the devil really was in the detail. Three superb pictures and no industry recognition whatsoever. What to do? Well perhaps, reasoned Fincher, doing 'a Zemeckis', was the way forward. After all, good as he is, the man's got an ego right? This alone must explain why a filmmaker previously attracted to such engaging, edgy material, was motivated to direct Roth's fatuous slab of homespun whimsy - a light touch jaunt through the 20th century as seen through the eyes of a glaze eyed non-entity.If Forrest Gump succeeded at all, and the debate goes on, it was as a result of it's canny juxtaposing of the dull everyman with extraordinary moments in US History and the characters that populated it. Look, there's Gump shaking hands with President Kennedy! There he is with John Lennon! But Benjamin Button, bless his one dimensional heart, barely makes a mark on history as he inoffensively passes through it. The fact he's aging backwards making him one of the most extraordinary humans to have ever lived, if anything, goes virtually unnoticed, as if it was no more remarkable than an unusual skin disease. The potential of the premise is therefore offensively wasted, to the point where you're not convinced his aging normally would have made much of an impact on his life. Button's plight (he is born computer generated) might have given him a unique perspective on the human condition and what a different movie it could have been had Pitt played someone with the mind of Oscar Wilde - a cutting intelligence and wit brought to bear on his inverted existence and the lives he touched upon the way. But the Gump model only works it's magic if you find profundity in the banal and the chocolate box truisms that have the least demanding members of the audience nodding their heads and wiping a tear from their sentimentally swollen eyes. Thus it's a superficial, curiously still piece of work that hopes you'll graft your own experiences on to Pitt's blank canvas and in doing so, squeeze out the melancholy as you remember your own lost loves, your own disappointments, your own missed opportunities. That's fine if you're in the mood but otherwise you might think Fincher is wasting your time and unlike Pitt, you're not getting any younger.The only thing that saves Button from complete irrelevance is the technical showmanship on display. As with Fincher's previous efforts, the meticulousness in the framing of each shot married with the highly inventive use of CGI speaks to the intelligence behind the camera. It's also a handsome film, as they say in New Orleans, impressively mounted and richly photographed. But Fincher, who to his credit pulls back from fully fledged Gump levels of sentiment, can do nothing with Roth's mawkish script and consequently Button is easy on the eye but unforgiving on the mind. Has Fincher sold out with it? Well he may finally get his Oscar but as he stands at the podium, golden statuette in hand and grin fixed for the cameras he'd do well to remember Tyler Durden's warning from the long long ago - "The things you own end up owning you".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The curious case of Benjamin Button is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. The interesting condition (Benjamin's age moving backwards) of the main character(Brad Pitt)constitutes an interesting love story between the two main characters. David Fincher's direction is great but I think the biggest praises goes to the cinematographer Claudio Miranda. Fincher and Miranda worked together in such cult movies like Seven and Fight Club and they again show their potential with the great work of art direction in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The movie,in my opinion,is the early favorite for the academy awards of best art direction and best cinematography. The performances of the two main characters(Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are also great but Brad Pitt does not seem to be winning the academy award. In conclusion The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a touching, beautifully told picture with great images, the film is worth spending your three hours seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Feel Good Movie But Worth Every Moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The predominant theme of this fable is the impermanence of life and the loss we suffer because of it. If you've read anything about Eastern religion, you will be very familiar with the ideas of impermanence and the futility of trying to hang on to anything, but as Westerners, some of us may be unprepared for the way this theme slowly creeps over us during this story. After thirty minutes in, I realized I was in for a hard ride emotionally.This is one of the most lovely and melancholy movies I have ever sat through. The story is narrated by both Benjamin and the love of his life, Daisey, while she is on her death bed in a New Orleans hospital, with the help of Ben's diary. And a very bad storm is on the way.I have heard comparisons of this movie to Forrest Gump. No, no, no and no. I'm not denying Hanks was good in the film, but it was totally contrived. Ben isn't present at a dozen history making events. In fact, the beauty of Ben's life is its simplicity.Ever since I first heard of the premise of Benjamin Button, I wondered this: What happens to him in the end? Sure, aging backwards sounds great at first, and it is. 80. . . 70. . .60. . .50. . .40. . .30. . .20. . .then what? The human brain becomes fully mature at 20 or so, and at its peak at around 21 or 25. Beyond that, what happens to Ben? At some point he will start to lose his life memories, not because his brain is degenerating, but because it is devolving, along with the rest of him. In stead of being able to accumulate more and more knowledge, or even hang onto it, that knowledge, along with all those memories, will just . . .go. They'll evaporate. Just who will he be at ten? At five? Will he devolve into a infant, a fetus, then. . .what, pop out of existence? What a horrible fate. More horrible than old age, really, because my grandfather died at 94, with all his faculties and memories intact. He could add a column of numbers faster than I could enter them into a calculator and used gloat over this. He died quickly, of a stroke, one day. And so it is. Ben simply regresses into childhood, with no memory of his great love, his encounter with a German submarine, his adopted mother, his friends, his own daughter, or anything at all. And it's not a blissful forgetting. Ben is frightened and confused as a child, sometimes hostile, full of behavioral problems arising from the strange shadows in his consciousness. Somewhere in the corner of his brain is the phantom of an entire existence, but what was it? He doesn't know. He can never know. He experiences a kind dementia, then devolves to a toddler. As an infant his little body simply fails, and he mercifully dies in the arms of his devoted ex-wife, then an old woman. "He opened his eyes at the end, and looked at me. And I knew he knew *who* I was."Technically, the movie is a marvel, and Brad Pitt turns in a very understated and heartfelt performance. But you won't be marveling at the backwards aging Brad Pitt, you'll be immersed in the unfolding of Ben's life, the wonderful fable of the backwards running clock supposedly installed in New York's Grand Central Station, and the final image of Huricane Katrina's rising water, washing away the artifacts of a life.</fullReview>

This movie is like peregrination to cherubic world of this most beautiful feeling, I feel like I close my eyes and just feel you in my arms while time goes on and we get old just to be in love forever. I wish all understand to live a life like Benjamin Button, to live the way God created us to walk on the path while God lead us 'coz it's the destiny to walk with pure heart and love is waiting to embrace. I wish to die in arms of this pure love while taking my last glance from her eyes. Love is very beautiful just like its imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing, elusive film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what one might think, this film is not about "story", it's not about "people", hence all that talk about lack of warmth and emotional detachment is not really relevant. It's a self reflective film making, an intellectual cocoon dealing with itself, the way it's made and especially its star in a very enclosed way which almost seems to be intentioned to shut out the spectator. Whether one likes him or not, Brad Pitt is a Movie Star. Over the last two decades he became an iconic representation of a kind of classic idea of what this term means ? someone who's physically so out there, who possesses some kind of charisma which has nothing to do with intellect, cultural gravitas or even acting ability. Valentino had it. Garbo had it, as did Garry Cooper, or Hedy Lamarr. It's the ability to be a beautiful, emotionally blank canvas which invites the spectator to project his or her own fantasies on. This attribute caused directors to explore and use Pitt as A Star. Early on, Redford recognized it and used him as a surrogate self, celebrating his effortless physical charms while acknowledging the dark sides of this kind of persona in A River Runs Through It. Last year Andrew Dominik showcased him as an older, more reflective Star to Affleck's groupie. The casting of Pitt as Jesse James in itself was a major artistic choice. From Thelma and Louise through Meet Joe Black to Troy there's a conscious use of Pitt's presence and the way people react to it. A decade ago Fincher made Fight Club in which Pitt portrayed himself, or rather a fictional fragment of the imagination, formed in the shape of a certain movie star named Brad Pitt who actually exists as such in the cinematic universe of that film (Norton and Bonham Carter are seen in front of a theater showing Seven Years in Tibet). It was a study of the fascination our culture has with media promoted artifacts and the fact that "stars" are likewise objects one is encouraged to lure after. And now Fincher continues and explores the very essence of that abstract entity, the movie star. Benjamin Button's life doesn't look like a real person's life nor he life of a real person who's a movie star. But as it can only be materialized within the realm of a movie, this life can be looked at as a metaphor to the "life" of the abstract notion which is what a "movie star" is. Since this entity exists only in the body of work of the star, it is not obliged to follow the linear chronology mere mortals do. Watching On Golden Pond first, then Mister Roberts, followed by Grapes of Wrath and finishing with The Farmer Takes a Wife and one have a curious case of Henry Fonda. It has nothing to do with the real person who was born in 1905 and died in 1982. Jodie Foster is exactly my age. Yet if I watch Taxi Driver today, the only "Jodie Foster" I'll ever know, the one in the movies, is 13, I'm still 46. The character of Benjamin Button - or BB (just like Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monro, or indeed, Brigitte Bardot) - is passive. It goes through life and this world without real involvement, but it's a cinematic journey, each section of it corresponds with the contemporary cinema of its era ? from Griffith's Victoriana, through L'Atalante, the war movies of the '40s, Red Shoes, American in Paris, even Turning Point. It is filled with references to movies? a New Orleans streetcar, Blanchet's character's name. Pitt seems to be channeling familiar cinematic idols ? a Gene Kelly, a Dean or a Brando and finely a young Brad Pitt. Blanchet's hair was once Moira Shearer's while one might be thinking of Katherine Hepburn and Blanchet herself as Hepburn at some point when the older Daisy emerges. And then there are these little theoretical footnotes, about the kind of existence the cinema enables ? the reversal of time which brings the clockmaker's son back to life, the analyzing of Daisy's accident. The running joke about the guy who was struck by lightning seven times, each time presented as a cinematic miniature? is all about the movie star who can "die" many times in different movies then come back in another. So this is how one should look at the way Benjamin Button fulfill the ultimate vocation of the movie star ? incarnating the romantic fantasy. His two significant love affairs are presented as two very different cinematic romances. First there's the early '40s movie ? set in a secluded, exotically romantic place, confided in location and time, a kind of movie where the camera will always stay discretely outside closed doors. And later we're treated to a '60s movie, relatively explicit (naked bodies strategically covered with sheets), much more kinetic and outdoorsy. But in both cases it has nothing to do with real life, and these romances are ended once the "movie" ends - whether it's Casablanca or Barefoot in the Park, it can never evolve into a story about paying the mortgage or changing diapers. As a counterpoint to BB's there's Daisy's life. Not only does it go along "normally", she's a dancer. Dancing is the ultimate example of live performing art as a fleeting, elusive action which exists only while it actually happens as opposed to the ever lasting nature of performance captured on film. And off course the way her career evolves, brutally ends and then being revisited in a kind of secondhand way as a teacher is a way to accentuate the uniqueness of the cinematic immortality. (One can also look at it as a comparison between the hard gained, labor and talent based stardom of the Bette Davis school, represented on and off screen by Cate Blanchet, and the fame based on luck and genetics, like the one attributed to poor Pitt).</fullReview>

It is a great and original story written by Eric Roth, a man that ages backwards. This is I think the first drama by Fincher, cause I know almost all his works are either thriller or suspense. But then again he made this incredibly wonderful. They may compare it to "Forrest Gump" in terms of style (Narration about his adventurous life, etc.) but with no doubt, this is much better. I hope this film wins an Oscar. After 9 years, Brad Pitt and David Fincher collaborate once more for their 3rd film, and it's good as the last two films, but in a different genre now.

		<shortDescription>Stunning Craftsmanship and a Heartfelt Approach Lend Resonance to an Elaborate Adult Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taken as an elaborate, adult-oriented fairy tale, there is much to savor in director David Fincher's 2008 time-spanning magnum opus. The sheer craftsmanship in his nearly three-hour film is second to none from Claudio Miranda's masterful cinematography to Alexandre Desplat's grandiose music to Donald Graham Burt's meticulous production design. Nearly every image feels like a beautiful tableau perfect in the depiction of the specific period that the filmmaker had meant to evoke. Where the film misses the mark somewhat is in its center. The passivity of the title character - while understandable given the passage of 20th-century history he witnesses and the extraordinary changes he experiences - does not provide as compelling an impetus for the plot as one would hope. Co-written by Eric Roth ("Forrest Gump") and Robin Swicord ("The Jane Austen Book Club"), the story takes a "Gump"-like approach to Benjamin making him an observer of the sweeping events around him. With the usually sober-minded, action-oriented Fincher ("Se7en", "Fight Club", "Zodiac") at the helm, the surprise is that he pulls off the movie without sacrificing his dark-edged, soulful film-making style.Based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald ("The Great Gatsby"), the fanciful story centers on Benjamin Button, who is born in New Orleans on the night of that World War I officially ends. His mother dies after childbirth, and upon seeing his age-withered son, the father leaves Benjamin on the back steps of a local retirement home. The barren caretaker Queenie takes the baby in without condition even though Benjamin has the symptoms of an elderly man - arthritis, cataracts, deafness. Defying the odds, he continues to live as an old man growing younger by the day. In the midst of this odd existence enters Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the residents, who is immediately drawn to the aged Benjamin. Realizing they are destined for each other despite the initially discomfiting circumstances, they move in completely different directions for the next several years. Daisy becomes a promising dancer in New York City, while Benjamin becomes a tugboat sailor experiencing war, romance, and his budding manhood. It's inevitable that they intersect, but given that their life paths are moving them in opposite, intractable directions, the issue becomes how long can they truly stay together.While Brad Pitt fits the physical dimensions of the part well, especially with the assistance of expert make-up and CGI effects, I think he falls a bit short in conveying the nuance of his watchful character. There is an opaqueness in his performance that makes me wonder if there is much to the character beyond his extraordinary medical circumstances. Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, captures the restless vigor of Daisy well and effectively shows the evolving resignation her character faces as she grows older and he younger. On opposing timelines, both actors are required to age from 20 to over 80, and neither displays the predictable affectation that would otherwise mar their work here. There is standout work on the sidelines - Tilda Swinton as the lonely, wealthy wife of a British diplomat who embarks on a clandestine affair with Benjamin while he is stationed in Moscow, and best of all, Taraji P. Henson (memorable as the simpering Shug in "Hustle and Flow"), who plays Queenie well beyond stereotype into a genuinely heartwarming character. There are some amazing scenes such as the wartime sequence at sea, as well as humorous interludes like the lightning-prone man. The ending feels a bit rushed, though the framing device with the reverse-clockmaker lends surprising resonance to the central love story.</fullReview>

Lots of movies have weird stories but when watching till the end you don't feel it was weird and you may believe and live the story... but this one I always felt it was weird didn't believe or live it at all! Well I do believe this movie is over rated and it doesn't deserve all this Oscar nominations! I do agree it deserves the Oscar for makeup and maybe Cinematography but nothing else... Brad Pitt acting was good but he doesn't deserve an Oscar for it! The movie is long 166 mins, It turned really boring in the last hour and a half!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank heavens I watched this on a screener so I could fast forward! Two hours and 46 minutes, I thought this movie would never end. It's no secret, this film is the story of a guy that ages backwards. Told from the perspective of flashbacks from a diary being read to a woman on her deathbed. He's born an ugly old, wrinkled, and arthritic baby in a scene that reminded me of "It's Alive" (people look at the baby and gasp from fear). The first part of the movie is like an extended "Twilight Zone" episode. And then the film continues on to tell his life story; touching, sensitive, and emotional throughout. He has many life experiences, but always goes back to his childhood sweetheart (his childhood being a 12 year old that looked like Dick Cheney). It is, obviously, a love story. But Benjamin knows he is aging backwards and doesn't want to burden his sweetheart with his old age (which in his case will be {SPOILER ALERT} an infant with dementia) so he splits, only to be found later as a demented boy and cared for by her anyway. I have not read F. Scott Fitzgerald's book so I don't know how true the movie is to the story. But I do know that this movie could have told the story in much less than 166 minutes. It's just too darn long, and the length (in my opinion) undermines the enjoyability if the film because some scenes just drag on. Fincher has done some excellent work in the past and it seems his goal was to outdo himself on this film. Sometimes less is better. The makeup, score, and cinematography are great. But if I was a member of AMPAS this would not be my choice for the Best Picture Oscar. Slumdog Millionaire tells a love story and story of growing up in less time, and with exceptional cinematography, a better screenplay, and fantastic performances by actors I have never heard of. It gets my vote (if I had one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film quite a lot, but I have a lot of complaints. I felt the beginning was top notch, interesting, and made me think the whole film was going to be great. However, the film slowly eased off and got progressively worse as it went on. I noticed this when the person I was sitting next to (who originally looked quite engaged) was asleep. One of the strengths of the beginning was the amount of fantastic characters with interesting stories. As the film went on, the minor characters slowly disappeared, until all that remained were the two leads. At the end of the film it shows all of the characters, and NONE of them were introduced after the second half, they were all from the beginning. That was a clear sign of weakness. The second half seemed to be more of a quick explanation on what happened to Benjamin. It was frustrating that the second half was quick and didn't do anything more, and after choosing to go to a long film, you would expect for a good finish. But it wasn't. Another part of the film I thought that weakened it was the lack of purpose. No real message was gotten out of the film. Nothing to leave you with. It was a pretty simple story, and it was entertaining, but moving - no way. And for a heavy Oscar favorite, I would expect a bit better. Not to mention it's insane similarity to Forrest Gump, but that's another story.A generous 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overblown ode to indulgence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever Paramount wanted an alternate title for the lengthy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, they might want to think about Try Hard. Director David Fincher (Zodiac) and screenwriter Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) pull out all the stops in their quest to create a profound movie masterwork, so much so that I'm surprised the movie didn't come with an advertising budget to festoon theater lobbies with neon signs saying "this way to greatness". It's the cinematic equivalent of the keener kid in class who's always got his hand up trying to win the teacher's attention, or the publicity hound seen jumping up and down in the background of news clips to get noticed.Loosely based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1921 short story, Button tells the tale of a child born prematurely old who ages in reverse. The story is designed to show the capriciousness of life, and pounds home the point that we each must seize the day and make the most of each moment, lest we find ourselves looking back on what could have been and wishing we'd done things differently. The problem is, this theme is established fairly early on and keeps being hammered away at the audience for close to three hours.Fincher practically throws the entire cinematic art school cliché canon up on the screen, repeatedly using nature's elements such as looming thunderstorms and hurricanes to foreshadow troubled narrative stanzas, and resplendent sunrises and downy snowfalls as backdrops for other life changing sequences. It works, and is refreshingly pleasant up to a point, given how Fincher is at least making an effort to layer into the story an artistic quality not often seen in Hollywood pictures, but when the same well is tapped multiple times over three hours it becomes akin to silver-screen pablum, and left me feeling as if I was being spoon-fed by filmmakers who thought they were smarter than the audience by half.Roth's screenplay follows a structure similar to Forrest Gump, with Button's life broken down into stages, each recounting his life as recorded in his diary. Like Gump, the story introduces a collection of diverse offbeat characters, each of them an archetype ranging from a seductive lonely wife (Tilda Swinton) to a wise and brash grizzled sea captain (Jared Harris), who school Button in various aspects of life. It's in these diverse segments that the movie manages to entertain the viewer and hold interest. One passage, in which Button recounts how one small event, similar to the butterfly effect, radically impacted the life of his great love Daisy (Cate Blanchette), is a sequence of genuinely inspired storytelling. Unfortunately much of what else is offered either goes on far too long, or could have been expedited or excised entirely, thus tightening a story that appears over-indulgent and full of its own self importance.There's a reason why Fitzgerald chose the short story format to tell his tale. If only Fincher and Roth had followed his lead the end result might have been better.Oh to look back upon what might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching if Very Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a beautiful, touching, and very flawed film. The plot is touching, and the performances all affective, and the film is generally well done, but it is flawed, mostly I believe to the screenplay. Like many of Roths previous films there is an overabundance of sub-plots. The film is to long, but that isn't only it. Large chunks of the film seem disjointed from the rest of the picture, and as far as I'm concerned the most dramatic of these are the many scenes where Ormond reads the story to a dieing Blanchett. Still Benjamin Button is a very good film, mostly due to what the actors did, Pitt and Blanchett are great in their respective lead rolls, and Taraji P. Henson more then steals the film as Pitts mother. Also much of the film is very touching, I just wish Roth had written a better screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bicurious Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a phrase I rarely use: 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is one of the most overrated movies of the year, as 'Atonement' was last year. What easily could have been a 'Forrest Gump' remake, 'Button' stars Brad Pitt as a man aging backwards ? interesting concept enough, but thoroughly uninteresting, spiteful character. By the end of the film, all that we gathered was that he liked playing the piano, alcohol and sex with multiple women, married or not, despite having a 'Jenny' (from 'Forrest') complex for Cate Blanchett (who, coincidentally, also doesn't mind fooling around while married.) I believe the movie was trying to be the next 'Forrest' but failed on many counts, including lack of heart and (interesting) characters to believe in or care about. I could never get into Pitt's character, as he starts out wholesome as 'Forrest' but then shows a completely aimless, selfish and shallow personality. And one of the things that irked me the most, just when he had everything he ever wanted, he leaves due to his "condition" of aging backwards, when I knew then, and the final half hour proved, he had plenty of time left with the life he would leave behind. If this was supposed to be a lesson in "acceptance" for differences in people, he learned basically nothing in his extremely meaningless life. And the worse scenes involved a speech-impaired Blanchett (not telling, but) listening to the 'Button' story. 'Titanic' got it right by narrowing its "older-Rose" scenes to but a few, not every 10 minutes. Now, the good: the special effects, background sets, score and cinematography were excellent, as they were for 'Atonement.' Overall, neither was terrible, but lacked the heart that would make them great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked 'Forest Gump', you'll probably like it, and if you didn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>you probably won't like this one either. Personally, I didn't - but I'll give this movie a 6 (would have gone 5.5 if half stars were allowed, rounding up) because it isn't pure junk, obviously not low budget. But it's no 'masterpiece' either.The parallels to Gump are the style of narration by an odd character, the characters he encounters along the way (tug boat captain very close parallel to Gumps' Vietnam Lt.), as well as pointless asides for a set up (lady swimming the channel). Like Gump, the movie plays at the expense of some segments of society. (Gump, being slow people, B Button being old people portrayed as physically unattractive, even scary. B Pitt will most likely age far better in real life than this movie portrayed 'his older self' - most people do. The movie seemed to glorify youth) Like Gump, the movie has some forced emotionalism, at the end, B Button presents some flat statements as something profound.There's also the positive portrayal of some bad morality, B Button's old girlfriend cheating on her new husband, with seemingly no regret whatsoever.Beyond the 'Gump' comparisons, what could be an interesting period piece gets bogged down in 2 hours spent not even getting out of the early 1940s. This is a 60 minute idea, played out in over 2 1/2 hours.And the obvious plausibility flaws about reducing size at both ends of life.But credit where credit is due, it does have a few redeeming points about life - that a chain of seemingly random events can change someone's life (segment where the woman's dancing career is ended.) And the point where the right people might cross paths at the wrong time (B Button visiting New York).As far as the acting goes, I think they're pretty much playing out the dictates of the script. I really don't know what more they could have done with it.I'm rarely aware of editing, or even think about it. But an improved movie could be made by cutting 1/2 hour our of the first half, I think it was poorly edited.I had never heard of this movie, 1 hour prior to seeing it, it was a last minute invite. The Gump comparisons were made by myself and my group immediately after the show - there was no prior suggestion of it from anyone else. Yet, clearly many people came to the same conclusion.I said in my review of Forest Gump (on IMDb), that I wouldn't pick the movie, but I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against it with a group of friends who really wanted to see it either. I think that applies here too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning and beguiling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a long time since I sat through a movie of such length and became so beguiled.The film could have continued for a further hour with no complaint from me. Hollywood has shown an understandable reluctance in recent years to produce slow action motion pictures of such duration for fear of them being shunned as European-style art house. That this movie works so well is down to the brilliant and sensitive interpretation of an intriguing story. The direction,script and acting are first class. The wonderful 'aging' of the Brad Pitt character is riveting and presumably one reason why no studio has attempted to film this Fitzgerald book earlier. Brad Pitt should win an Oscar for his performance. Cate Blanchett similarly although I fear 2009 could be Brangelina year</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was not magical, OK at best...... not even</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this was OK, a little worse than OK i don't want to be too mean because it wasn't too bad or awful or anything like that. i wasn't expecting much going into the theater. Because of all the stupid hype for this movie i knew it wasn't going to be that good. for one thing it didn't need to be too long, there were some scenes that were, well not pointless but dragged out. during the movie i was just like OK come on already we get the point. but the one thing that bugged me the most about this was that they never clearly told u the dates or Benjamin's age, real age and age he appeared. brad Pitt said it once but right when he said it a lady coughed and i couldn't hear. come on just put the date in the corner of the screen or something like most movies. SPOILER:the other thing that really annoyed me was that i thought that since when he was born he was a baby, baby size, and baby mind, But just looked like an old man, that when he aged into his actual baby years he would have wisdom like a sixty year old or a seventy year old but know he was just a normal sized kid who was immature and acted his age, when he was seven years into his life, and had a seven year brain but old body, he was small and immature and acted like a seven year old, SO WHY Didn't HE ACT LIKE A 70 YEAR OLD WHEN HE APPEARED SEVEN it just doesn't make sense, and when daisy announces that she is pregnant she says "u were born 49 years ago and i am 43 were almost the same age" if he was born i don't know in his 80's i think because it never really tells u, then right now he would in his thirties, which means they already crossed ages, unless i missed something that just didn't make sense. but if she meant something else by it, like he is currently 49, and was born i don't know lets say 31 years ago, then hey your 49, you only raise kids till there 18 so lets do the math 49 - 18 = 31 and he left because he didn't want daisy to raise both kids HEY MORON you would be 31 i think u can still take care of yourself. and the scene when he comes back when the daughter in 13 lets do the math again shall we. 49 - 13 = 36 they made him look so much more younger that he should of been, so please someone correct me on this maybe i missed something because if i didn't the makers of this film need some math lessons.SORRY ABOUT TYPOS</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Hollywood style or A Tribute to New Orleans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the Fitzgerald story as a premise, the movie attempts to weave a love story around it. Since Hollywood is bereft of experiential knowledge of what true love actually looks like, they predictably insert a series of affairs (fornication) in its place. Set mostly in New Orleans, the viewer is expected to view fornication and infidelity (adultery) as normal, natural expressions of love. The predictable result: no commitment, empty sentimentality, no heart, no soul--a perfect reflection of Hollywood itself--flat as celluloid.Exceptions: Queenie, Benjamin's adoptive mother; a mother's love; she takes him in despite his looks and always remains a mother to him. Captain Mike--a kind of Lieutenant Dan Taylor reincarnation (Forrest Gump)--displays sacrificial love.Other observations: A visual work of art, even a masterpiece (train station, boarding house, brothel, Russian hotel, tugboat, New York Ballet, summer house). New Orleans life and culture are interesting. In fact, all that is fascinating about this movie is completely incidental to its very poor, long, boring, and boorish script.The movie attempts to retain some light humor, but misses the element of farce. Besides its title and the character's name, and the premise, a man ages backwards, the film bears no resemblance to Fitzgerald's short story whatsoever, which, ironically, can be read in about twenty minutes (It's hilarious!). Even the setting, New Orleans, is different, and the movie is clearly, in part, meant to be a kind of tribute to that city, as is born out at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smash masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At nearly three hours, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button can be a little difficult to get through, considering there are hardly any explosions and not a hobbit in sight. It&#x2019;s the kind of movie you have to prepare yourself for mentally, to sort of gird yourself against the slow - and I mean slow - scenes as the norm, not the exception. But if you are willing to invest the time and to commit to the film as a whole, the experience is enriching, beautiful, touching, and fascinating, in large part because of two stellar lead performances, by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story, the movie concerns the life of the title character, who was born with what&#x2019;s judiciously called in the movie a reverse-aging disease; that is, he&#x2019;s born with the physical characteristics of an old man, and as time passes he looks younger and younger. You can just imagine the wacky shenanigans that commence! But this isn&#x2019;t a comedy. It&#x2019;s a deeply affecting, layered movie about not only the aging process itself - who among us hasn&#x2019;t fantasized about being younger than we are now - but also the effect we have on the people around us, even peripherally. It&#x2019;s also about loss and hope and death and unfettered romance. So yeah, it&#x2019;s kind of a chick flick.Oh, but what a chick flick! I have to say that even though this is the longest non-action movie I&#x2019;ve ever seen, it&#x2019;s very compelling. Director David Fincher - who worked with Pitt on Seven and Fight Club - had a dilemma right from the get-go: How do you tell a story when everyone knows how it ends? Sure, this isn&#x2019;t based on a true-life event or anything, but the basic premise tells you everything: Man is born old, dies as a baby. So you know he eventually dies. How does the director get from A to B without seeing his audience doze off? By operating within the framework of the quirky premise itself. Everything you or I experiences in life, we experience as a linear process: A, then B, then C, and so on. Benjamin Button goes from Z to Y to X, and so on, but there are greater implications - and complications - than simply doing everything in reverse. For one thing, Benjamin has the unique problem of watching people he loves grow old and die while he gets younger. For another, he has to deal with people believing he&#x2019;s an infirm old man when he&#x2019;s a naive preteen.At the heart of the story, though, is the loves of Benjamin, particularly a troika of women: his adoptive mother Queenie, played by Taraji P. Henson; Elizabeth, the wife of a high-ranking Briton in Russia, played by the elegant Tilda Swinton; and Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the women residing in the old-folks home where Benjamin was raised, played by Elle Fanning as a girl and Blanchett as a grownup. Benjamin experiences all of his love in a way that none of us ever has or ever could. He looks experienced, but he&#x2019;s not, and easing into adulthood as the rest of us might isn&#x2019;t quite on the menu. It&#x2019;d be baffling enough to do things sort of out of order, but since Benjamin has no frame of reference, he&#x2019;s not sure what&#x2019;s right and what&#x2019;s not so right.There are many people out there who solemnly swear that Brad Pitt just plain stinks as an actor, that he basically plays the same grinning doofus in every movie. I don&#x2019;t think this has been the case for a long time, perhaps back as far as Thelma and Louise, as Pitt&#x2019;s taken on more and more tough, detailed roles. Don&#x2019;t believe me? Check out Babel, for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Or Seven Years in Tibet, or Fight Club, or the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. The man isn&#x2019;t just a pretty boy, and I think it&#x2019;s sort of prejudicial to label him as such when he&#x2019;s clearly better than that.Cate Blanchett, by positive comparison, completely nails the role of Daisy. Blanchett is an attractive woman, but she&#x2019;s never been called the sexiest woman alive, or some such nonsense. Her exuberance, her dedication to her craft, and her willingness to play unglamorous roles make her arguably the greatest actress of her generation. She&#x2019;s exquisitely wonderful here, playing a complex character who ages somewhat gracefully but always, always believably. Her anguish at seeing her true love look better and better while she (she feels) looks worse and worse is compounded by her dread at knowing what lies at the end of the path, for while she&#x2019;ll probably die just as millions others before her have, at a ripe old age, the man who makes her heart soar will perish under the most unfamiliar of circumstances, possibly not even knowing of the grand life he&#x2019;s led.The movie is told within a framework of Blanchett&#x2019;s now-aged character on her death bed, during a hurricane, while her adult daughter reads from her diary - well, really, from Benjamin&#x2019;s diary, ensconced inside Daisy&#x2019;s. The daughter is played by Julia Ormond, who I mistook for Lolita Davidovich. I haven&#x2019;t seen Ormond in anything since I think Sabrina, and she looks fantastic; the scenes between her and Blanchett were heart-rending; Fincher used silence - and the approaching storm as background - with precision to greatest effect.As for me, although the movie is long and necessarily lags in spots - there&#x2019;s only one action scene, but it&#x2019;s a doozy (if a tad unbelievable, even for this movie) - it&#x2019;s ultimately very satisfying, delivering on its premise in creative, bold, and mesmerizing fashion. It&#x2019;s not going to be for everyone, I would think, but it&#x2019;s beautifully told and very well acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, yeah, the story of Brad Pitt aging backwards, how good could it be?Well, very good, apparently. This movie was just so long and detailed, sucking the viewer in immediately and keeping them hooked. It made you think, too. The whole concept of time and aging and the fact that nothing lasts forever was executed flawlessly. It was a look at life from a new perspective, full of all the beauty and the embarrassments and the trivial things and the quirks and everything else.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a riveting and intricate drama that will certainly remain enjoyable and powerful long after one viewing, and this is certainly one you'll want to go back and watch again. I haven't seen a movie this original and stirring in ages, and the way it takes a standard formula, a good old life story like you'd read in someone's autobiography, and creatively tweaks it with all the strange little nuances of Benjamin's curious condition is spellbinding. The combination of the surreal with the familiar, of the strange with the heartwarming and the personal, does exceptionally well, crafting an emotional behemoth of a movie that you need to see at any cost if you like good film making at all.I think I've found my movie of the year. See it. See it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been wanting to watch this movie and when my friend invited me to watch it, i gladly accepted. Then i found out that it was going to be almost 3 hours long and i didn't think that the movie would hold my attention for that long but boy was i wrong. By the time the movie was over i felt like i had been in there just for 30 minutes. In my opinion it a masterpiece and Brad Pitt definitely deserves an Oscar. It's not just a movie about a man aging backwards, it shows us the meaning of true love and how precious life is. It is one of the best movies of the year and possibly one of the best i have ever watched. It is worth every buck you spend on it and Brad's &amp; Cate's performances are flawless. Couldn't have picked better actors to play the part. It is a must see and i must admit Brad Pitt does look gorgeous even as a 80 year old man. I made my mom go watch it and she is very picky about which movies she likes but she loved this one. She's not a fan of Brad Pitt either but she said that with this movie he really does live up to his name.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with the movie since it contained many unrealistic scenes in addition to unusual story itself. For example, the hero saw the World War II, then somehow he was in Minsk, etc. It seemed as if director aimed to surprise the audience by all possible and impossible means.With all respect to great actor Pitt, I did not like his playing as well since he looked as if he pushed himself to believe into the story but finally did not and acted not easy and naturally as he used to in his other movies. He looked not confident and distracted for me. However, Cate Blanchett was perfect and it helped to continue watching.The other thing that killed me was that I spent 3 hours in a movie theater (20 min of previews + 2h 40 m of the movie).I wish all the fake scenes would be cut off. I think this story should be kept simple because the life of this man is unusual itself and if it would be shown from his point of view to love and life only, without fantastic occasions, it would be nicer. Otherwise, it reminds a bad copy of Forrest Gump.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The curious case of Benjamin Button is a truly amazing dedication to life and how you should live it. David Fincher's amazing drama tells the story of a man named Benjamin Button, Benjamin isn't like other kids his age. In fact he's like nothing the world has ever seen before, He was a man born old, and as time went by Benjamin started to get younger and younger while the people around him get older and die. The curious case of Benjamin Button is a celebration about the meaning of living life to it's fullest. It's an inspiration to all people young and old that just because your getting older doesn't mean you can't live life like there's no tomorrow. I very,very highly recommended this truly exceptional film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest movies in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dear Mr. Fincher. You have proved to me that humanity is a species worth saving. I will return in a thousand years to test you again. Fare thee well, earthmen." The above might very well have been an alien watching this movie. It certainly sums up many of my feelings after having watched it.I won't go into details about the actual plot, most of you know the deal with Benjamin Button being born old and dying young. What you might not know yet, is that in between those two events, you'll experience numerous moments of awe, despair, sorrow, sadness, humor and sheer enjoyment.The story is adapted from a short story and is one of the most engrossing I've watched in a long time. Clocking in at about 160 minutes, you'd forgive the movie for having a few dead periods. But it never does. It's as if not a single second could have been shaved off it. Respect to Eric Roth for the story, but with movies like Forrest Gump, Munich and The Good Shepherd, it's no surprise.As for the much discussed effects, they are plentiful. But none of them gets in the way. On the contrary. They are added with graceful subtlety, making for wonderful and fantastic pictures. I am not quite sure what it is about the sceneries in the movie that is so wonderful. But they are thick full of atmosphere and everything ooze detail and handicraft at its best.Much credit should also be paid to the soundtrack. The story stretches over a long period and the music is matched to every period, as well as the wonderful score.Brad Pitt narrates and plays Benjamin Button - save for the end. Special effects was applied to make him older and younger. With marvelous results. He acts - as always - strikingly well. I'm not a particularly big fan of him, but a performance like this deserves recognition. And he does have a pleasing voice.Lastly, I must point towards the always enchanting Cate Blanchett who is absolutely wonderful in this movie. It is rare to see a woman of such classical beauty. As she gets older in the movie, she just seems more and more graceful.In the end, I felt like reversing time and watch the movie all over again, getting more of the beautiful details and dialog.Thanks for a wonderful viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A completely wonderful experience! Really, the best film experiences are the hardest to fully describe, and I'm having difficulty surmising into words just what an amazing film this is. As you have probably seen from the trailer, it's the story of a man who is born in his 80's and ages backwards. No medical explanation is attempted for this "unusual circumstance". Director Fincher perfectly captures the magical life of Button, and really the magic of life itself. I guess you could say it poses quite a few philosophical questions on death, life and love, but in no way is it pretentious or attention-grabbing. We are just encouraged to enjoy every experience. Brad Pitt is excellent in the title role; if he doesn't get an Academy Award nomination I will eat my hat. The next best performances come from Taraji P. Henson (as Benjamin's adoptive mother) and Tilda Swinson, as an English socialite who Button has an affair with. Unfortunately Cate Blanchett is terribly mannered and so self-important and actressy as Daisy, the great love of Benjamin's life. It's a wonderful romance, and I loved every bit of it, but Blanchett, especially in her early scenes as a sort of bohemian ballerina, lacks exactly what Pitt seems to emit effortlessly- being natural. Every bit of her performance seems so carefully studied. But I can't leave this review on a negative note, because it's such an amazing movie. A true testament as to how good this film is? It went for 2 hours, 40 minutes. I could easily have sat there for another two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to viewing, I was mildly curious if I would be able to suspend reality enough to buy the premise of this movie. Soon into the movie, however, this became a non-issue, as I was mesmerized by the acting and the story. There is a sense of ease in this movie, both in the viewer's sense of time passing and in the story itself.The casting is perfect. Brad Pitt skilfully underplays his role in much the same way as in Mr. Black. Cate Blanchett is nothing short of superb as Daisy. The remainder of the characters are also richly cast, with notable performances by Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson, and Jared Harris.If I had to sum up the theme of this movie, I would say that it is an unusual study in mortality. It is a very easy movie to watch - a richly told story that never drags. It is so rich with characters and events that I wondered if the entire story would wrap up in the long runtime of 2 hours 47 minutes.In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. I will probably view it again at some later date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "the curious case of Benjamin Button" is without question THE must see epic of 2008. At just under three hours this movie presents everything (all the highs and lows) that life has to offer. With the interesting concept of growing in the opposite direction.No movie has more successfully looked at the old belief of "youth being wasted on the young" in such a unique way and David Fincher manages to surpass all previous work with this amazingly brilliant looking film, successfully representing the time period to unbelievable detail. And the main stars, Brad Pitt as Benjamin and Cate Blanchett as Daisy, provides some of the best performances not only of the year but of their own respective careers. It also must be noted the amazing SFX that are seen in this movie, usually films of this genre don't tend to need any CGI but this film uses it to achieve staggeringly unbelievable effects.In a year of spectacular surprises (WALL-E and The Dark Knight) and lackluster disappointments (Australia and Quantum of solace) it is good to go to the cinema one last time before 09 and see one of , if not the best, films of the last twelve months.Expect this to dominate every awards ceremony in the new year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can always count on Hollywood to turn even a silly sounding concept into a masterpiece of a movie. For me, Button is the movie to beat in 2008. It succeeds on many fronts and is a pure best picture contender.The movie is filled with good performances, most notably Brad Pitt. His was not a performance of explosive dialog but one that required expressions that told us what he was experiencing; and he did an excellent job. The characters brought alive the various emotions in the story, which built its way to become a poignant tragedy.David Fincher took the movie to another level using a fantastic storytelling technique, and he can be thankful to the spectacular cinematography which made the movie look so rich and alive. The movie had an excellent blend of humor as well, which was a perfect aid for its long running time.The style of the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump in some ways i.e. it was a story about life with a unique perspective; and just like Gump it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't enjoy tearjerkers, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't for you, Wow, I haven't cried this much at a film in a long time. I brought my boyfriend's teenage sister and we shared a good, cry fest.I know a lot of people have commented on the length of the film. Yes, it is long but I feel that it was necessary to bring the depth needed to get personally involved with the characters. The character development was excellent; relationships weren't just assumed.There are really two stories in the film. The first is the obvious one, a man aging backwards, but just as much of the story is devoted to a little girl as she transforms into a superficial young women, then into maturity. It was a great contrast to really explore what a person goes through while aging (enhanced with amazing make up and acting).There's tragedy in the film but there's also comic relief so you never get the feeling of hopelessness while watching. There are some beautiful, erotic dance scenes that are somehow also tasteful which I wasn't expecting. It's hard to describe. You'll have to see the film to understand.I honestly feel that saying Benjamin Button is the same as Forrest Gump is unfair. The only thing the characters have in common is being born with disadvantages and having someone believe in them. That's all though. Benjamin Button isn't a fairy tale and is no where near as light-hearted as Forest Gump (which was a relief). The two movies have a completely different tone to them. Benjamin Button is more of a parable about aging and loss. Button is an intelligent man, fully aware of his disadvantages and the pain it may cause.On a lighter note, there's also great costuming. They really got the look and clothing of the time periods right (and there are a lot of time periods). The 1930s, 1940s and 1950s dresses were distinct and correct for each decade. I wouldn't be surprised if the film won some awards for its flawlessness.Benjamin Button wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be either. It was a very nice, solid film. Definitely worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's easy to compare the plot to other films. The amazing thing about the main character here, is not what he does, which is nothing special, or what happens to him, most able-bodied men got caught up in the war, it's how he lives his life.Benjamin Button is born handicapped (think Forrest Gump's "magic legs") He stands for the first time when confronted by a faith healer, who then dies of a heart attack (an episode of "House"). He misses his chance to be with the woman he loves at least 3 times (Like Water for Chocolate). He gets to spend the middle of his life with the woman of his dreams (the beginning of many films where one or the other has something awful happen to them), then fades into obscurity as he grows younger (this is new, but we don't get to watch).We need to believe that Benjamin's life is tied to a clock made by a blind clockmaker that runs backward, even though they never met, the clock was started before Benjamin was born, and it continues to work even when unplugged and put in storage after he dies (we see a huge, intricate power source earlier in the movie). This clock that runs backward is left in a train station from 1918 until 2002 even though it is only right 4 times a day, and probably causes countless numbers of people to miss their trains. Benjamin is confined to a wheelchair, nearly blind, nearly deaf, and has hair like the Crypt Keeper at 84. I know many people over 80 who are in much better condition, but it was, after all, 1918.It sounds like I'm panning the movie with all these criticisms, but I actually loved it. It made me glad to be aging with my friends and relatives, instead of growing younger and watching them die. It also makes me feel that middle age isn't so bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never get this 2-3/4 hour of my life back and that makes me angry. Actually, it was more than that because I kept falling asleep, so I had to keep going back and starting sections over again, trying to stay awake the second time around. The only stars of this movie were the make-up and special effects, and while the F/X were OK, the makeup was awful and distracting. To my thinking, the aging (Cate forward and Brad backward) wasn't consistent with the time frame of the story. And it makes no sense that Brad's body ages backward but, apparently, his mind ages the normal way, so that he suffers dementia during his "childhood." Cate's various scenes as a dying old lady are badly written and the dialogue is nearly impossible to hear or understand. In the end, does she become one of the elderly who died in hospitals during Katrina? Is the message that all of those poor people had great stories like this one and so their deaths were truly tragic? What an absolute crock! If there were a lower rating than 1 star, that's what I'd give this complete waste of time and talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand. I don't get it...If you wanted an award so badly you should have come to me. I would have given you an Oscar for Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, Zodiac... your amazing movies have your beautiful, one-of-a-kind visuals and outrageous twists. Hell I would have given you an Oscar just for the Rolling Stones' trippy "Love Is Strong" video. Everything you've done up to "Button" was genius...But David Fincher's "Curious Case of Benjamin Button" was a serious case of Academy-Fever, a disease for which there is no cure. Brad Pitt stars as an Old Baby who ages backward- a fantastic concept which only two characters in the film even notice. Brilliant CGI is used to transform Benjamin from dull elderly cripple to dull Kennedyesque hottie and- like screenwriter Eric Roth's other vapid creation Forrest Gump- Button does and says as little as possible in a heroic attempt to stay BLANK. (I don't want to give away the ending but he wins.) Besides boasting one of my favorite directors and favorite actors this movie also stars one of my favorite actresses- Cate Blanchett- who gets to dance with the body of a 19 year old. I've never seen a picture so visually rich with so little to say... what's the premise of "Button?" That youth is wasted on the young? Benji gets the best of both worlds but still manages to avoid smiling. I barely made it through the movie's 2:46 run-time and I cannot think of a reason to ever sit through it again.Today's lesson: even Gods stumble. Please, Mr. Fincher: go back to making films of violence and depravity and schizophrenia...You know, for the kids...GRADE: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar-aesthetics overshadow what could have been a thought provoking story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I have to say one thing: ?The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" goes on for long enough that it won't leave you completely cold if you've made it all the way to the end. However, the movie drags on too much. Very often I found myself wishing that the story would move along quicker and I couldn't wait for Pitt's character to get younger and finally die.Maybe, "Benjamin Button" was just too conventional for my taste. The score, the cinematography, the lines of dialog (which are incredibly clichéd and humdrum in certain parts) all seemed to scream: ?Please, please Academy. Give us the Golden Statue!" Even though I wasn't much of a fan of ?Slumdog Millionaire", at least that movie had its own original aesthetics and wasn't a run-of-the-mill Oscar-nominee.Speaking of a lack of originality: Am I the only one who sees more than just a few parallels to ?Forrest Gump"? Benjamin Button is the gentle Outcast who experiences all sorts of adventures through the years, one of them on a ship, not unlike Forrest on his shrimp boat. There he meets a captain, not too different from Lieutenant Dan. Benjamin has this erratic love interest in Cate Blanchett's character, just like Gump has in Jenny. The movie has a reoccuring symbol (the bluebird), as does ?Forrest Gump" (the feather), and the ?Life is like a box of chocolate: You never know what you're gonna get"-catchphrase here is ?You never know what's comin' for ya" and so on and so forth. More than just a few similarities, if you ask me.This definitely doesn't mean that ?Benjamin Button" is completely worthless. It has some nice ideas (the aforementioned bluebird as a symbol for infinity, the clock that's running backwards) and the screenplay is clever, but all in all the kitschy cinematography, the dramatic setting with Hurricane Katrina waiting to happen, all of that is just a bit too glossy and conventional for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great make up, cinematography, poor direction, casting and horrible editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, it was brilliant to see set design and make-up of the highest class and that should be applauded but the actual film was a short story padded out for around 3 hours such that much of the movie is in fact, very boring. Before I take the positives in the movie itself, there are two aspects that both ruin the film and more importantly, increase the running time by around an hour.Firstly, the casting of Tilda Swinton is just awful. I can appreciate the reasons why the director wanted her in the movie, she's beautiful, and a great actress, but, after likely rejecting her in favour of Cate Blanchett, should have waited for another film before hiring Swinton instead of giving her a completely inconsequential part that has no substance and has no impact on the story.Secondly, the constant reverting back to the lead in the hospital re-counting the story. This kind of scenario has been played out hundreds of times before, and much better. In these sequences, the film simply meanders to nowhere in particular before you are transported back in time. The meandering sequences in the hospital conservatively last around 20 minutes which could easily have been done in 2 or 3 minutes with better dialogue.Both of these facets of the film almost completely ruined the film for me but that is not to say the film doesn't have its redeeming features.Firstly, the film does a very nice job of approaching Hurricane Katrina in a way that is oblique but at the same time handles the upcoming devastation with some very good handiwork from the camera.Secondly, Brad Pitt's performance is great. He loves his accents (a la Snatch) and he's up for it here too, but as someone said earlier, his character simply isn't likable enough to be overly sympathetic with him although there are some real comedic moments and these are done well.To sum up, it's an overly long film with several great moments, it's not Oscar winning material by any means (as a picture, it is Oscar-material as far as a costume drama goes) but it is reasonable and that is well above the Hollywood average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well if the movie wasn't for you it wasn't for you, and if you have received nothing from this movie then please move on. A simple not for me will suffice, I for one thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I give it a 10/10. This movie showed a man who did struggle as many of us do yet he was able to deal with his situation much more maturely and rationally than most people can do for themselves in their "normal" lives. It is really a shame that more people do not live like this man or at least take away from this cinematic experience. Though this film did not bring tears to my eyes I do not believe that it was meant to; for throughout his eventual lifespan his life was far to good for it to be a sob story. Despite the growing old of his wife and his continual aging into youth the story cannot be sad because at their last moment together they know who they are. I am neither here to criticize or bash anyone for their reasoning if they did not enjoy this movie, but if this movie had not moved you in some way then perhaps wait a while to collect and try again, it often works if I have ever believed to have missed something. No matter this movie is pure A+ grade material and i recommend it for those who believe it is a worthwhile pursuit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON works best when thought of as a sort of fantasy or fairy tale rather than a complex science fiction about the Chaos Theory and Time. It is essentially a heartwarming and compellingly engrossing Motion Picture that one surely has to see to believe. There is no wonder that comparisons have been made with FORREST GUMP, as they are essentially similar-type movies. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON takes a life of its own, however, especially after the hour mark, when Brad Pitt appears. FORREST GUMP was perhaps a better film overall, but THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is more thought-provoking, and there are various hidden elements and undertones pervading the wonderful story and script.David Fincher infuses his own dark style of direction that many have come to love (myself included; both FIGHT CLUB and SE7EN feature well in my Top 20) though this may be his most lighthearted film to date. His nomination for Best Director was undoubtedly deserved.Brad Pitt is adequate but not really outstanding, and I can think of a few performances that should have been given the nomination over his. It is not for a lack of effort on his part; it's just that he lacks the requisite range for such a complex character. His portrayal of the young Button is youthful and energetic, but not as an old and experienced man trapped inside a young man's body. Likewise, his portrayal of the old Button is that of a feeble and weakened man, and not that of a young man trapped inside an old man's fragile body. The story of Benjamin Button is supposed to be a melancholy one in hindsight, and Pitt lacks that sense of melancholy that such a unique and difficult character should exhibit. His nomination did not come as a surprise but it is unlikely that it will result in victory.THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON stands a better chance of winning the technical awards rather than the acting, directing, and writing ones. The movie is simply beautiful, and should not be missed. The screenplay is intelligent and well-constructed. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is an excellent film that warrants discussion. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 192. Unreservedly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Novel Idea, slow winding Narrative with Decent Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button runs an overlong 167 min and unfortunately starts to feel it's runtime in effect losing pull towards the end, but the pacing and storyline for the 1st half of the movie are still very-good. Around the 2/3 point though there aren't too many questions left unanswered and the story has the hasty additions of characters and acceleration of time. The humor is here and there, but vacant mostly when Benjamin grows into middle age. The best performance by far is by Taraji P Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother who stands head-and-shoulders above most of the cast including the leads. Brad Pitt's character is mostly aloof and unemotional, but self effacing in a way similar to Tom Hanks Forrest Gump. The love story mostly feels obligatory but has some interesting moments such as some of the later dialog. Cate Blanchett does a good job, bringing in a bit more emotions. Early scenes within the care-home and during Benjamin's first 20 years were much more interesting making it overall a solid outing with high marks for the novelty and performances. Music too is sometimes very good and moody fitting well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Film of Wondrous Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was extremely interested in seeing this movie, especially when it received a staggering 13 Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Leading Actor. I was so interested in seeing this that I trudged through knee-deep snow for a hour to get to the cinema, and ended up with frozen feet. But it was worth it. I have often said that the Academy Awards tends to make mistakes with some of the films that it nominates (when they ignored The Dark Knight for Best Picture nominations, it was an unexpected nasty slap in the face). But I have to say that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button deserves every single one of its nominations. This is the most awe-inspiring piece of mainstream entertainment since The Dark Knight stormed cinemas last summer. Beautiful, subtly poignant and performed and constructed with almost hypnotic confidence, Benjamin Button slowly wraps you in its story and, before you realise, traps you. Very few films have the ability to do that.The film opens in a New Orleans hospital in 2005, with Hurricane Katrina howling outside the window. An elderly patient named Daisy (Cate Blanchett) asks her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) to read the diary of a man named Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) to her, knowing that it is her last chance to discover its contents. We are then drawn into Benjamin's story, starting on the night that WW1 ended, and the night that Benjamin's biological father, Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng), who is horrified by his son's appearance, abandons him on the step of a old-people's home run by a kind woman named Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), who adopts Benjamin. At first, it seems likely that he's going to die from health issues caused by old age. But miraculously, as everyone around him grows older, he grows younger. As his life progresses, his path continually crosses with that of Daisy, and a deep relationship grows between the two of them. However, with the two of them growing in the opposite directions, there are inevitably heart-wrenching consequences? Benjamin Button has so many events incorporated into its storyline that my summary is incredibly brief by comparison. But everything is so brilliantly woven into the story that the apparently lengthy running time (the film runs for just under 3 hours) just flies by. Every aspect of the production, from the acting to the visual effects, from the direction to the costume design, flawlessly fits into the production like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle.If the characters are sympathetic enough for the tragic force of the story to shine on screen, this is largely down to the magnificent performances. Brad Pitt delivers a superbly subtle and nuanced portrayal of Benjamin Button. Terrifically capturing the mannerisms and essence of a character who transforms from a young man in an old man's body into an old man in the form of a young man, Pitt has rarely been better. The Academy Award nomination that he received was definitely deserved. As Daisy, Cate Blanchett creates a sympathetically flawed, yet strong character. Blanchett's sparkling performance creates a connection between the character and the audience, much like the relationship between Daisy and Benjamin. In the role of Queenie, Taraji P. Jenson is a torrent of force and energy. The love, care and heartfelt uncertainty that Jenson pours into Queenie makes her all the lovable and human. The Academy Award nomination that her performance received was yet another well-deserved nomination. There are other strong supporting performances from Jared Harris (as the captain of a tugboat that Benjamin works on), Jason Flemyng, Julia Ormond and a brilliant Tilda Swinton (as a woman who Benjamin has a brief affair with), who all take their screen time and run with it.Now we come to the direction. David Fincher, director of films such as "Fight Club", "Zodiac" and "Panic Room", has never attempted a film with such scope and detail as this. However, from the way that he composes himself in the director's seat, you are unlikely to notice it. Fincher manages the difficult job of not going for the easy emotional moments with aplomb, and weaves the different story threads together with such tremendous skill that none of them seem extraneous. He also creates several moments which are simply compelling in their creativity and sense of originality. One of these moments comes in the first five minutes. It is an astounding shot of a battle in WW1 which is rewinding, with soldiers running backwards towards their trenches, and violent explosions shrinking out of existence. Another sequence, in which seemingly disconnected events all play a part in a tragic accident, has a brilliant build-up and a genuinely intelligent idea driving it; if any one of these small incidents hadn't taken place, then the final tragedy might not have happened. But hey, that's life. Did Fincher deserve the Oscar nomination that he received? I'll give you a clue. Yes!!! Technically, this film is colossal. The inspirationally faultless visual effects used to construct the appearance of Button at different stages of his life, the haunting musical score by Alexandre Desplat, the marvellously realistic make-up for both Benjamin and Daisy at different stages of their lives and so much more make this film a gallery of some of the most influential technical achievements in years. This film stands alongside technical juggernauts such as "Jurassic Park", "The Dark Knight" and the "Lord of the Rings" films.Overall, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is an incredible achievement, both technically and emotionally. Simply mesmerising from beginning to end, "Benjamin Button" is easily one of the best films of the year so far, alongside "Slumdog Millionaire" and "Frost/Nixon", and it will take a lot of great films to keep it from being it from being in my Top Ten list of films in 2009. From where I'm sitting, the race for the Best Picture Oscar has become very interesting indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mesmerizing Masterpiece on Life, Love, and Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is epic. It is beautiful. It is the best picture of the year. Director David Fincher takes on a new obstacle with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and succeeds at the highest level. Most of us know what a great director he is, but he's never a Oscar-type movie, but he will finally get his due as I expect him to be taking home the gold. The movie centers on the life of Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt. As he states throughout the film, he was born under unusual circumstances and ages backwards. With the outside of an old man, but the mind of a new born, Button had quite the obstacle to overcome as a child. He is raised by the loving Queenie, Taraji P. Henson, who runs a nursing home establishment. There he meets an assortment of characters that all effect his life in different way although one person seems to have more of an effect than the rest. Benjamin first meets Daisy, Cate Blanchett, at the home and they instantly become friends and eventually fall for each other. Over the years we watch the epic and fantasy tale of Benjamin and his journey through life. Eric Roth wrote the screenplay and deserves high praise as he will likely be taking home gold as well come this Oscar season. He touches on death, love, and, most of all, life. Life is full of great and bad moments and nothing always lasts are two of the most powerful parts of this picture. Roth creates some incredibly moving and powerful scenes through the deep dialogue. Above all he touches on how such little details and things may have a tremendous affect, whether it's good or bad, on your own life. During one of the most moving scenes of the film, Benjamin Button explains how one small detail of a girl not breaking up with her boyfriend the night before or a man waking up on time, rather than 5 minutes late, would have a drastic affect on Daisy who, as a result, would break her leg from being hit by a car and never be able to dance again. Also, the final scene of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is also powerful and one the greatest scenes of any film I've seen this year or ever in cinema and it is incredibly moving. Such a tremendous story and script is only the beginning to this historic achievement. Brad Pitt gives an Oscar-caliber performance as Benjamin Button creating a perfect character who changes roles along his journey through life and develops his character extraordinarily well. He also creates a tremendous southern-New Orleans accent and isn't over the top at all. If you haven't taken him seriously as an actor as of yet, as a result of not seeing AOJJ or Babel, then you will finally realize that he is one of our finest actors in cinema. Cate Blanchett develops her character just as well, if not better, and is currently the best actress I've seen all year. Both of them have tremendous chemistry together which help to make the love story to this epic tale that much more touching. The visuals to this feature are stunning. Whether it's the submarine scenes, the view of Paris, the lake, or the city itself, Fincher uses his usual lighting as well as brilliant cinematography to create unbelievable scenes. Some say that the film is too visual, while I disagree. Fincher stays close to the characters and story at hand and throws in a beautiful scene every know and then, but it never takes away from the story in my opinion. Fincher's camera work is top-notch and it's extremely well-crafted despite being an ambitious and epic film. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button never drags and goes by in a flash despite the 3 hour running time. In fact, I didn't want this film to end. Alexandre Desplat's memorable score is touching and unforgettable. It helps to create a happy, sad, angry, or depressing mood for the film and is beautifully composed. The costumes, make-up, and set designs are some of the very best of the year and I expect this feature to take home Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Visual Affects, Costume Design, and Make-Up, at the very least, come Oscar season. Overall, this is a historic cinematic feature that is well-crafted and a beautiful film about life. This is a magical and miracle movie and one that is unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacrifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is no doubt one of the best movies of this decade, but most of the film's viewers seem to be missing the big picture. This film has a number of different popular themes; "youth is not wasted on the young"; "the human spirit knows no age"; and the list goes on. One of the central themes of this film is sacrifice. Benjamin Button is heroic in the fact that his life was not wasted or misspent due to his ailments. He is heroic because nothing stopped him from experiencing extraordinary life experiences. However, I feel that the film is more about sacrifice for the ones that you love. Benjamin gave up everything because of his love for his wife and daughter. He knew that his condition would so complicated and so difficult to understand for his wife and daughter. He left them to spare them the emotional turmoil that would ensue had he stayed. This story is more of a story of sacrifice than of triumph of the human spirit, and it illustrates the limitless possibilities of things that people will do for the ones they love. The point of this post is not to point out that people are wrong in their assessments of the film. All of the observations are correct, however, I just don't want people to be lost on the more obscure points of the film. I loved this film when I saw it, and knew that it would be special for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indulges you to seize the day and live life to its fullest, because you never know when it's going to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've waited a long time to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and I'm happy to say I was quite happy upon viewing the movie in theaters. Director David Fincher's film follows the story of a man named Benjamin (portrayed by Brad Pitt) that ages backwards: when everyone around him grows older and older, he just keeps growing younger. Cate Blanchett portrays Daisy, his tragic lifelong lover, with Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson and many other talented actors portray various friends, co-workers, love interests and family members he meets along his extraordinary path in life.The movie had lively characters you could relate to, its scenery was breathtaking, and it all came down to its original concept, a concept that made the film so special to me. Its time-twisting elements made you think about how life is fragile and how it keeps slipping away, and how we can never escape our mortality - no matter how far we go. Benjamin Button was growing younger in body but older in heart, and when he faced his aging friends and family, you couldn't escape thinking how lonely he must be (going through the opposite process and all) and how random life is.But instead of taking you to a depressing conclusion, the film wrote itself out like a marvelous feast for life. Even the setback - the story being told to a dying Daisy amidst the upcoming Katrina Hurricane - gives one a new perspective on life, and indulges you to seize the day and live life to its fullest, because you never know when it's going to end.From director Fincher (Fight Club, The Game, Panic Room), I found The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to be a great film with marvelous settings, excellent performances and a versatile cast. It's smart, unique, original, and has an extremely well executed high-concept. After a long wait, I'm happy to see the film get the respect it deserves - both at the box office and by the Academy.I gave it 10 points out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could easily compare this movie to Forrest Gump. The Curious Case eloquently covers the this man's life and his connections. Even I cried when Caroline read the postcards to her. It seems that going through a man's life is common among at least these 2 great movies. Perhaps there are more that I can't think of at the moment. This style allows the viewer to consider how to spend his time. Ah. Time. I think one of the lessons that The Curious Case teaches us is to explore. It doesn't really imply to use your time wisely, but I am motivated to work harder and smarter because of it. This will be another future feel...uh maybe not good...but feel-invigorated movie, kind of like how Love Actually is my feel-good movie. The beautiful soundtrack, Pitt and Blanchett's best ever performances, and unique story combine to form a film that will be talked about for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fincher's Masterpiece Blend of Craft and Emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher has been one of the most impressive directors of the last decades, switching genres with an ease impossible to many of other overrated directors who chose safe themes and approaches. His latest is probably the closest he comes to a standard epic drama, but there is very little that is standard about this gorgeous, impressive, and very moving film.Fincher follows the rather special life of Benjamin Button, a man born looking like he is in his eighties, who finds his way to the loving arms of Queenie, a woman who will raise with the tender and selfless she seems to dispense so naturally. Their scenes together are likely not to leave a dry eye in the house. One can almost feel the love on the screen. As Benjamin grows older, he encounters a series of special characters and discovers that a full life requires understanding and sacrifices, regardless of whether the process is chronologically correct.He encounters people who make a mark on his life, and each incident is highly valued by Benjamin, stressing the positive over the negative. He understands some people shape us and our destiny, and we must learn to appreciate their contributions. As the epic continues, he discovers love, sex, courage, the irrationality of some events in every person's life, and as the center of the story, one very special person, who will be his loved one until the day he dies.It's wonderful to see how Fincher hits the right notes and uses a marvelous musical score, some of the most breathtaking cinematography of the year. Yet, in order to turn this from just an ordinary tale to a masterpiece, he must rely on the acting of all the participants, in particular, Swinton, Pitt, Blanchett, and the superb Taraji P. Henson. These performers convey depth and complexity with simple looks, their work more difficult to carry out because of the extended amounts of make up and special effects.Watching Pitt grow older, yet become older could have been a very distracting gimmick, but the maturity and intensity of his performance carry the film easily; his various scenes with Henson, as mentioned before are the emotional core of the character, shaping his eventual relationships with the other women, particularly the one who will become the love of his life, and will eventually be at his deathbed."Button" is an amazing work of art, a movie that seldom is made because it requires dedication, vision, an understanding of the beauty that surrounds us and exists inside of us. Some people call it a showcase for the power to impress others with technology, as I see it, "Button" employs our technological advances to put together magical imagery that enhances the inspiration, imagination, and the hard work put together by people like Fincher and Roth and their flawless cast."Button" is the diamond at the top of a year that has given us its share of jewels.</fullReview>

OK, Ill admit it was a wonderful storyline, and had great acting, but honestly, that's all your getting from this film. Brad Pitt was excellent, so was Kate. They should of added some scenes of bullying, fighting, and stuff like that to make it more interesting, especially since this is not based on a true story. Makes sense nah? If your looking for a movie that's gonna blast you away with action, violence, and stuff like that, do not go see this movie. Also, this is not a theatrical film. This could be a rental. Whats the point of going to the theater to see this movie and wasting 20 bucks(you and a date)on theatrical surround sound, huge screen. Basically all im saying its a very quiet movie for the theaters. The only reason why its so big is because Brad Pitt is in it. might as well just rent it. Save your money. OK ciao.</fullReview>

The first is realized through two fine performances by Pitt and Blanchett, and the latter, by their circumstances, which prove non-too-unusual after all. Our life is fleeting, yes, as are our actions and the few relationships we will have during our stay. The condition has summoned some to revolution, and others to their premature, or perhaps, fitting exit. The characters in this film will come and go like us as well. Though many of us will pass this life unnoticed, few of us will attempt to draw from this strange security, the subsequent freedom it thus affords us. Often too passive or too impatient at what we later discover are the wrong moments, we lose great love or the chance at it, and discover at long end, that the actions which finally drew their present course, lead us to a life we are non-too-pleased with.Strangely, this grim bell is why the film remains hopeful, despite its subject, and ultimately succeeds. Indeed, though epic love, like Benjamin's strange condition, war, or the beginning of yet a new life all find within them the same terminal fate, and although the winding paths we each cut across the progression of this common fatality may multiply the swings of its axe, our short stay CAN STILL prove rewarding. Brad Pitt's representation of Benjamin, and Fincher's story, are therefore at once hopeful, appropriate and terrific because the one plays, and the other shows love fashioned through a terminal life is not only possible, but also possibly remarkable. To have done so from the viewpoint of Pitt's passive observance is commendable for both the actor and director, who in so doing, place him like us, as an observer becoming gradually aware of a marvelous and yet frightening condition he cannot escape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Awesome, So far the Best Movie of 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.This is a beautifully written, acted and directed American Masterpiece.The cinematography, sound design and score are phenomenal. The chemistry between Brad and Cate is off the charts. This is a complex movie that I haven't been able to get my mind or emotions totally around, but it is moving as the elements that keep crashing in and about the characters. It is funny and sad and poignant.We had a few great films this year ? from the king of blockbusters (Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight") to a compelling biopic (Gus Van Sant's "MILK") to a brilliant movie from India like Danny Boyle's "Slumdog Millionaire", Mike Leigh's "Happy-Go-Lucky", Thomas McCarthy's "The Visitor", Courtney Hunt's "Frozen River", Tomas Alfredson's "Let The Right One In" and Jonathan Demme's "Rachel Getting Married", but I doubt I will see anything as good as David Fincher's masterpiece so soon. In other words, an instant classic (there, I said it). 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Moving Forrest Gump Type Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie, my immediate thoughts were Brad Pitt's performance was excellent and probably a sure bet for Best Actor nomination, but also that the lion's share of the credit for this movie's success belongs to the incredible creative talent behind it production, that is the screen writers, directors, graphic artists, supporting actors, and everyone else involved. I suspect there are many other actors who could have done what Pitt did, as there wasn't much emotional range required for his role. The central figure in the film was Benjamin Button but what really made the movie were all of the backstories, like his adopted mom, the Tug Boat Captain, his biological father, &amp; the various other figures (i.e. - the nursing home resident struck by lightening 7 times). These were what made the movie interesting. I'm sure F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved of this version of his short story with two very big thumbs up. This is without question the best movie adaptation of any of his works I've ever seen. It more than makes up for Coppola's wretchedly bad "The Great Gatsby", perhaps Fitzgerald's best known work with a similar big box office budget.The one weak link was its length, nearly 3 hours. I thought this could have been reduced by at least 1/2 hour. The love interest aspect with Cate Blanchett was a bit overdone, and the Tilda Swinton vignette could have been eliminated entirely, as he'd already lost his virginity in a New Orleans brothel, courtesy of the Tug Boat Captain.But all that aside, this is a really good movie worth checking out on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Extraordinary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cried. The Curious Case of Ben Button surpassed my expectations and has become my favorite film of the year (yes, better then The Dark Knight). The main reason this movie is so great is it moved me, a feat that very few movies have done to me in the past.Beware Major Spoilers Ahead. It was just so bittersweet to see in the final scenes of the movie as Ben is a small child and Cate Blanchett walks with him and cradles him as a baby when he finally passes.Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's performances are undoubtedly Oscar worthy, their chemistry is perfect. The story is a true epic, i never touched my cell phone once throughout the entire 160 min runtime because it was just so compelling, master storytelling. Tilda Swinton and Brad Pitt's brief romance was also believable and was a wise addition to the film. Each sequence in the film is interesting enough for its own film. The affair between Tilda and Brad, The times on the ship, The tortured soul of Bens father after abandoning his son etc. There is something for everyone in this film, so instead of seeing the hacky Marley and Me or Bedtime Stories, See this its beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie You Want to Watch Instead of Make-Out with Your Girl/Boy-friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of my favorites of 2008. As a man, I can admit that this was a great love story. I got chills in certain parts. Brad Pitt was the perfect person for this role. Although I have never cared for Brad Pitt, he was the only one I could think of for this role. The idea of the movie is what makes it so great, and the beginning of the movie sets the tone for the whole movie, which turns out to make a lot of sense throughout the movie. It makes you think about your life, and it touches you if you really watch it. And don't let anyone tell you its not worth the time. It's long, but totally worth it. And it is worth the 8-9 dollars.I didn't give it a 9 or 10 because of 1 thing. The one thing is that the movie was predictable at some points. I see about 2 movies, old or new, a week, so maybe that was why I was able to predict, but even so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cate Blanchett is Incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a gorgeously shot film about a boy who is born old and gray, and ages backwards. While others around him age forward and die before him, he ages the other way- and gains youth. The film, directed by David Fincher (Zodiac), and written by Eric Roth (Forrest Gump), is 167 minutes but seems to fly by as you're taken into a World War I and flown through Benjamin's lifetime of mystery, sex and love.I think what makes the film work the best is Cate Blanchett, who has never been as luminous, gorgeous or stellar. It's as if she knew her character so well, she melted into it. Blanchett meets Benjamin when she's a little girl, but as their lives intertwine, she realizes his secret, but grows to love him anyways. In some scenes involving breathtaking cinematography, the two form a bond that's stronger then sexual passion- there seems to be a spiritual trust that surges between their souls. Cate plays herself as an old woman too, and in pounds of makeup, confesses to her daughter- Ormond- about her life with Benjamin. I hope Blanchett is nominated for an Oscar for this performance, however with competition being so tight she sadly might miss. I hope she makes it.Brad Pitt is fine as Button, but I felt a certain element lacking from his performance. Tom Hanks in "Forrest Gump" also plays a man with a disability who floats through life in amazing adventures. But Hanks was able to capture a certain depth to Gump that Pitt is overtly lacking. It seems Pitt plays Button with the same dismal note over and over again, only sometimes taking the character to another level. He is still incredible to watch.Taraja B. Henson (Hustle &amp; Flow) is a nice surprise as Queenie, who takes care of Button once she discovers him on her doorstep. Playing the role with enough sass to put Hattie McDaniel to shame, I often found myself thinking she was playing the role to the stereotype. But she's adorable none the less.The biggest winners from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" should be the makeup artists. Not only do they make Blanchett and Pitt appear older, but also YOUNGER! Pitt, in his 40s, at one time looks 25 again. And it's sexy as well as creepy. Blanchett, a ballet dancer in her prime of the film, is shown as a giddy 19 year-old and also a 55 year-old widow. It's brilliant to see how the makeup mixed with the actors can make this film go beyond it's level of greatness.Over-all the film has excellent music, beautiful costumes, and riveting messages about death and being happy to be alive. Tilda Swinton also turns out a brief but powerful turn as a rich woman who shows Benjamin true passion for the first time. Bravo again- to Ms. Blanchett!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Things Last</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director David Fincher has crafted a masterpiece. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a an artful drama that soothes your soul and makes you ponder. This movie is remarkable in every way. What starts out as a period piece becomes... a journey of a lifetime filled with love, life, death and the search to understand and finally embrace the meaning of age and the wisdom that comes with it. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay is perfect, the style of language chosen is well-written, F. Scott Fitzgerald would be proud.You'd be surprised how gentle the direction is considering David Fincher usually associate himself with conflicts and thrillers (Se7en, Fight Club). When it comes to movies like BENJAMIN BUTTON, names like Steven Spielberg or Richard Attenborough might be the first to come to mind as the ones possibly helming such a beautiful film, but nope, it's David Fincher who proves how versatile he can be.Eric Roth who won Oscar for adapting Forrest Gump is definitely one of my favorite screenwriters of all time. And in a way, he makes BENJAMIN BUTTON seem like a much calmer version of Forrest Gump, both characters are often naive, trying things for the first time ever, both stories span across many years, but Button goes grows mature in mind over time even though his body ages backward while Gump, well, still as naive as ever.I really enjoy Roth's choices of dialogue, those memorable quotes that sound so poetic and there's power in the subtlety of it all.Original score by Alexandre Desplat is magical, it gives you the feeling like you're listening to a classic tale or nursery rhyme. Cinematography by Claudio Miranda makes every shot breathtaking, it's like looking a painting and you can't seem to keep your eyes off of it.The production design, art direction, costume, the editing, all of those aspects compliment each other and go appropriate with the timeline of the story. Gotta give the most credit to the make-up dept. The way they make Brad Pitt look old and and grow younger each year as Cate Blanchett would grow older and older instead, it's excellent and mindblowing. You'll be in awe.Great casting decision. Who on earth can look like a teenager even when he hits his 40s other than Brad Pitt? That man is like Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, they never seem to age at all. Brad Pitt, in my opinion, has always been just an okay actor whose image and acting don't necessarily leave with you after you watch his movie but BENJAMIN BUTTON is not his usually movie. The New Orleans accent might be a little rough around the edges but I think he does a fine job here as a man who doesn't force his ways in this life, he shows his intentions but then he'd also things happen as they may, if time allows. His character lives in a place where he sees death frequently, so he learns to accept and never dwell in self-pity and just live, and live to fullest is exactly what he does.Taraji P. Henson who plays Queeny, Benjamin's step-mother, if you will, she gives the performance of her lifetime. She gets my vote for Best Supporting Actress. And who can deny the elegance of the great Cate Blanchett who plays Daisy with such beauty and grace. What an incredible talent.This movie makes you think about how to deal with the fact and fear of growing older. We can either be depressed about it or make the best and enjoy every single minute with the ones you care about and accumulate as much memory as you can because despite what you may think... some things last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it hard not to draw comparisons to "Forest Gump" after seeing this film. As a play, it would have been nice. If it had been made 20 years ago, it would have been forgotten by now. The fact that visual effects are what they are now will make this film an academy award winner that will resonate for decades.I remember the way I felt when I first saw Gollum in "Fellowship of the Ring". I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The combination of motion capture and computer animation had made a real creature, but one far enough from human that it was still a bridge between something human and something cartoonish.Artists say that the hardest thing to paint or draw is a human face, because any flaw will be immediately spotted by anyone. We are so in tune to the human face, movies that have attempted to duplicate it have, up until now, fallen flat.When we see Brad Pitt in his late eighties acting boyish in this film, it is 100% genuine and believable. When Pitt is 19, he is just as believable. The effects are as ground breaking in this film as the dinosaurs in Jurassic park or the bullet-time slow-mo shots of The Matrix.Now that I'm through going on about the visual effects, I have to say that the film does something amazing on an emotional level. It screams something to us we don't even want to whisper to ourselves in private: You're getting older! We've watched people grow old in films before, but we never believed it. We see people around us grow old, but we have time to adjust. We look around at pretty people and realize they are too young for us. We see our parents having trouble walking and hear about their medical problems, but we don't see it as unusual.Watching an otherwise ordinary man grow younger is jarring. Believing what we're seeing makes it emotional. Ill never be the same after seeing a baby die of old age. The movie tagline is true. Life is measured in moments, not minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Button is a Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can tell it is Oscar season when films like 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' are released, a film telling the story of a man born old, who ages backwards in almost a reworking of 'Forrest Gump' (both films sharing the same screen writer). The films premise does not really get any further than that, nor does it present any real insight allowing Benjamin Button or the audience to see things differently, or indeed develop into any sort of character. Instead we see the story of a fairly regular man experiencing a somewhat regular life for the time: growing up, going to war, falling in love and dying, and with very little said about Benjamin's condition.While there may be people that say the focus of the film is the love story between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett that is not the case as they never have any good chemistry on screen. Most of the appeal for Button comes not from the script or even the direction of David Fincher, but mainly the visuals of ageing effects. It is certainly not the performance of Pitt's career. From the director that gave us 'Fight Club', 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' 'Benjamin Button' will come as a big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>should be retitled: The Tedious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many months of intending to go see this film, but never really finding a convenient time, I finally got around to seeing it and was crushingly, woefully, disappointed. In fact, I haven't felt so let down by the promise of a film since the advent of the Star Wars prequels (well, maybe Indy IV). It's really a bit of a mess of a film, a curate's egg really that has good bits in it, but is ultimately too long, poorly structured and badly paced. I couldn't help but think it should be renamed "The Tedious Case of Benjamin Button", as regrettably it commits what to me is the cardinal sin for a film, that for all its interesting touches, it's ultimately boring and, to be honest, not as original or intelligent as it thinks it is.The plot, for those who don't know, is a simple one. We follow the eponymous Benjamin (Brad Pitt), a man who is born as an old man and slowly ages in reverse, experiencing the 20th Century through his eyes, with the focus being on his inevitably doomed love affair with Cate Blanchett's Daisy, the normal ageing love of his life.The problem with this, on paper promising, idea is that it is basically squandered. The backwards ageing provides only a few moments of poignancy, the rest of the time it is either played for laughs or ignored altogether in favour of what is to be honest a straightforward linear narrative about life and love. The main problem is that conveying the 20th century through the eyes of one man and the girl he loves has been done before, and better, with "Forrest Gump", and this film lacks the wit, charm, or pace of Zemeckis' film.There are some good things, the acting is on the whole excellent, especially from Pitt who is startlingly convincing as the curiously afflicted Benjamin, and Blanchett as his soul mate the beautiful Daisy. Plaudits also should go to the always excellent Tilda Swinton, as the repressed wife of an English diplomat who Benjamin falls for while working on a fishing boat in Russia.Visually the film is also stunning, though sometimes the aesthetic is too extreme. The cold of Russia and the bleak rain splattered streets of New York are presented well, but the scenes of Button's home in New Orleans where he grows up are shot in such a mellow pallet of yellows, and have such a cheesy family atmosphere, you almost expects someone to come in with a packet of Werther's Originals to hand round.The scenes that are of interest are often peculiar vignettes detaching from the story, and while fascinating, such as the story of the blind clockmaker making a clock that only goes backwards following his sons death, or the sequence showing the many small cause and effect chains which lead to a major accident, the use of a hummingbird as a psycho-pomp, ultimately come across as just cynical attempts to make the film appear deeper than it actually is, recalling the similar opening of "Magnolia", but without the intelligent relevance.The only truly outstanding scene is one in which the fishing boat on which Button works is attacked by a German U-Boat in WW2, and is forced to fight back. But even that moment of action underpins the meandering slowness of the rest of the film. Bluntly put, the film is way too long, and feels it. Around the 2 hour mark, you suddenly become very aware that there is much more left and that it could be done much quicker.Another problem is with the films structure, particularly the framing device which has an elderly, dying Blanchett getting her daughter to read Benjamin's Diary, which then becomes his narration. It seems clumsy and unnecessary, especially as any time we are getting drawn in by Benjamin, we get dragged out into a series of repetitive mother/daughter conversations between the two. Also, the main emotional reveal of these scenes is massively underplayed and the daughter is given so little characterisation, it is almost impossible to feel empathy, or even care that her mother is dying, when the relationship could be much more poignant.Blanchett as an old woman is also incredibly irritating, her reminiscences of lost love and her life when she was younger at best schmaltzy and at worst sanctimonious, comparable to the old woman in Titanic in both expositionary function, and irritating personality. This isn't her fault though as much as bad writing, but she does typify the problem. Only Pitt and Swinton are given juicy parts, Blanchett is essentially just there to look gorgeous (which of course she does) whereas a massive cast of supporting characters barely break into two dimensions (least of all the hard-drinking Irish captain he goes to work for- stereotypes ahoy!).Ultimately, the central love story is sweet, but padded far too much, while an interesting premise is largely ignored or unexplored, as if it was only there for occasional comic relief. Its a frustrating, badly structured film that away from the media circus, isn't really anything special. Its worth watching if its on TV sometime, but if you go out of your way to see it, you'll be quite disappointed. It does have its moments, but it was vastly overrated on its release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What curious case?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get the hype at all and cannot believe the score this film gets. I really wanted to see it but was thoroughly disappointed. This is a VERY slow paced film and I mean slow, I usually enjoy films that are slower moving like 'Lost in Translation' but this is way too long and the plot doesn't hold up. Reasons I was not impressed:1. For a very special condition such as Benjamin had, he was not at all special, he was not charming, emotional or even burdened by his condition.2.Brad Pitt's acting lacked any depth. his character was merely like a 'normal' person and we were treated to a life story of a very average type of man.3. Too long- could have been half an hour shorter. it was so slow moving that i got very restless and watched the clock to see how long it had left. all i ended up doing was watching the end to see how he would regress into childhood.4.The narration is very annoying. The old Daisy is practically inaudible and the narration of Benjamin's diary is intrusive and schmaltzy.5. No conflict. I waited for some and it never came, every time something began to happen in his life, a new scene started. characters were to and fro like yo yo's, he didn't learn anything from any experiences and an audience learns nothing from this man (who is different in a very big way)6. Despite great special effects, the darkness after a while appears dull and I was hoping for a least one 'light' scene.7. The acceptance of Benjamin. he was not shown to be bullied, questioned or ridiculed and unlike the superior Forrest Gump, he had no sense of humour and was not brave.Overall, the film was slow, dull and far too long. the film looked quite good, but the plot was lost. the unusual premise should have spawned an intriguing life story of a very un-common man but instead we just got a pretentious, Hollywood style life story of a man with no depth, which was simply in reverse.</fullReview>

The short story was masterfully transferred to the big screen with a truly engrossing plot that brought joy, sorrow and intrigue in equal droves throughout. The title character had you truly absorbed and Pitt managed to garner empathy almost effortlessly with a watertight performance. Blanchett was also superb for her part and the two leads obviously no how to get the best from one another. The three hour playtime flew by and I left the cinema having been totally sucked into the story and taken away from the world outside, which to me is what any great film should do.

		<fullReview>The movie is based on a short story, it describes the life of Benjamin Button, who's mother died during his delivery, and who's father put him on the doorsteps of home when he is born with the appearance of an elderly man. The home, run by a black maid named Queenie, takes him in as a son, and people begin to see that he is in fact aging backwards, from old to young. But you wanna know what's funny? For all its preaching about unpredictable events, Benjamin button lives a pretty normal life. He worked on a boat, he worked in the navy, and then he operates a toll booth. That sounds pretty average to me, and I found personally that Benjamin Button is more of a science-fiction character than a human being. The fact that he spends his whole life seeing his friends die off is interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I was American, I'm sure I would have enjoyed this film - it's beautifully made, has incredible effects, great acting, amusing characters and an intriguing story.But... it's just a bit too sickly sweet and schmaltzy - and presents a far too rose-tinted, American-nostalgia-focused account of twentieth century history for a foreigner like me to appreciate. This isn't a criticism - it's an American film after all - more an observation from an outsider's perspective.I suppose a British equivalent might be the film "Zulu" - great fun to watch if you're a Brit, but kind of insulting if you're a Zulu - and complete pap as far as history goes.It also didn't need to be three hours long. I'm guessing that pretty much half the run time of the film could have been left on the cutting room floor without any effect on the continuity of the story-line - and we would have been spared the inanities of scenes like the series of coincidences leading up to the road accident: pointless, flashy film making all to make a trite point summed up by the phrase "stuff happens".Anyway, I can definitely imagine bigger wastes of three hours of my life and there's always the amusement of waiting to see if the baby Brad Pitt will end up disappearing forcibly into someone's womb at the end of the film....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the film to be very well thought out and the roles played with amazing warmth. I did not find that old Benjamin and young Daisy were "attracted" to each other in the way that some posters here seem to believe. I thought it more as a kind of "on the same page" type of thing as opposed to a sexual desire on either part. He was drawn by her blue eyes and she was drawn because he was "different" to the others in her grandmother's retirement home. That's my view anyway. Nevertheless, I think the film is well worth the nominations it received. I have nothing against Brad Pitt but I am not an avid fan. With that being said, I think he gave a brilliant performance. Cate Blanchett is beautiful and genuine in her portrayal of Daisy. I hope this film cleans up at the Oscars. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From time to time there's a movie that amazes us for it excellent story, magnificent cast and more great things and that becomes instantly into a masterpiece. That's the case of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher's latest film is one of those movies that catches you from the very beginning with its fantasy, romance, action and some moments of humor. The movie tells the interesting story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with bizarre consequences. The plot is convincing and very well developed by Eric Roth. David Fincher makes a magnificent work directing, although it is a two hour and a half movie, it has a fast paced rhythm making it enjoyable and it never bores you. It has excellent special effects, the makeup is wonderful, great locations, the movie is set to the perfection in the different years that occurs in the movie. The cast is simply great, Brad Pitt gives us one of his best performances ever, Cate Blanchett is fantastic as Daisy, Tilda Swinton is very convincing as Elizabeth Abott and the secondary roles of Julia Ormond (Caroline), Taraji P. Henson (Queenie) and Jason Flemyng (Thomas Button) gives a really good support to the movie. In conclusion, A very entertaining movie worth to see. It is destined to be a masterpiece and the great winner of the upcoming Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great film no, no, no a remarkable film from David Fincher(Director of Fight Club, Seven, and Zodiac if you happened to not know already)and Eric Roth(Writer of Forest Gump and Insider) and, although, this film strays far away from the original short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film was still infused with Fitzgerald's philosophical awareness of America and its future, which was apparent in the final shot of Benjamin Button.The story spans from the early 19th century to just about when Katrina hit New Orleans and with that it brings a presence that invokes lots of conflict and even more resolve. Benjamin, as everyone should know by now, ages backwards and is subjected to a life of turmoil. He joins the Navy in war time, has a fling, inherits a small fortune, falls in love, has a baby and then travels the world. Of course, there is more in between, but I'd rather not say because I wouldn't want to ruin the film for anyone. But I can say the shear beauty of this film both ellued and hypnotized me with the magnitude of its composition and range of its rhythmic pace. It was an utter breakthrough for Hollywood, not only because it will remain a memorable story but, also because of its its uniqueness in the garbage that's getting pulled through the mainstream.And with that said and done, It was great treasure to watch and enjoy on opening day and I expect and recommend that every person watch this extraordinary film.Jacob Reategui</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic love story rich in visuals and insight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a film like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" tell such a basic human story with such visual prowess. There's not a whole lot of action or imaginative settings, yet director David Fincher makes New Orleans and New York between 1920-1970 feel like a fantasy world of sorts. This is the kind of a film that will likely get a slew of nominations at the Academy Awards and clean up many of them."Benjamin Button" is sort of an epic love story, the kind of film that we haven't really seen since "Forrest Gump." At nearly 3 hours long, it gives us the life of Benjamin (Pitt), who physically ages backward from an old man to an infant, while his brain ages like that of a normal person. While the film could be about how his life is different from everyone else, the emphasis is more on how this affects his perspective on aging, dying and the fleeting nature of life, as seen through his love for Daisy (Blanchett) who he meets when they're both children, but she of course ages normally.The visual rendering of Benjamin as an old man (his younger years) is absolutely astounding and could press some other CGI-loaded films at the Oscars. The make-up as well, which is forced to capture a large span of aging because the film doesn't jump very far ahead in years at any point in time, is incredible.What is most surprising about "Button" is the cinematography. Between the contrast of light and dark around faces and a couple beautiful sunrise scenes, what is just plain old America has a distinct beauty to it that really captures the epic nature of the story. It's long and really quite slow at times, but it could have been worse without some of the imagery.The acting was also very impressive. Pitt manages to pull off the concept of looking one way and feeling another. He's particularly strong when he's 20 or so, when his character appears in his late 50s. He gives Benjamin a gentle nature that comes off as mature, though his naiveté in terms of love and loss is apparent. Blanchett is also very strong, proving triple-fold already how talented of an actress she is in any role. Several other supporting roles played by lesser known actors were also impressive, including Queenie, Benjamin's adoptive mother.Though tedious in length, "Button" is a film that someone of nearly any age can appreciate. Eric Roth's screenplay is genuine in both its comedic and dramatic aspects, though no matter which, always has something to say about aging, death and loss. Ultimately, it manages to say a lot more about how similar Benjamin is to us, though he appears so radically different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This. Movie. Was. Terrible.It was quite literally Forrest Gump with a change of disabilities.In it, we follow Forre.. er.. I mean Benjamin as he experiences his life in reverse. It is, of course, full of fantastical occurrences that most compilations of 20 men wouldn't meet in their lifetimes, but of course, Forrest (oops I did it again, I mean Benjamin!) just manages to fall ass-backwards into every piece of luck he possibly can. Father is a millionaire -- Here take all this free money!Its full of stereotypes -- The cruel white businessman who doesn't accept his son because of his appearance, the elegant and beautiful mother dying during childbirth, the loving black mammy taking in the unwanted child, the hard-working and stressed out surrogate father asking "Why are we taking care of someone else's child?!?", the neglected, spoiled businesswoman jumping in bed with Benjamin as much to punish her husband as because of her desire to be with Benjamin, and the oft-returning love interest that's made a family for herself but never stopped loving! Oh! So original! If you can't piece this film together yourself from about 3 or 4 other better films then.. well.. you just haven't seen enough movies in your life.Watch a couple of good films and don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is boring, ill thought out and completely lacking in any meaningful plot developments. The plot is formulaic and the movie has absolutely nothing to say about the ageing process or life in general. The three hours I spent watching this movie is three hours of my life I won't get back. Amazingly Brad Pitt has been nominated for an Oscar for his role in the movie, all I can add is that talking in a southern accent and wearing make up does not constitute acting. This movie has taken a brilliant F Scott Fitzgerald story and completely ruined it.If you value your time avoid this movie.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies ever made... Review...The Curious Case</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere between life's beginning and end Benjamin Button reveals the heart of time, relationships and love.Life is said to be all about timing but in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" time has no limit when your living life backwards. Benjamin Button, dramatized by Brad Pitt, is a story about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards. Adapted from a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Benjamin Button is an extraordinary man who lives in an ordinary world.Along his journey through life he encounters impressionable people such as Queenie, played by Taraji P. Henson, who takes Benjamin in as an infant and raises him as her son. He has a chance meeting with other people such as Elizabeth Abbott played by Tilda Swinton, a wealthy married woman who Benjamin experiences his first kiss with and Captain Mike played by Jared Harris, a boat captain who Benjamin travels around the world with.Benjamin's most engaging encounter is with Daisy, portrayed by Cate Blanchette. Daisy and Benjamin meet as children and grow as lovers in an unusual but spectacular relationship.Brad Pitt's performance is praiseworthy, he expresses the essence of Benjamin's patient character and particular life exceptionally. The impeccable modern use of make up and prosthetics brought Benjamin Button to life, a task that was impossible when the story was first written in the 1920's.The movie was directed by newcomer David Finch and showcases cinematography that lures the viewer into a peculiar but intriguing world.The tale of Benjamin Button begins with a historic event involving a clock that ticks backwards. The story comes full circle with a touching and symbolic ending in which the clock stops ticking."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" teaches an important and pervasive lesson about time to those who may feel they are too old or too young to do a certain thing. Benjamin's message can be captured in his own words, "It is never too late or in my case too early, to be who ever you want to be." The movie is close to three hours in length. Time is well worth investing in a film with such great emotional and idealistic impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story of a man's life, told backwards, with both lots of good and some not-so-good at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Fincher is a truly gifted storyteller, probably one of the most talented and inspired that have come from that much hallowed age-group of early 1960s born American filmmakers (i.e. Soderbergh, Tarantino, Linklater) that rose to prominence in the 1990s with their groundbreaking work. It's a shame then that one year after directing a picture like Zodiac, where with a 157 minute running time (almost the same as this film) not a minute was wasted, he should have a film like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button: filled with so much promise, delivering in some brilliant bits, it's overloaded with a particular storytelling device that flat out doesn't work and doesn't help mask what also doesn't work in the actual story itself.I say this admiring this picture, admiring Fincher's work, the cinematographer immensely, the make-up artists and especially the visual fx crew (who, by leaps and bounds, should get the Oscar this year if it means much in those circles), in criticizing it heavily. This is one of those pictures one *wants* to work wonderfully so much that its bloated length is the cause of a central problem: the script. While not entirely the fault of co-adapter of Fitzgerald's story as a quasi-remake of Forrest Gump (the similarities are many, too many for here to note), the framing device used to wrap the story of Benjamin Button around - his story told from a diary he wrote read by his daughter (I'll get to that later) to her mother Daisy, who lies dying in a hospital bed in the middle of an oncoming hurricane (also get to this later) - is relentless and pointlessly repetitive. Imagine how annoying it would have been if Winona Ryder's old-lady version of her character from Edward Scissorhands kept popping up to tell the story and you'll get the idea of how it a) just is mundanely acted overwrought by Blanchett and Ormond, and b) it doesn't progress the story save for one or two of the flash-forwards.And as for the actual story of Benjamin Button, born on the night of the end of World War 1 as a baby aged 90 years old and aging backwards until he's a little boy with old-man dementia and Alzheimer's? It is, as you watch it, pretty entertaining, at best engrossing, and provides the viewer with so many rich ideas that are only followed upon a couple of times. Button lives a fairly uncomplicated life for someone who should be, by the look of the trailer, to have something extraordinary happen: he becomes a sailor when he turns 17, he sails the world bit, befriends and has an affair with a Brit (Swinton), does some minor combat duty in the Navy in WW2, and then has an on-off again relationship with Daisy, and then that is mostly the rest of the picture.Like in Forrest Gump, to make a quick comparison, Button has some of that whimsical fortune put upon him, brought on by a slightly sad circumstance: instead of Gump becoming a shrimp boat captain by a promise of a dead war-buddy, Button is abandoned by a father who runs a big Button-making corporation (Button's Buttons, cute, huh?), to which Benjamin is the sole heir. Only, we don't see him work at the factory, he sells it at one point for extra cash, and it doesn't have much prominence in the story. Maybe Roth or Fincher or whomever thought buttons wouldn't be very interesting to the story. But, hey, why not try it? This is a case where the parts are better than the whole, if not greater. Some sequences are brilliant, really wonderful, like Benjamin's explanation of all the clockwork-type of events that lead up to one of those life-changing accidents for Daisy, or when we see Benjamin walk for the first time, or even just simple things like bits of montages. It also goes without saying it's a technical marvel, as mentioned, and is gorgeous to look at - just as, I should add, it's two stars, who give very good performances (albeit not as good as Jesse James or Bob Dylan last year respectively), as people who have to cope with aging with each other, and have to grapple with death and the lingering sense of oncoming loss that leads to a decision 3/4 of the way through the picture that should be better handled, but isn't.The way I'm describing it, from the daughter 'twist' that shouldn't be one at all and is handled like one of those mean contrivances in movies that is unbecoming of a production like this let alone Fincher's, or the Katrina angle (which I wager was Brad Pitt's idea, noble but out of place), or just little things in the story that don't work, you'd think I would rate this lower. But it is a kind of flawed marvel, a work of mainstream movie art that is tainted by an excess of unnecessary storytelling in a film that requires that it be strong throughout. It takes a lot of guts to pull off a picture like this, and I'm glad Fincher made it. That it's not something I'd watch ever again from start to finish goes without saying.</fullReview>

I left to movie theater over four hours ago, and I still can't get over it. Very emotional. A must own when it hits DVD and I am definitely going to see it again in the theaters. An instant classic.

		<fullReview>This movie does not deliver! All the way throughout the movie, you go through Button's monotonous life, because he's taciturn, more taciturn than ANY viewer likes to see him. Here's how taciturn he is: he doesn't reply back with more than 2 line replies from any character in the movie. This alone destroys the "emotional" feel of the movie, because how can one sympathize or connect with Benjamin if everything is processing inside his head&gt; (You just want to yell at him for not being able to chat...) There's no "climax" to this movie. It's just a movie on his life with no moral. I can imagine females loving this movie (because they love these types of movies and the "hot" actor Brad Pitt.) but your typical male (like me) will not enjoy this movie. Males who say they enjoy this movie probably are critics or heavy movie watchers (and critique, or think A lot), both of which make them not typical; smart men, this movie is for you.This is pure Oscar material. It's not entertainment-friendly. 2 hours 40 minutes of pure "getting to nowhere". Sure there's a conclusion at the end, but what have I just learned from sitting here for almost 3 hours? None of the characters really "progress", and there's nothing about this film that audiences will remember for longer than ...a year?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Christmas Night. I have just returned from seeing what is easily the Best Film of 2008, and though there are some heavyweight contenders (or so I've heard), they would all have to go pretty far to beat THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMNIN BUTTON. I have seen MILK, and as close as that comes to taking the cake, it still has its work cut out for it when being compared to this bizarre, engrossing and ultimately moving tale of the life of one extraordinary man. David Fincher (SE7EN, ZODIAC, THE GAME, FIGHT CLUB) has just officially floored me. He would be the last director whose name would come to my mind when seeing a character- driven tale of such life-affirming power. Spielberg, yes; Chris Columbus, probably; Rob Reiner or Ron Howard, without a doubt, but David FINCHER? This movie is going to change his fortunes as a director.But not his alone. Brad Pitt officially joins the company of Newman, Redford and other memorable screen hunks whose status looms large in our consciousness not just as matinée idols, but as real ACTORS. As for Cate Blanchette, I've never doubted her acting ability, and she matches and compliments Brad scene-for-scene with a grace and subtlety that makes her other work pale by comparison. And for her, that is a stunning achievement. As for the rest of the cast, they all make me glad that I am not a voting member of the Academy: Taraji Henson (HUSTLE AND FLOW), Jason Flemyng (INDIAN SUMMER), Jared Harris, the luminous Tilda Swinton...I would never be able to single out just one of them as "best", because each brings their own special 'something' to the table that this tale would've suffered so greatly without. Eric Roth, who did such an amazing job with the screenplay for FOREST GUMP has triumphed again, and this should be reflected at Oscar time as well.I don't want to give away a lot of the details, and even if I tried, I don't want to dilute your experience of seeing this film with some mundane attempt to describe how wonderful, sad, hysterically funny and moving it is overall. Simply saying that BENJAMIN BUTTON is the story about a man who lives his life in reverse, is like saying that ROOTS was the story about a slave. Or GONE WITH THE WIND was about a war. Or CITIZEN KANE was about a man who ran a newspaper. The less you know going in, the more astonished you'll be when you have seen this in its entirety - the FIRST time. Don't be daunted by the nearly three-hour running time. Like the best parts of your own life lived, it goes by in the blink of an eye.Well, mercifully, I will cut my senseless babbling short here. I only ask, no, BEG you to be sure not to wait for the DVD. Let that be the fate of all other movies you see from this year. But this one? Get to a theater and see it NOW. And take family and friends as well. It's the best holiday present you will give them....EVER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen!Simplistic,pandering, silly, plodding, inaccurate, full of awful stereotypes - painful! shameful! Whatever is good about it - others have pointed out the great makeup for example - is way overshadowed by the utterly stupid and vacuous premise of the film. The short story may be wonderful. The conceit of the film is ridiculous. It's one of those movies that tells you the characters love each other, but we don't feel it. We are told Momma loves her Benjamin, but we don't feel it. Benjamin himself is really quite the jerk.The heavy poorly done accents alone almost do in this one alone. I am not sure why Southern accents inspire such derision, but this movie has set back another decade or two anyone taking Southerners seriously.I saw this because I have heretofore enjoyed all of Brad's movies. Not a fan of Cate, but she can act. They are both awful in this. I blame that on the idiotic story &amp; execution. At its best it's sentimental, empty pap, at its worst it's pretentious, bloviated, false and offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A true epic that left me utterly speechless". Ha ha! This Zelig/Forrest Gump/Being There rewrite/ripoff left you speechless? Perhaps that's for the best. Unfortunately, you could still type.This truly cynical movie is a blatant appeal to the elderly who wish to (literally) turn back the clock to when they were young. And to look like Brad Pitt would not be a negative either (despite him looking like either a paper bag or Kevin Spacey through most of this movie). Most movies are marketed to those with the dollars, and this movie is no exception. It should have been called The Curious Case of Baby Boomers. Don't worry old people - you'll be flying up to "heaven" (as an embarrassingly clichéd CGI hummingbird) soon, no doubt! "You're not getting any younger" is not just a cliché, it's the truth. You won't be kicking the can (ala Twilight Zone), you'll be kickin' the bucket. Bon voyage! Hopefully, after you're gone, we won't have to put up with boring, ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE (yeah, he's getting younger. AND? What else?) 3-hour (was it 3 hours long? felt like it) crud such as this. Do I have to mention that the clock and the real father (remember? the guy with the titular buttons?) and the midget and the ship and the daughter and the weather etc. themes went nowhere beyond simply moving the plot along? That there was basically no character development? Fincher (who also made Fight Club - a great movie) is a quality director. Brad Pitt is charming and good-looking. There was tons of CGI and period costumes. Yet...This movie blew as hard as the forced "hurricane" subplot. I wish I could turn back the clock to before I wasted my time and money on this nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll age in this over long and over hyped movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's whole genre of movies whose plot line could be summarised as 'a fish out of water' where the central character is out of place ("Crocodile Dundee") or time ("Back To The Future") or body ("Big"). "Benjamin Button" is firmly of this type with its preposterous idea of a baby born as an old man and then becoming younger and younger. The proposition comes from a 1921 short story by F Scott Fitzgerald that, most unusually for a literary work adapted for the screen, can be read much faster (about 10 minutes) than the film can be viewed (an overlong 165 minutes).The eponymous curiosity is played by Brad Pitt who gives such a languid performance than one suspects that he was as bored as many viewers will be. Really the star of the movie is the ever-excellent Cate Blanchett who is BB's love interest Daisy (actually he manages an awful lot of sex in spite of his physical challenges) and Tilda Swinton and Julia Ormond are fine as well.The narrative takes nothing from the short story except the name and the concept and screenwriter Eric Roth is clearly attempting a repeat of his success with "Forrest Gump" - another 'fish out of water' - but "BB" has none of the humour and charm of the earlier work. Amazingly the film has been nominated for no less than 13 Academy Awards, but this is an over-hyped affair that only deserves awards for the very clever technical trickery depicting the ageing and reverse ageing processes of its central characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while ? a very long while ? a film comes along that is fully worthy of your total suspension of disbelief, where you can sink comfortably into the theatre seat and simply take it in, knowing you're in completely competent hands. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" was one of those extraordinarily rare films, for me.Within the first 20 minutes of this masterpiece ? a word I don't use lightly or often ? I knew it was gonna be OK; I could relax, let go and just allow the story to wash over me. And what a story it is, this one. It sounds weird, when you first hear the premise ? Brad Pitt's character aging backwards, starting out as an old man (who reminded me of an extremely wizened Robert Redford) and getting younger as he goes on. However, within the context of the film it works brilliantly. It's tied in to how a clockmaker creates a clock that goes backwards in time; he built it that way in the hope that it would somehow bring back loved ones who died during war. So the weird concept doesn't exist in a vacuum, it's given a grounded basis, however fantastical that basis is.That's the thing about this film ~ it's got this fantastical element at the center of it, but the story itself is grounded in reality, the reality of life ? its joys, its sorrows, its surprises, its moments of transcendent beauty and the sometimes devastating discovery that things most often work out much differently than one imagines or dreams they will. At its core, this is a story about love ? the love of a woman, Queenie (a heartfelt, beautiful performance from Taraji P. Henson), for a horrific-looking little baby, the love of a father for his son, the love of a man for a woman and a woman (Cate Blanchett's stunning performance) for a reversely-aging man.At the heart of the film, of course, is Brad Pitt's perfect turn as Benjamin. Aside from all the other wonderful things he brings to it, his part needed someone physically beautiful, to give full power to the segment of the movie where Benjamin is in the magnificent glory of his prime. Vincent Gallo, as great as he is, wouldn't have cut it, is what I'm saying. Pitt's physical beauty gives deep resonance to this segment ~ there's a heartbreaking feeling to this part of the film, making what follows even more chilling, as we see him become younger and younger, until even the memories of his incredibly-lived life are obliterated by his ever-regressing child's brain.A few more things that deserve mention: there's a great turn by the wonderful Tilda Swinton, who finally realizes her dream of being the first woman to swim the England Channel, at age 68, and also one from the great Jared Harris, as the colorful, consistently inebriated artist/sailor, Captain Mike. His character provides a lot of the humor in the film, and there is a lot of humor throughout, though never at the expense of the characters. The rest of the casting is perfect, as well ? for instance, you really believe that the younger Daisy has grown up to be Cate Blanchett.Screenwriter Roth and director Fincher make all the right choices in this epic piece of film making. This is the kind of film that movie theatres were created for in the first place, it's the kind of movie that cannot be rationalized or intellectualized or nitpicked to pieces - it simply must be experienced, in all the rarity of its awe-inspiring wonder. My favorite line, the most eloquent and the most ironic, is in the scene where Benjamin has become a youth (sort of reminding us how he looked in "Thelma and Louise" so many years ago), and Daisy gasps, "You've gotten so much younger!" and he replies, with hard-earned, world-weary wisdom, "Only on the outside."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different turn for Fincher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an aspiring filmmaker I love that a director who normally deals with violence and scum of the streets changes his tone completely to test himself. I am not sure if Fincher is the best at this story because he doesn't want to be too sappy, but he certainly isn't bad at it because he gets cinema. Now, maybe Spielberg or Zemeckis are better at this kind of story, but who cares, this is a great escapist film and the best technical achievement of the decade next too Pan's Labirynth and The Lord of The Rings series. The film doesn't stick with you as well as something like Forrest Gump, which you can't help but compare it too because they are very similar, mostly b/c they are from the same writer; If you don't know who that is then you're an idiot. I loved watching this film and the nearly three hours felt like an hour and a half. All the performances are good, and may deserve Oscar nominations, but should not win, because the technology of the film helps there performances a lot and also because in every acting category there is at least one, two, three, or four performances that were better. I think Pitt can be very good, especially with Fincher, I love Cate Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson is awesome here. I wanted too think this was a completely great film, but I couldn't for some reason. I had problems with the film. I did not like the narrative of the story being told during Katrina from the daughter of Button(Pitt) and Daisy(Blanchett). After the film I realized it was contrived and unnecessary, even though I really liked the hummingbird at the end. Instead what they could've done is just show the hummingbird during the rain right after Button is dying. Also, I would have liked for some of the people to be a little angrier, everything was a little too melancholy and even silly, silly might be too strong but you know what I mean. I loved the Tilda Swinton chunk of the film and I especially loved the part of the film where Daisy and Button meet in the middle. The themes are strong, and the story is strong, but they are not as strong as the technique; that's why this is not the best film of the year. I made a top ten list of the year, like I do every year because I'm weird, and this ended up being 8th on my list(In Order: Slumdog Millionaire, Milk, The Dark Knight, The Wrestler, Synechdoche, Rachel Getting Married, 4 Months 3 weeks &amp; 2 Days, and then The Curious Case)because of the lack of emotions after the film and the flaws in story telling. Not Forrest Gump or the best film of the year, but it's not that far behind and technically it probably is a greater achievement. Look out for Fincher to win Best Director at the Oscars this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" follows the life of Benjamin Button, who is born with the appearance and physical limitations of a man who is 87 years old. Abandoned in a nursing home by his father, Benjamin begins aging backward on the outside of his body. While in the home, he meets Daisy, a young aspiring ballerina. As the film progresses, the two fall in love, while struggling to deal with the issue of one growing younger while the other grows older.My favorite film from David Fincher is "Zodiac." By the end of the film, I found it quite surprising "Benjamin Button" wasn't all as great as people hype it to be. Don't be surprised when you find this film not as great as you imagined it to be. The hype makes the film much more than what it really is. However, that doesn't make the film bad. In fact, it's really fantastic, but, again, not as good as you would've wanted it to be.What starts off on a mediocre note, "Benjamin Button" is like other films you've seen before. You see this old woman, Daisy, in this hospital. Her daughter is sitting next to her. The mother tells her to read off a diary, written by the man she loved. Then starts off the journey of the film. While the story goes on, once in awhile, or quite often, the story stops and goes back to present day. I found that quite annoying. It does break the flow of the film but I guess all movies do that.Filled with flaws like that, "Benjamin Button" is not a perfect film. The film is awfully long that I found some points in the film very pointless and have no meaning to the story whatsoever. However, I guess the point of the film is to show the life of Benjamin and not the romance tale between him and Daisy, which I thought would've been just as good a movie, making it probably forty-five minutes shorter. This being said, the best parts of the whole movie was the romance tale between Benjamin and Daisy.As the film progresses, the film turns mediocre to great until the brilliant last act. The fairy tale has a very timeless feel to it and I guess that's what made the film so great. Brad Pitt does a great job portraying Benjamin at various ages. When Cate Blanchett comes in, she, as well, does a great job with her role. Supporting roles like Taraji P. Henson and even cameo roles like Tilda Swinton do their best for the movie.Like Fincher's previous work, "Benjamin Button" has a great look throughout the film, portraying different pieces of time fantastically and believably. On the same level, the costumes are great as well as the special effects. In the end, "Benjamin Button" is not perfect, but I didn't care. It's a fantastic film filled with flaws and it's proud of that fact. I think it's a great fairy tale for everyone, excluding kids, to see. While not the best film of the year, it's pretty high up there as well as being the most ambitious work from Fincher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another life-in-the-20th-century film with a twist that doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is basically the narration of the life of a person through the 20th century (WW2, swinging 60s, etc), but even on that premise it completely bypasses many of the big events and there's little other story or character interaction to make up for it. The main twist is that Benjamin Button lives his life in reverse (though time still moves forwards), being born as an old man and growing younger as time goes on.The film is okay, but not great. It didn't grip me and after a couple of hours I was waiting for it to finish. It's broken into segments of Benjamin's life without much overlap between them. Almost exactly the same story could have been told in a more interesting way with the main protagonist being a normal person (life moving forwards) who had a few problems in keeping relationships with people. That's essentially what it seemed to be, with very few characters lasting the length of his life and interacting with his condition realistically at the same time. The strength of this film is the acting and the cinematography, but the weakness is its screenplay.There's huge scope to explore the life of someone ageing in reverse, but the screenplay doesn't expend much effort to do so. The main characters throughout the film recognise that Benjamin is ageing in reverse, but simply accept it without questioning how or why it happens, or becoming obviously concerned about the implications or unknowns. It's as if they all just got up and thought "Hey, that guy's ageing backwards -- that sucks" and then went on with their lives without wondering about it in any detail.There's very little exploration about what lengths someone might need to go to to fit into society without such a problem actually being noticed, such as getting a passport or any other kind of public record, escaping being drafted for Vietnam (for which he must have been a prime candidate), or just living below the radar of those who might want to learn more about his condition. The closest the story comes to investigating implications is with a brief sub-plot about (not) raising a family, which is a shallow addendum stapled to the end.A vague effort is made to connect Benjamin's life to the life of a clock in a railway station that was built by its depressed maker to run backwards, but for me it didn't work at all. A short story about the creation of the clock is given at the start, an announcement that the clock has been dismantled is made at the end, but throughout the whole movie -- including at Benjamin's birth and death -- no plausible reason is given to believe that there's any connection between the clock and his life. Did the producers just throw this bit into the script at the last minute because they thought it'd seem cool? It felt superfluous to the film and I thought it should have been either cut, or properly intertwined with the rest of the story so it would actually be meaningful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambitious but complete failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, a film is more than just an excuse to eat popcorn and be entertained. A film is a chance to view the world through someone else's eyes, no matter how right or wrong, intelligent or unintelligent they may be, and if you look hard enough there are many life lessons to be learned. I have seen thousands of films, (that is in no way an exaggeration), own hundreds of films and love many of them, but if you had to ask me to pick favorites out of all films I have seen and own, David Fincher, the director of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button would definitely be part of the cream of the crop. In a tie for my favorite film of all time, it would be between Sidney Lumet's 1957 masterpiece 12 Angry Men and Fincher's masterwork Fight Club. Full of twists, subliminal messages that are noticeable after repeat viewings, excellent performances and a story that is undeniably unique, Fight Club is the next step in cinematic perfection that never fails to amaze whether it's the first viewing or the tenth. It is also arguably the only film I have seen where the screen adaptation was far better than the book, (yes, Fight Club was a novel long before it hit the big screen). So one would think the only man fit to adapt an old cherished yarn of a man born old who ages young would be Fincher. This is not so. It should be a crime that Fincher was even able to think about doing this film.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is based off of F. Scott Fitzergald's 1921 short story of the same name, which was roughly 60 pages long. I believe this is the essential mistake with this film. It takes a very short story and creates a film that is almost three hours long. It follows a man born physically like an old man, save for his height through his life. He appears as a baby but has the wrinkled skin, arthritis and the hairdo of a geriatric male at first and then begins to grow young. The story is intriguing at first, i.e. it will spark ones curiosity and the effects the technological wizard David Fincher uses are mind blowing. He manages to make Brad Pitt appear as an old 3-foot man flawlessly. You won't believe your eyes. Sadly that's mainly the only great thing in this ambitious but thoroughly flawed film.The acting in Button is overall mediocre, save for Brad Pitt's performance, who becomes his character even without the technical wizardry, and earns the right for his Oscar nomination. Only Pitt's nomination and the visual effects nomination are worthy here (Button was nominated for 13 Oscars which effectively proves that the Oscars are a scam with all credibility now revoked in my book). Everyone else does their jobs to the bare minimum which would be okay with a better script, but that is where Button ultimately, and colossally fails. Eric Roth, known mostly for his work with Button-like Forrest Gump and other critically acclaimed pictures like The Horse Whisperer, the Insider and Ali wrote Button's script but failed to realize the essential component of what makes Benjamin Button so curious and instead focuses on his experiences and not their meaning. He is also far too poetic. There is a great 5 minute scene in which button describes about ten different happenings during the day which add up to cause an accident in which Cate Blanchett's character is injured. It is very poetic and well done in every way; however, one can usually come to those obvious conclusions on their own and makes you realize the 5 minutes here are wasted much like the entire film is wasted. The 5 minutes could have been saved for some meaning if Benjamin had instead just said, "Daisy got hit by a car." It may look like an intelligent way of saying something but is ultimately pretentious and an insulting waste of time.Overall Benjamin Button looks good, and seems very intriguing. Sadly, it should have stayed a short story. It is much too long at nearly three hours which feels like four, is unintelligent with its pseudo-philosophies that have been over explored already, (for better films in this genre see Forrest Gump and Into the Wild) and will either put you to sleep or drive you to suicide. Do not see this film. It is one of the worst films of 2008, (it is on par with the grotesque Strange Wilderness) and it wholly wastes the talents of Brad Pitt and David Fincher, and I have now lost all respect for Eric Roth and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, (the Oscars), which have now become one long commercial and a look at an extravagant life most of us could never dream of where multi-millionaires give each other high-fives and tell each other how awesome they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joe Black Meets Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was apprehensive about this one going in...there was of course the glut of rave reviews and Oscar guarantees, but enough terds in the punchbowl to make me wonder.Fincher has made great movies, Fight Club and Seven to name a couple, but Panic Room was brutal and I could never get into Zodiac. So I was somewhat hesitant to brave the corn syrup swamp that is the megatheatre but Pitt, Blanchett, a day off of work and a hangover were enough to get me there.The bad news started in the coming attractions...nothing that even seemed worth renting...and this reel of banality continued for the next three hours. It seemed like the filmmakers, concerned about making another Forrest Gump but likely hired to do just that, decided to take out everything that made gump great and left only the empty shell. Case in point...you have an old man and a little girl forming a highly unlikely bond...work with that! Sure its a little "on the nose" but its comedy gold! There was only one scene that hit on this strange relationship, and really no scenes at all that gave us any idea why these two beauties might truly love each other.Don't get me started on the man struck by lightning either...this gimmick within a gimmick movie made me cringe every time. Totally unimaginative and cheap.Tilda Swinton was the lone bright spot, but even the relationship struck up by she and Pitt could have been given more depth.Overall, it's two pretty people on the screen for a good while and if this is enough to get you theatre, fine, but I wouldn't even recommend a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously unmoved by Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film review contains the biggest plot spoiler of all time: simply put, the plotting is horrible. The filmmakers have taken an engaging idea and allowed it to wander off half-cocked and unfocused, until it finally just closes its eyes and dies.This does not have the sympathetic emotional complexities of "Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (similar theme of emotional disambiguation) nor the complicated psychological interweaving of "Fight Club" (same director.) Instead, it is a rambling, shambles of a film which lacks the emotional depth and honesty required to provoke a truly heartfelt response from the audience. The ultimate result is hollow and unsatisfying.That said, pretty much everything else about it is good: art, design, cinematography and acting are excellent. Even the script's not bad: the dialog and the concept are intriguing, the characters are interesting, but ultimately, what the filmmakers choose to do with all that good work is so ad hoc that it drains the sympathy out of the predicament.So here's the problem laid out in full: ***even more plot spoilers***The story is set in New Orleans. An old woman is dying in hospital as Hurricane Katrina is approaching. To distract her mother, the daughter reads to her from the diary of a friend: Benjamin Buttons. Benjamin was born as a baby-sized old man, and grows younger as his life proceeds. His mother dies in child birth and his father, appalled by the little freak, dumps him at an old people's home (which is a nice twist on leaving a baby outside an orphanage.) A woman working at the home is childless - and accepts the baby as her own private miracle. Parallels are drawn between infancy and senility. Daisy, the granddaughter of an elderly resident, comes to visit. She and Benjamin are both seven years old, and it's love at first sight. Benjamin looks like he's 70 so it's a little creepy but we get it: love sees through the human veneer of time and space.As they age, Benjamin gets younger, and Daisy gets older. After many failed attempts, they become lovers at the age of 43. Unexpectedly, they also have a baby daughter. Everything is about to become most interesting; the standard convention of older men marrying young women will be put on its head; the father and daughter will both be 21 at the same time; the conflicts inherent between an older wife and her younger husband will be explored; will love also see through that veneer?But the film doesn't go there. Instead, Benjamin leaves Daisy after celebrating their daughter's first birthday taking my interest in the story with him. His explanation to Daisy is that he's being noble: he will become too young to help raise their daughter to adulthood, and will then become an infantile burden on Daisy. As it is, Daisy marries again, her second husband dies, and she ends up nursing Benjamin in his second childhood, anyway. And Hurricane Katrina? It doesn't amount to much.***F. Scott Fitzgerald*** The underlying idea for the film is based on a short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was written in 1922, which may be why the film has been set in that period (rather than the belle epoque as the story is.) Many of the rudimentary ideas are the same, but the short story is more directly focused on Benjamin and his changing relationship with his father, wife and son.In the Fitzgerald story, the wife is middle aged at 35, and a matronly by 43. Benjamin is able to raise his son, but by the age of 30, they start to swap places. Finally, the analogies of infancy and senility that are found at the start of the film, are at the end of the short story.Ultimately, it seems as though the filmmakers were squeamish about directly engaging with the question of aging once the characters pass 40. The very old are fair game - but the power years? 40 - 65? I'd love to see the market research on that lot. Cate Blanchett is a magnificent beauty who will be 40 next year, and yet the film makers seem squeamish about giving her a look that is convincingly middle aged. Her makeup is great as the dying Daisy, but three years earlier in the films chronology, she looks barely 50. I was thoroughly moved by Fincher's manifesto on the state of manhood in 'Fight Club'. I expected him to be as raw and real on the tyranny of time, and am plainly disappointed that he wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Based on an advance preview:) I tend to be impressed by films that effectively achieve a wide epic-type story-telling "scope", and this is a very telling commentary on relationships over long-ranging lives. It starts out with a surfacedly- difficult premise -- a guy Benjamin (BRAD PITT) who ages in reverse and meets love interest Daisy (CATE BLANCHETT). With wonderful makeup, cgi effects and acting, it all "WORKS", enhanced by strong efforts by the supporting cast members: TARAJI P. HENSON as the housekeeper at a rooming house who adopts him as a baby, JARED HARRIS as Captain Mike, TILDA SWINTON as someone he gets attached to, JULIA ORMOND as Daisy's daughter Caroline, and numerous people living at the rooming house. It succeeds in director David Fincher's goal of showing "mortality and life? and the way we're touched and affected by" the people "we meet along the way". I found this to be an often sweet and charming film that meanders successfully through the "complicated" lives and times of its many characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Haven't we all been drooling for Old Man Brad for what seems like ages now? And who can blame us....The allure of the combined writing talents of Eric Roth and Robin Swicord - the first-time-coupling of two power-broker talents with films like The Good Shepherd, Munich, Memoirs Of A Geisha and Little Women to their individual credits; the third collaboration between star Brad Pitt and director David Fincher (remember Se7en? How about Fight Club? Ask any male born after 1985 about those films influence...); Pitt and Cate Blanchett together again after Babel; Tilda Swinton's third in a row after Michael Clayton and Burn After Reading; the best trailer of the year.Just how much did the Brad Pitt vehicle "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" intrigue me? I saw it three days ago at an Australian screening and it's just about to click over 2.00am the following Monday. There's lots to mull over....That's the good news.The downside is that after 165 minutes of film and 72 hours of contemplation, I've time-travel led. Its not the much-anticipated peek at "...Benjaman Button", December 2008 that I'm reliving; it's 1994 and I'm at the Greater Union Parramatta cinema for an 11.00am session in mid-1994, and I've just watched "Forrest Gump".As much as I want to (and I desperately want to, though my respect for the 'spoiler warning' dictates), I am not going to repeat the 90 minute conversation that consumed the drive home from the screening. Over that 90 minutes, my partner and I indulged in "Forrest Button" - a sometimes hilarious, sometimes sarcastic yet, ultimately, blindingly-obvious game that involved matching the plot/characters/themes/minutiae of the Tom Hanks Oscar-winner from 18 years ago with one of the five the most-anticipated films of this year.And it's long. Throat-tighteningly; bum-numbingly; shoulder-stiffeningly long.At this point, I can't stress enough that the "Forrest / Button" comparisons are not all negative. Like the film that bumped Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and Quiz Show at the '95 Oscars (not to mention the un-nominated Ed Wood, The Madness Of King George and Three Colours:Blue - jeez, who was in charge there...?), The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button has much to recommend and admire. It's a shoo-in for major nominations at most award ceremonies for technical achievements like cinematography, special effects, set and costume design. No complaints in any of those departments - it is an exquisite, beautifully, even lovingly-rendered visual journey.But the tragi-whimsical story that the lead character must endure - that is, aging from a newborn old man to a mentally-dwindling, decrepit baby - offers a premise of far more promise than it ever fully delivers.And its long. Drink-replenishlingly; babysitter-communicatingly; parking fee-multiplyingly long.Variety's editor-in-chief Peter Bart wrote a recent piece commending that, in a time of fiscal barrenness in an industry financed by corporate stakeholders, its admirable to see idiosyncratic yet wildly expensive films like Baz Luhrmann's Australia and Fincher's ...Benjamin Button get the support of assorted CEO's, CFO's and COO's.But despite at first appearing edgy and fresh, both films are knock-offs. At least I respect Luhrmann for acknowledging his influences on screen - Wizard Of Oz, Gone With The Wind, The African Queen and God knows what else.But ...Benjamin Button is a con. Seen it all before....I'll return to this post in more detail, after more have seen the film and the discussion want spoil anyones potential enjoyment.But be warned. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is like a box of chocolates - beautifully packaged, but a mixture of flavours that wont please everyone, nearly impossible to finish in one sitting and full of fat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poor man's Forrest Gump with an inexplicable gimmick tossed in, this really didn't need to be half as long as it was. All the major scenes seemed like window dressing while the dull in-between moments were stretched out for as long as possible. It had a few charming scenes and some legitimately funny bits (particularly the old man recounting his experiences with lightning strikes) but give any film nearly three hours and a huge budget; the law of averages says it's bound to stumble across a few of those by sheer chance. Many of the character moments were forced and stiff, and there was almost zero chemistry between Blanchett and Pitt to back up their supposed lifelong passion for one another. Wrapping the whole story up in the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina just felt cheap and needless. A real disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating. If you didn't enjoy, you have missed this films subtle beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype about Benjamin Button somehow eluded me, therefore I had no expectations before watching the film. In fact, I only rented the movie at the last minute in order to entertain a group of friends. I spent the entire 168 minutes completely engrossed in the story. Over the next few hours lost in thoughts of life the film had provoked within me. I am absolutely astounded at some of the negativity on this forum in regards to this film. The general dissatisfaction surrounding this film seems to be in regards to its length. The sad truth about Hollywood films today is that unless there is non stop action people lose interest. Pathetic!! The best films take time to build characters. You can become infatuated with somebody in an hour but to make a deep connection with somebody takes time. The same concept applies here. French cinema prides itself on the ability to build characters and develop story. Hollywood might want to adopt this method more often.The simplicity with which the plot is conveyed underlines the POINT of the story so many people seem to have missed. The point to this film is best summed up by Button in his letter to his daughter Caroline: "For what it's worth, it's never too late or in my case too early, to be whoever you wanna be. There's no time limit, start whenever you want. You can change, or stay the same. There are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle ya. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again."Benjamin Button experienced all of these things. We see them unfold in his life. Some might say he was boring and unremarkable besides the way he ages. Others can see the sensitive and achingly human heart that lies beneath his quiet exterior. Benjamin is fascinated by life and his unique experiences leave him increasingly curious about the world. Benjamin Button goes through the motions of life, often in a bizarre chronological order, but he none the less discovers it. It is through Benjamin's life and legacy that his daughter, who at the beginning of the film feels as though she is a failure (apologises to her mother for being a disappointment), is able to draw hope and inspiration. He lived a life full of adventure; he loved, lost and made connections with a range of different people. And so in a way, his life continues on.Direction by Fincher is remarkable; Pitt is spot on; Blanchett is breathtaking, as always. Make up, special effects, wardrobe is all brilliant.BAD REVIEWS DISCLAIMER- Button is nothing like Gump. He is sharp minded and processes all that the sees with precision. - The Hummingbird somebody on here referred to as being "ridiculous" is a representation of the backwards theme in the film. Hummingbirds are the only animal which can fly backwards. Relevance. - Quiet character does not equal boring character. Learn to observe. - Button is anything BUT unthankful and a coward. He epitomises somebody who accepts the hand they are dealt. i.e. "there's nothing wrong with old age". He leaves Daisy out of Caroline's best interests, not his own inability or fears about fathering a child. - Life is beautiful. The way people deal with it is unique. Button is one of billions of stories. That is a main theme in the film. - Button gets that in the end, being mad or holding on to what is unfair in life just isn't worth it. "You've just got to let it go."</fullReview>

I was truly amazed at the way that they achieved the impressive reverse aging process. Going into this movie, I really was not sure how they would accomplish that, but they really exceeded my expectations and did an amazing job. A lot of people complained about the length of this film, and it is true that it is long, but I feel that everything in the film was necessary and was all important to the story.I really loved how we were able to accompany Benjamin throughout the coarse of his life and be there throughout his many journeys.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie after a long time of its release. As I had no interest into this movie before. And because I had enjoyed the Slumdog Millionaire much at that time. But today after watching this film I can say that this is masterpiece. Acting, direction and everything on the screen the dialogues. All are good. According to my perception this movie is telling the truth and reality of human life. The life seen the other way round. In reality also whoever grows to the old age they become almost like a child. They starts forgetting things, they become stubborn, and they wet the bed. They have to be taken care of. Yet, they have lived a full life which was full of life. They were young and they enjoyed all kind of joy and pain. This life of human being is portrayed into the film, but the other way round. Benjamin was old born and died as a baby. But that makes nothing less painful for him as any other human being. May be anything, but this is my perception. This movie is a lot like Forest Gump and Shawshank Redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room), I only heard of this film when the Oscars were coming up, and it did sound quite an original idea. Basically elderly Daisy Williams/Fuller is on her deathbed in hospital, and her daughter Caroline (First Knight's Julia Ormond) reads aloud the diary of a man named Benjamin. In a series of flashbacks, we see Benjamin born (with his mother dying in the process), and abandoned by biological father Thomas (Jason Flemyng). He was born in most bizarre circumstances, throughout his life growing up, he is ageing backwards. So as a baby he was born in his 80's, and as he grows, he looks older than he actually is. He was raised by seniors home carer Queenie (Oscar nominated Taraji P. Henson) who found him, and living their he also meets the girl who will later become his love, Daisy of course. Now a fully grown man, still looking older than his real age, Benjamin (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Brad Pitt) goes to work on a tugboat, has an affair with older, married Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton), goes through the Pearl Harbor attack, and eventually returns home to meet his revealed father. He is also reunited with a grown Daisy (Cate Blanchett), their love blossoms, they move in together, and of course as Daisy looks older, Benjamin looks younger. It is when Daisy has a baby that he feels it is not fair to have a man like him as a father, so he leaves. He only returns to see Daisy married to another man, and his daughter Caroline grown up, and eventually he returns to the senior home to be cared for by Queenie, and Daisy, as we see him shrinking to child size, suffering dementia, until dying looking like a baby, and of course, back in the present, old Daisy dies. Also starring Elias Koteas as Monsieur Gateau and Josh Stewart as Pleasant Curtis. This is a very intriguing and at times emotional idea for the lifespan of a character, a real change of style and tone for director Fincher, and with superb CGI and make-up effects giving us this journey it is a unique feeling film experience. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Music for Alexandre Desplat, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Make Up &amp; Hair, Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Cate Blanchett was number 37, and Brad Pitt number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 The World's Greatest Actors. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just saw it again.... it is absolutely amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button the first time in the cinema. As a big David Fincher fan, I had high hopes for the film and it didn't disappoint me. In fact it far exceeded my expectations. But I don't want to soley judge the film as a work by David Fincher, but as a film in its own right.I loved it the first time, but my biggest worry was that it wouldn't hold up upon a second viewing. All of my top favourite films only get better the more often I watch them, so the second viewing to me is even more important than the first one. And this film does just that. It gets better the second time around and I'm already looking forward for my third viewing.It is hard to pinpoint a single reason why this film is great. The performances are stunning. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett have great chemistry and were perfectly cast opposite each other. All the other actors fit perfectly to the characters they play.The story is a simple one, but a very emotional one. And it is told at a pace which I've noticed is not easy for some to handle. It is slow, but the last thing I'd call it is boring. And it is tragic. Very tragic. And if tragedy is not your cup of tea, then this film is definitely one to avoid.I'm the kind of person who needs the right setting to watch a film. I cant just watch it on a laptop or on an iphone. I need the darkened room with a nice big TV. And watching this film on Bluray engulfs you even more.You will have heard about similarities with Forrest Gump, but those similarities are superficial and irrelevant. They are the kind of similarities which are common in movies. Like the ones shared by Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. Or The Terminator and The Matrix. Or Sunshine and Event Horizon. You can find a million films which have tons of similarities between each other. But all that matters is if the characters are believable and if you can suspend your disbelief enough to enjoy watching them for the duration of the film.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button does that immaculately. I will recommend this film to anyone. Of course not everyone will like it, but in my case, I was deeply touched by that movie. Twice over. It is definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.I cant wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Button,Button, Whose Got the Button?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "The Reader",Benjamin is a great disappointment. But,while "The Reader" was entertainingly implausible, this film was just tiresome. For starters how did so many mediocre directors get the idea that if you film something in an amber light it gives a more realistic sense of the past.It doesn't. The second problem noticed was this film often needed subtitles, so many of the speeches were delivered in a mush-mouth fashion. From the beginning, it was riddled with clichés, the angry father, the beyond compassionate black woman,the beyond-wise oldsters, the good-hearted but tough sailor, the cliché cat house. Pitt, usually talented, was wooden. But then the script was solid oak. The only moments worth watching were with Tilda Swinton and even her character had enough sense to pack up and leave.This is one of those films, like "Titanic" where you could spend an entire afternoon commenting on its many flaws, inconsistencies and unintentional laughs. All these film buffs who praise Fincher must be the same people who think that Ronnie Howard is a talented director.Almost every scene is predictable or borrowed from somebody else. The only thing curious about the case of Benjamin Button is why anybody made this saccharine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outright classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I had seen the first preview for this film I knew that I wanted to see it. I waited to rent it because I felt I wasn't missing anything not seeing it in a theater. I had high hopes for this film and it definitely did not disappoint. David Fincher is a true genius and I feel should have won director of the year for this picture. I felt moved after finishing it and I didn't want the movie to end. The movie is on the long side, but if seems so short because I was so wrapped up in it. Pitt gives his best performance in years and Blanchett also is phenomenal. It's the people that Benjamin meets throughout the movie and the friendship and relationships he has with these people are what make the movie. It is a one of a kind film that left me amazed when I was finished with it. A great story about love, friendship, hardships, and growing up. This picture moved me like none other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I saw TCCOBB, I was surrounded with so many negative reviews that I even at one point last hope in this film. All I heard was: "It's too long", or "It's pointless". Yes, opinions do differ, but people were totally panning the film! Until I saw the film, and I was in awe! The film is enchanting and magical. It follows the entire life of Benjamin Button; a man born in his 80s and ages backwards. The plot is a fantasy, but it is so well-treated that you get so sucked in and enjoy the film. Many themes run throughout the film, most notably death, loss and forbidden love.Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime! Brilliant! Taraji also shines as Queenie, she gives this character a huge heart, and she's like an angel! Blanchette also did a great job (An Oscar nomination would have been well-deserved).David Fincher adds a magic to this film that is so rare in movies! He was robbed! The screenplay's pretty good, and there are some killer lines! he he THe visuals are stunning! The make is awe-inspiring! The sets and costumes are gorgeous! The scenery is stunning, and the score was stuck in my mind! TCCOBB is a magical film, not to miss! Should have won many more Oscars. Dunno why all of the negative commentaries! It will live forever.P.s: Prepare yourself for many tear-jerking moments!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OKAY movie.... but boring...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a movie about a man who ages backwards. Okay, i'll admit, sound interesting but...When i started to watch the movie it was very slow-going and not very interesting in terms of the story being told but i gave it time and after 2 1/2 hours .. it was still boring.I can surely appreciate the genre of the movie i do not expect a car chase, but there was no suspense, nothing that made you want to keep watching.The Plot in itself is a lot like Forrest Gump, but lacks the controversy, humor and charm that Forrest Gump had.Although i must say, the cast is very good in this movie, except the character of Daisy when she is older, i never understood a word she said.I can understand the moral of the story being about love, loss, and atonement , and all that good stuff, but to me the movie is more about the story of a man and his love life.Also, the fact that he ages backwards had a lot and so little to do with the story. It's a strange thing, but his condition did nothing to make the movie more interesting. But at the same time, it was a big factor of the movie. ... strange, i know.Needless to say, the movie was not HORRIBLE, it was a great story, but an uninteresting movie. But it will most likely become a classic. These types of movies usually do.:)</fullReview>

Every person has his own preserved place on this planet (except Benjamin, he's just an observer), but only if they start from the right beginning.Like the old lady in the scene when haircutting Benjamin (they were talking about he is going reverse) i feel pity about his life. He outlives everyone he mets.This kind of life brings to big responsibilities for a young learner child in the body of a old man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cinema is the only art form that allows us to transcend the inevitable progression of time. Photography permits us to freeze images in a trapped temporal position, but since its earliest days cinema has shown how the world might appear if we could shuffle the order of calendar selections. In "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" the genius of the story is contained within pure science fiction material. A child is born as a withered old man with one foot in the grave and ages over the course of a healthy lifespan to become younger with each passing year. Millions of possibilities exist as to how this man could lead his mysterious existence, and the grandest gesture in David Fincher's old-fashioned fantasy is that the man is treated not as a freak, but observed by others, and ourselves, from a different perspective. As a commentary on the goodwill of fellow man, this is a movie to clasp.There is a young boy who lives in my neighbourhood who has a hideous deformity on his face. One can only sympathise with his unfortunate condition. Whether his outer appearance affects any relationship I may have with him is unfounded. If he is a good guy I will welcome his friendship, but if he fails to be civil around me then I will judge him solely by his attitude. That is how the sea of characters take to Mr. Benjamin Button. I went in expecting to see one sort of movie and was joyously surprised. Director David Fincher steers clear of casting a herd of bullying folk to tease and mock the abnormal individual. He also avoids sticking slavishly to the original comic material by F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is an old-fashioned weepie epic in the best sense of the description. It is tough to make such a picture and avoid critical bashing because it is easy to veer into the realm of melodrama. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" hardly enters into this territory. Yes, the sets and the effects take precedence, but there is character depth on display. The natural progression of the story is set in stone, so all Fincher can hope to achieve is through his protagonist's inducing of radical thought through absorbing others beliefs.Read the full review: http://www.sightforallseasons.co.nr/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, but not fulfilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is fair to say that when I knew David Fincher is going to do a movie about a man aging backwards, I was expecting a film which is dark (true to Fincher's other film tones), but ends with a note like 'there is hope, there is a bright light'. When the movie came out, the grapevine had it that the film instead was trying to endorse a meaning or the nostalgia of life.OK, I'll get this straight. I personally have very high expectations when a film tries to talk about life in a whole. I've read some wonderful books that taught me what my life is all about, but Benjamin Button is little more than a cinematic painting which is beautiful and runs like a small poem, has nostalgia in spurts and more. The film is beautiful in as many parts as it is somewhat depressing.The major disappointment about this film is that the concept could have been transformed into a much better story. Instead, the writers chose to place the Curious man named Benjamin in a silent commodity of living his life like any other man outside there, instead of showing him as the miracle that he could have been. End of the day, he was just a man who lived. The miracle was missing.I had troubles trying to get 'its talking about life' concept out of my mind till halfway through the movie, and I knew this film isn't about life, but instead it is about a man who was in many ways different yet similar to rest of human beings. The film could so easily be about a regular human being who ages just normally, because the reverse aging concept isn't blown enough to take centre stage in the whole film. What Fincher has ultimately told in this movie is that offers us similar joy and similar pain, even if we were living it in different ways.All said and done, the movies is a beautiful painting. Exquisite camera-work, art direction, and spellbinding special effects on the older Benjamin are huge high points for the film. But what lets it down is the film's stale narrative structure, elaboration of many unnecessary scenes or events, at many points I simply don't get what message the film is trying to send out. Because, all the time, the film pretends like it has something important to say- while it doesn't have anything such.The film's aesthetic features reminds me of both Forest Gump and American Beauty, but there seems to be a middling hand and you end up getting a slightly mish-mashed film. Despite the film's slow pace, some scenes that should have been elaborated more are instead put on an expressway train, it seems like the makers have conveniently skipped doing any scenes that could have a real pang in your heart. Very few scenes make you feel really sad, and even those aren't helped by some very silent, non-reactive acting by Brad Pitt (don't mistake me, he was brilliant in this film I think, but this is more the director's fault) or I should say the characterization. Not one scene of crying in the whole film and they made Benjamin look like young monk who knows what it is like to lose your loved ones and is used to it. The character transformation is almost non-existent.Cate Blanchett is beautiful and adequate but as said Fincher and the team's monologue-like approach in a film where there is hardly any much dialogue doesn't help any actors show off their prowess. Tilda Swinton's character seemed to have no bearing on the story and was added just for the sake of it.But, at the end of the day, it is a beautiful film externally but it just lacks more soul that it could have had. I couldn't hate this film, because I enjoyed it, but I couldn't love it either, because this should have been much much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is like a box of buttons, and this film is too like "Gump"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The odd premise is well-realized, technically, and the film's acting and production values are fairly flawless. But in its loosely episodic narrative with its patina of well-polished, folky wisdom, it reminded both of us independently of "Forrest Gump"?and that was before we found out it was written by the same guy. Tell you what: You want to watch Brad Pitt age backwards? Go rent "Thelma and Louise" and "Kalifornia." Otherwise, watching Kate Winslet in "The Reader" aging in the forward direction?though largely without accumulating much wisdom in the process?is much more satisfying. The casting, actually, was also good, putting Pitt and Blanchett together again as in "Crash." Enjoyed seeing Jared Harris in a more manly role than the sympathetic supporting one in "Igby Goes Down." It may be from the Fitzgerald story, but why does the main black female character have to be named "Queenie"? How about "Mildred," if you have to be period-accurate? Finally, the initial support for the premise, the human losses of the Great War--World War I--ought perhaps to have had its tragedy better woven into the subsequent narrative of a life lived backward, paralleling the idea of the clock that ran backward in honor of those tragic losses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not on the button science-wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brad Pitt is good, Cate Blanchett excellent, and the production values lush. Despite half a dozen people playing the main character (a la Dylan) things fit together quite well. The atmosphere reminded me of Forrest Gump (with whom it shared a scriptwriter) ? a cornball "well, isn't that just life" sort of movie. Well, I don't mind southern corn (I lived and worked in New Orleans, where this film is mainly set, for a term a few years ago) and it tells a cute love story, but the central conceit, a person living backwards through time, is just plain ridiculous. "Time like a mighty stream bears all its sons away" ? in one direction. Anyone going in another direction would be another dimension ? we could not see them and they could not see us. Of course literature need not obey the laws of physics but "suspension of disbelief" is more difficult when physics is regarded as irrelevant. This is not so much science fiction as unscientific fiction.One curious aspect is the portrayal of African Americans in the story. It is as if the racism of the Deep South never existed, which I suppose fits in with the 'fairy tale' plot. Benjamin is brought up by the enormously sympathetic black proprietress of a genteel old people's home populated as far as I could see entirely by whites. Another odd thing is that one-one except Kate seems to notice that Ben is getting younger all the time. One might have thought his case would have aroused a certain amount of scientific interest. He also seems to be the only case, which is also odd.This is an entertaining enough movie, diverting at times though a bit long at two and a half hours. But I'd only give it an Oscar for the make-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curious case of intense boredom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I haven't put a review up here for quite some time and I won't even really bother here or with any other movie since this website is now so obviously been overwhelmed by dime a dozen bloggers on studio payrolls. I had noticed it before but just read the first three reviews here and besides the fact that they're almost identical reviews, they're so over the top obsequious that its beyond the point where IMDb can no longer avoid commenting on it.Magical? Best performances of the year? BS. Without going into any detail just know that any friend or talk show host or newspaper reviewer you've heard say 'the film is boring' is absolutely correct. Its a 2 hr and 45 minute movie that feels like its 5 hours. You just want the thing to end or the old woman to just croak early in her deathbed at the hospital. The voice-over narration makes the boredom that much more grating. If I wanted the audio book I would have bought it - ACT Brad and Cate, don't TELL me the damn movie as I'm watching it. Give us a taste of voice-over to settle us into the movie, don't beat is into submission with it for three hours.This concept was based on a short story and the writer didn't add anything to it to make it worthy of a three hour movie! I can't lay all the blame on the writer. He didn't green light this picture and it wasn't a spec script. Obviously the producers, Brad being one of them, became enamoured of the idea and rammed the thing thru rewrites thinking that seeing Brad in incredible makeup using his best, scratchy nostalgic voice would trick people into thinking they're seeing a great movie. Sorry Brad, didn't work in The Assassination of Jesse James and it didn't work here. Do yourself a favour and work with a director who's making a movie from an original script and let him mould you into his vision - don't force a vision on someone else.This film is weak and uninspired. The only reason it got a nomination for best picture is because the Academy feels obligated to nominate at least one huge budget, huge actor movie or even less people would watch their crummy awards show again this year.Stay away from this one, rent it one night when you're having trouble sleeping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weak cocktail between Forest Gump, English Patient and The Notebook...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try to give my review of this film and apologised in advance for my English but I will try best.When a short story is put in on the big screen and it last for almost 3 hours better you make a good entertaining piece of film... If it's a runner for 11 awards of the academy you expect to watch a piece of art cause potentially it could win all of them. Well I just see one Oscar coming and it's a make-up or special effects. Apart from that nothing but a fairy tale with flaws if we take the movie seriously.I won't named all of them. You can read it in other reviews and I don't want to be that critic. Just say that beside the story (a baby born old and getting younger with years) there's nothing new. Even more is a cocktail between Forest Gump, the English patient and Notebook all blended together and adding a lot of water. As a results you got a weak cocktail nothing remarkable, not to be the cocktail of the year at least.The plot focused mainly in two aspects; Benjamin Button getting younger which is probably the most attractive point in the movie and a weak and impossible love story due to his condition. Well, all the where abouts of his re-born life is not as good as in Forest Gump (speaking from a tale point of view) but as the movie can't deliver an appropriate drama feeling there's no other way to watch it. The drama fails as well in the love story. You care a bit but is predictable and you can recognised a lot of scenarios from previous films. All the story love comes from a diary, the be loved woman dying in bed and remembering her past and so on.Performances are OK and the truth is I was entertained for almost 3 hours even when some times is slow or you could have cut a few minutes or define better the plot, either just a tale story or drama love story but not in half way of both. Or you could make characters in more depth. Despite of all is a watchable movie just not expect the movie of the year. See it with an open mind and ready to enjoy and it will make its work. Do some popcorn too!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex movie that requires some attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is quite a disappointment for me. I expected a marvelous masterpiece that will easily settle in my top-10 films ever. Well, that's not the case here.Oh, before I start, I better explicitly warn you that I have myriad spoilers here, about specific scenes and ending. Beware...First of all, the film is not coherent with its vision and message. Some aspects of it say "No matter what life throws at you - you can still do what you want and be what you really are." It's supported with Benjamin struggling to be an ordinary person despite his unusual circumstances; with the old man's stories about the lightning strikes and his bottom line of "you know what, I'm just glad I'm alive;" with Benjamin's letter to his daughter; and with the finale of everyone being simply what they are - mothers, artists or dancers. But ultimately, this message has nothing to do with the actual case of Benjamin. For the matter, he could've been simply ill, or handicapped, or just weak-minded (someone said Forrest?) and that message would've still been conveyed. The film doesn't really deal with the complexity of aging. Motives such as "nothing lasts" and the clock-running-backwards try to deal with this issue, but without really saying anything meaningful. That's why the film is incoherent - it has a statement about our ability to live our lives despite its obstacles, and at the same time it's clumsy with attempts to say something about aging. This incoherence is the fault of Eric Roth, the screenwriter, to my opinion.Fincher is not as brilliant as I expected either. For one thing, he couldn't make Brad Pit deliver a breathtaking performance. It's true that Benjamin is a pithy character, yet actors can create deep, round characters with their body language and the look in their eyes (take Gene Hackman in The Conversation as an example). Unfortunately, Benjamin is not such a character. Can someone tell how weird and startling it must be to live as someone who ages backwards? I can't, and Pit's performance doesn't help a bit in that matter. Moreover, to my opinion Fincher was off-guard in some scenes. For example, the collage of the couple being deeply in love - with cuts of them sailing a boat, then their heads popping out of a lake, and eventually them sitting on a paradise-like beach. Give me a break... Fincher also disappoints when it comes to minimalistic scenes that focus on the relationship between people. The scene of Benjamin leaving the house should've been horrible to watch! For crying out loud, the husband and father of this family is about to leave his whole life behind! Pit plays it as if he has just finished a flirt with some girl and has to hurry outside before she catches him. Cate Blanchett somehow manages to save this scene (she's terrific throughout the film, by the way). And, most importantly, she'd doing it using nothing but body language and face expressions, which show how much better she is in acting than Pit. I think Fincher could've used a deeper score in the scene, focus more on Benjamin's face, make the camera close in on him slowly to catch his inner conflict and huge sacrifice, and make Pit open up and show some more emotion. Pit's demeanor is rather emotionless in this scene, as well as in other allegedly strong scenes like the discovery of his father, the death of his mother and Daisy's dismissal of him after her injury. The only scene where Pit gives a strong performance is when Benjamin pays a visit to NY, only to find out that Daisy has a life of her own and that he's not in it.An interesting thing about this film, which scores a point for Eric Roth and Fincher, is that it seems to grow old as it goes along, just like the characters in it. At first we get a magical story, just as everything seems magical when you're young. The shots are quick, the camera is dynamic, the music is a magnificent New Orleans Jazz. There are many characters and they all seem special in some way. At the beginning, every aspect of the film behaves like a child discovering the world (not surprisingly, Pit doesn't play Benjamin in most of the beginning). At the end, things are different. Suddenly the music is more tragic, shots are longer, camera is still, and there are no more new characters. Only Benjamin and Daisy remain, like an old couple that has nothing but each other. When I first saw the film, I thought Fincher was simply loosing it towards the end, because the film didn't quite carry me away. But after watching it the second time, I figured out it was planned. I think Roth and Fincher wanted us not to be carried away, just like life and aging don't carry us away but rather slow down and then just... well, end. The film even says it: "Sometimes you just have to let go." That's why I wrote in my title that this film is a bit complex and demands some digestion.So, to sum up - the screenplay is pretty interesting and complex, but fails to come up with a strong, evident message. Fincher manages to create some magical moments, especially at the beginning, but at other times (especially at intimate, inner, emotional moments) he's under his usual level. Pit is a miscast (like watching Forrest Gump without Tom Hanks) and the acting level is redeemed by Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson. The score and filming are beautiful (like the sunset and submarine scenes). I think this production could've done much more than it actually has done, but it's still a good, stimulating film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really got it going for me... From the first minute I was captivated by the unconventional plot and story, haven't seen such a different start for a long time. The story development was surprising, I was really caught with the movie, and lived and breathed with it while watching it. The first tears, emotions of love, joy, past memories came fast, as I have seen that being different means going the harder way, walking through the rockier path......Love is the moments, not the minutes........what do we all do for love, we even let ourselves be miserable so the other part of us could be loved and happier than she/he could be with us......Loved it so much, the end of the movie got to me, and I have cried for ten minutes at least. I strongly recommend the movie........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that you feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to seeing this film I had read the short story by F. Scott Fitgerald and felt it to be interesting, entertaining, and moving. What I found with the film itself was something more. When placing a 1-10 rating on this film I found myself debating between a 9 and a 10, but in the end could not find a defining flaw to drop the rating down that one point. This is easily one of the most rewarding films that I have seen in years, and I believe it stands out among others in what it attempts, and succeeds in achieving. Not only does this film entertain but it delivers a real and applicable message. While many films are made for their entertainment, this is a film that the viewer can truly feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benji Buttons is very Gumpish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a good reason this movie has a Gumpish feel to it...probably because Roth, the screenwriter was attached to both movies. Effects were used to drive the storyline instead of trying to overstimulate the viewers senses (this was contrary to a counterpoint thesis I wrote in film school about the negative implication movie magic effects would have on the eve on movies like Independence Day...I said it would destroy storyline, and from my experience, in most cases it did.....this is definitely an exception to that counterpoint) It had drama, humor, action (the submarine battle scene was sweet). Although clocking in just under 3 hours the story pushed the time along, and ironically... the movie's theme of time within a lifespan doesn't seem to drag. The love story is nice but it lost the one star for overdoing it. I think 10-15 mins lighter, the film would not have suffered in the story being told of his affection for this particular girl. There is a recurring story within the story regarding lightening which I will not divulge but is HILARIOUS. Overall, this was very entertaining. I am still on the fence as to what if so and so...played B. Buttons. Story was good enough to hold up to many A list actors but Brad made this character his.....and not to understate his abilities but I give the most credit to David Fincher...who clearly made a movie out of his element (Seven, Fight Club). Stylistically, this is way different to anything he has ever done in the past, and he (in my opinion) made a masterpiece</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious Indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw the trailer for this some months ago and,without knowing much more about this other than the fact that Brad Pitt was playing a man who was aging backward(that and the fact that the trailer curiously DIDN'T have a studio identification mark at the beginning of it),I found myself,ahem,intrigued. Curious,if you will.Months later,and with the critical and overall audience positive vibe,I decided I'd invest in this. An entertainment reporter on NBC,shortly before the Golden Globes,referred to this movie as a "Romantic film",but I think that description is a little more than a tad oversimplified. This is a grand,sci-fi/fantasy/adventure/romance/tall tale that only really suffers from its own ambition.The movie's plot is really not secret,so I'll instead reveal some differences from the Scott Rudin-Robin Swicord penned screenplay and the original F.Scott Fitzgerald short story: Benjamin(Pitt,as much a credit to this role as the brilliant make-up job done to show the progression,or rather de-progression,of time)is in the movie born at the end of World War I(November,1918),whereas in the story he is born a year before the American Civil War(1860); he is born to rich MAryland or Virginia natives in the story,whereas he is clearly a product of a mixed relationship marriage in New Orleans;and while the lady love of his life is a bright,talented dancer named Daisy(Cate Blanchett,ages beautifully,inside and out)in a clear allusion to the one of the more remembered works by the famous author,her name is something more like Hildegard. Those things,added to the exquisite detail and artistic embellishment of director David Fincher,make this movie is a vision. While I was,I must confess,somewhat put off by the romantic elements of the movie,I could basically take it in stride as being something that overall enriches Benjamin's life story.The nearly three hour running time of CCoBB may put off perspective viewers of this movie(among other things),but it shouldn't. The narrative is so rich and fluid that it only feels like a lot of time running once you disengage in watching. If this show puts one in mind of other "tall adventure" tales on the big screen like Forrest Gump or BIg Fish,that's no mistake:co-writer Rudin also penned Gump.A strong,if perhaps over-stuffed,offering to the large screen which is probably best viewed there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, touching and uplifting, an adventure in living life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button so I went in with little to no expectations. I just knew I wanted to see it. This film certainly won't be for everyone. First of all anyone expecting to see some sort of slick adventure or action or even a typical Brad Pitt vehicle will be disappointed. The film clocks in at nearly three hours and is very slow paced but the sheer intelligence of the film is mind blowing. It is such a beautiful piece of art that brings tears to your eyes making you contemplate life and death and everything about it. Maybe it just hit home for me I don't know but it was just a beautiful story. Essentially nothing of any major interest happens during the lengthy life story of Benjamin Button but the entire schtick to the story is that Button is aging backwards. He is born as an outcast, a crippled, shriveled old man who ironically is raised in a New Orleans Old Age Home. If anything you are held to the screen by sheer curiosity of watching this boy grow backwards. Hence what truly makes this a curious case. This film is a combination of a lot of different flavors YES it also includes a touch of Forrest Gump (also written by The Curious Case of Benjamin Button writer co-writer Eric Roth), Dickens' Great Expectations, with an F. Scott Fitzgerald flare (the author whose short story inspired the film.) Brad Pitt is a huge movie star but there is no doubt that he also has some really incredible acting ability proved earlier in his career with incredible roles in Se7en and 12 Monkeys. His performance as Benjamin is subtly brilliant. It doesn't really take your breath away but rather endears you to him over a course of time. The use of Pitt in the CGI scenes was disturbing and well done all at once. Cate Blanchett who I am NOT a fan of is actually decent as the love of Button's life Daisy. They don't exactly have outstanding chemistry but somehow they manage to pull it off. The supporting cast is terrific but they really pale to the performance by Pitt. Julia Ormond does a good job in a small role but she has very intense aura about her. Jason Flemyng does a terrific job as Button's father and Taraji P. Henson is brilliant as Pitt's adopted mother who runs an old age home.I'm actually very impressed that director David Fincher pulled this film off. It is a very ambitious film and although it certainly isn't for everyone Fincher pulls off this fantasy epic very well. fincher's past is critically acclaimed and he has a lot of fans from Fight Club (a movie I didn't care for at all), and Zodiac which was ambitious but missing so much to it. He did however create the brilliance of Se7en and The Game so perhaps he does have some talent to speak of. If you are willing to watch an epic about a man and his entire life and really see the film for it's true message then you will truly enjoy this film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different movie from Fincher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is indeed, a very different screen experience, as many of us had been through a big popcorn year. Actually, this film deserved positive reviews. That's how good it is. First class director, first-class actors plus the beautiful cinematographic and music. Some movies are meant to be appreciated, and this is indeed one of those few.I'd like to share some thoughts I got from watching the film. For example, later stages of life can be hard, either being an old man or a baby, and it's always lucky to have someone with love around you. I don't watch this film to persuade people into its logic and fantasy. I hope that one can simply appreciate life more after watching this, just like me. Some other thoughts also came to my mind after watching it, that some beauty can't be derived from life, but can only be buried with love. That might be why Benjamin escaped his own parental responsibility. He just knew he'd have to die in a way nobody could take. He didn't even reach for Daisy's help when he's becoming incapable. There are more inspirations from a single viewing of the film. I can't imagine what I can get with more viewings.Talking about performance. I think Cate Blanchett just delivered again. Her change through the whole movie was so nature, comparing to Brad Bitt. She just didn't waste any single second on the screen. Seeing her dancing as well as seeing her cry at Benjamin were totally satisfying. On the other side, Brad Bitt's performance was more alike a statue, an eye candy for the audiences. This is not saying that Brad didn't deliver, but he was constantly covered by Blanchett.David Fincher had been directing dark films all these years, many of which being my favorite. He apparently took a big step into the poetic filming, rather than making darker films. This might be a good sign for all of us. In the film, we saw human forgiving another human, a person reading another person's life, and so much more...9/10 It's straight-forwardly heartbreaking towards the end, but still a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides a few minor issues, Benjamin is gorgeously photographed and deliciously epic and moving story about life and death over the entire life span. A timely movie, Benjamin presents a behavioral peek at our contemporary aging issues of our society today from the perspective of the life of two senior citizens in flashback. There is an amazing use of light and dark in this movie, much more so than most movies, especially silhouettes. Even at the beginning the replication of the simulated colorized old movie scenes heightened the effect of flashbacks within flashbacks. One noticeable oversight included tea without milk scene and the other noticeable weakness is Benjamin as an old youth, whose behavior didn't seem to exude the usual characteristics of being young in an old body. However, the overall movie flowed with powerful subplots with poignant short stories of Benjamin's life and the people who come in and out his life. This lengthy, extended movie was able to encompass a lifetime with interesting and compelling stories, a Lost in Translation (2003) format expanded into a lifetime of experiences. Never overly dramatic - but resonating with real life experience-like events, Benjamin as a youngster falling looking out the front door to a fart from an old man. Nine out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not long finished watching this film and am still in awe. The film hit me hard and i have not been left with this much feeling from a film in a very long time. Throughout the film there are several deep meanings and philosophies as Benjamin Button ages through life (albeit backwards), all of them very powerful and true. I was a little wary of the thought of the visuals in respect to Benjamin's appearance before the film, however, my worries were proved surplus. I don't think i could fault this film in any area, it is near perfection in my opinion. What are films for if not to make you feel something powerful, something deep, something happy yet sad...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some people are artists....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I always thought David Fincher was an artist, but, to be honest he kind of let me down with Panic Room, and the following Zodiac was not so much better. I was beginning to think he lost his touch. But then he comes to us with this movie, a true masterpiece of our time, a movie that keeps you on screen with it's characters, a story that follows the line of life with it's ups and downs, with it's joyful or sorrow times, sometimes as beautiful as the hummingbird flying far over the ocean, sometimes as dark as blood spilled in clean water. All this shown to us while the movie gets more colored every minute, starting from almost black and white, like a very old cop movie, and finishing in a 21st century perfect edited shots. I was amazed to see this so well put to the screen, especially the way this film shows it. That being backwards. Of course Fincher is not the only artist to deserve praising for this jewel. Eric Roth and Robin Swicord did it with the script. The music is very well placed and sometimes so subtle that when it isn't there anymore you don't even realize it. You just wait, not knowing what for, until it comes back. The cast is perfect. Pitt and Blanchett gave excellent performances. But not only the leading actors shine here. I especially liked Jared Harris (captain Mike) and Tilda Swinton. They manage to steal every scene they're in. Although I see it somewhere between Forrest Gump and The Journal, this movie manages to surpass them both, and I think it deserves the first 10/10 from me this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely moving and powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a sprawling, epic feel, wonderful acting, and makeup and digital FX work beyond Oscar-winning, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an instant classic, a movie that doesn't just want to entertain. It makes you think about life, about all the mistakes you've made, about how short the whole ordeal really is. The movie is so effective and powerful with such a subtle delivery of its message that it's hard not to tear up just a little bit. The movie has two of the best performances I've ever seen on screen with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett both being at their very best. Button is based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and is directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac).Throughout the passage of time in the movie, if you know anything about it, Benjamin keeps getting younger and younger, and basically starts out as a baby who has the looks of an older man. This is where the movie works its magic. Just seeing Brad Pitt reappear as his 20 year-old self, the movie works on so many levels. The constant metaphors with the clocks, the present-day storytelling, the narration... it all just flows together so rhythmically into a film with no flaws. This isn't just the best movie of the year, it's one which transcends time and makes for a moving and powerful piece of film-making gold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not so curious after this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me tell all of you the major problems I had with this movie that could have made it a much better film and much more entertaining. Well first of all this side story was a huge problem I had with this film. There was no character building with their daughter Caroline so what was the point of her even being in the film? Secondly there needed to be more cinematography. I mean he sent postcards from all these different places, cruised the sea on his boat, and the best thing we see throughout the whole movie is a sunset? Come on now I want to be amazed. Thirdly I was just flat out disappointed with the story. Benjamin's life was not that astonishing. Truthfully it was quite boring. He didn't do anything that made me want to get into the movie. He spent most of his days in hotels or at an old person home. So these were all things that made me very irritated in the movie. Although these things annoyed me and could have made the movie better there were some good factors in the movie as well. Such as the acting. Brad Pitt I thought did an excellent job as Benjamin Button as well as Cate Blanchett as Daisy. The main reason I am giving this movie such a high rating was probably the best aspect of the film: the makeup. This is what truly amazed me was at how old they made Pitt look and then the best part was how young they made him look. It was astonishing. Well heres my review. Agree or Disagree it doesn't matter this is my opinion and I hope I gave you an idea of this movie. My suggestion: Wait for the DVD. Also this is definitely not the best picture of the year and will not win best picture, there are definitely better movies such as The Dark Knight(which wont win best picture either but I wish it could) and Wall-E.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Button is a hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I first saw the trailer for this film, I have been looking forward to its release. I thought it looked like a beautiful love story, but more than that, an exploration into one man's life. It would be a story about a man who faces insurmountable challenges from the get go, but still has a full life. Boy, was I right. But I had my doubts that would be right.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is based on a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The short story and movie couldn't be more different. Many people say the book is always better. Here is a case where that is not true. The short story is typical Fitzgerald. The family is dysfunctional. The content is dark, dark, dark. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. In the short story, Benjamin is born, lives, and dies. Everything goes very quickly. His wife is mentioned in one paragraph. You can read the whole thing yourself online. I found the short story depressing. Benjamin is not a particularly likable character. After his wife gets old, he grows bored of her and goes off to have adventure. He is rejected his whole life except for one period where he is a successful football star. Lucky for the screenwriters, the movie goes in a different direction. Don't get me wrong, the short story is well written and will make you think. But I like stories with some hope. The short story doesn't have it.The movie, on the other hand, is a tale of a man who by all accounts should have died. His mother dies giving birth to him. His father considers him a curse and slips into the night to get rid of him as quickly as possible. By some miraculous touch, he lives. He is born an old man and finds himself getting younger as time passes. He has many physical problems. The first 20 so years of his life are spent in a "home" for invalids and people with disabilities: the rejects of society. He is taken in by the kind young Queenie, who becomes Button's adopted Momma.The plot takes many twists and turns that would go on longer than a review should. Suffice it to say that Benjamin visits many places, meets many interesting people, and his ailment does nothing to stop him. The film that is most similar would be Forrest Gump, so I wasn't at all surprised when I learned that Eric Roth, one of the co-writers of the screenplay for Benjamin Button, also wrote the Forrest Gump screenplay.The main relationship of note is his lifelong friendship and then romance and then something even more with the red-headed Daisy. Benjamin and her connect instantly when he is old and she is young because they are both old souls. They like the same stories and dream of adventure. Their love is tragic, however, because of the aging problems. Can you carry on a romantic relationship when the man appears to be in his 20s and the woman in her 40s? Sure, but what about when the man turns into a teenager and even younger? If you don't like long drawn-out emotional romances, don't let this scare you away. Much of the content is odd enough to balance out the melodrama. In one scene, Queenie takes Benjamin to a tent revival. The preacher gets his lungs going and the praying gets going and in the excitement of it all, Benjamin stands up and begins to walk for the first time. It is a miracle, and then the sweaty preacher drops dead. Scenes like this keep the melodrama from taking over the story.Although the movie is about 3 hours long, it didn't drag for me. I was immersed enough that I didn't want it to end. Brad Pitt does an exceptional job as Benjamin Button. He plays Button as a man who knows something is wrong with him on the inside, but ignores it on the outside. It is difficult to convey internal tension without speaking it aloud, and this makes Pitt a great actor. I have always believed Brad Pitt is an awesome actor because of two movies: Interview with a Vampire and Twelve Monkeys. You can add Benjamin Button to his most successful roles. It is important to note that many actors play Benjamin Button, and all do a wonderful job, but the movie belongs to Brad Pitt.Cate Blanchett is not quite there for me. She plays Daisy like a superficial artist type in her 20s. I know they were trying to show that as a young woman, Daisy would be more superficial than later in life, but the character wasn't believable until she was in her 30s, and she and Benjamin are supposed to be about the same age. It felt forced to me when she was the star dancer. Once she is in her 30s, she does a fine job as a middle-aged and older woman. I'm not sure what could have made it better, but she just came across as snobby, which wasn't believable for an old soul like Daisy.But go see Benjamin Button, it is a great flick and will most likely be tagged for many Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to New Orleans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually went to see this film, not knowing that it was set in New Orleans. I knew only that it had gotten a negative review from Roger Ebert, a critic I respect. It sounded like basically a vanity project for Brad Pitt.Yes, indeed, there is very much pride evident here, but it is pride in New Orleans rather than an overinflated ego. This is a love letter to New Orleans. I don't know of any other film which makes any better use of the city--it was even used for scenes set in Russia, Paris and New York. And it was also a period piece. I think the most remarkable fact about a nearly three hour film set in New Orleans is that there is not a single reference to Mardi Gras. Beyond this, the city and its history play an integral part of the story, rather than simply serving as a quaint backdrop.I don't know of any accent that was misplaced. The production design and art direction were stunning.With respect to the plot, the premise of a man being born old and growing younger would have served for the backdrop for a science fiction film. Or worse yet, a comedy. But the film makers here do not try to explore or explain Benjamin's condition. I think that the most uniquely New Orleans touch is that no character actually treats Benjamin like a freak.If you must have an explanation, you will probably not like this film. The film makers tell you this with the opening story about the clock. In the real world, that situation would not be allowed to continue--not even in New Orleans.The film avoids most of the major historical incidents and developments--those which are not needed for the story. For example, the racial segregation in New Orleans is simply ignored, since it would cause problems with the story. And I am not totally sure about the historical accuracy of the tugboat in WW2. But historical accuracy is not the point.Even the final image is true only in a general sense, but not literally.The acting was excellent. Brad was miscast and wasted in "Burn After Reading," but here he scores a major triumph. And Cate Blanchett may be in line for yet another Oscar. I have not seen all of 2008's films yet, but this is my favorite so far.A line of dialogue, when Tilda Swinton asks Brad where he's from:Brad-- New Orleans. (pause) Louisiana.Tilda-- Is there more than one?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night after seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I was left with sadness and unhappy with Brad Pitt's performance.The story is very simple it's about a guy's life being shown in reverse. This movie is very entertaining and sometimes enjoyable. Brad Pitt is the best choice to play the main character however, sometimes while watching it Brad Pitt is just staring at the other characters and seems like he forgot his lines or pages from the script is missing. I was looking forward to a performance as enjoyable as Tom Hank's performance in "Forrest Gump".The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best films of the year but, I don't think Brad's performance is Oscar worthy. Most likely this movie will still be around after Oscar nominations are announced.If your looking for good movie to see while Oscar buzz is going on I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

The line from the movie about why people die was great. It was that the reason people die is so that we realize how much we love them. I never thought like that before. This movie was very thought provoking and a very intense tear jerker. I t had great comic relief though to make up for how sad it was. Brad Pitt's performance, and in fact the whole cast's performance was amazing. This movie was truly epic and will never be able to be topped for original content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having a great movie story for a movie is only a beginning also it is a very risky to have a great story.Because Great stories always has a huge complication,So generally When a director takes a great story director either ruins movie or makes it a masterpiece,there is no other option for a great movie story.We also saw many examples of great stories disgusting movies,but seeing a masterpiece from a great story is generally an unusual and rare situation.If you have your great story you should also have a great script from it and also perfect casting and acting.If one of them leaks then movie becomes a trash. When we looked T.C.O.B.B.I don't say this to flatter anyone,but movie is the one which makes a masterpiece from this great story.Firstly:Story is obviously amazing and spectacular.So first level is passed.In way script i can say that this script at least should be nominated for best adapted screenplay Academy Award.All words are chosen carefully and wisely.There's no sentence which is useless and meaningless.Every word deserves its place and fits exactly.I can say this because i also examined screenplay.About acting I can say that best performances given by Pitt is taken by the direction of Fincher(I even don't mention about great directing of Fincher)and in this movie Fincher isn't disappointing us and making Pitt acting greatly.Pitt by his physical appearance is appropriate for this role.Blanchett is also perfect and unforgettable.She gives perfect performance in this role and doesn't disappoint us.Another thing i surely want to mention is make-up which should be awarded.Yes,make-up should not only nominate but also win Academy Award for make-up.Because When you watch it,it' almost impossible not to admire make-up. Finally,I should mention about film editing.Also in a movie like this one:Editing is the certain key because if there had been any editing problem film would have ruined and film editing is also perfect. T.C.O.B.B. is surely best movie of the year and if you watch it i can assure you that you will not forget it for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding as it is beautiful. Modern day epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing movie that overloads all your senses, caresses your heart and lets it swim in your drained emotions. David Fincher is superb directing this tale set in the early 20th century and taking much influence from a character in an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt)is born under the very unusual circumstances as a man in his mid-80's. With his mother dying during his birth, Benjamin's father(Jason Fleming)abandons him on the doorstep of an old-folks home, where the overly-kind black caretaker Queenie(Taraji P. Henson)takes the odd-looking babe to raise as her own. The story of Benjamin's life in reverse is revealed in his dairy, read by Caroline(Julia Ormand), the daughter of his life-long love Daisy(Cate Blanchett), who is dying in a New Orleans hospital as hurricane Katrina rages upon the city. We go through the odd, but interesting twists and turns of Benjamin's life. We relish in the beauty and endure the tragedy of circumstances extraordinary and merely common as Benjamin grows younger in appearance and age. Sensational cinematography and beautiful scenes abound. My favorite scene has Benjamin as a 'tugboat man' with Captain Mike(Jared Harris)riding out a snow storm. Special effects throughout are awesome. If it is possible to fall in love with a movie...this is the one.</fullReview>

Benjamin Button had such a unique condition which could have been exploited more however, the directer chose to stick with the love story, which by the way unwinds majestically, and in my opinion had there been more meat on the bones, besides the love story, then this film would have easily got 10 out of 10.Magical film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cate Blanchett is astounding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the life of a man who is born old, and gets younger as he ages."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a refreshing film. The interesting plot captivates viewers, despite the abundance of melancholy. It tells how Benjamin enters the prime of his life while everyone around him die off. It tells a tale of enduring love that cannot come to fruition. It tells how dreams are shattered just because a series of coincidences string together to create calamity. Cate Blanchett is amazing in her role as Daisy. She is graceful and regal as ever, and yet amidst her astounding elegance she portrays all of Daisy's emotions fully. I particularly find Cate Blanchett's performance at the end of the film moving. The melancholy in her eyes as she looks at the young Benjamin is piercing and affecting."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" stands out from the crowd because it lacks car crashes, road chases, tropical beaches and brutal fights that define many contemporary blockbusters. It may not do well in the box office earnings, but it will be remembered for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astonishing echo with WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS' "When You Are Old"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was breathless at the second half of the movie when the painful departure among the characters reminded me of the poem I have long recited "When You Are Old When you are old and gray and full of sleepAnd nodding by the fire,take down this book,And slowly read,and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once,and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true;But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur,a little sadly,how love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overhead,And hid his face amid a crowd of stars." I was also amazed by the cinematography and special effects of some scenes. Overall, although the first half of the movie was a little bit slow, I still give it a 10. This time, I cried again, struck by the fact that love, persistence, forgiveness, tolerance and so many human emotions transcend time and space.When I was out of the movie theater, life again was beautiful thanks to this inspirational movie. I guess that is why I am in love with movies for so many years and the love continues to grow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to describe this movie coherently. There are so many things to say, yet so many things that should be left unsaid. For anyone wanting to see this movie, let me reassure you: you will not be disappointed. In fact, your expectations will be met and exceeded. I will only say this: to me, It is more than a movie, It is a life experience. I have never seen any movie like this before. It is beautiful in every sense of the word. There is so much to be learned by watching this film, so much to, in a strange away, experience. It really is breathtaking. David Fincher has definitely outdone himself, something I, at first, didn't think possible. A final word to the wise: Do not attempt to take from this movie more than what it gives, lest you ruin this wondrous experience, for yourself and others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cruel Contradiction of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The phrase "Happy New Year" has been thrown around constantly by everybody as a matter of common courtesy, greeting, and parlance, seemingly devoid of sincerity and significance. What does it mean to embrace a new year and to be happy? In fact, when was the last time you ever brood over about the meaning of your existence and about your life in general? I did - just the day before 2009, I managed to watch the new Christmas movie "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" (starring Brad Pitt) without lending much ideas about what the film symbolizes and how it's going to turn out. To my admiration, the film, whilst very well-made on its own, has cast a new light about my attitude towards life.Directed by David Fincher, one of my favourite directors, whose filmography includes contemporary classics such as Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac, "Benjamin Button" could most readily be summed up in 2 words: movie magic. The film tells a poignant tale about a man born miraculously of a defect with causes him to age backwards in time (somewhat alluding much to Christ's birth). Although the crux of the story sounds ludicrous and bizarre in nature, it is in fact a mere plot device to explore a gamut of universal issues from love, morality, to life &amp; death.Highlights of the film would be its star-studded cast (Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton), its brilliant, still-cam cinematography, a fitting orchestral soundtrack, and the amazing special effects (think middle-aged Pitt transforming to a pygmy 80-year old to being a 20-year old heartthrob again). The only downside to many however, might be its near 3-hour runtime. Most moviegoers (including me) might simply be looking for thrills &amp; action-packed plot lines common in Hollywood blockbusters these days, but frankly I didn't mind the slow-moving nature of the film, it serves an essential purpose to evince the drudgingly long and painful chronology of a man's life. In fact, it is almost a mirror of life, as the adage goes, "art imitates life", and in this case, "Benjamin Button" is one such film which truly deserves such title. Through viewing the (albeit fictional) life of Benjamin, we are reminded of the plentiful contradictions of living : life is at once ugly and beautiful, we live and then we die, et cetera. There are memorable moments in life and there are plenty of those we would like to forget - life is lovely, but it is cruel at the same time.In short, the film is all but an apt analogy about the universal mystery we call "life", it is a film that, after watching it, you'll grasp the subtle beauties of humanity, and appreciate the nuances of life. Rarely has a film captivated me on so many levels - it has both enthralled and left me embittered and downtrodden towards the end, taking a huge toll on my emotions! (I was literally in tears as the credits rolled) It is perhaps one of the most touching film of the century and movie-making at its finest. If I hadn't been so moved by it I wouldn't be motivated to extol the film and write an afterthought. My rating for "Benjamin Button": 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Way To End 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button which was originally a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald was a wonderful way to end 2008. This movie was masterful and heartwarming from beginning to end. The acting, movie pacing, scene transitioning, even the lighting was brilliant to say the least. Through the protagonist Benjamin(Brad Pitt) You couldn't help but feel a connection to the characters he encounters throughout the movie as you the audience live vicariously through him and his actions. This connection musters many emotions within the viewer as you cry, laugh and feel every trail and tribulation Benjamin experiences. On that note I must warn you, this is not your typical clear cut love-drama movie. The story is so unique, it's a once in a lifetime cinematic experience. To fully appreciate this instant classic in its fullness do yourself the favor and go see this movie while it's still in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wonder what time truly is? Has humanity understand the time concept well, or we are just waiting for clocks to decide our ending? The tag-line for this movie is absolutely perfect, the time is not measured in words, but in moments. You might say that aging backwards is a cheesy and interesting science fiction story. I'm sure many of you watched the movie or planning to watch it just because you are attracted by this concept of aging backwards and this is something new and interesting. But I am encouraging you to watch it because you can learn something from it. You will learn how to enjoy every single moment of your life, because nothing lasts for ever. Of course, nothing new, where is the message? Who doesn't know that? We sure do know that, but are we doing something about it? Many of us live our life thinking about tomorrow, unfortunately our life is based on time, on that clock which always ticks. We should stop misunderstand time, we have to start living our life and our time on earth in moments, not in minutes.This movie is learning us how do that, especially through love. The romantic story from this movie is far from being a great one or one to remember, but it's a simple one, with up and downs like in every relationship, and the simplicity is the beauty of it. Love will always remain the most important feeling in our life, even if it's a story to tell or a simple one, we as humans can't live without love. Apart from love, the movie is teaching us how to capture the important moments in our life, by visiting other places, by surviving some disasters, by knowing other people and so on. This movie is not a masterpiece, but by its simplicity and your imagination it sure brings the beauty of life on the front page. A life that is the most important thing we have.Definitely a movie to watch!</fullReview>

After Se7en and FightClub, David Fincher and Brad Pitt finally achieve perfection together, and what a way to do so. "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" is beyond anything you could possibly imagine. It tells the story of a simple and quiet man who's aging process comes backwards and how during that time he learned how to appreciate every aspect of life especially love. This films reminds you that nothing lasts forever and that you should never regret, but instead, live and feel as if every moment is your last...Fincher's amazing attention to detail shows again and works in such way...!Beautiful scenarios and amazing past time recreation!

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece; A Touching Metaphor Of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Benjamin Button is a "curious" film. Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club,Panic Room, Zodiac) it's a much different film from his regular suspense thrillers. It could be called epic. It could be called a fantasy film. I think above all, it's a film that presents life from a different point of view than we've ever see.Benjamin Button is born at the close of the first wold war. After a tragic event involving his mother, his father immediately leaves him on the doorstep of an elderly home. He is immediately taken in by Queenie a kind, outspoken African-American. Throughout the rest of the film he has many hilarious and life altering experiences. None, however, are as important as the friendship he strikes up with Daisy, the granddaughter of one of the elderly. She immediately sees him not as strange but odd and peculiar. Many events transpire and throughout the film we constantly come back to their relationship which eventually transforms into a romance.Button is one of, if not the, best film I've seen all year. David Fincher, working with a great script, does some top notch directing. The cinematography also makes the film something special. What also sets it above others are the remarkable special effects. The aging affects are particularly breathtaking.Now, with all the praise on the technical side, there is plenty for the acting. Taraji P. Henson is excellent as Queenie. she's sassy and a perfect mother to the unusual Benjamin. Cate Blanchett is, once again, absolutely stunning. She commands the camera in her scenes. Her acting is brilliant and deserves an Oscar nomination, however, enough cannot be said of the man that carries the weight of the film, Brad Pitt. He is perfection as the quite, observer that is Benjamin Button. Despite the fact that he is very quiet throughout the film, he plays it so well.Benjamin Button is a rare masterpiece. It has many themes about life and death. No matter how life starts or ends, you make who you are and it's about the things and events that matter to you that make your life special 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad way to frame a film -- at the bedside of an elderly woman who's dying and on morphine drip. There's a scene where Benjamin is working on a tug boat, and the boat lets go a blast of its horn which sounds like a fart. Cut to the bedside, and the daughter asks her mother: "Did you say something, Mom?" Not the best editing I've seen this year. The tinkly music that cushioned every scene was unbearable. After an hour of this stuff I walked. Just the prospect of, what?, an hour and a half more of Brad Pitt left to come was just too bleak. This is one of the "best films of 2008". Oh well, I know it's been a terrible year for films, so that's no surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should have been so much better. It should have been the best film of the year. It should have been the best movie of the decade. It should have been a lot of things. Considering all the rave reviews, the fact that it vaulted into the IMDb Top 100 in record time, and of course the incredible trailer, it led me to believe this was going to be another brilliant David Fincher movie. The man has had an almost flawless career, with Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac among others. But Mr. Fincher greatly disappointed me with this film.First of all, there is so much CGI in this movie, you never know when you're watching Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett or just a computerized version of someone else with just their heads superimposed on the bodies. The CGI affected the cinematography as well, because some of it was beautiful, but its like looking at a fake Picasso painting. It still looks nice, but you know its just not the real thing. Cate is lovely as always, and Mr. Pitt gives a good performance considering the circumstances of the character and plot. In the end, its nothing more than an interesting story done the wrong way. If you want to see it done the right way, watch or re-watch Forrest Gump. Other than Eric Roth being the writer on both films, they share almost identical structures and story lines, except that Gump was a clever and funny tale, while Button is sad and utterly depressing.I was expecting so much, and barely got anything at all. Its a complex, deeply layered and epic tale, and it'll probably win 7 or 8 Oscars. Not that I think it deserves 7 or 8 Oscars, but it will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical, breathtaking, and wondrous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly one of the best films of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a visual feast that feeds the eyes as well as a marvelous and touching story that reaches the soul. Directed by David Fincher, the man responsible for dark dramas such as Fight Club and Zodiac, nearly every scene perfectly captures the moments it is set in. This is crucial in a story that starts out in 1918 and goes to the 21st century. Every decade is meticulously crafted and created. The 20s, 30s, 40s all seem so real and sweep you up in its charm.Needless to say, this would be for nothing if not for some great acting, and here we have two of the finest actors in work today. Brad Pitt plays Benjamin nearly at all parts of his life, and yet we always can feel him there despite being covered in makeup and CGI effects. Towards the middle when he looks as he does in real time, there was only one thought going through my mind as I watched him on screen: This man is a movie star. He has the looks, the body, the charisma and the smarts to bring people along with him and convince us at every turn that he is this character. He should almost definitely be nominated for an Oscar and it shouldn't be a huge surprise if he wins; he certainly deserves it. By no means any less a star but more of an actress, Cate Blanchett also deserves serious buzz as Daisy, a beautiful dancer who captures Benjamin's heart and joins him on this unusual journey. Taraji P. Henson also is spectacular as Queenie, the woman who nurtures and cares for Benjamin and loves him perhaps more than anyone else.All in all, this is a well-told story that I believe a lot of people will reckon with and recognize as a sincere work and a true example of the magic and potential of cinema. As mentioned before, the set designs and cinematography are staggering and Oscar-worthy as are the music, editing, direction, and of course the picture itself. I'm not sure if its the front-runner, but it will be in the thick of it come February. And why not? Such a breathtaking and terrific piece of entertainment and nostalgia that captures a series of moments in all parts of the world. They come together and make up one life; something so precious and important yet gone so soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this on pay per view for the first time.1) If I fall asleep during a movie, then it did not live up. I fell asleep several times during Benjamin Button and had to backtrack to review many parts.2) The dialogue was horrible, empty, barely audible in too many spots. Yes she was ill, but I could barely make out the mumbled dialogue of Daisy in the hospital bed talking to the daughter. Julia Ormond did a horrible job of portraying a concerned daughter as well as portraying a genuine New Orleans accent.3) There was absolutely no chemistry between Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Everything was forced and contrived to make it "work".4) The transitions from one scene to the next seemed to come out of nowhere. The movie did not flow well. For instance, I had no idea how him and the tugboat ended up in Russia of all places. And how did Tilda Swintons character end up in the same Russian location? 5) The only cool part of the film was the effects.6) The movie was way too long.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although negative, I will point out that the movie was well acted, and the very visually apealling.That being said, I must say I think it's a shame that people in this day and age feel fine about taking someone else's story, re-writing it, and making all the money off their "creation".This movie had very little to with F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Curious Case....".I won't go into detail, for spoilers and the like, but I think it's awful that people do that.This movie is NOT "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". This movie is "I'm going to write some story, put the name of someone else's story on it so it will sell." Final note, this is a work of re-writing for the sake of making money. Any artistic value in this movie is unintentional. Any similarities between this, and the actual story it is "based" upon is purely coincedental.Now, I'm off to film Grease. But, there won't be singing, or gangs, or cars, or set in the 50's. There will just be a hot chick named Sandra Dee. She'll show her boobs, and I'll make millions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for you Brad Pitt...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>3 hours later, the lesson of this movie is that Brad Pitt is still able to look like he's in high school (even though he's really in his 40's). That's not jealousy, i promise. I really enjoy Brad Pitt's movies (i.e. Fight Club, Troy, Burn After Reading, Snatch, etc), but what i want to iterate in this comment, is that they chose him for the role, because he's Brad Pitt.This is an original story, at least it's original to me. Although this movie does have it's good points, after 3+ hours, I just felt like it is an un-realized version of a possibly GREAT story. This is a mediocre fantasy movie. Good fantasy movies are able to ascertain credibility through the reactionary tendencies, chance encounters, and equally large/fantastic introductions of the "extras" and "supporting characters" in the story. It may just be my affinity for his work, but i feel like Guillermo Del Toro could have told this story better, in less time, with more substance (it's a 4 star movie if he does it, and it's in Spanish).This movie does pull at your heart strings a little bit. I felt like the scenes between the dying mother and daughter in the hospital were very well done, and obviously relevant to everything else in the movie. But i also felt a lack of any sort of chemistry between Brad Pitt and Ms. Blanchette.In summation, i didn't like the way Benjamin Button's condition was taken with a grain of salt by everyone in the movie. The reaction of the rest of the characters to him is what really makes or breaks the movie. Also; the movie was too long, with countless scenes contributing to the "not moving forward" factor which was never lost on me. And lastly, I think that it's too wrapped up in a not-so-genuine love plot between Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchette.4 out of 10 from me...</fullReview>

As the main character gets younger, you feel yourself getting older.I thought it might get interesting when Cate Blanchett's character was finally introduced but even her good acting couldn't save it for me.The only redeeming feature was the ending. If you can make it that far without dying of old age, that is. My suggestion? Go to the last 20 minutes of the movie and watch that.At least Forrest Gump had some interesting things going on around a very ordinary guy. Benjamin Button is just, plain, ordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For you wonderful people hopefully still enjoying my musings of questionable value but guaranteed real emotion and passion, you'll find a lot of elements discussed in this review, but I refuse to bash the movie on account of it's crazy enthusiastic optimism, so disaster tourists and pessimism-is-realism snobs can take the next exit out. In case you're wondering, I didn't write this review in a fever dream of ecstasy right after watching the film, I let it sink in for a week, and believe it or not I took a 300 word chunk out.You see, "Benjamin Button" is not a dialog-heavy movie, it is not a 4 hour soporific trial, but there are scenes so beautiful in it I almost can't stand it, I can write a thousand words about such a scene alone, this probably is what it must've felt like for American Beauty's eccentric voyeur to see the plastic bag dancing and twirling in the wind.Blanchett's Daisy and Pitt's Benjamin eventually do get together, even long before they "caught up with each other" age-wise. This junction leaves me with the fewest words to spill out, yet it's the best part of the movie, it's a challenging task to do any degree of justice to a love story worked out in detail on the screen. Daisy is the first girl to notice that Benjamin's a special boy. They share a moment under a blanket(no, not in that way) but soon enough life happens and Benjaming takes off on a tugboat and unwillingly ends up in WW two. He writes her whenever he docks a new town and doesn't relent in doing so for a great many years. When he returns home, she - at the age where her hormones are racing - wants their relationship to crystallize in something physical, but he as old as he looks hasn't reached that maturity yet. Hurt, she loses some wild hairs when she moves to the city to pursue her artistic ambition as a ballet dancer. He very sweetly tries to woo her on a surprise visit and is hurt on his turn when she displays no enthusiasm towards him whatsoever. Again they tragically part ways. Fincher turned the genders around as Benjamin symbolizes the girl who isn't ready to sleep with her far more eager boyfriend yet. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is filled with these subtle innuendo's and double bottoms. For instance, he demonstrates how the stars can align just as plausibly to drive two people apart as fate can bring them closer together. A series of the most unfortunate of small events costs Daisy her dancing ability, after which she is too humiliated to let Benjamin take care of her.The two soul-mates ultimately do lock lips and experience many happy years together, as she matures physically and he matures mentally, their love grows and they couldn't be more in love than the moment right before they part. Which brings us to the most surprising plot twist in the confident, not plot-driven film namely: Benjamin leaves Daisy way before he's forced to in an effort to give her the opportunity to find a second husband and mostly a father to their newly-born daughter, who is perfectly baby-faced by the way. Another surprising scene tells about a later re-encounter between the two broken hearts, making for one of the movie's very best scenes.They picked up the pace for a lot of the scenes in Benjamin's later, pre-pubescent life, as they contour the bleeding heart of the movie, the fleetingness of everything, even love can not stop time. Mortality is an endlessly interesting theme, yet most movies steer clear of it consciously. "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a musing on it, and even though the odds are stacked against it, it un-selfconciously embodies hope, optimism, beauty and it succeeds in reaching an emotional plateau that will give future filmmakers nightmares in awe of the achievement."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a grand movie sans the pretension, it is an intelligent movie sans the esotericism, but most of it all it's a movie with a tremendous heart and emotional intelligence that, helped by it's dreamy style, elevates the viewer into cinematic heavens. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seemed interesting enough when I saw the previews for it. After seeing the movie though I couldn't help but think that this movie was a rip off of Forrest Gump. It has a similar plot of telling the story of a guys life, but it just is not as good. It is like a less interesting Forrest Gump that plays in reverse and is a lot weirder. Even though Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time, this does not even come close. They should name it The Biography of Benjamin Button. It was kind of like Walk the Line or Ray, so if you would like to watch a movie like this, then you might enjoy this movie more than I. The one thing I did appreciate about this movie is that it gives an interesting view of what it would be like to be born old. I guess I just imagined it differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious, indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some things wrong and some things right with this movie, but the former outnumber the latter.First, what's right: the art direction. Every image, every shot has been executed with great attention to detail and the authentic look. The New Orleans of the 1920s and thereafter, the New York of the 1940s, the episodes at sea during WWII feel right and credible. I'm not sure how much of these scenes were computer-generated, but the money spent was not wasted. The same can be said with regard to all the CGI work.Next, the love story: I believed the chemistry between Benjamin and Daisy, as well as the lifelong mutual attraction they felt. First love often refuses to wane,even if circumstances intervene and impede it, as they did in this case. For this reason, the middle part of the movie where Benjamin and Daisy reunite is the most watchable. Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt are convincing in the display of passion for one another. In fact, all of the actors in the film are very good, outstanding among them the actress who plays Benjamin's mother, Queenie, the actor who plays the Irish captain, and an actress I admire, Tilda Swinton as the British diplomat's wife. I also think, however, all the actors were wasted in a film whose point is lost upon me, and this is where my dissatisfaction with the film lies. I believe it attempts to say and do too many different things, and it fails to accomplish any of them compellingly. If this is a love story, then it's formulaic and hardly original. We've had too many movies where an elderly person on his or her deathbed recalls a great love once lived. That storyline was used in The Notebook and Evening with better results. If, on the other hand, the point of the movie is to depict 20th century historical events in the US, then where was the Depression of the 1930s? The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s? The Vietnam War? The social conscience of the 1960s and the 1970s is replaced with footage of The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show. And the formula of looking at history through an individual life was done better in Forrest Gump. If, finally, the film attempts to underscore the fragility of our lives and the random events that shape them (Daisy's accident and the end of her dance career), that point was made early on in the movie, as soon as an elderly character began repeating to Benjamin that he was struck seven times by lightning. All references to life's tenuousness became repetitive after that, which brings me to my last complaint: the film was too long. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is, indeed, a curious film, not in best sense of that word. It tries too hard to be significant, and it fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great? Not really...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty obvious that an enormous amount of work went into making this film (just considering how looooong it is and how many well made-up life stages its title character covers). However, Art is not judged by quantity, but by quality. To me, this film felt dull and pointless. OK, so Benjamin ages in reverse with all the complications such a phenomenon would generate, and travels a lot. So? What exactly is the film supposed to tell us besides this particular thing? There's a lot of attention to detail, but it feels so minutious that the film appears rigid and uptight, like a soft fabric stitched too tight. It seems to me this film was supposed to bee a bit deeper, maybe a bit whimsical with a touch of wonder, or SOMETHING that would make it more than a pointless story, and would get us ponder for a while afterward. Maybe if Mr. Fincher would have remembered this was not a "who done it" movie and it requires a softer touch and a more relaxed approach, and mostly, more freedom in its creation, the film would've had that airy quality that makes us smile with our hearts and truly remember it for a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mankind has always been fascinated by his own mortality. Death has been a prevailing motif in art throughout the centuries, most of the contributing artists and authors now deceased, having been outlived by the work borne from their passions and uncertainties. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald died prematurely in 1940. There will come a time when director David Fincher passes on (hopefully not for a long time yet), and so 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)' will serve as his own wistful essay on the nature of life and death, love and loss. Fitzgerald's short story was adapted by Eric Roth, who also wrote 'Forrest Gump (1994)' {itself inspired by the likes of 'Little Big Man (1970)' and 'Being There (1979)'}, and so comparisons between the two films are certainly not unfounded. Both films ? and I love 'Forrest Gump,' by the way ? trace the lives of sympathetic characters who are forced to experience the world through unusual circumstances, thus giving them a unique outlook on life. Also brought to mind is Tim Burton's 'Big Fish (2003),' particularly with its elements of fantasy.Though almost three hours in length, every shot of Fincher's film is a sumptuous feast for the eyes, with computer-generated imagery integrated seamlessly into the plot, enhancing the fantastical atmosphere rather than distracting from it. Extensive make-up is used to add decades to many of the supporting characters, but what I found even more astonishing was the visual trickery used to "age down" star Brad Pitt to a striking youth in his twenties. The effect is marvellously disconcerting, and really drives home the sheer eeriness of Benjamin Button's circumstances. The film's somewhat-gimmicky premise is played surprisingly lightly during the film's first half, but gradually transforms into a melancholy tragedy when Benjamin begins to comprehend that his current "normal" lifestyle is only temporary. There's little emotional pay-off to the film, perhaps because the protagonist is himself incapable of finding any lasting satisfaction. Though we follow Benjamin's years to their logical conclusion, there's disappointingly little pathos in his final moments; as soon as Brad Pitt is removed from the equation, the audience loses its emotional anchor with the character.Despite its inconsistent tone and occasionally lazy storytelling, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is probably Fincher's most mature film to date, certainly more so than the highly enjoyable but superficial 'Se7en (1995)' and 'Fight Club (1999),' though 'Zodiac (2007)' first signalled the arrival of an intelligent filmmaker. For viewers in search of action-packed thrills, they'd best look elsewhere, for 'Benjamin Button' is a film in which nothing much happens. This remark is obviously hyperbole, but I don't mean it as a criticism; the film is a subtle and elegiac meditation on human mortality, and it basks for 166 minutes in this simple but powerful premise. For Benjamin Button, we can't sit back and muse, as we might for Forrest Gump or Edward Bloom, "this man has had a great life." When it comes down to it, exactly what has Benjamin done with his life? He's just lived it, and, really, that's all that anyone can expect out of life. Some people were born to sit by a river; some get struck by lightning; some are artists; some swim; some dance. Benjamin Button lived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story starts off slowly but poignantly in a "retirement" home in New Orleans. The people that populate Benjamin's world are all at the end of their mortal existence while Benjamin is headed in the other directions. Also, one learns that there are many places one may be struck by lightening.The special effects &amp; makeup that altered Brad Pitt's appearance as he de-aged during the film were amazing. I found myself getting lost in the story despite the amazing lack of car chases, explosions and cheap sexual titillation. A very mature presentation on how time changes us all and how the choices we make or ignore have lasting impact upon us until the day we die.The acting was sublime and superb by all concerned. Cate Blanchett did an amazing job of handling the demands of showing the complicated emotions and conflicts felt by Daisy as she deals with the truth of her relationship with Benjamin. Kudos also to Taraji P. Henson's soulful depiction of Benjamin's "mother," Queenie.Being a resident of New Orleans, the most poignant part of the film was the ending. I found the death of Daisy coinciding with the arrival of Hurricane Katrina and the flooding of the warehouse holding Monsieur Gateau's "The Reverse Time Clock" hit me literally where I live. The movie made liberal use of showing off New Orleans but that ending was emotional as Katrina still haunts us to this day. Also, I learned I would never want to stay in Murmansk in winter.This is a must-see movie for those who love movies rather than soulless SFX spectacles. Brad Pitt &amp; this film better get some Oscar love or a whole lot of folks will be upset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflection about the self inside us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A child is born and that small one to be called Benjamin Button, is already with an aspect of an old-baby. A premature aging, Progenies, could happen but that would have occurred in the uterus, if we want to make that in the rational way. But this is cinema, and one can or not accept others fantasies. One can be riding on several illusions and delusions and select what ever premises are offer to us, the ones that explained to us the meaning of that particular movie. A short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was used as a guideline for the screenplay freely adopted by David Fincher ("Zodiac," "Fight Club"). I think that the perspective that best describes the attitude of Bajamin Button as a human being with such peculiar vital cycle(Interpreted by Brad Pitt, excellence elevated to the seventh power), is like a child attitude about everything. That is without prejudice, accepting, full of tolerance and at the same time enjoying more everything about him. Specially some human functions that he did not have before and then just happened, almost out of the blue, like his sexual initiation. He himself is not surprised of how he looks outside. He also could have a vision of life as an anthropologist, or even an alien, that explorer our human nature from the perspective of what I don't have, until I know that exist and then gained, that is why he accepted things like they are. The story itself is painful because it accentuates the ephemeral of romantic relationships, in this case between Daisy (Cate Blanchett. Even when that is lasted almost a lifetime, it is precisely because they are running in the opposite direction in its trajectory, and to avoid colliding with each other, then they allow to many things and persons before loose each other, because the ultimately goal is to remain like two lovers beside time. There are some events of a century, people crossed as shooting fireworks, and a daughter. For her there are letters ad postcards from abroad in which her mysterious Dad is full of love, and advices for her.It is a film that requires us to accept the premise of the absurdity of life traveling in opposite direction. The same could be said of "Orlando" novel and film of Virginia Woolf and Sally Potters respectively. The premise is a human being who lived four centuries and alternating gender continues being herself or himself along the centuries, in Benjamin Button, the essence is the total lack of sense of ownership of the other, the love that seeks the happiness of being loved and not the cage, because although that could be made of gold after all it is a prison. The film is about how much we love the others, our friend relatives, lovers, that after all they continue living somewhere on the hard disk of our brains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fincher and Pitt and should have been accorded a great deal more acclaim than they were. This is an impossible, illogical premise and story, and yet they made it into something poignant and entertaining. Its extra length zipped by effortlessly. My only quibble is that the reverse aging was sometimes somewhat distracting and therefore not quite successful. And then there's Ms Blanchett's performance. Somehow after successfully traversing most of the script, she manages to overdo her part in some inexplicable way. It broke up the flow of the piece and I found myself annoyed with someone I usually love to watch and wonder about. Pitt, however, did a magnificent job, I thought. He was this little man as convincingly as any character actor has ever inhabited someone as far removed from themselves as Benjamin is from the real Pitt.</fullReview>

The girl was "OK" as an actress but felt so sorry for her to be in such a stupid movie, well, it's OK for "7-year-olds" but NOT for adults! When are we going to see REAL plots, that require intelligence, like in the movies of the 50's and 60's? All you see now is stupid poor excuses for science fiction like this movie, or nudity, violence and obscenity because producers are too stupid to use their brains to come up with REAL ideas or REAL, intelligent plots?.UGH!!!!!!! Brad Pitt appears, as usual, full of himself, but in reality, his IQ is probably inconsequential, his acting is deplorable and his taste in choosing roles just as deplorable. I might want to mention that I am sick and tired of hearing about him and Angelina and Jennifer. Come on Brad, be a man and get a life! What kind of legacy are you going to leave for your poor children, that you played a vampire and a stupid jerk several times in movies? What degrees have you obtained? What have you done for humanity in general? What have you done for anyone else other than yourself?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true gem in and of itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back from seeing The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and never once did it feel dragged down or contrived; like so many other dramas that came out last year. Never has a film been so original, so groundbreaking, so touching and heartfelt at the same time while giving best performances all around from Cate Blanchett and of course, most of all, Brad Pitt. The most remarkable thing about this film is the progression of events that flow so naturally, from different time periods and the "aging" of the main character. But none of these things would matter had it not been for David Fincher's taut, ingenuity, masterful direction with a first rate screenplay by Eric Roth. For once, special effects don't overshadow the story and drama; they mainly serve them. And they are indeed wonderful. A true gem in and of itself. This film teaches us to value life and the time that we are given in this harsh, cruel world. But most of all, it tells us that no matter how old we get, love is forever boundless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) **** Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton, Jason Flemyng, Jared Harris, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, Elias Koteas, Phyllis Somerville, Elle Fanning. Remarkable adaptation loosely based on F.Scott Fitzgerald's short story about a man born old and aging in reverse ? becoming younger ? is given gravitas and dignity thanks to the surprisingly adult direction by David Fincher and splendid lead performance by Pitt (both arguably career bests and Oscar worthy). Eric Roth and Robin Swicord's screenplay is full of rich characters and touching bravado that echoes "Forrest Gump" in many ways, not the least of which Roth also wrote the adaptation of. Excellent acting by Blanchett as Pitt's star-crossed lover and Henson as his adoptive mother. But the truly impressive feat is by the visual effects crew super-imposing Pitt on other actors in different stages of Button's regression through the decades in a seamless matter. Kudos to Greg Cannom's make-up crew for an amazing job for both Pitt and Blanchett. One of the year's very best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Fincher again proves what an amazing director he is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the short story (of the same name) written in 1921 by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a unique and emotional journey through one man's rather different life. Benjamin (Brad Pitt) was born unlike any other child, with the physical features of an elderly man, and this causes his father to abandon him at a random doorstep. Luckily for Ben, he is taken in by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) and raised in an home for the elderly. As he grows he witnesses the elderly around him pass on and meets many interesting people along the way, one of which changes him forever. Daisy (Cate Blanchett) meets Ben as a young girl and they strike up a friendship that spans their lifetimes. Even when they both part ways as she goes to a ballet school and he becomes a sailor, experiencing the world and its people.David Fincher, along with two fine actors, Pitt and Blanchett, have made a epic unlike many others. This is not an epic like Lord of the Rings or Gone with the Wind, this is a human drama epic, following the life of one man and who he meets and loves. At 160 minutes in length, this truly is a film that will be remembered as a different style of epic. The film covers life, death, love, birth, war and loneliness, but by the films end it is obvious what the true message is. Life is about the moments, not the time, it is about what we do, our true passion and talent, as seen by a moving and poignant final montage. And on saying that, the movie is not overly sentimental, although it managed to jerk a few tears from this viewers eyes. I know that this was due to the touching relationship that Benjamin and Daisy have, and Fincher handles these scenes so beautifully that they cause many emotions to flow through the soul. But also interestingly, he handles death throughout the film not always so sad, as death is seen not in a negative light by Benjamin.Eric Roth deserves mention for his wonderful screenplay, which blends comedy with a hint of war and drama. The characters are all rich and easy to care for as a result of their uniqueness and charm. Queenie, Ben's mother, is a sassy and devout woman who we can immediately like. Also, one of the elderly in the home provides some genuinely good laughs as a man who repeatedly tells the story of how he was struck by lightning seven times, and as he recalls the times he was struck, quick old fashioned film footage shows us how it happened. Fincher's direction is sure to get nominated for awards, as are the screenplay and acting and they all deserve them.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a magical journey that feels shorter than it is, and is one of the best mainstream films of the past decade. 5/5</fullReview>

This movie is the best movie I have scene in a long time. One thing that struck me was Brad Pitt's performance. He has matured. His acting was more skillful and insightful that any thing he has done recently. One could tell he was enjoying himself. Cate Blanchett was excellent to. To me Ms Blanchett has the same skill set as Katherine Hepburn. She can play several characters very well at the same time. In conclusion, the technical aspects of the film were astonishing. Also, the movie was very emotional. As demonstrated by the women crying around me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Growing Younger Never Was Interpreted Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald; both the book and the movie. When I heard about this movie in the summer, and I found out it was based off F. Scott Fiztgerald's book about a man who is getting younger instead older, I jumped at the chance to see it. It was a plus that Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, and Julia Ormond were in it. Today I headed to the theater with Heather to see if this movie was able to do Fitzgerald justice. It did. After the 30 minutes of commercials and previews, the movie finally started. It was very creative of Paramount to have the Paramount icon created full of buttons. I already knew that I was going to love the movie, even though that really had nothing to do with it. The acting was superb. From the beginning of the movie, I had tears in my eyes and laughter coming out of my mouth. Pitt did an amazing job as the curious Benjamin Button. At every moment of his age, I believed him. He played the old man with a child's innocence with such precision that I had to remind myself that it wasn't based off a true story. A big and happy surprise was the acting of Taraji Henson, who played Button's adoptive mother. I know that after this movie, she is going to have movie offers left and right. Pitt and Henson had such a wonderful chemistry that I felt the mother/child love from each of them. Of course, Blanchett and Swinton were just as amazing. The symbolism in the movie was well thought out. I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure if it was in there already. The hummingbird flying around in unexpected times signified the freedom and bewilderment that surrounded Button and Daisy. The people Benjamin met all molded him into the person he was. It was great how he recognized that. It was great how past events were shown using an old-fashioned camera. It kind of took the same method in "Forrest Gump." I thought that it gave visual breaks in the long movie. What made it more interesting is how they used different formats of old cameras to represent the past.The movie made me cry. It reminded me of my true love and I, and how he was the only person who ever loved me on first sight. Button's and Daisy's love was beautiful and wonderful, and I wish that I could have this with him. It wasn't all about true love. It had a wonderful message about living your life and never thinking you are too old to do something. However, the love story helped.Definitely a movie that I am going to get on DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

Furthermore, the desensitized aspect of adultery is the main aspect of the illicit movie. When we view the latter with a loose moral value we find mankind not evolving but actually devolving. Please, avoiding this movie will maintain your positive note toward God along with the magnificent value of a baby. Vanity appears to make itself more important than the breath of life of which we all know is temporary and of little value.Remember, Hollywood is full of evil; the house of Satan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kissable Writer reviews David Fincher's "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" (part1)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear reader, As you may or may not be aware of my shameless David Fincher fan-boy status, if you are, I need not tell you the levels of psychetude in my bloodstream reached dangerous levels the eve before my visit to the theater to see "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". As I have discussed on a few occasions, expectations this high usually make the boat head unwaveringly for shelves of disaster.We already knew David Fincher can apply his vast technical talent and intuition on grisly, provocative source material. Case in point: Se7en, where the bowels of Dante's hell are opened up for two hours. We already knew David Fincher is able to shape a parallel universe where the wondrous appears completely natural. Case in point: Fight Club, where it's perfectly normal to live in a dusty dump and make soap all day without arousing any suspicion. We already knew David Fincher is passionate enough about his art to respect his Noir influences without being too scared to expand upon the themes of the genre. Case in point: Se7en, the movie where the ending implodes as the only innocent lamb in the movie gets slaughtered, a barrier even the gloomiest Noirs haven't broken. We already knew no two Fincher directions remotely resemble one another, even when he boldly tries to upstage his own serial killer movie. Case in point: Zodiac, where the, eventually fruitless, obsession to track down a killer makes more victims than the actual murders. What we didn't know is that Fincher is the only leopard in the world that can change it's spots. With "Benjamin Button", he has created a life-affirming epic that combines these aforementioned skills and have them result in a product that's a hell of a lot more than the sum of it's parts."The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is a lengthy picture, spinning one theme and keeping the camera steady on one actor for 160 minutes. The theme is mortality. The actor is Brad Pitt. Not that you're going to recognize him in the first reel. In case you've been living on the moon for the past six months, Benjamin Button ages backwards. From crib to wheelchair, from cue-ball to wavy locks, from distinguished wrinkles to bad complexion, well you get the idea. On paper, this comes off silly. But Fincher wouldn't be the man who walks in his own shoes if he didn't strike an interesting chord right off the bat. You see, Benjamin spends his days not moaning about his sore muscles or finger-thick glasses, he doesn't mind living with the Damocles' sword of knowing he will probably die way before a normal man's time. He takes every day as it comes, lives the hell out of it, and doesn't lose a wink of sleep worrying. A girl, as their innate ability is shattering hearts with a shy smile or a magical movement, destabilizes his life; he instantly falls in love with her and even though the puppy love is as requited as the situation allows it to be, later on she matures and he has a hard time understanding her rejection.Benjamin journeys to far away places on a tugboat, the captain of which is a self-proclaimed artist whose own body serves as a canvas. He begrudgingly followed in his father's sailor footsteps, but every tattoo forms a reminder of where his heart and passions truly lie. Benjamin observes that the man's anger is only skin-thick but his joie de vivre and acceptance of his plight go right down to the bone. He brushes sides (and other body parts too) with a lonely, dream-robbed middle-aged wife who once cherished the ambition of swimming across the English channel. At this point, Benjamin Button still has the anything but dashing looks of father time himself, and the wife herself (played by the completely average looking but great actress Tilda Swinton) didn't exactly walk right out of a pin-up calendar, yet their attraction grows to a physical point, because their personalities click so well. Benjamin lets go off the (still widely believed) notion that physical beauty equals beauty and by extension the possibility of being loved, and is deeply pleased by the door of hope this hidden truth swings wide open. The relationship "ran it's course", as Benjamin himself states at one point; a phrase embodying acceptance and inner peace like few other in four short words.He encounters his father, who gave him up after seeing the elephant man-esquire creature that he daren't call his son born out of a dead mother. As all fathers should, he teaches his son, who is unaware of the identity of the man sitting across from him, how to drink and between the lines we can read the shame he's feeling and the pride replacing it. Here it is Benjamin who hands out a lesson: never try to change someone because every one is perfect in one way or another.At the end of the second act, most characters Benjamin met up with have gone gentle into that good night; he mourns but he doesn't linger on the pain. Because "we're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?". Who wants to live forever? An intricate part of whether or not the movie will resonate with a part within you lies in the classic love blooming between Benjamin and Daisy. Does the fact that it's a romanticized movie love alienate you or does it melt your heart because you understand the power of movie love can be found in the smallest, tenderest of gestures: a kiss on the forehead to awaken someone, seeing the world in someone's eyes, comfortably sharing silence and a moment of beauty that's heightened by the mere presence of that someone. End of part 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this was a Best Picture contender for 2008, my natural reaction was to compare it to Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. Although they are both completely different kinds of movies, they do share a common theme of a lifelong romance. However, whereas Slumdog Millionaire starts out dark &amp; gritty and leads up to a fairy-tale conclusion, David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is quite consistent throughout and doesn't try to be too dark or too bright.It was very intriguing just observing Benjamin's growth (or rather, backwards growth) and at times I could really feel for the characters. This is probably the best performance I've seen from Brad Pitt to date, although I thought Taraji P. Henson gave the best performance in the movie as his foster mother. Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is definitely one of the best movies of 2008 I've seen.8/10</fullReview>

Many of the plot elements were eyeroll worthy, such as the fiasco in the beginning when the father kidnaps and abandons his son (without any repercussions, apparently). The multitude of unintelligible accents also aggravated me to no end, especially the narrator's exhausted, Southern accent (ugh!). I also found Benjamin Button to be a wholly unsympathetic character, as was Cate Blanchett (after she grew up, that is). The only redeemable aspect of the movie is when Benjamin Button encounters Tilda Swinton's character. I thought that part of the movie was quite sweet--but to what end? (because their ties are severed so abruptly!). The ending of the movie was also nicely executed, but by that time, I was ready to flee the theater. I recommend that you watch this movie (if you still want to) when it comes out on cable. Don't pay to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow, insignificant film jewelery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year's biggest contender at the Academy Awards is an Academy film in every respect. It's star-packed, it's pompous, it's somewhat historically oriented and it's trying to make you cry your eyes out. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most insignificant films you'll see this Oscar season. The life of the Benjamin Button is, despite his weird aging complexity, not at all that unusual, or at least it shouldn't be. As he himself says at one point in the film, the only thing young about him is his looks, and only in Hollywood is looks considered to be character. The only motivation Benjamin has for anything seems to be a curiosity that is never explained, and we are expected to believe that it is by virtue of looking weird.For a film about time, it's painfully little concerned about the times. Despite world travels and a multitude of other characters who actually seems to have a more defined place in time, Benjamin's story remains solely about Benjamin and his looks. For some reason (which we are supposed to believe is his condition), he doesn't seem to know what neither sex or war is at the age of 20 or so. We are supposed to sympathize with him for being a stranger to killing when he first sees it in the war, probably because he is not as old and experienced as he looks. But fact of the matter is that he was still older than millions of others who actually had to fight in the war, so I for one do not get any special sympathy for him.The film is narrated to us by Benjamin, or rather read from Benjamin's journal by the daughter of his dying love interest. The framing story is completely pointless and only drags out the plot. The love aspect itself is the only thing that makes the story worthwhile, but that too is told pretty clumsily. At one point Blanchet's character tells Benjamin she never wants to see her again. But instead of letting us know any of the feelings involved, we are told that Benjamin went out and had fun with other women until Blanchet changed her mind and showed back up on his doorstep to ask for forgiveness.Of course, as an Academy favorite, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is still a beautiful film to look at. It's cast is famous for a reason, and Fincher hasn't lost his touch either. It is just a shame how the story and characters (at least the main one) remain entirely superficial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious case of Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I left the theater there was only one thought running through my head; what ever happened to David Fincher? This film, although it has a nice central idea of a man growing younger and meeting a woman growing older, is ultimately about nothing. 45mins could EASILY have been chopped out of this. Did you need the Tilda Swinton story? All the crap on the boat?The Forrest Gump analogies are rampant. In fact this is the love child of Big Fish and Forrest Gump. Alabama voice over, Lieutenant Dan, even having a symbol that was supposed to represent the them of the film - which by the way was WEAK in this movie. What a stupid idea the humming bird was - it's wings beat in a figure 8 motion and 8 is the symbol for infinity... Give me a break. Although I'm not Forrest Gump's biggest fan at least the feather was subtle and poetic. The Humming bird feels forced. The special effects were a mixed bag. The digital make up was good and Pitt as an old man (except for one or two overly fake lip movements) were spot on. However traditional effects and digital matte paintings were atrocious and substandard. At first I thought the film was going to be a 300(esque) blue screen job - but then Fincher betrays that overly stylized style by having the film post-1950s being uber real. He even has Brad Pitt traveling around the world at one point and they look as if they were filmed in the real locations.There a sequence in it that involves a traffic accident that almost made me yawn out loud. I get it Fincher. I see the point you are trying to make. It is a scene that feels robbed from Jean Pierre Jeunet or someone (only he'd have made it more entertaining by speeding it up and having the action happened really fast so you are playing catch up).In also ends without any real closure and left me feeling... Meh. Stick to the darkness Fincher, you work best in that world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dull, hackneyed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited about going to see this film but it was a spectacular disappointment.It is a very contrived film and any hint of originality is ruined by being presented in a heavy handed and clumsy way. There are grandiose attempts at profundity that come across as awkward and contrived. This is particularly apparent in the attempt to picture the alcoholic, tattooist, tug-boat captain as an artist - it might have worked with a different director or better script but in this situation it is trite and blatant. Also, watch out for the hummingbird...The script is also packed with absurd lines that I think were meant to be profound and insightful but are downright banal and obvious leaving one with the urge to laugh in embarrassment. The characters are unlikeable and self-absorbed (he abandons his wife and child without any good reason). Some of the minor characters are very interesting, namely Mr Gateau and Tilda Swinton's character and their stories would perhaps have made the better film.What has happened to Brad Pitt? He couldn't carry this movie but perhaps no one could have. You leave with the distinct impression that a committee set out to create an 'original' and 'beautiful' film, utilised the most clichéd lines and scenes in their arsenal and managed to produce a hackneyed, dull and ugly movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a huge Brad Pitt fan but after this movie, I am now. It is his best by far.I have never seen a movie like this. Interesting yet simple storyline. A story of a man born old who ages in reverse. As he is slowly getting younger everyone around him is aging normally. The make up and special effects in this movie are great.This movie made me think about things and made me think of my own children especially by infant son.It is long, but I liked the premise of examining a life lived backwards.I am totally in awe of this fantastic movie. I hope it wins the Oscar for best picture. Much better than Slumdog Millionaire which I thought was over-rated. This movie deserves all the praise it has gotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't go anywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been quite excited at the idea behind this movie. The first hour was quite interesting, and yet one of the major flaws I had with this film became apparent: No matter how old he looks or how old he really is, he seems like the same character.No one in the film really seemed to undergo changes. For some reason his relationship made me think of Forest Gump and his Jenny, but it was no where near as deep as Gump's relationship.No one made a big deal about a man who is aging backwards. The film could have just been about the life of any normal man. There was no real feeling of magic about his reverse aging. No real sense that it made any difference to the film. I had to think about how old his body would be and how old his mind would be because it wasn't often obvious.Overall this film far underachieved in my eyes in all ways, acting, story, feelings evoked and lingering impression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you loved Forrest Gump, you will love Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say that this was a bad movie, I just didn't quite enjoy it. A friend described it as Forrest Gump with reverse aging. This description is very accurate. I think there are many people who would like this movie, its just kind of boring since you don't grow to love the characters at all throughout the movie. It is like Forrest Gump in many, many ways, but primarily because it is a string of small stories tracking a characters life. While I think this can make a great movie, I only actually enjoy it if there is enough character development to make me love or at least deeply care about the character you are following. I'm sure this is a hard balance to find - to tell so many stories but also make you love the character. I think it is possible to do both though; PT Anderson did it at least twice. Cate Blanchett was great, Tilda Swinton was good, and Brad Pitt was okay. The best though was Taraji Henson; I hope she gets some recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply fail to understand how this boring and very 'hard-going' movie has managed to garner so many positive reviews. I had trouble staying awake! The whole idea of a person born an old-man-baby(?)and ultimately reverting back to a baby - but this time,an old-young-baby(?)Is the most puerile, pointless,laughable and unbelievable 'plot' I've ever come across.The write-ups claim that the film centres around a man who ages back-to-front, i.e. gets younger as time passes - instead, we have this mixed-up, silly premise In which an old looking baby becomes an adult, then reverts back to a 'REAL' baby - but who then dies presumably of old age! Quite how this project cost 150 million dollars to make Is beyond me, and I was left wondering on what,exactly,such a huge sum was spent? If you are considering watching this movie for the first time, I suggest that your time would be better spent watching paint dry - It would certainly be more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many questions few answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Either film-goers are a totally different species than I or they ask a lot less of a film than I. I started off reading the book. (I'm in a book/film club where we do both and then discuss both together.) The book was a mere outline of a story not yet written. It just told events that happened with almost no dialog, expression of feelings, or even descriptions of where they were. It was a very short story and the facts were very different. His father denied his age and dressed him in shorts (he also kept custody which got changed in the film.) His wife came to resent him as did his teenage son. The movie went with the bare bones plot outline and wrote an entirely new story. What both had in common was that the characters didn't act like humans in the face of a scientific impossibility. They were shocked but that was the extent of it. No one contacted the media or the scientific community so that Man could study this "miracle." So the movie is now some sort of science fiction tale where people don't act like people yet in every other way they do. That inconsistency ruined both tales for me. I might have tried seeing it like one would GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, or Kafka's METAMORPHOSIS. But in those the goal was to share an insight and the unreality made the story fresh and helped drive the point home. The BUTTON twist did neither for me. And the love story made no sense to me, particularly when the Brad Pitt character leaves his wife (loving wife.) He didn't trust that her love for him was substantive enough (not superficial) to weather the onslaught of old age and sickness. She had the same affliction when she got injured in France--she hid from him and married someone else she didn't really love. Why? Because she was afraid she wasn't really loved for herself but for her looks and talent. Those aren't symptoms of love but impediments to it--it's not love if you start off thinking you're not really lovable for who you are inside. So I had no admiration for them as the relationship unfolded. Only in the end as he got really "old," did he allow her to love him and that didn't seem like a real choice but a result of him running out of options. I've read the laudatory comments and they do not resonate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been at least three occasions, when at the end of a movie, my wife and I will look at each other with an amazed disappointment. "The Butterfly Effect", "City of Angels", and now "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". Granted, we enjoy Pitt movies and consider him extremely dynamic, but the story here failed to hold to its own. And there was no return on investment. As expressed by well-spoken critics, there were way too many Jump-the-Shark moments that tended to insult what little intelligence it required to watch such a film.Intertwined with the impending threat of a Hurricane (to pay homage and toss a few coins toward the Army Corp of Engineers) was an outlandish and entirely uninviting display of single-dimensional character-building. No fault of the collaboration, just too great of an attempt to reinvent the wheel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying Buttons is a beautiful picture. But that's what it feels like, a photograph taken by a well groomed photographer. However there isn't much of a story here. It almost seemed like Fincher was shooting a spread for GQ. There were scenes where I could almost hear him say. "Show me those pouty lips!" If you think I'm being harsh; then just watch the motorcycle scene again. Pitt almost strikes a pose to Maddonna's Vogue.The story just isn't groomed enough to warrant such a huge epic. Even Australia (with multiple stories) couldn't cut it. I did however think the age fx were amazing but, after a hour of trying to stop thinking about how an older Pitt looks like a present Redford, it was distracting. It also seems as if the one action scene was very forced. Everything working in Button's favor to ensure harm didn't come to him. I heard several people say this scene was a wondrous spectacle; for me it reminded me of The English Patients airplane crash. Just a nod on the shoulder to keep me awake and interested.I really went into this film with hopes it would be an epic. I knew it would be a long journey (running at approx. 3 hours). However time stands still in a grand film. This film seemed long because I, like Buttons, could feel the hours, instead of years, creep up on me. As I left the theater my Son asked me a question that really caught me off guard: Dad what if Buttons would have been normal like us, would the movie had been different? I answered, sure I would not have seen it.I guess that's the real FX here. My Zodiac/Se7en director got me to see a Harlequin Romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am certain that this film will be compared to Forest Gump. People will no doubt call Benjamin a literary masterpiece. But to me comparing these films would be the same as comparing a fine piece of art work with a cheep knockoff found in the bottom of a cereal box. to explain. I found most every character to be shallow flat and uninspired. do not misunderstand they had potential, in fact the film as a whole had potential. the problem is that it just did not deliver. this is what i got out of the three hours that i had to sit threw.#1 If your born as an old man and grow young you apparently have the rare ability to have relations with every woman you meet and some how manage to hold on to the title gentleman. #2 If you work on a tugboat. every one around you will die in a battle royal with an enemy sub but some how you will come out victorious. the best part about it is that you don't have to care about the crew because nobody watching does ether. a side point. Your captain will be reincarnated as a humming bird and then will visit your girl years after your dead.. Kinda creepy #3 clock makers that are blind make clocks that run backward and for what ever reason this allows one man that doesn't seem to be connected with that event live a backwards aging life. i just don't get it #4 If you have a troubled relation with your father he will most likely will you his button factory and his house which you will immediately turn around and sell. Benjamin BUTTON, BUTTON factory hmm I wounder why that factory had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. oh well.....NEXT #5 how many characters do i have to meet that do nothing but leave me with more questions,A piano teacher, where is her personality and and what did she have to do with the story? The man from Louisiana, who was he? where did he go? and why did he appear sitting in a field making a profound statement at the end of the film? and then there was the mysterious woman who was married to the spy. what ever happened to the spy? hmm that must be top secret.now lets take these elements and throw in a heavy does of commercialism and and a heavy dose of CG and we get a film with more holes then swiss cheese. not to mention that the whole point of him growing younger had any thing to do with any thing. the movie would have played out exactly the same had Benjamin lived a perfectly normal forward life.All tho i don't know for certain i would guess that the short story that this film is derived from is probably an enchanting story and possibly well worth a read. I just cant seem to make myself read it for fear it will be worse then the movie.If you like story telling do yourself a favor and watch a classic Forest Gump,Big fish,Secondhand lions,or The princess bride. and pass on the confusing mess that is Benjamin Button.</fullReview>

The acting was good, the plot was a unique concept, but something was missing. I had been told this movie was the next "Forest Gump". But it didn't have the charm (nor Tom Hanks). One thing that made "Forest Gump" (for me anyway) was the way photos of events, news, characters, etc. were used to depict the passing of time. This method is what also added more charm to the movie "Same Time Next Year". I did think that Taraji Henson stole the show. Her acting was outstanding and I hope she wins the Oscar. And although I thought Brad Pitt did a good job, the other competitors for Best Actor are much stronger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twig-thin, pretentious garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should have known it was going to happen eventually. There's always one potential Oscar film that I absolutely hate, and in 2008 it is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. To get it out of the way immediately: yes, the film is technically accomplished. It totally deserves to be nominated for all the technical categories, including score and cinematography. It is absolutely gorgeous at times. But so freakin' what? The film behind those technical accomplishments is just plain bad. The film is about a man who is born old and ages backward. He falls in love with a girl who is in reality the same age as he, but he has to wait for her to grow up and for him to grow down. Cool concept, yeah? I was aware of this story since way back when Spike Jonze was talking about doing it, around 2000. I've been waiting for it for the better part of this decade. But you know what? It's just a gimmick. I don't know what F. Scott Fitzgerald's original story is about, how he uses that gimmick, but Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth do absolutely nothing with it. The backward aging thing doesn't provide any insight into how a life is lived. Ben Button the character has no insight, besides a few banal observations. The film has no historical point of view. Set in New Orleans from the end of WWI and ending, chronologically, at Hurricane Katrina, it has almost nothing to say about the 20th or 21st Centuries. This is particularly obvious when there are black and white characters interacting with each other as if no such thing as racial tension existed. Many of the film's critics note its similarities to Forrest Gump, which was also written by Eric Roth. Yes, there are many honest and insightful arguments against Forrest Gump, but at least it didn't turn its back on history the way Ben Button does (though it does, of course, polish it far too much). So little happens in the film, it's almost amazing that they were able to stretch it out for nearly three hours. The film just gives us bland sentiments, two dimensional characters whom I didn't come close to caring about, lots of talk about life and death but no real philosophies on it and no sense of time or place, except for the most generic sort possible. I haven't mentioned the actors yet. This disaster isn't at all their fault. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, both fine actors, are given little to do. I guess you could kind of praise Pitt's old man act, but much of the impressiveness of that is due to the special effects and makeup. Taraji P. Henson is getting a lot of praise for her role as Queenie, Benjamin's adoptive mother. She's probably the best actor in the film, but this kind of mammy role is below her talents. No black woman should have to waste her time in such a stereotypical role. The only performances I liked at all were those of Jared Harris, who is a lot of fun as a sea captain, and Tilda Swinton, who is always good. I blame most of this movie on Roth, whose script is so extraordinarily vapid, but Fincher is partly at fault. This just isn't his kind of movie, and it's obvious he isn't able to handle sentimental material. I hate his most famous films, Se7en and Fight Club, because I find them both disgusting, cruel and cynical in a dangerous way. He found his perfect match, in my mind, last year with Zodiac, which utilized his clinical style perfectly. He seems to approach movies with a detached procedure, much as the investigators and journalists of Zodiac are supposed to operate. A grand love story, which Button purports to be (but never is), requires a director more in touch with his emotions.</fullReview>

If he wins an Oscar for that drivel the whole institution will stink.5. The punch line of the film, 'Whatever age you are everyone can always achieve their dreams' is even greater rubbish than the film itself. It is a typical Hollywood piece of schmulch that makes any intelligent person puke.I had to fight sleep all the way through this garbage - when really good films like Edenlake are ignored in the Oscars and this drivel picks up 13 nominations it proves that the whole show is rigged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yawn .... Zzzzzzzzz.... (movie's still playing) .... Yawn .... Zzzzzzzzz .... Benjamin's how old now? WHO CARES? AND WHY IS HE GETTING YOUNGER?In the Picture of Dorian Gray with Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, Angela Landsbury and George Sanders, Dorian NEVER gets old. Beat that, Benny. At least in Dorian the movie offers an explanation for why Dorian does not become old. With Benny ... NOTHING! NO EXPLANATION! Ya gotta give the audience an explanation.After giving the matter some thought and avoiding a rush to judgment, let it be known that this celluloid mess is a truly bad movie. This movie contains all the elements found in a clunker: boring characters, pretentious story, implausible situations, laughable dialog, unoriginality and unnecessarily long. Why oh why was this movie made? What was its purpose? It could not have been to entertain because in that regard the movie fails abysmally.How bad is this movie? There are no words that can fully answer this question. For one thing, this movie is long. For another, this movie is boring. For yet another, this movie is slow ... is ponderous ... is pretentious. An old man who gets young? Okay, what's next? A tall man who gets short? (Oh, that was done in the Incredible Shrinking Man.) A man who becomes an animal? (Oh, that was done in The Werewolf and other similar movies) A intellectually challenged man who becomes a genius? (Oh, that was done in Charly) A man who creates another man (Oh, that was done in Frankenstein). Ugh. First, in which genre does this movie belong? Science fiction or whimsical drama? For a drama, including a work of fiction, to work the story has to have plausibility, and in this movie the lack of plausibility is glaring. Now if the movie was presented as a science fiction drama then maybe the story could be accepted at face value and judged accordingly. But for this incredibly boring, ponderous, pretentious, and LONG movie, that is not the case. Okay, a man is born old and grows younger. That is a crucial element of the story that demands, indeed cries out for, further explanation. That cannot be accepted as a given because of its fantastic nature. Yet this movie offers no explanation whatsoever, relying instead on the audience accepting it despite it's obvious implausibility. This would be like watching the movie King Kong (any of one of the movies) with no explanation of King Kong's origin (Kong came from an island). Or this would be like watching the movie Predator with no reference as to where the creature originated (the creature came from outer space). Then the movie is so lacking in any kind of dynamism or conflict as to render it stale to the point of being annoying. The main character Benjamin is liked by everybody, even his father who not unreasonably panics when he sees his strange progeny. Also, the use of repeated flashbacks chopped up the story, interfering with its continuity, and starting the movie with an dying elderly woman who could barely talk didn't help the movie either. And by the time the main character has devolved into a child it was way past his bed time, for him and for this over hyped, over baked, overly long and very boring movie.Actually this movie does have some (unintentionally) memorable scenes. Like when the Benjamin's father is told that he has a new baby son, sees the infant, is absolutely horrified, grabs the baby and then is running all over the place with the baby while being chased by the police. Or when Benjamin is working on a tug boat and throws garbage overboard - into a head wind - and gets covered with garbage. Or when Benjamin has his first sexual experience - with a whore. Ugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but who cares?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a screening of it in Portland last Thursday and was blown away. It's definitely not perfect and has its flaws, unfortunately. It had the potential to be one of the greatest films of all time, and even with its flaws I still feel that it is one of my personal favorite films I've seen in my life. There are spurts in the film when its absolutely mesmerizing, a really unique film experience that is unlike anything you've ever seen. I wish the ending had been stronger, with everything that led up to it I was hoping to have a Shawshank Redemption type ending, but it never came. There were a few other things scattered throughout the film that need not have been there or were a bit cliché. So all in all it wasn't perfect, but in the end and after a few days since seeing it I realized that I didn't care about the small problems, and that it's without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. With its scope and scale, a project this inspired is nearly impossible to be entirely perfect with all the little details. The vision of it is unrivaled. The cinematography and score are heavenly, and the acting is beyond superb. When you think of the film as a whole, the story, the vision, you can't help but appreciate what you've just witnessed and the people that were involved to dream up such a beautiful piece of art, including F. Scott Fitzgerald. So see the film, let it flow, and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantasy that failed to transport</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, a good movie is more than an intriguing premise. It is more than the casting of my favorite actor or actors. It is certainly more than clever, state-of-the-art special effects. A good movie is one that touches my heart and captures my imagination. Benjamin Button was not, for me, a good movie. Quite the contrary, unfortunately.I entered the theater with the certainty that I was about to be delighted and instructed. From the film's premise, I expected to be entertained and moved by a fantasy about life's precious impermanence and the beauty of aging and loss, fueled by great chemistry between the film's lead actors. I adore films that show how our lives struggle against time and mortality, including Ground Hog Day, Eternal Sunshine, and Stranger Than Fiction. It was the transformation of the premise into a movie for flesh-and-blood folks like myself and my husband, who had just shlepped through the snow after a forty-five minute train ride downtown, and, coffee cups in hand, craning our necks in the third row, wanted, needed, dare I say even deserved, to be transported, mesmerized, and awestruck.I'm crushed to say that we weren't.The film was lackluster. I felt no sense of wonder, only repulsion at the gremlin-like infant, and at the mask-like makeup of Pitt and Blanchett at the beginning of the film. And as many have commented, I could not identify emotionally with Pitt's charmless characterization of Benjamin as a youth trapped in the prison of a feeble body. Where was his frustration, his yearning, his emotional roller coaster as he struggled to transcend his condition? I didn't see it or feel it. So I waited to feel something, anything.And I did. I felt increasing annoyance at Blanchett's mumbling on her deathbed, to which scene we returned dozens of times, chopping up the ongoing storyline. I felt worried about my husband, who, despite the caffeine, appeared to be slipping in and out of consciousness. I felt embarrassed by the cheap attempts at slapstick humor: the holy-roller preacher drops dead at his own prayer meeting, Benjamin projectile vomits after his first night of drinking, Benjamin discovers his youthful prowess in the tub while still a wrinkled prune.I am no stranger to the fleeting poignancy of life, the bittersweet sorrow of watching vital and vigorous loved ones dwindle and falter. Yes, there can be beauty in it. When people die, we do realize how much they mean to us, and how much life means, just as the movie states. Unfortunately, this statement is made a cliché uttered by a minor character. I wish that, instead, the movie had simply shown us this universal truth, through the unfolding of a specific tale of characters we feel for, rather than trying to force it down our throats with tedious determination.The movie depresses rather than uplifts. Not because it doesn't try to illuminate, but because it puts all its effort into surface appearance: make-up, clever visuals like the enormous clock or the backwards-running film of doomed soldiers impossibly returning home unscathed from battle. Film is visual, but it is also emotional. I want such visuals to touch my emotions, not my intellect. I don't want to say, "Oh, I get it, Brad Pitt looking from his wheelchair at some playful kids his own age means that he feels trapped by time and wishes he could break free from his body and play with them." I want to experience it with him. Instead, all I see is a grotesque mask and the heavy hand of the filmmaker manipulating the "character" of Benjamin like a toy soldier, moving him from scene to scene: Benjamin as curious youth, Benjamin as roving young man. Yes, I see, but I never feel with him, let alone for him.The only thing that kept me nudging my husband awake was my interest in watching Brad Pitt's make up evolve. I was so disengaged by the action that the only suspense was waiting for Brad Pitt to revert to hottie. Unfortunately, my husband couldn't wait, and just before Brad's actual physique appeared, we tiptoed out of the theater, feeling older by the minute, but grateful that we had opted to regain what little time we had left.We felt cheated. I had opened my heart and mind, and I felt I had been forcefed tedious, obvious, and morbid chunks of "wisdom" and "poignancy" that I feel we as humans already get. No one who has experienced youth or advancing age cannot get what it all means, and how bittersweet it all is. What I wanted was to see something magic and true unfold. Fantasy can show us truths in ways that realism cannot. I didn't feel the magic, I didn't feel transported, I didn't learn a lesson of the heart. I whiled away the minutes wondering what was so funny about Benjamin being unfairly mistaken for a pedophile. I wondered what Hurricane Katrina was going to do to the hospital when it hit. I wondered why no one objected to a black woman in those times raising a white son. I wondered whether the concession clerk had mistakenly sold me decaf instead of regular. I truly began to speculate about the nature of the passing of time, and why it was passing so terribly slowly.In reading descriptions of the second half the movie, I realize that, while not getting to see Cate and Brad in their prime was disappointing, to have stayed for the second half would only have been more disappointing. I don't ask for movies to feed me Hallmark sentiments. I am tough; I can take whatever message is delivered. I just don't see how the distracting medium of this film does justice to its message. The artifice fails to take wing. Clearly, others fell under its spell. Wish I could have, but it left me cold and resentful.</fullReview>

He is the primary actor, and the biggest name in that garbage movie, but his name is nowhere mentioned. What lesbian wrote the info page? I would also state that the acting was very bad, wannabe period actors, and the plot of an old guy reversing in age to infancy for 2 1/2 long hours, trying to make a weak plot last that long is ridiculous. Knock it down to one hour, and hire some successful writers, and get a better director, and you might have a watchable movie. The intention behind this crappola movie, was to inspire couples to soak up the period romance, and be in envy. Don't waste your money on this bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The (2008) **** (out of 4) David Fincher's latest tells the story of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), a man who ages backwards with various consequences throughout his life. If Forrest Gump was about a simple man doing extraordinary things then Button is a extraordinary man doing simple things. This was the last of the five Best Picture nominees for me to watch and I must admit that going into the movie the entire storyline left me rather skeptical to say the least. I really wasn't sure what to expect since the film sounded like Forrest Gump 2 and while the two films share a lot in common this one here is remarkable enough on its own to really pack a terrific punch. Button doesn't do anything overly special in his life except live and fall in love and these simple things are what makes the film so memorable. Clocking in at close to three-hours I must say that I hoped the movie would keep going as not once did it feel overlong or as if the story was running out of things to say. I think the most interesting thing is that director Fincher really paces the film in a way to where the viewer can see Button's life unfold but at the same time have the viewer wonder what they would have done under the same circumstances. The way Button learns to live and love makes for plenty of great drama as well as plenty of laughs but that the same time it's quite remarkable at how touching and uplifting all of it is. The special effects in the film are also quite remarkable because there never take away from the story that's going on. The are various effects being used with the CGI looking great in recapturing the look of the 1920's and 1930's. The real special effects come in how they get Pitt to look like a child, an old man and back to a kid. The visual effects used here, and I'd be lying if I said I understood them, are quite remarkable to look at but again, what's most remarkable is that they don't take you out of the story. A lot of credit also has to go to Pitt who turns in another great performances. One can only imagine what was going through his head as he tried to come up with the various emotions that would go into a role like this. I mean seriously, how does one prepare to have the body of a 80-year-old man but the mind of a baby? Is there some special class to take about having the brain of an 80-year-old yet the body of an infant? Pitt nails everything his character goes through and that includes the terrific vocal work that he must tackle throughout the film. The supporting players, Julia Ormond, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton and Taraji P. Henson all deliver excellent supporting work but there's no question that the film belongs to Pitt. Some might balk at the film saying life doesn't work this way and perhaps that's true but a lot of the film is a fantasy but one written so close to human nature that it's not hard to imagine what you see is set in a reality. If I could have changed anything about the film it would have been how the story is told as Blanchett's character is on her death bed going back through a diary of Button's. I think the story could have been told straight but this is just a minor issue. When the credits finally started I couldn't help but feel incredibly moved by what I had just seen and this is certainly one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then a film is made which, encompasses every aspect of film-making. A great story, (with a plot), solid characters, a thorough explanation of events, all of which culminate to a finale which is appropriate for everything have just seen. Of course, this is in addition to a bit of humor scenes, dramatic scenes, even death scenes.This film reminded me so much of Forrest Gump, which I absolutely admire with all respect. It used the same pacing, same type of storyline, mixed with an amazing score, and breath taking scenery. The characters reflected Forrest Gump as well. Of course not exactly the same but, very similar. Brad Pitt's character was born with a significant set back, which he had to deal with his entire life people saw him as being old and they treated him in the same way, just as Forrest Gump was seen as being stupid, so they treated him as if he was stupid. Both Benjamin Button and Forrest Gump had girls the were amorously engaged with. In this case instead of Jenny, it was Daisy played by the lovely Kate Blanchett. In addition to all of that, their was his little "tour of duty" on a Tug Boat. He saw some time in WWII, and his Capitan, Capitan Mike was killed, this is all very similar to Forrest in Vietnam, and Lt. Dan. This all happened while this girl that he has "loved" since childhood, ran off and lived her adventurous, yet promiscuous life, and only after suffering dearly does she return to the one she loved. Daisy does this, in much the same way that Jenny did it in Forrest Gump.All in all, this film was spectacular. This is a movie however, that like Forrest Gump is difficult to mass produce, and therefore it stands the test of time. Benjamin Button will be a movie that will be seen, comfortably, by families for decades. It's a story that is a great lesson for children, and a bit of wisdom on the part of the adults. I believe that everyone should approach this film with an open heart, and the mind of child.I highly recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely does a film really make a person think about himself, his life, and his philosophies. Some movies simply provide a brief escape from reality -- entertainment and nothing more. Other films raise awareness on issues, or call people to action. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of those rare films that can inspire, teach, and entertain and it's one of the best films of this year.The movie is based on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and follows the unique life of Benjamin Button, a man born with the physiology of an old man. As he grows in age, Benjamin's appearance becomes younger -- he is life actually unfolds in reverse. This gives him an interesting perspective on life, allowing him to see the world and the people around him in ways that no one else can.Benjamin Button is an epic story that takes us through many episodic moments involving the people and the places that surround Benjamin. There are no traditional "bad guys" in the film. No discernible conflict that weaves its way through the story. Just moments. Moments that come and go, but that make lasting impressions upon Benjamin and the audience as well. What it teaches is that life is fleeting, that things change, and that "you never know what's coming for you." Benjamin has to deal with all of these issues. He has to learn that death is part of life. He has to overcome his own disabilities. He has to make tough decisions that affect him and others. The film is deep, philosophical, and moving, and even after the last frame fades away, its themes resonate in the mind.The movie's look and feel is as grand as its subject matter (and running time too -- nearly 3 hours). The cinematography is rich in color, each tone and palette supporting the needs and moods of a particular scene. Pacing is often a problem in the early stages of the film. Some moments seem too drawn out. Some of the dialog and acting seems too melodramatic. Some of the gags are overdone. However, the last act of the film moves very quickly. Perhaps this was done on purpose, for in real life, time seems to move quicker as we grow older.Overall, this is a powerful film that will take you on a wide range of emotion and will also take you on a journey of self reflection.Read more at http://FrameRate.blog.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rather long film, but I thought, mostly enjoyable. The story is pretty thin, so don't expect any epiphanies, but it was a very well-crafted flick. The makeup and computer enhancements were really amazing. I especially enjoyed the first half of the movie where Benjamin was still "young" and the actor who was playing the role had his head supplanted by a computer-inserted version of Brad Pitt's (who is made up to look like he's 70-somethihng). It was kinda cute seeing an withered old-man with a young boy's sensibilities and innocence.So, anyway, go expecting a sorta fairytale for adults, but don't expect any heavy "message", though it does try to convey one. The message is just a little too vague and lightweight to really communicate. Do expect to be blown away by the sets, makeup and special effects, as they are really amazing. And expect a fluffy, mostly meaningless, just about pointless diversion. It's fun, though a tad long...</fullReview>

You know, where all mysteries and problems of life have simple and simplistic answers.To be fair the concept is interesting, if not original, (The Once and Future King and Slaughterhouse Five come to mind) but can not sustain the film. There are few decent moments in the film and at times it seems to try for a magic realism that might have worked. However, the swell of the dramatic music and explicit narrator explanation of such moments show how well the filmmakers know their intended audience.It's not my cup of tea but if you like Forrest Gump type of movies you will like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mild case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Benjamin Button's life unfolding on screen is like watching a reverse process of sunset. Wouldn't that be "sunrise"? You may ask. No, it is not sunrise, it is a reverse sunset. What exactly does it mean then? That's the question that got me scratching my head upon the moment the credit started rolling on the screen.Mystically affected by a giant clock that was built by an agonizing father who wish to turn back time so his son would not have died in WWI, Benjamin was born with a rare condition. He was born a dying old man who would then grow younger and younger everyday. Does this unique ability offer Benjamin any special perspective on life? Well, one can not really tell as Benjamin pretty much lived the same way like you and me, except the apparent anomaly noted above. His uniqueness or weirdness was rather well accepted by everyone he encountered. People treated him absolutely like any other human being, sometime even better. Following the same line of complaint, everybody got along surprisingly well from early 20's all the way to present time. Consider the racial tension, war time and economical depressions throughout the era, the movie's fairy tale like peaceful setting makes me feel rather disconnected from the time and space it was trying to depict.In the early part of this film, looking oddly like a well behaved and well dressed Gollum, our Benjamin mostly sit quietly an observer. He's more like a senile old man than a reckless child with an old man's body. He pretty much persisted in that way throughout the rest of the film, never angry, never overly joyful, and never showed any true anguish, conflicts or depression, nor did he showed any fear. He pretty much accept life with a tired smile and life pretty much treated him the same way. Such complacency nullified any dramatic undertone that the director may try to paint.The second part of the movie was driven by the love story between Benjamin and his childhood friend Daisy. Though know her since very young age, Benjamin's life was pretty much parallel to her until they collide in midpoint, at conveniently ripe age for love.Now, the story of Benjamin's life was told by the narratives from hospital bed ridden old Daisy and her daughter's reading of Benjamin's dairy. I don't know why director chose to tell the story this way. It never added anything to the story. As matter of fact, it completely ruined any surprises and fail to draw emotional response from viewer by way of the unknown twist and turns of the love story. Because from the very early on, we already know that this old woman is Daisy who must be a significant part of Benjamin's life, they must have fallen love with each other and they must have spent big chunk of their lives together. This really had taken away the effect of the love story between the two on audiences.After the high point of the relationship between Benjamin and daisy, the movie pretty much proceed like a receding tide, there are some spots of minor waves here and there, but mostly, Benjamin fades into obscurity.This movie, like Benjamin's eventful yet oddly emotionally bland life, can be likened to a peaceful sunset in reverse. It is not quite a sunrise, because though Benjamin grows younger, he ages mentally pretty much the same way like rest of us. This special gift of reverse aging doesn't seem to award him any special wisdom nor give him any dramatically different perspectives on life. His life is pretty much void of any conflicts. Things come and go quietly. Nothing on the screen really stirs up a big storm though Benjamin had been through plenty of storms throughout his life and eventually came out all unharmed and hardly even bothered. Because of this, I considered the movie somewhat a disappointment because the it failed to fulfill the potential of the unconventional premise of the source material.There are few points to note, though they are never really fully fleshed out. Benjamin seems to have a very keen sense of the causal effects of time and events. At certain key points of movie, he's able to reconstruct a seemingly random event from the perspective of an agnostic determinism. Upon investigating a little deeper, I realize that Benjamin, though age reversely, did not actually live life reversely. Therefore, the perspective came rather unnaturally, forced and out of place, especially the sequence proceeding the third encounter with Daisy. (I shall not spoil any plot).From the technical point of view, this movie deserves a sound applause. From the music score, set design, special effects and the cinematic, they are all well polished and skillfully executed. The make ups and the facial special effects is extremely well done consider that this movie would not be possible at all without it. The facial special effects can be a little distracting from time to time, but it is still among the best I've seen in Hollywood.Overall, it is one of the better movies in 2008 though failed to fulfill its full potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benjamin Button is a stunning triumph if you judge it on its special effects alone. Simply great. Make-up, CGI, attention to historical detail etc -- great.While the story is a very intriguing one the actual execution is good, not great - the performances are fine, but the whole project doesn't reach the heart as one would wish.I am not saying for a moment that you shouldn't watch Button, it is entertaining - but, it is not a GREAT film, I am pleading that major studio films be prepared to make their films more challenging or charming; there is a severe lack of both brains and, more seriously, charm here (Gump which this loosely resembles had oddles of charm) : the result is just too bland and most of all it lacks charm to be great.It will almost certainly win Oscars for its effects and make-up (Or perhaps TDK will take that? It should win for costuming - excellent. But it should not win for Best Picture.In conclusion: the look and design of production are not enough if at the end of it all of it leaves us unmoved.</fullReview>

Now after seeing this movie, I know what it is like to watch a movie and see people trying to act like they care about each other. There is just nothing between Pitt and Blanchett. The two leads in this story are incredible actors and bring much to their craft. It seems the lack of chemistry is more in the direction of the movie and ineptness of taking the story to a level that moves you. The cinematopography is nice and the soundtrack is average. There are some points in the movie that they try to convey but they come across as just so-so. Not the epic, this movie is being portrayed as being. I like the premise of the story but the movie fails to capture me emotionally, and please there is not the slightest bit of similarity between this and "Forrest Gump". It is not fair to compare one story against another so that each can stand on it's own. However you might see and love it. If that is the case, enjoy!

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is about a man born with unusual complications who later goes on to lead a normal life, but his unique condition may come back to haunt him and he must deal with that as he seeks work and falls in love. I was overall quite disappointed with this film. After seeing how many awards and nominations it has earned, I figured I would really like this story, but it left me with much to be desired. Technically the film is very well made with great makeup, sets, cinematography and visuals. I also liked the overall visual style and the period piece settings as well. The acting from the entire ensemble cast was also quite good, so I guess my main problem lies with the film's screenplay. I thought the first half of the film was fascinating and really quite involving and unique. I was actually quite intrigued about what would happen to this character in the second half of the film and that is where I was disappointed. Whereas, I felt the first half of the film to be quite interesting and have a good pace to it, I could not say the same for the second half. To me an original and intriguing idea just used many old Hollywood clichés and story lines and for me the film really started to drag. Normally, I do not have a problem with films with a longer running time and if I am really enjoying said film the time goes by really quickly for me, but this film had a longer running time and it was dragging for me and I was getting quite impatient for it to end. Not to mention that the second half of the movie was very sappy and melodramatic to the point of being ridiculous. It's one of those films that tries so hard to leave you with a lasting emotion, that it actually tries too hard and goes overkill with overly sad music and situations. I have nothing against sad movies, or even crying at a film, but when the film feels so forced on the viewer like this, it just does absolutely nothing for me. I wasn't heart warmed, or deeply saddened. I was just basically bored and ready to leave the theatre. If the second half of the film had been quite as well written, or original as the first half I could definitely see this film winning many awards and getting tons of praise, but as it currently stands I think it is just an okay film that could have been a lot better. Still this is just my opinion and others seem to love this film, so you the reader have to make up your own mind over the movie, but for me it just didn't hold up as well and resulted in another typical Hollywood film released at Oscar time hoping for a nomination, but with nothing new, or original. Too bad because it showed such promise.</fullReview>

My excitement dropped a little as i wasn't sure he could pull it off but boy was I wrong. The cinematography in this film was beautiful with the New Orleans backdrops and other areas, the story was very touching and sad with moments of great comic relief, the special effects were very well done as each age of Benjamin was recognizable as him but not overly done as you sit there thinking why does brad Pitt have a baby's body. This is also by far Brad Pitt's greatest acting achievement as he embody's the character and shows true emotion throughout with his subtle glances or facial movements. Overall this film is very highly recommended because in a film like this i don't know how much more you could ask for.</fullReview>

However "fresh" and "light" the intentions, all of the anecdote's squeezable curiosity - mostly on the visual side - dries up well before either Pitt or Blanchett reach the acting age, while the tenuous sketch has to drag along for another ninety minutes, weighed down by platitude after platitude about "Life Twists" and "Fate Tricks", till it's prematurely buried with the customary Southern grace and a sermon somewhere in the Fifties - and still one reel to go. Adulthood can be dull and unsurprising, but the artistic rendering of it should not. The failure is even greater if you have lavished talents on capturing the uniqueness of human existence - and on the backdrop of Great History, no less - to the effect of telling the same old story in the same old way. Memory isn't a cliché. Go Katrina!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - or several sentences on Viagra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Completely in the spirit of my expectations the probably most anticipated premiere for the winter turned out to be just the next disappointment. I've been always surprised at the abilities of some people to tell short and not especially full of matter stories for extremely long time. If a story encompasses a whole human life, is it absolutely necessary to tell it over the same time span? After 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' I'm absolutely sure that the redundant accents on the completely uninteresting daily routine of the main character are no longer trademark of the untalented, working with low funding, inexplainably pretentious 'artists', who think that a three hours long scene, depicting a hay chewing cow, is the ultimate form of cinematographic art.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is based on several sentences (including the title) of an otherwise good short story, stuffed with Viagra (yes, it does go on for hours), and turned by Eric Roth into a FrankenForestGump, completely devoid of the humour, the solid content and the wonderful special effects of the original he wrote and Robert Zemeckis directed.The commonality with the 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald is quite bleak and unpersuasive and I can't help but wonder why. Even the main concept of a rejuvenating person is twisted (again, why?) - in the short story Benjamin Button (depicted by Brad Pitt) is born physically and mentally developed as an old man (he can speak barely a few hours after being born) and his rejuvenation is also both physical and mental. In the movie he is born with an old man's body, reminding the one of the master jedi Yoda, and with the mental development of a new-born, and only is getting younger. And that's it. If the sight of a rejuvenating Brad Pitt riding a bike is enough to keep you almost for three hours in the theater - this movie is for you. I was expecting (probably for the last time) something more of David Fincher and Co.To conclude: visually appealing, but annoyingly and groundlessly dragging and overextended. The acceptable acting of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett is held hostage by the weak screenplay, based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story barely enough to pass as an adaptation. The movie is filled to the brim with horribly pointless and stereotypic dialogue and lacks any hook or at least some attempt for a plausible character development. On top of that there is an irritating nasal overacted voice-over. Instead of watching something that doesn't contain anything you haven't seen before, just read the story again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film of 2008; an instant classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually, the film is absolutely breathtaking. Fincher is no stranger to strong visuals and all of his movies feature absolutely stunning cinematography. As on his previous works, on Benjamin Button, Fincher works with a cinematographer mostly known for his work in music videos and commercials. Claudio Miranda, who also worked as a gaffer on almost all of Fincher's previous films but who hasn't worked very much as cinematographer on feature films, delivers absolutely breathtaking work on this film ? it is definitely the best-looking and most gorgeously shot movie of the year, and a definite shoo-in for any cinematography awards, including the Oscar. With Fincher, you know that every single element of the visual language is carefully planned; from lenses to variations in aperture to depth of field to wonderful compositions to the best and most stunningly beautiful and amazing use of lighting in any film this year, using a combination of lighting temperatures, from hot and warm to cold and somber; creating sharp contrasts on the one hand and soft, lush glows on the other; sometimes bathed in light and sometimes dark and gloomy, from various sources including both superficial and natural, in-frame light. Visually, the film is nothing less than a work of art, and is one of the best looking films I've seen recently. And the fact that it was all shot digitally on the new Thompson VIPER camera, the same one Fincher used on Zodiac, makes it even more impressive, because it's easily the best-looking digital photography I've seen yet.But there's so much more! While the film is undeniably rich in every way possible, much of its vibrancy derives not only from its visual prowess but also mainly from its impeccable story. The basic premise itself is so wondrously simple it can almost too easily slip into being taken for granted: A man is born at the age of 80 and ages backwards. It's a mind-bending concept that, in the film, is treated not much as a shocking anomaly but is almost taken for granted, and generally seems widely accepted. This basic idea is the foundation of the film, but it is also one of the only things the movie has in common with the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story it is based on. The bulk of the film's content comes from the brilliant, exceptional mind of Eric Roth, who is by far one of the best screenwriters working today and who has delivered deep, fascinating, incredible work on multiple occasions in the past. The most prominent of these earlier screenplays is his Oscar-winning Forrest Gump, and his Benjamin Button script has much in common with the former screenplay. Both feature whimsical characters with a unique condition, a condition that dictates their perception and experience of events as they make their way forward through time and history. Also, both feature a love story that lasts throughout the ages, over the years and years of the story. Finally, both films seem to feature a similar kind of attitude and nature to them: a quirky, wonderful combination of humour on the one hand, deep and profound drama and romance on the other, and intricate character development on the third. Its brilliant, unique, imaginative and wonderful fantasy-element concept of a man aging backwards; grand, encompassing scale and broad themes of undying love and life are what make it a good screenplay; but what makes it a great screenplay is Roth's impeccable attention to detail. He provides us with wonderfully well-developed main characters and lays out the foundations of their strange but wonderful romance, but every one of the supporting characters in the film also has a unique, terrifically well-developed personality: from Mr. Gateau, to Queenie and Tizzy, to Captain Mike to Elizabeth Abbott, Roth provides every single one of the characters that Benjamin encounters along his journey with a distinctive personality, and it is that very element that makes the film so worthwhile.The phrase "instant classic" gets thrown around a lot, but in any given year I can only think of a handful of films that fit that description. Earlier this year, I would have thought that all was lost, and except for the two beacons of light from the summer, The Dark Knight and WALL-E, it seemed like 2008 wouldn't be remembered for anything else. Although the last few months have produced a slew of good films, the one that will be most remembered in years to come, and looked back upon as a classic, will be The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This movie has it all: humour and drama, strong and deep emotions, harsh sequences and delightful ones, a sweeping, epic romance, quirky characters, thrilling scenes and tranquil ones; the acting is top notch, the directing is flawless, the production value and cinematography are second to none, and the story is one of the best, most unique and delightful of any film this year, delivering a powerful and heartfelt message about the meaning of love and life. David Fincher has long been considered one of the best directors working today, and with Benjamin Button he delivers us the most dramatically and emotionally accomplished film of his career. Brad Pitt, another illustrious individual, also delivers the best work of his remarkable career. All in all, Benjamin Button is the perfect example of an outstanding entertainment, and while I still have a few more films on my list to see, overall I think it's safe for me to say that in my opinion, Benjamin Button is the best film of 2008.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little long, reminds me of Forest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea for the story is alright. Benjamin Button is born old and grows younger. Mentally, he ages normally, like any boy would. Physically he grows up from an infant to a full grown man, while growing younger in appearance. The acting is good as well. However, the show is about three hours long and a feels drug-out. I was getting restless for it to end. The movie reminds me of Forest Gump; the story of a unique person's life and experiences over the years. But, it's not quite Forest Gump caliber. There is more plot to the story than the simple narration of Benjamin's life, however. His story is told through his diary, as read to an old lady on her death bed in the hospital, by her daughter. What her connection to Benjamin is the story that slowly unfolds over the course of the movie. It becomes pretty clear where it's going halfway through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forest Gump with Progeria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't a single plot point in this pig that doesn't correspond directly to "Forest Gump." The best imagery was also stolen from "Gump". Those deep south accents were too charming to lose so Fincher just moved the bulk of the action over a state or two. Instead of "Life is like a box of chocolates, You never know what you're gonna get" there is "You never know what's comin for you" or something like that. It really doesn't matter. Instead of a floating feather we are given a fluttering hummingbird and balloon for good measure. Fincher moved the story back a few decades so instead of the Viet Nam war we have WW2. Instead of shrimp boat we have a tugboat. There is the sudden unexpected windfall. And at the core is the on again, off again relationship with the wild, "damaged goods" childhood sweetheart. Of course the star crossed lovers finally get together long enough to conceive a child but, tragically, one of them abandons the other all too soon. Etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum. Brad Pitt's credibility wears off as he is slowly stripped of his make up. The epilogue feels like a United Way commercial. However, overall the production is glossy and visually well constructed. Usually I will give a film at least a 5-7 if the technical aspects are as good as these. But I was so appalled I am reluctant to give it any stars at all. The only reason I sat through the whole 2 hours and 46 minutes is so I could discuss how bad this really is. A friend defended "Button" by stating that this movie is "like 'Magnolia'. You either love it or you hate it." I disagree. I hated "Magnolia" but at least it had an original script. David Fincher's cred is spent as far as I am concerned. I can't believe he got away with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was "good." Yes. It won a couple of Oscars. But it wasn't that good. First, it was too long! And it was so boring! They added the Hurricane Katrina plot to try to make the movie more interesting. It was great to see Taraji P. Henson play a different type of role. She did not act like a sassy woman in this movie, but a warm loving mother. This is a movie about an old man who became younger. It seems like Benjamin was very strange as a very old toddler and a very young senior citizen. The only time when he was normal was when Brad Pitt played the role of him. I finally found some plot in the movie when I discovered that Daisy's daughter Caroline was Benjamin Button's daughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie - I am a fond reader of FSF. The beginning started well, but It was long, and it felt long. Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett were great. Great story and filming overall. In my opinion Brad Pitt cannot act. He only has 2 speeds; goofy (Thelma &amp; Louise, Ocean's 11, burn after reading) and quiet (Joe Black &amp; this one). Never once did I believe that he was an actual character other than Brad Pitt EXCEPT when he was really old and had lots and lots of make up on and voice was changed. Too bad they couldn't have picked a better lead actor. It was sad and poignant and all that, but disappointed that the movie couldn't add anything to the already good story/premise. Otherwise, it was worth seeing, but I doubt I'll see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the past four days, we have seen four movies. Milk, Australia, Slumdog Millionaire and Benjamine Button. Of the four, the "blockbusters" were the weakest. Both Australia and Button are FAR too long, and pull from previous films for their content and concepts.While I loved the performances of both Pitt and Blanchett, the story is just too long (especially when it was derived from a F. Scott Fitzgerald short story). I wanted it to go somewhere. The "big twist" was telegraphed in a zillion ways. Beautiful faces and places...but not much more to offer.If you have a choice between all of the films out during the holiday season, see Slumdog Millionaire.

		<shortDescription>Should Have Been an Amazing Story but Wasn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horrifying self-realization: Heinlein help me, I went to see a Major Motion Picture Event and a Happy Madison Production (Bedtime Stories) on the same day, and I'm giving them both the same rating (6).This is the MMPE. You can tell because it's nearly 3 hours long, is based on Akshwul Litrachoor (F. Scott Fitzgerald's novella), and stars someone (Mr. Pitt) who is among the dozen people known only by 1st name at supermarket checkout counters everywhere. It's ostensibly about a man who, for no explicable reason, grows older mentally and experientially at the same pace as everyone else while growing younger (from about 70ish) physically. The amazing thing about this is that it's so unamazing. Pitt plays his role in the lowest of keys. For such an unusual person, Benjamin leads a pretty dull and ordinary life. The center of that life, and of the film, is when his middle age overlaps with that of Daisy (Cate Blanchett), and they have upwards of a decade of happiness living together before fate draws them apart again. Huge props to the film for originality and creating a tremendous sense of time and place from 1919 to 2005, but really, nothing in it reached right out and grabbed me. This has not stopped it from being touted for multiple Oscars, so I'm probably in the minority here, but I can't in good conscience tell you "Ya gotta go see it!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't live up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the 3 long hours i spent watching The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I'm afraid I have to conclude I am a bit disappointed.This movie had so much hype surrounding it, and after all those golden globe nominations I thought this movie was really worth-seeing. I was a bit wrong. It is extremely overrated and I honestly expected more from a possibly Oscar-winning movie.The whole movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who ages backwards. We follow him from the moment he was born, and through all his mishaps and adventures and we watch him get younger while everybody else around him gets older.The plot is interesting, and screenplay, I feel was fairly well written but this is NOT best picture material. I feel Doubt should have been substituted with this movie for the best picture golden globe nomination. Even Brad Pitt's performance was fairly average, he has definitely had better. Frank Langella or Leonardo Dicaprio will probably edge him out on the awards. Screenplay and directing do deserve nominations but there are better movies who will probably win. Make-up however was excellent, and they deserve an award for that.As much as I wish the movie goes home empty-handed on January 11th, and on Oscar night, I doubt the Academy will look over this movie, so I'm afraid I will have to endure a disappointing and frustrating Oscar night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitt ages backward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think you can write a spoiler for this movie, because the entire film can be encapsulated in four words: Brad Pitt ages backward.Here's a list of things that made this movie so bad: It was overly sentimental--which is to be expected, considering the screenwriter of Forrest Gump wrote this. You can also see his handiwork in the convenient road signs we have to make sure we all know what year it is. Oh, they're watching The Beatles on Ed Sullivan. See, this is the 60s.The characters all have one trait--Brad Pitt ages backward. Other than that, he's pretty damn boring. Elizabeth likes to swim. Daisy likes ballet. Queeny is a no-nonsense black woman. In the real world, people like this have NEVER existed ANYWHERE.This one's just a matter of taste--CGI SUCKS BALLS. Nobody thinks it looks real, okay? Just go back to putting cartoons in if you're too damn lazy to build something with your hands.Overall, this movie was just very very boring. And it was almost three hours long. It said nothing, and the one slightly interesting thing about it was already exhausted in the trailer: Brad Pitt ages backward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Drawn Out and Lengthy Type Of Torture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look up the word "disappointment" in the dictionary, and you'll find The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button as the definition. Lets get the facts straight. The cast is all star. Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett, and Tilda Swinton. Awesome. And the director is a genius as well, holding Se7en and Zodiac to his name. Awesome again. Yet somehow with all of this talent, the movie ended up being a dry boring torture with no direction. Can someone explain to me how this catastrophe happened?!The Pros: 1.) Beautiful cinematography. As usual, Mr. Fincher really knows how to work the camera to the fullest effect.2.) Brilliant Acting. Even though the dialog is pointless and boring most of the time, the acting none the less is brilliant.3.) Captivating Makeup. Seeing Brad Pitt as an 80 year old baby is quite amazing to see on screen. And seeing him get younger and younger is cool as well. They did a great job with everyone in this.The Cons: 1.) Terrible Narrative. The story cannot stay on track what so ever. Its scattered all across the board, without a clear destination. The film starts at an awkward position, making the viewer feel confused.2.) Horrific Dialogue. The conversations carried on screen are ridiculously extensive without a point for the story. Most of it focuses on characters we the viewers don't really care about. Past love life's, false hopes, remembrances, etc. You want to be interested, but in the end, you just don't care.3.) Worst Narrator Ever. When one thinks of a great narrating voice, people such as Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, and Samuel L. Jackson come to thought. Would you ever consider hiring a mumbling old grandma to do the talking? I think not. Most of the time, you're gonna be trying hard to understand what the heck is being said, and how much your missing out on the story.4.) Lullaby Music. The music is low key mixed in with a darkly lit setting throughout, making it a perfect case of catching some Z's. You're eye lids will get heavy to the sounds of xylophones and bells.5.) Ridiculous Running Length. Don't get me wrong. I love a good drama. There Will Be Blood is one of my favorite movies, and thats basically all talking. But when you make a movie this long, with such little going on, this movie feels like two Titanics together in one. The walls were dripping with sappy estrogen juice throughout. This is a Chick Flick.</fullReview>

From the point of view of the special effects, it was an impressive movie. If only they'd spent as much time on the actual script this might have been quite a movie.This movie is boring. It's boring because of the clockwork way the material is handled, and it's boring because it is way way way too long. There are a few twists in the story, that anyone over the age of 8 should see miles away.This movie is icky. (ok, it's a chick flick). The relationships are handled in a sickeningly sweet way and very little is done to create any truly meaningful characters.spoiler ----spoiler The characters are stupid. They apparently can't add or subtract, otherwise both the main characters would have realized that there was no reason for Benjamin Button to run away. He would have been an adult all through his daughter's childhood.Spoiler end.All in all, I'm sorry I wasted my three hours watching this movie. Rent it and do the cross word puzzle while occasionally glancing up at the screen, you'll enjoy it a lot more than you would watching it in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Brad Pitt Should Stick to Zippers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a book a couple of years ago called "The Confessions of Max Tivoli," about a man who ages backwards. The book was nothing special, a moderate diversion at best, but what it did do well was explore the emotional and psychological conflicts the main character faced as he watched everyone around him -- including his love -- lose their youth while he gained his.That same kind of conflict is the missing ingredient in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," and without it, this wisp of a story doesn't add up to anything. This film is a three-hour journey with a blank slate of a character who doesn't seem to react much to the things that happen to him. Yes, Benjamin Button ages backwards, but the film never establishes how Benjamin's life is any different because of this quirk than if he had aged traditionally. The gimmick offers a lot of excuses for cool special and makeup effects, but otherwise this is just a long and rather boring episodic story that doesn't have anything to say about its characters.It's time for the world to face that fact that Brad Pitt is simply a limited actor, and it's a mistake to put him at the center of any film that relies on a complex performance to make it work. The same thing was wrong with last year's "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," but that film worked despite Pitt's presence, largely because good actors were cast in all of the other roles, and they created interesting characters to compensate for the dull one at the film's center. The same is not so here. The only other actor who gets a meaty role to play is Cate Blanchett, and though she looks lovely, she's simply not given the material with which to create a memorable performance. Taraji P. Henson, who plays Pitt's mother, just does the strong Southern mom routine that Sally Field already created in "Forrest Gump." The best performance comes from Tilda Swinton, who has a tiny role as an enigmatic woman who shares some intimate moments with Benjamin. She was so fascinating that I would rather have left the movie I was watching to follow her story instead. That's never a good sign.It's hard to believe that the David Fincher who made last year's endlessly fascinating "Zodiac" helmed this film as well. While "Benjamin Button" is nowhere nearly as maudlin as it could have been (and probably would have been in someone else's hands), it's downright gloopy compared to Fincher's other works. The sentimentality is not helped by Pitt's thunderous voice over narration that's full of machine-made homilies, the kind that start with phrases like "The funny thing about home is...." or "Sometimes the people that mean the most to us...." The film is as technically accomplished as they come, every scene pretty as a picture. But one wishes that Fincher and company had spent a little less time making their film look nice and more time fleshing out a story that would engage our interest for nearly three hours.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly potential and so disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Titanic could explain the faith of this film, not the movie titanic, but the ship itself. A big production with a lot talent and big names behind it, but not being able to deliver its potentials; it didn't quite transfer its audience where it could have with all its promise and potential.The film was beautifully shot, with amazing lighting and composition. The cinematography was the only thing that could keep one from falling asleep.The premise of the film is of an unusual one, and it begged the question of how it was going to work. I personally thought that this could be a vehicle on delivering a very profound message on life and death. I thought it was going to touch on the absurdities of life and death and the reasons behind our existence. Or maybe touch on how one would appreciate his/her young hood much more if they aged backwards; because who can deny that a man with a young body and the wisdom of an old man could achieve anything that he wants to. But it didn't at all focus on those philosophies about life; instead it was about a very usual and at times boring love story, with all the clichés that we have all heard from our kindergarten teachers when we were 5.The film seemed sappy and sentimental. The only times that it tried to have some sort of message on life and death it ended up being so cliché. Lines like: nothing lasts forever, everyone dies, no one is perfect, all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us, etc? delivered no refreshing outlook on life. Normally movies tend to steal a few clichés and run with it in the hopes of not getting caught but it was surprising how the decision was made to put all those clichés in the film and still the film begged the audience to take it seriously.There was no depth to the main character, Benjamin. In a character driven film like this, the main character's depth and complexity determines the depth and complexity of the film, without it the whole movie would fall flat as it did in this case. It was unclear what Benjamin liked in life, what his passion was, what were his hobbies, what made him happy, what made him sad, etc. his motivations were unclear.At the end of the film, I wondered what his special condition of aging had to do with the film's message and its ultimate goal. I don't think the film would have been that much different if Benjamin was a normal person with no special condition but still went through the same journey. In other words, his special condition didn't add anything profound, as it could have; to the plot other than fooling the audience into thinking they are witnessing a very unique film.The reason behind the film's relatively good reviews could be (beside the hype and Brad Pitt being in it) because the plot seemed interesting and unique enough to get someone to go and check it out. But after walking out of the theater I couldn't help but thinking that what a genius marketing strategy this was to generate all that enthusiasm about a film that delivered nothing new, and something so mediocre that could have been delivered by any other film that comes out on any Friday throughout the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So we all saw the previews and hoped to get something out of this. But the previews could have sufficed for the whole film and in fact would have been better than wasting almost three hours of my time in a terrible excuse for a film. Benjamin Button simply grows up in a pseudo nursing home and he gets younger. People come and go in his life and EVERY single character is so static in this movie.I tell no lie, there is no depth to the characters. There is also no plot to this movie. It is a collection of scenes put together poorly as the transitions between the hospital room and benjamin's life are pretty poor. Probably the best things are the very cheap laughs that get very tired and are really intended for 5 year olds. They are also in bad taste and a display of horrible directing.Funniest of all is that I keep reading of amazing acting but what acting is there to do?!?!?! Benjamin's character simply narrates and rides a bike throughout the movie. If you think this movie will make you appreciate little things and moments and events, it won't. The movie in no way does so and this will be the end of David Fincher's directing career. This is honestly that bad of a film.I am an Avid movie goer and all of the good reviews must come from people paid to say good things about this abomination. PLEASE GO SEE something else. Go see Slumdog Millionaire if you haven't, or Seven Pounds, or Doubt, or Milk.If you ignore this comment, I really think you will regret seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying, imperfect film that desperately needs some trim to tighten pacing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts right off the bat and never let go. Adaptation scripter Eric Roth's story is well-told and the productions values top-notch.But then the logic began to fall apart midway as the pacing become leaden. And it becomes fairly predictable. At one point, as the cross-cutted sequence overlap each scene, I thought the tragedy is about to unfold. Boom, revelation. I deserve a medal for being an armchair psychic.I had to close and grit my teeth as I tried to suspend my disbelief at the ridiculous logic promulgated by the film towards the ending. I know, it's a fantasy -- a literacy fairy tale. I can believe the age reverse - that's already established in the moving beginning.But I cannot get over the fact that the film producers chose to idealize love, romance and sexual relations which is unintentionally funny in terms of farce. The film even glamorizes adultery by rationalizing it, which is a little disturbing to me as a fairly irreligious, apolitical and amoral moviegoer.It's also embarrassing in pretentious attitude. What's with the film scratches and black &amp; white one-take scenes in flashbacks? I know, I know - it conveys silly humor and nostalgia. But we don't need visual splendor to sledgehammer the purpose. There's the awful romantic montage between the two lovers that borders on self-parody reminiscent of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch advertisements. That was ridiculous because we are subject to worshipful images of Brad Pitt mugging in front of the camera to bask in self-adulation of narcissism. While sitting in the darkened screening feeling embarrassed by the string of treacly romantic scenes, I imagine the young female audience patrons sigh erotically with the whispers of "Brad is gorgeous like James Dean!" Even James Dean would roll his eyes in disbelief as he was being given a comeuppance by Brad who sneers condescendingly to the audience "I'm richer and better looking than you" and other patronizing insults with David Fincher's self-satisfied, almost cynical direction. Hollywood has contempt for the audience patrons who made the studios, producers and actors rich in the first place. Why be patronized with self-consciously snooty, glitzy model photo shoot for GQ? Stick to the story, not pretty pictures. I'm sure Terrence Malick smirks in self-depreciation. I thought David's career in directing music and commercial videos is behind him as he establishes his talent in feature film. Yet he slips in the half-assed Calvin Klein homage to the idealized vision of impossibly handsome male masculinity. Artistic self-indulgence is getting darned old because Fight Club's closed since 2000. Also questionable is the character Benjamin's lack of discernible income/employment while being in love with an apparently self-employed woman as a "young James Dean-lite man" who somehow afford to own stylish clothes and ride motorcycles. Maybe he exploited Social Security loophole in the 50's to live high and in style, which amounts to fraud. Chose not to go to "college" or try modeling while working a bunch of crummy minimum wage jobs as shown later in the film, which is ridiculously pitiful.Complaints aside, the cinematography is spectacular that compliments the dark, depressing themes and atmospheric mood, which are of course Dave's trademark styles. The film is well-direct but in some scenes noticeably overdirected. And a few scenes do need trim here and there without losing the meat of the story, because leaner meat in tight pacing to keep the audience's attention steady is the best appetite as food for thought. The final theatrical edits of Titanic and Lawrence of Arabia are impeccable. Even James Cameron had to force himself to cut extraneous scenes that cost millions of dollars to film. David needs to refine his editing sense by knowing the aesthetics of "what is necessary and what is not" without coming off as self-indulgent as Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson. I loved Zodiac because it's reasonably paced with suspenseful tension, but the opposite is true for a mega-budget dramatic work that feels overlong like the last half hour of The Dark Knight for the sake of padding the length to give the impression this is an important work of art without regard for the audience's ability to be attentive as long as the story and pacing are woven perfectly without prompting some to walk out for quick bathroom and refreshment breaks when the film gets "slow". (Run-on sentence intended.)Sorry, but that's the truth. Heed my advice and quit catering to specious indulgence. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has its strength in the first hour, then falls apart as the film reaches the exhausting climax with the touching conclusion of a life. A weak, lamely manipulative ending left me cold after feeling emotions in spite of laughably absurd logic.This film is akin to a self-serious second cousin to Forrest Gump, a well-made but emotionally manipulative and dishonest film. It's undoubtedly fascinating how long it took for the film to come to fruition, but the ultimate outcome is tepid. David is better off making traumatizing, gritty and stylishly adult films because that's where his interest lie instead of a PG-13 Oscar bait film along the line of overlong films that successfully bait sentimental Oscar voting idiots hook, line and sinker. They reject dramatic epics like Zodiac for this kind of "tastes like maple syrup on buttermilk pancakes at Denny's" tripe because they love being manipulated to well up their eyes.** 1/2 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey! Where'd my $9.50 go? And 2.5 hours??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you kidding me with this stuff? My bladder and I were kept captive for 2.5 hours+ on this ridiculously overplayed (and overplayed, and overplayed, ...) exercise of recycled Hollywood "let's be Southern 'cuz it's so 2008" film format. It was Forrest Gump without the story, genuine content, or as another previous opinionite wrote, purpose. I know Brad, Cate, and the rest of the cast meant well, but lil' hint to the director(s): screen people for their ability to consistently portray a true southern accent (let alone narrate it). Let's not even get into the list of intricacies of southern etiquette that were mis-represented. But that's getting too fine-tuned too quickly. If I have to see one more movie with someone at their deathbed recounting an impossibly absurd line of events with an increasingly (false) southern accent, I'm gonna insist plastic bags are handed out when you get your ticket torn. And by the by, next time you look up at the complimentary hospital room TV screen and see a hurricane that fills about 90% of the Gulf of Mexico, get your and your Momma's ass up out of of there instead of lighting a cigarette in the hall (it's 2008 A.D. people, not the 70's). Throwing a Katrina angle on this was cheap, stupid, and poorly done. I'm not sure who the amazing "critics" were who gave this one anything above a D+, but as usual, I'm reminded to trust my instincts instead of their thin, little sails that sail on the Santa Anna winds. P.S. Is there not a single good wig person in Hollywood? The make-up in this thing was uber-cheesy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boring Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me come out and say this, I went into this movie with extremely high hopes. The second trailer simply floored me when I saw it and I worship at the alter this is Fight Club. I'm a big fan of Fincher's previous movies, even Zodiac, which I thought was a good effort but not a great movie. Maybe my high expectations were the reason I wound up dissatisfied with this film, and if that is so then you can call me biased but I walked out of the movie theater today (Christmas) tired and disappointed.The movie itself isn't bad and it's stunning visually. The problem lies in it's run time, the movie is bloated to say the least. Entire subplots including a clockmaker creating a clock that ran backwards and Kate Blanchet's character on her deathbed in New Orleans during the onset of Hurricane Katrina could have been removed entirely. I feel that had this movie ran forty-five minutes shorter I would have enjoyed it more. Run time issues aside the movie was very well done but it failed to hit the emotional notes I was hoping a movie declared by many as one of the best of the year would have. But then again, maybe I went into it hoping for too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night at a sneak preview. This is a gentle, loving film done with a glow of kindness. The scene of the father of the soldier rowing out to see was breathtaking. The story is intriguing, entertaining and a joy to watch unfold. The performances were mostly good, however, Brad Pitt didn't react to specific scenes in ways that were logical or emotionally correct. Cate Blanchett is just wonderful and Taraji Henson is unforgettable. The girls who play Cate's character when younger are breathtaking to watch. This is a lovely film --- yes, it is almost three hours long but it didn't feel like it. And the packed theater audience was totally enthralled the entire time. I so enjoyed the movie and recommend it. The story also shows Hurricane Katrina coming to New Orleans, which we know is where Brad Pitt is working to rebuild the city and raise his family much of the time. Keeping that in mind makes the story even more golden.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it me or is this the most overrated film ever! It started off o.k but boy was the story drawn out over what felt like an eternity, I can honestly say I couldn't wait for the ordeal to be over! The short story was a strange concept that probably belongs in the domain of the TV production, but as an almost 3 hour film it just didn't work. The visuals, locations and make-up used in the were good but all these were let down by a story that should never have been made into a film in the first place! You never get an true insight into the feelings of the main characters, now come on, a guy who was born as an old baby and is "growing" younger, surely he would have faced some deep rooted internal hardships, but all the viewer gets is what's on the surface.All in all a film that starts well, but goes on and on and on, with the viewer waiting, even hoping for something vaguely interesting, or even funny to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curiously boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an arousing concept derived from the novelist, in its play of life and death and the stages of the body from day one to day final, but aside from this ironic concept the movie does nothing for the viewer. I will not defame the cinematographers, the crew, etc, because clearly they are very technically savvy when it comes to their craft. However, there is always a place to lay blame on bad directors for mediocre films. You can tell when a director makes an attempt at stripped down simplicity to evoke a seemingly complicated tale. In the case of David Fincher, it is a lukewarm success. Time and time again, when haven't we seen the recycled incident of an aging and frail parental figure recounting his/her life story?with some shocking secrets I might add(wink, wink). I have nothing against the cliché because it's really not about the tale, but more about the teller telling you the story. The voice over was utterly ridiculous, it felt like a clear condescension, and an all too convenient cinematic devise to link this big mess together. Look at well done voiceovers like in Kubrick's clockwork orange, where there is a feasibility of the protagonist telling the story, and an actively dynamic question between the narrator's truth and the truth you observe on screen. With Button, you have an arbitrary case where you are simply spoon fed the incident, as if I couldn't just sit back and watch the events unfold without them being verbally described. You can tell when a director attempts to masturbate an audience's emotions, and happens to fail in conquering our hearts. The series of events such as the teeny-bopper Benjamin returning home, or his return as a child, are meant to provoke you, but fall short of the punch line and goes on awkwardly silent like a very bad joke. One last note, there is no such thing as a bad actor, only bad directors. Brad Pitt is not a Bad actor, but when he is constantly used as a ticket seller on the basis of his good looks and flesh, then it becomes little more than expensive pornography-which we all enjoy from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have seen this movie in the same day that I've seen the Slumdog Millionaire. In my opinion, the both movies had a similar idea, i.e. to present a story of their heroes, who meet and loose and meet together again, during their lifetimes. Despite the similarities, now I have to say, that the "Slumdog" was an excellently managed moving film, with great story telling, and the creators of the "Benjamin Button" can be only jealous about that. I cannot call their movie otherwise but an expensive junk. It's not only the idea that some person would be growing up by actually getting younger in the physical way. The idea was courageous itself, in any case a good artist could play with it a lot. Nevertheless, it seems to me the film makers lost their courage soon and the result is just that mess. During the film I didn't know if the director wanted us to be chilled, thrilled, if he wanted us to cry (this seems to me the most probabilistic now) or to be teased, or to be scared or if we were supposed to laugh. Casting in the movie was by stars like Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchet, the people doing the make-ups must have had a tough job too. Some scenes of the movie resembled other movies like The Big, Forever Young, Magnolia or even The Blue Lagoon. By the way, it seemed to me that in parts where Cate Blanchet was to play a tender ballet dancer also the cameraman had a tough job, finally shooting this scenes from a big distance and in dark scenes. Cate Blanchet was perfect for playing the character of Katharine Hapburn in the Aviator, the soft tender tiny ballet dancer definitely is not her role. Well, if you have to see this movie, you go, but honestly, I was ashamed to walk out from the projection room in the cinemaplex, where other people could see me, that I was to see the movie like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curious Case of an Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot express how truly magnificent this film is. This is what film-making is all about, pure escapism. You forget reality for two hours and you'll get an amazing masterwork helmed by a genius, written by a visionary and defined by high standard acting. Everything is so right in this film, from the acting, to the vivid cinematography. The directing and writing were beyond excellent. Some people complained about its length and I am not one of them. Believe it or not, I actually wanted more out of it, it is that good but I believe the ending is just as magical the way it is. David Fincher, one of the greatest directors in our current generation takes another risky project and turns it into one of the most beautiful films of recent memory. From Fight Club to Seven and 2007's sleeper Zodiac, the guy has yet to make a bad film. Well, except for Alien 3 but that is nothing but history now. Kudos also to the guys who wrote 'Button', the geniuses Eric Roth and Robin Swicord, their work is simply masterful I wouldn't omit a line from the film. Every second is treasured and wasn't wasted.Brad Pitt has come a long way since Thelma &amp; Louise. The dashing debonair didn't resort to his boyish good looks but instead acts wonderfully. There is a certain charm about him that makes Benjamin an interesting and memorable character. He puts his all and the payoff is grand. Cate Blanchett is just superb as Daisy. No other actress could have portrayed Daisy like Cate did and the chemistry between them is just magic. Taraji P. Henson deserves at least a Best Supporting nod, what she did to Queenie couldn't have been better. Its just amazing. The make-up department deserves a round of applause too, the effects that renders Pitt into an old, frail child were just a thing of beauty. All in all, 'Benjamin Button' is a 2008 masterwork that you can't afford to miss. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a sad tragedy that I had to beg my mother to go see this movie with me. Early this morning, I offered her up to three "benjamins" (after Benjamin Franklin) to go see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and, though she did not take the money, she considered it a steal.The words marvelous, original, delightful, brilliant, decadent, heart-warming yet heart-wrenching, do not even begin to pin down what this amazing tale is all about. With some of the best character development I have ever seen, the almost three-hour long story is most assuredly worth it. At one point, though my bladder was more than full, I was pinned to my chair, desperate to find out what would happen next to the absolutely unique characters.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Benjamin is completely complex and perfect, as is Cate Blanchett's Daisy. The way that they look at each other throughout this entire film assures that they really do love each other as much as F. Scott Fitzgerald intended, which is the entire purpose of acting, I think.The plot and the message of the movie are simply impossible to put into words, but I suppose the closest thing is this: "You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went; you can swear and curse the fates - but when it comes to the end, you have to let go."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exactly like Forrest Gump in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They were written by the SAME PERSON!!! So, each being similar in subject matter and theme, the two films play out almost identically.The overall plot structure in Benjamin Button is the same as in Gump. The film opens with a very old woman in the hospital telling her life story to her daughter, in the same way that Forrest sits on the bench and tells his. She has in her possession the journal of Benjamin Button and when the daughter starts reading each section the action cuts back to then, the overall story being one about one humble man experiencing the 20th Century in the United States while he and his heart's desire cross paths over and over again. I guess it works well enough as a framing device, but in terms of entertainment, Button is just not as fun and Forrest Gump. Both films try to add humor with a bunch of non-sequitur stuff, like, for example, an old man describing all the times he was struck by lightning (accompanied by intentionally ghetto film of it, because apparently someone followed him around his whole life and filmed him and just HAPPENED to film him when he was struck), and its just not funny after a while. This film is more intent on moving you with images and movement than Forrest Gump was.This is a really long movie, and its mostly enjoyable but MAN it drags in certain spots. Also, it spends its greatest moment 5 minutes in, in which a scene from WWI is played backwards (you've probably seen this in the trailers). When i saw that i thought that nothing could possibly be better, and i was right.The effects and the films look are great though. They did a great job making brad pitt look really old, but also making him look 15 years younger. The same goes for cate blanchett but i think that was just traditional makeup on her, instead of the fancy computer stuff on brad.Overall, it was OK. I felt really weird being there in the theater because the last hour is a pure brad pitt ogling-fest, but looking back the effects and detail in the movie are really great and make it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching the movie, the first thing that crossed my mind was whether the trailer was getting me worked up and excited for something that was going to be overrated. However, I'm glad David Fincher proved me wrong, especially since I had to sit in the same seat for about 3 hours needing the toilet! The reason why I loved this movie so much wasn't because of how amazing the actors were, or the fact that Brad Pitt was turning young and disgustingly fit again, or that it had beautiful ballet, but because it held a lot of meaning.The simplicity of this movie is what made it so breathtaking. It proves that love can overcome many things, to be grateful for what we've achieved, and to know that it's never too late to achieve more things in our life no matter how old or young we are. At the end of the day, we all end up in diapers and we all die, we just have to make the most of the moments in our life, not the minutes, just as the tagline says.Brad Pitt played his role flawlessly, and I couldn't help but just watch in amusement this old man acting like just any other curious child. It's the little things that makes this movie so beautiful, and the little things that Brad Pitt shows the audience really portrays this playful character trapped in an old mans body.I recommend this to anyone willing to sit down for 3 hours and accept the small things in life we take for granted, or the big things in life we once achieved and never stopped to be grateful for either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "Benjamin Button" has a certain pretense which you realize after an analysis. It is slow, contemplative, with numerous promising setups and sub-plots. You attempt to grasp symbolism, hypothesize what could a "great new ideas" be derived from here. You think of cinematic experience, special effects, montage, mise-en-sc?ne. You wait anticipating all of this tie up at some point and create a catharsis. Finally, it ends, and you are left with nothing. All the stories, scenes, episodes ? everything is left unresolved, childishly trivial, superficial and weak. No ideas, no character development, no thought. Many story lines, such as daughter, learning of her real father's precarious condition, her mother, dying of cancer, the hospital scenes in the onset of Katrina in New Orleans (?). What's missing is 9-11, Afghanistan and Iraq wars and election of Obama. I started from detail analysis of all sub-plots, but had to give up finding this exercise utterly exhausting.This is pretentious small 'moving pictures' which only be remembered for the utter inaptness of directorial and screen writer's work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again ti's the Season for Oscar contenders and as history teaches us to win an Oscar a movie doesn't have to be profound, original or even interesting.This is the case with "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". This movie follows a life of an orphan born an old man whose "life is like a box of chocolates". Benjamin discovers his humanity interacting with various characters and growing younger in the process - that's the original part.The premise is interesting but the movie isn't. It borderlines on plagiarism of Forrest Gump. Thank God Brad Pitt is good looking, and for all the ladies, he grows younger as the movie wears on - 3/4 in, all the Cougars in the Theater want to rip his shirt off, which aging Cate Blanchett does after little hesitation.As for Forrest Gump plagiarism, this movies has a: - southern, disabled man - lifelong, unfulfilled love who comes around at the end - boat and a boat captain - war - some other stuffAll in all if you're taking your wife or a girlfriend to the movies go and watch "The Slumdog Millionaire" and wait for this to come out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how they managed to take such an unusual and interesting topic, with countless opportunities for interesting plot development, conflict and excitement, and turn it into 3 hours of dull, drab, disjointed episodes and characters that add nothing to the story and cause no major difficulties or consequences for them main character. Scene after scene I just kept asking myself, what the hell was the point of that? If there's anything curious about this movie it definitely isn't Benjamin who turns out to be, despite having a disorder that should have the scientific community in a frenzy, a complete and utter bore. He meanders aimlessly through every scene barely expressing an emotion greater than mild excitement while spouting trite, corny phrases like "I was just thinking about how nothing lasts...and what a shame that is..." Is that supposed to be deep? I mean really.Really, the curious thing about this story is a number of other things besides the main character.-for instance, how can a movie about a black woman in the 20's/30's raising a white baby outright ignore any consequences that would have come from the racist attitudes of the time...especially in the south! yet the movie doesn't even mention or acknowledge this. preposterous.-another thing that was very "curious" about this movie was how nobody seemed very surprised at all at his condition. he doesn't even so much as get harassed about it. the guy is the ultimate freak of nature and all anybody can ever comment on is how good he looks as he's getting younger?? give me a break! why isn't he being poked and prodded and taken apart by the scientific community? WHY ISN'T ANYBODY STUDYING THIS OR EVEN BEING INTERESTED IN IT AT ALL. ack.-curiosity number 3: something about a tugboat.......then something about an affair with a swimmer....wait what does this add to the plot? oh right, NOTHING. again and again the films creators seemed to purposely avoid any potentially juicy plot twist to focus on things that are mundane, boring, and pointless.and I'm not even going to go into the nonsensical mechanics of his aging disorder, but ultimately I ended up wondering what the point of it all was, as the whole movie didn't seem to have one. the storyline appeared to be devoid of cause an effect which is an essential part of a good story.for not evoking any emotions other than boredom and mild confusion, for having a weak plot that's full of holes and lacks any real meaning, and for giving us a visual treatment that's either drab or just plain ugly, this movie fails on all levels. I wish I could give it a zero.</fullReview>

Why not have a movie about how angels marry we would have about the same interest. The movie is technically brilliant and has great acting, so are all the Star War movies ...Technical brilliance is evident in most movies today, so is good acting Hey Hollywood a good movie must first have a STORY . Something to say that is meaningful to our existence. What a waste of good actors and talent. Fincher must be the new David Lynch...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated pretentious time-waster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it won 3 Oscars, but those were for Art Direction, Make Up and Visual Effects. So all the people that feel guilty they fell asleep, were bored or during the viewing did their manicure and planned their holiday: even the 'real' experts realized that it maybe looks OK, but should not be rewarded for content or entertainment value. I think the movie was made so irritatingly long to be sure everyone falls asleep and then decides that they must have missed a masterpiece.It took my ultimate willpower to keep staring at irrelevant scenes (someone that our hero has met once comes by to say he leaves forever. "I will miss you, bye" and there he goes and never comes back .... another minute filled) and the pretense that every meeting the main character has is with 'meaningful people' that have a 'deep bond' with him while constantly nothing meaningful happened and all conversations were as shallow as in a porn flick.Somebody had a nice idea (a life going backwards) and then forgot he can not write and made a whole long boring story about it desperately trying to impersonate John Irving (Life according to Garp, Hotel New Hampshire). The difference is that in Irvings work funny things happen, and weird scenes take place. Not things that soap writers would kick out of their scenarios as being too cliché.A waste of talent (the actors), a waste of a potentially nice story, a waste of money and surely a waste of my time.PS What sad people you Americans have become that the movie is rated PG 13 for, amongst other reasons, smoking! Does that mean all movies from the 20th century are PG 13 now? And all the cartoons that have smoking in it? And will people that smoke in the street and are seen by someone below the age of 13 be accused of molesting a minor? Keep fighting for your right to own guns and burn petrol, and keep forbidding people to do what only bothers themselves (smoking, drugs, loving somebody from the same sex) and then wonder why your society is going bonkers and you have a weekly random killing spree on your TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Fincher, Seven, The Game, Fight Club. I love David for how he has inspired me in the past and that I will not forget. I write this review only out of frustration over what seems to be be, unfortunately, a story that is not new to me. I've witnessed the fall of so many artist's over the years into mediocrity that is painful to for me to witness and it plagues my mind indefinitely. I hate people that don't take the time to watch and listen to what they are viewing before making these statements but I have thought long and hard before even thinking of writing this down. Of course, I don't know what Daid Fincher was thinking when he made this film. I think to myself, "Was it the influence of the producers in his ear, the promise of money, or pure experimentation with the notion of making a hammed up piece of redundant slop like this to see how it felt to be a true official Hollywood A-lister untouchable, or purely a bad decision from the start due to the downside of fortune?" but I refuse to believe that Fincher is not a great artist!I don't need to say much about the ingredients of this film because I think you have already guessed how I see it. All I can say is-David Fincher, Remember me? Im the outsider in this world searching for meaning everyday that I wake up to a commercial world wanting only what it can gleam from my unfulfilled soul. I will continue to carve out my place in this world through my art. Will you join me again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit long but a great date movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by recalling my favorite moment on the screen. Cate Blanchett dances to a moon lit gazebo as the young dancer while the somewhat elderly Brad Pitt looks on. She's talking a mile a minute as the blossom just ready to be picked up. But Pitt decides not to pick, the time is not right. Very bittersweet.There's lot of bittersweet moments in this movie and it does run too long. For too long, we see Pitt as the aged kid. Best moment here for me is getting his first drink and first lay on the same night.The set of circumstances that accumulate to Cat getting hit by a car and he sees her in the hospital. The two of them about the same age making love in a sail boat and pausing to watch the Beatles on TV while setting up house.For me, the Benjamin Button character could have waited a few years and foregone the backpacking in India which made me feel less sympathetic to him. By the way, Pitt as an actor is called upon to be passive throughout. With less screen time, Cate is able to to display a wider display of emotions.Eric Roth came up with a very haunting screenplay. I just wish Fincher cut some of it to make a stronger movie. It's still quite good and a great date movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I the only one who hated this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with high hopes--it had a high IMDb rating, and a friend had personally recommended it. So when I sat down at the theatre, I expected to enjoy the movie. From the opening scene, however, my expectations were lowered drastically.Was there any point whatsoever in setting the movie's narration in a New Orleans hospital just before Hurricane Katrina hit? Because it seams as if the filmmakers said, "Oh, this is New Orleans. Let's include Katrina!" and did so without any further reason.The movie was also exceedingly long--almost 3 hours. Even if I LIKE a movie a great deal, that length is stretching my patience. The story would have been a great deal tighter and more interesting if they hadn't attempted to cram every tiny detail of Benjamin's life in--or even if they had decreased the returns to the narrator by a few. As it is, the story was almost lost in the filmmakers' need to include every tiny detail--and increasingly irrelevant ones, at that.One thing I cannot fault is the acting, and that is why this review is given 2 stars instead of only 1. All the actors (and there are a LOT of them) were superb. Brad Pitt in the titular role was particularly good--hearing the character mature as his body became younger was particularly disturbing.Overall, I would not recommend anyone to see this movie unless you have a taste for incomprehensible, overly-long movies with little discernible plot.</fullReview>

The story of Benjamin is the real story here and the screen comes alive during his story.I was really moved with the trailers, but not so much with the actual film, mostly I think because of the length of the film, almost three hours.This is well worth the effort, and everything in other posts is very detailed and accurate. The time and effort taken to craft this film from the beginning is really evident and well deserving of the award nominations it will certainly garner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Benjamin Button starts out very promisingly as a well-acted, well-paced film with an interesting premise. It's funny, a bit unorthodox, and the events in the film, in Forrest Gump-ian fashion, aren't directly related to each other but further the plot and character development.Maybe it's an amazingly clever meta-joke, but as the film went on its plot regressed in complexity, relying more and more on worn out movie clichés and schlocky melodrama. By about halfway through, it's a straight-up chick flick, before becoming a daytime soap opera. The "aging in reverse" plot is more or less abandoned here, and when the movie returns to it, almost as an afterthought, near the end, there are no surprising twists to enliven the movie's deadening pace. What you expect to happen is exactly what does happen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among a group of 5-6 friends I was the only one who did not like this movie. So one may conclude that it should not be a bad movie after all. To me, however, it will be remembered as a "boring movie with a long name".So the idea is that a man ages backwards. Well, that's a good idea for a movie but even the writers of a 30-minute late night show may come up with better ideas. "Memento" is a great film not only because of its brilliant idea but the way that idea was implemented.Although this film is packed with some good actors and dazzling makeup and visual effects, the weak script and character development makes this movie a failure. After the first hour of the movie I lost my faith in the story and was just waiting for the occasional lightning scenes!The movie has so many irrelevant events with no help to the main story like war scenes, hurricane Katrina, the woman who liked swimming, and even the mumbling old Cate Blanchett parts. In a well-developed story all of these would have been a part of the whole puzzle but here they are just unsuccessful attempts to give more dimension to this rather predictable story. Had not the movie received so high IMDb rating, I would have given it a 5 or 6 minus. Now I give it a sole star to keep the movie south of really good films in the chart!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't start to explain how terribly boring this movie was. It's easily the most boring movie I watched in years, probably because it's the most boring movie that spent so much in marketing to get you to watch it.The whole movie is a depressingly slow series of events about the life of a guy that starts looking ancient and dies looking like a kid, as biologically impossible as it is. Unfortunately, this is the only fictional element of this movie: not enough for a decent fiction movie, and not enough for a decent real life movie.Everything in this movie has to be so terribly slow it'll make counting sheep a thrilling experience in comparison. The movie could be compressed into a 15 minutes short film and it'd still be depressing because save for a couple of moments, the overall situation only goes from bad to worse. There's nothing special in the end; no surprises, no plot twists, nothing that will make the hours you've spent watching this worth in the least bit.The leading cast's performance was alright, though nothing spectacular except perhaps by the old lady telling the story. I suppose it's quite an achievement though; if I had a role in such a movie I'd fall asleep in the middle of my performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate this film pretty much for all the same reasons that the other posters have written: Blatant ripoff of Forrest Gump and Big Fish---Hell, the set designers even used the same design for Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's apartment that Forrest and Jenny had! And don't get me started on the ship's captain/destruction of Cate Blanchett's legs/and Benjamin's father walking with a crutch/ and the black characters who love Benjamin! Give me Bubba and Lt. Dan ANYDAY! Biggest problem I had was this: I truly didn't care in the slightest about ONE CHARACTER IN THIS ENTIRE FILM! THEY WERE ALL BORING ARCHETYPES! One last complaint that I have to wonder how many others noticed: At the end when the giant clock gets embraced by the floodwaters. Okay, um, I think I recall a similar scene in another movie where a beloved sled named "Rosebud" gets consumed in a fire at the end...oh yeah, that was a little picture called "CITIZEN KANE"--anybody here remember THAT ONE!? BTW--I'll admit "Citizen Kane" is overrated too, but at least Orson Welles didn't ripoff other films and try to pass his off as ORIGINAL! Oh yeah, one other question. EARLY in the film Brad Pitt narrates that it's 1970 but it's obviously the early 1920's! What the hell was up with that blatant error!? Okay, I'm done venting. I'm not the type to assault other people whose tastes differ from mine so I'm not going to resort to childish name-calling against people who like this film. Suffice it to say that I'm completely baffled by the popularity of this exercise in cinematic ripoffs!</fullReview>

Ah of course, if this is the kind of movies it is competing with at the Oscars! 2008 ought to be the year of weak premises. Button was a waste of time. The only thing worth mentioning was Brad Pitt's make-up. Everything else (including his acting) were below par. The logical inconsistencies were innumerable - to mention one: Button is born small (but old) and dies small (but young) with no wrinkles on his skin. Where did all the extra skin go? When are people going to realize it is not one idea that makes a movie? Scott Fitzgerald would have written that story in under three hours of his time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At nearly 3 hours, this is one long and, unfortunately, boring movie. The problem isn't so much the main story arc - it's the seemingly endless disconnected and meaningless story lines scattered throughout the film.Let's start with the structure of the film. It copies directly from The Titanic. So we have a dying old woman who shares her memories of her lover with her daughter. And just like in Titanic, she dies and the daughter finds out who her father really is. Boring, been there, done it before.Then there's nearly 30 minutes devoted to a character who does't propel the storyline along. Benjamin has an affair in a Russian hotel with a woman married to a British spy. This story acr had no consequence to the main storyline of the film. Why was it included? Why was she married to a British spy? Why does she up and leave him? He doesn't even seem to care, and neither did I.Then there is the hummingbird. The hummingbird is related to the death of Benjamin's captain and appears when the captain dies. It later appears when Daisy dies. Why? What does the hummingbird have to do with Daisy? Then there are the countless other characters who we are told are significant on Benjamin's life by the voice-over but then have no corresponding storyline. Most annoying was the woman with the dog. The dog appeared to be given great significance when it appears - but then disappears without consequence. Same as Benjamin's sister. Same with the clock maker. These vignettes padded the movie to distraction.And then there's the old man who was hit by lightning 7 times. The first 3 flashbacks are funny, and from then on, it's like groan - what does this character have to do with anything? Brad's performance is good. It's probably his best role - but let's face it, he's not really an actor's actor. Cate is her luminous best and as always absolutely steals the show. Daisy is the most enigmatic and interesting character. It's her story, rather than Benjamin's that is of most interest. Had the film been edited much more heavily and concentrated on the Benjamin / Daisy story, it could have been an amazing film.It's beautifully shot, great score, great effects, some good performances - but watching this film is like listening to a story told by someone who continually goes off track. In the end, you just want them to stop talking and you no longer care what happens.If you liked Titanic - you'll probably like this film. It has all the hokey plot devices and narration, and it's too long with too many characters. As with the Titanic, a great story is sacrificed by lack of editing. And you know it's bad when the audience leaves the theatre too bored to talk about the movie they just saw.</fullReview>

Im still waiting....The film gets lost half way through and stays that way to the end when magically, a man shrinks into the size of a newborn and then dies. I appreciate the fantasy aspect of the story but this is just ridiculous. And it hits none of its hinted at high points, there is no meaning, no outcome, nothing really. Its beautifully shot and well acted (Cate's crackling/dying/southern voice is completely over the top though)but the storyline is rubbish. Its like the exam paper you started and then went to a party instead so just winged it in the morning when you woke up with a hangover to hand in at 10am.There is also absolutely no chemistry between Brad and Cate which makes the love story mildly unbelievable BUT this really doesn't matter when the storyline is so rubbish. I really wonder about the people who think its amazing - swept up in the hype/marketing millions perhaps?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Pitts performance is flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script is strong, particularly in delivering poignant life messages. The make up is excellent and the costumes are very good. The photography and lighting are good. Brad Pitts acting is very monotone with no changes in facial expression throughout the story. I see no outward measurements available to the viewer to detect the evolving emotional maturity from Pitts character that comes with life's experiences. Example. Early in the movie, he is a young boy in an old body. At first, the viewer is unable to differentiate whether Benjamin is mentally and emotional equivalent to his advanced physical age. Apparently, he is not. Another example: an early scene with the 5 year old Daisy, they both hide under a table which substitutes as a "fort". This presented an opportunity to display the character of a small boy in an old body but that is not what is delivered. In scene after scene Pitts emotional delivery is flat. I found no "chemistry" between Pitt and Blanchett, although I believe she delivers a strong performance. I believe Johnny Depp would have been a better choice for the role. There is some effective comic relief delivered by "lightning" but it is never developed and left as simply that, comic relief. Lastly, it is a very long movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I'm not a professional movie critic and belong to a small group of people who come to a movie theater to enjoy the movie as a whole. I really don't care about who directed the movie, what are the names of actors, what are the special effects in the movie or how wonderful are costumes or light. I want some entertainment from the show, some story that touches me somehow. And as you can guess this one was not entertaining at all. It was plain boring. Everything was so unnatural and predictable. The original short story was probably indeed too short so it was a challenging task for writers to fill 2+ hours of the movie. Of course they connected the dots and filled the gaps but no, it didn't bring any value to the movie. Everything from this movie was seen so many times before.Of course this is not 1 out of 10 movie - 3 out of 10 is probably a more realistic grade, but I'm sick with the rating distribution so biased toward 10 (check for yourself).And please don't tell me about Gold Globes or Oscars. "No Country for Old Men" was also nominated but it didn't make it any better as a movie. And no, I'm not a person enjoying stupid action movies with car races and meaningless violence.The bottom line - it's not a masterpiece but a very average ordinary movie. Not entertaining at all.

Think of the touchstones of a certain Oscar-winning GUMP, stir in some TITANIC doomed romance, a reversal of DORIAN GRAY and even a touch of what Coppola only wished he'd done with YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH, and you have a good start on BUTTON.

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't be fooled. Many critics have gone on record calling David Fincher's "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" the year's best film. It's attracting tons of Oscar buzz as this review is being written. I walked into Fincher's film with high expectations, but I was let down. NOTHING about this movie screams "Best Picture". With a recycled screenplay, too many misfired metaphors and a generally gimmicky, confused premise, no amount of brilliant acting or technology can save Ben Button.The premise is clever. Primarily based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film chronicles the life of Benjamin Button, played by Brad Pitt, who's mother dies during child birth, and who's father abandons him on the doorsteps of an old-folks home when he is born with the appearance of an elderly man. The home, run by a black maid named Queenie, takes him in as a son, and people begin to see that he is in fact aging backwards, from old to young. Its a premise that, in the right hands, could have been expanded brilliantly to reveal poetic ideas life and death, but, starting with the screenplay, a series of mistakes cause the film to sink.People need to accept that Benjamin Button and Forrest Gump, both written by the talented Eric Roth, are fundamentally the same movie. There must be at lease 30 similarities. Both men are southern gentlemen, both have a miracle moment walking for the first time, both spend time on a boat, both spend time fighting a war. Additionally, both films involve a female love interest who ventures out of her home for several years to pursue a dream, while on a rocky road to find herself. These 2 movies are identical, and the film's biggest defenders will have a hard time arguing against that fact.But I'll ignore those similarities for minute, because I should assess this movie as its own work. And when looked at that way, I'll say the first word that comes to mind is preachy. Every 7 minutes, Benjamin, narrating the film, gives us a brand new metaphor about life and how its just so "un-predictable". There's also some completely pathetic visual poetry with a hummingbird, whose significance in the film's message I'm still unsure of.But you wanna know what's funny? For all its preaching about unpredictable events, Benjamin button lives a pretty normal life. He works on a boat, he serves in the navy in WWII, he co-owns a dance studio with his romantic interest Daisy, played by Cate Blanchett, and then he operates a toll booth. That sounds pretty average to me, and I found personally that Benjamin Button is, himself, more of a bizarre science-fiction character than a human being we could all relate to. The fact that he spends his whole life seeing his friends die off is interesting, but it seems repetitive and gimmicky by the middle of the movie.I must concede though, this film has its strengths. Technologically, the make-up and height adjustments made to Brad Pitt are astonishing, and the way that he looks like an old man getting younger and younger progressively is extraordinary. Additionally, the performances, including Pitt and Blanchett, but also Tilda Swinton as a spy's wife staying in the same motel Benjamin is, were good, although I noticed Cate Blanchett struggled horribly with a Cajun accent.I just don't get it. In a year filled with multiple competitive Oscar contenders, like The Dark Knight, Frost/Nixon, Milk, Slumdog Millionaire and Changeling, it is astonishing to me that this is the stand-out for Best Picture. Surely, Benjamin Button's technology is worthy of awards buzz. But little else is.I feel like this picture thinks itself to be better than it actually is. Why else would the structure of the story by so explicit, the production so high quality, the acting, as a whole, so good? I don't know, and come Oscar time we will see if any members of the Academy saw what I saw in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." I hope they do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many reviewers are gushing about this movie, but I thought the movie was totally implausible and inconsistent. The premise is so bizarre and silly that it makes the love story impossible to appreciate. Furthermore, Brad Pitt is largely mute, which I don't equate with fine acting. Cate Blanchett is very cold and distant, not someone who would make an obvious love interest. Even Tilda Swinton was warmer than Cate Blanchett. The last half-hour is especially disappointing, since part of Benjamin's body ages normally (the brain), while other parts age in an inverted sense. I felt that the screenwriters were having a particularly bad time of it, trying to figure out an ending that was somehow consistent with the beginning. I predict that because Benjamin Button is very dull, and self-important, it will be nominated for best picture Oscar and will probably win (think Out of Africa, The English Patient or Chariots of Fire).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was going to be a very good film because of its interesting plot and its leading actors Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt but it turned out to be a too long and boring movie. I think it deserves 5.5 stars, but I give it a 1 because it doesn't deserves to be in the top 250 IMDb list.The plot is developed in a very slow pace and it lasts too long (166 minutes) that make it very boring. I have always liked Brad Pitt's work but I can't believe he has been nominated for the Oscar as best actor , the role he plays here could haven been played easily for any regular actor, I didn't find his role very difficult to be done. he has had better performances specially in "Fight Club (1999)" where he deserved a Oscar nomination.Cate Blanchett is good here like in every role she plays. I Think this could have been better if it would have lasted only 120 minutes, taking away some parts when Benjamin is old. the final minutes are good and touch you, but despite these really good moments they don't delete the boring 85 % of this film.Benjamin Button was born old and each year he becomes younger, he gets younger in a place for old people and is there where he will meet Daisy the love of his life who is the granddaughter of one old woman who lives there , he will become sailor and will travel to many places before re meeting with Daisy.........This movie is recommended for people who likes very slow pace movies like "Lost in Translation (2003)", or if you are a very romantic person and don't mind being bored during the first 146 minutes to enjoyed the last 20 touching minutes.</fullReview>

I love most Fincher movies and his stamp is all over this visually. And some of the acting is very good.Unfortunately i base my ratings for films on whether i enjoy them or not and not based on a concept or the lighting or the effects. Yes it's creative but it runs out of steam fairly quickly. I spent the first 30 minutes thinking, nice concept, cool characters i wonder where this is going. By the final third i just didn't care anymore. I didn't engage with the characters at all. Brad Pitt is not a great actor and doesn't win me over at all. I didn't want to cry and i cry at pretty much anything, honestly it's a curse. I just ran out of putting the effort in to stay with the story.People are entitled to their opinion but an average of 8.5...come on. Top 75 films of all time. Not even close. It's an over-hyped piece of cinema "cool". You do not have to pretend that this is the bees knees. Be honest with your reviews. Your misleading the public and perpetuating a myth.So i'll finish on this. My true rating for this film is about a 5. I'm giving it a 1 though as i'm hoping it balances out the over enthusiasm of some of the IMDb crowd of Film fascists who care more about clever than they do about entertaining.I don't know, maybe i'm wrong but please, do me one favour. give it an honest vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Button was not so wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly started watching this film with great expectations..but by the end of it I was not impressed. The story goes on and on, dragging you along through his life as if it were more interesting than it really is. The CGI aging tends to be more annoying than realistic. The movie just left a bad taste in my mouth and tried so hard to be the next Forest Gump. Mr. Pitt attempted to pull your heartstrings throughout the film with little bits of humor here and there. Honestly his character was lacking a lot. The best performances were from the minor characters not the stars. Definitely not worth the amount of attention it is receiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm rather tolerant of movies that most people find boring, but this was completely different. I was so bored I felt compelled to come here and write a review explaining how bored I was. This is a warning...Benjamin Button is droll.Brad Pitt is a great actor and the character he portrayed as Benjamin Button makes for a rather mundane and lifeless protagonist. I don't think he is at fault so much as the writing and directing. There isn't much to the guy besides the fact that he ages backwards. Julia Ormond is laughable at best. Every time the movie reverted back to the hospital I literally squirmed in my seat because it was drawing out the movie more and more.If you are expecting a film like Forest Gump, think again. Gump was packed full of historical significance, excellent writing, great direction, and fantastic acting. Benjamin Button has very little historical significance. Besides the brief ten minutes spent in World War II, the character has absolutely no interaction with the times.I'm only writing this to contradict everybody who is praising this movie for being so fantastic. I'm surprised it has been nominated for so many awards already. Do not go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Boring Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very boring! It is listed as 2 hours and 47 minutes long but it felt like i wasted my whole day there. The movie had a horrible start and finish. There should have been more emphasis on the miracle of Benjamin Button's case, yet they just kept going on with his life. Certain parts of the movie should have been cut out to save time, some parts of the movie had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. They should have cut out the entire war part because it had no relevance to the rest of the movie. This movie took to long, the theater was packed, I couldn't get up to get some water. The movie had no purpose or meaning. Please do not waste your time. Anyways use your ticket to watch Marley and Me - it was much, much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How about a long, drawn out epic tale about one ordinary (but different) man with his unique set of struggles from birth to death, where he builds character as history unfolds around him. Sound familiar? The central difference between this and Gump is that Benjamin Button isn't a retard played by Tom Hanks. That's why I gave it a three out of ten....two points for not casting a retarded Tom Hanks, one point for effort. Apparently the proceeding isn't enough text, so let me add some more...good special effects, which will never save a movie on their own, and Cate Blanchett in her least memorable role to date...maybe if Forrest Gump had never happened, I wouldn't have hated this trite waste of time nearly as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What story?! Best Adapted Screenplay???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Brad Pitt stumble his way through Benjamin Button. Let me say that this movie appeals to the lowest common denominator. If you liked this movie, your not alone, my girlfriend really liked it; she's not a movie buff either. However, if you enjoy the complexity of a complete story with relatively few holes then don't see this movie. This movie has more holes than my cheese grater. Other comments on here echo my sediments. These characters motives are obscure at best. Why does Benjamin refuse Daisy after he's wanted her for so long? And why when they finally do make love is it a ridiculously quick: "Do you want to make love?" -his response: "Absolutely!" - And then they get busy just like that....? HUH?! This is just another example of Hollywood making a movie based on a 20 page story and writing it into a 3 hour movie -in which it has no more insight into the characters then the 20 page story had. It's a disgrace to make people sit through a 3 hour movie with such horrible story telling. Explain to me how a 3 hour movie written from a 20 page story is an adapted screenplay?! That's an original screenplay 'based on a short story' - wow - please listen to me Hollywood -Stop making 3 hour movies with special effects in place of real emotional dialogue and half developed characters who have completely unseen motives for more than half the movie!!! Argh! Why does Benjamin leave as soon as he finds out Daisy is pregnant??? He would still be able to be a father figure in the body of a 20 year old....and yet they give NO explanation for his decision to leave Daisy - and she just lets him go??? I thought they were in love? Quit jerking the audience around! I wasted 3 hours of my life watching a movie that left you wondering why this character did this and why that character did that...a screenwriter should know that the characters need motivation to create drama in a story. There was drama, but no motive for it. Shame on the screenwriter and director of this film. I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disaffected and Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much has been said on this title already; so, although i must write for my own sake, I will be brief.The plot seemed to me to be hackneyed and entirely languid in its pace. In fact, the entire enterprise was akin to a very vain person, casually strolling down the street while gazing ever so lovingly at themselves in every store front. Furthermore, it seemed horribly predictable. I can not help but think this view affirmed by the fact that "The Curious Case" strolled out of the gate for a one hundred sixty six minute race while the original Fitzgerald story lasted but a few pages to chew over, ultimately, the same philosophic point of life having kairos for all things.The acting was decent and I enjoy Mr. Pitt almost omnifariously but here he seemed hampered by the sluggish pace and the films tedious qualities. It all seemed very disaffected in a strong way. Not a powerful disaffection just a general indolence.I will admit that all the wonderful hype this movie received made things much more difficult for it, both in that I expected much more than I was liable to receive (i.e. had I never heard of it and then seen the same film, I would most likely have enjoyed it slightly more than I did as my expectations would be so aligned) and, second, in that many people's continual love- affair with the film brought out some sort of pompous revolutionary quality in me: the desire to free the hoi polloi from their manufactured confusion (as I deemed it) have certainly made me color the film worse than it deserves.So all in all, will the Curious Case of Benjamin Button change your life? No, assuredly no. Is it enjoyable? For the most part, yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A.O. Scott sucks almost as much as this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst films of the year. That A.O. Scott has it as a Critic's Pick is a sad reflection of just how low the critic world has sunk. This is a movie that even on a basic storytelling, studio screenplay level fails drastically. We're told in the first ten minutes three times that "You never know what's coming." But nothing ever does come. There is a completely pointless and dull sequence where Button hangs out with Tilda Swinton over late night tea(what they talk about we don't know because the conversations are done in dissolved musical montages.) There is a Gumpy boat sequence with Jared Harris that doesn't do anything except tell us Button loves sex with whores. And then there is the relationship with Cate Blanchett, which is really all the movie needed to be. Why they tried to turn a strange love story into an epic is beyond me. All the fat around the love story really takes the wind out of the movie's sails.The writing is awful. Inserting Dr. Phil new age sayings into a gruff boat captain's mouth is shameless and terrible. "You have to let go when you die" we are told by numerous characters(did they all watching the same Oprah episode or what?)Cate Blanchett has entered M.Streep territory in terms of her vanity level being capable of sucking energy from the screen. The pseudo-spiritual expressions she now makes in every picture are vomit-inducing. Her self-regard is what really sticks out in every character she plays. Put a Bob Dylan wig on her-- she's still always about "Cate the Great."I felt bad for Taraji P. Henson. Button comes back from a couple years at sea looking 40 years younger and all Henson can say is "I always knew there was something special about you." The audience laughed at the Ziegfield.Why is Julia Ormond's character in this film?And what Hurrican Katrina and the Beatles have to do with this outlandish fable I have no idea. If the filmmakers weren't so hell-bent on trying to make an old, thin Fitzgerald short story into a relevant epic-- this movie might have been okay. As is though, they tried to take an absurd yarn and place it in the real world. It never works. Too many holes. Too many conceits.David Fincher, after all these years, still has not made a great film. And this is his worst by far.A.O. Scott is becoming a really bad reviewer. You have to call out bad storytelling and movie-making, and Scott doesn't anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benjamin Button - Beautiful and Yet Empty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was in my top 3 most anticipated films of the year, since I am a huge David Fincher fan, but unfortunately, it was also one of the biggest disappointments of the year. The art direction and acting were beautifully executed, and yet overall, I left the theater having not felt anything for the characters or for the story. The film wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. It also would have better served the film if they had edited out around 20 mins of the movie.I know that it will still most likely win a few Oscars and Golden Globes, because of the scope and ambition of the film and the performances, but I feel that other movies, such as Slumdog Millionaire are more deserving of the awards. I remember when Chicago undeservedly won for Best Picture at the Oscars as a result of the over hyping of the film, and I have a feeling that the same will happen with Benjamin Button.</fullReview>

Basically the reverse aging scenario is used to get you in the seats and take your money, then you watch what is the retelling of a fairly ordinary life. Nothing amazing takes place, nothing that evokes deep thought in the viewer takes place and in fact, nothing really takes place beyond the oddity of his condition.There's no great love story, no great achievement, no great tragedy or overcome. Is it entertaining? Yes but not enough to justify the royal treatment it's getting from the media. It really felt like a made for TV story with a huge budget and big name thrown in the lead. When I hear claims like "best movie of the decade", it just goes to show what salesman everyone working in film and television really are.</fullReview>

It's real long and I stuck with it for two hours before deciding that nothing was going to happen. I then fast forwarded the rest and yep, nothing except the obvious. They clearly tried and it's clearly close to being real good but you are never thinking wow, you are never gripping the seat - it's just a series of non-events for no obvious reason. It moves along really slowly. It's rather predictable. There's no moral to the story, there isn't even an obvious point to it.

		<shortDescription>This year's "Forrest Gump," only worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This schmaltzy, bloated film sounds, on paper, like it was going to be some kind of unique experience in cinema; to my knowledge, an entire film that centers around a person aging backwards has never been done before. But as the film eventually progresses on (and very slowly mind you, slower even than "Zodiac;" Fincher is in need of an editor these days) we soon realize that that is the ONLY thing that is unique about the film. It's actually a very conventional bildungsroman which has everything you expect from any coming-of-age story. We see opportunities missed, opportunities taken, chance encounters, and a whole lot of death and dying. It's always a cheap way to narrate a film by killing off characters one by one, but sadly, it IS the film's narrative.And about the unique element of Benjamin aging backwards, the film doesn't really capitalize on it to make a bigger statement of life (In fact, for a running time of almost 3 hours, it doesn't make ANY profound commentary). Benjamin could have aged normally, and it wouldn't have made a difference. In fact, it just becomes downright bizarre and sometimes even disturbing in some scenes. When you see a decrepit looking Brad Pitt sharing secrets under the bed with a 9 year old girl, you will not feel comfortable. What might have been more poignant is if Benjamin had a real disease and knew he was going to die at a young age, and he still took the chances he took in this film. So the gimmick of age-reversal remains what it is: A gimmick. (Though I'd be curious to see what Fitzgerald had in mind when he wrote his short story.) There are also some plot events that simply do not make sense in the narrative of the film. Why have Benjamin raised by African Americans? It did not make a difference at all whether he was raised by blacks, whites, or Asians ? Benjamin is certainly not influenced by the African American community through the course of the film. For a film that starts in the 1910s and makes it a point that Benjamin is raised by blacks, it absolutely makes no mention about the hardships of blacks in pre-civil rights America. Another thing is that the film is told in flashback by Benjamin's one true love, who's dying and lying down in a hospital bed. It is not told in the present, but rather, it is told in 2004 in New Orleans. Yes, hurricane Katrina strikes eventually. What's the point for the filmmakers to include one of America's most devastating natural disasters if it has nothing to do with the plot? In a way, this film made me appreciate the films by people like Yasujiro Ozu (whose "Tokyo Story" is one of the greatest films about the impermanence of life) even more, with their spare, poetic style.David Fincher has made some of Hollywood's most suspenseful films in recent memory and I thought it'd be interesting for him to try a new genre. But after viewing the results, this is definitely not Fincher's territory, and the only reason I can see why this film was made was purely for Mr. Oscar. It tries to be this year's "Forrest Gump" but even there it fails ? it has not one memorable line from it, and clearly Fincher is trying too hard to be dramatic. Instead, he eventually becomes melodramatic. It's a curious attempt, and at least it's pretty well shot, not to mention some outstanding aging special effects. In the end, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is Fincher's chick flick, and I hope it's his last one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It not that good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trust me on this one...it's not that good of a movie. Yes, the plot is unique and the message of the overall movie is a good one but it should not be receiving all these kinds of accolades. First off the movie is quite long for a love story and it is pretty slow moving. Second, the voice of the old woman is severely over dramatic and half the time you cannot understand what she is saying. Yes, I am aware that she was on her death bed at the time but the voice did not have to be drawn out and difficult for us to hear. Lastly, it just missed that spark that every love story should have and I feel it is just getting the kind of response it has gotten just merely because Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett starred in it. I mean just because it has gotten these golden globe nominations (and will most likely get the Oscar nominations too) does not mean that we must like this movie. It is average at best and the only thing that separates itself from any other love story is the unique plot which is the only bright spot in the movie.P.S. Does anyone else think it is weird for a 70 year old guy to be attracted to a 7 year old girl and vice-versa?????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From wondreful to terrible in only 2 1/2 hours. Just add water.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had mixed feelings going into watching this film. I had read bad reviews by critics, both "professional" and IMDb peoples. I had also read some good reviews and seen the '8.7' overall vote on IMDb.The previews alone shown a wonderfully filmed movie. But beyond that, I wondered what a story of a man growing young could really be about? What substance was this film made of? The answer made me cry...and not in a good way.I'm going to make this quick: the first 1/3 of the film is wonderful in its honest, somewhat magical tale of a baby born old, raided by a couple who watch over old people in their dying years, Benjamin relating to their deaths, growing fond of a young girl his age. Here the artistry and visual style are magnificent with just the right touch to give the tale a magical "fable" like quality.And then Benjamin, at 17 in real years, looking and feeling as a 60 year old, sets off into the world, to experience life. But we ask, why? There's no real motive, no overall "pull" to his journey, somewhat pointless, yet entertaining...after all, it's his journey. But, from here on out the film starts to slip...it's still entertaining for another 1/3, or middle act, but we the audience have no idea where we're being taken, and by the last 1/3 of the film, it seems that the writers didn't either.The last 1/3 is sheer awful drek. It really is like watching a train fly off a cliff. This film didn't know where it was going and it was very plain. Thematic dialogue happens far too late in the film, our protagonist, Button, makes decisions that have no precident, we the audience don't really know why. The magic of the beginning is completely gone...completely abandoned. Lost.I will say this. The cinematography reminded me of Raging Bull in that many different styles and shots were used, different visual techniques that are just a wonder to watch. But in the end, the camera-work is not enough to save this film.It's a shame, because I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this film. By the end I was literally, laughing/crying at every expositive and pointless word coming out of Pitt and Blanchett's mouths.Kudos to Pitt and Blanchett for giving solid performances, but alas, all for naught.The only reason this film is up for best picture in the Acadamy Awards is because this is the only "popular" movie that was half decent, whereas the rest of the nominees, all excellent in their own right, were not nearly as popular, and more 'cinema' than just 'entertianment'.I would normally give this film a 6 out of 10, but the sites 8.7 has led me to take the stance of a 'hater' and drop a phat uno on this one to try to average it out. I don't like doing this, but the writers of this script have forced my mouse-click.Please, watch the first half, then save yourself from the torment of the second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I life worth forgetting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being one of the big Oscar contenders this year i tried not to expected too much from this movie. But what i got was far far less then i could ever have anticipated.It's like the writers sat down and thought of a great idea about a guy, Benjamin, aging backwards. What the writers then forgot to do was think of an interesting life-story for this Benjamin guy. Sure it could be fun to see someone going to school when he already knows everything and having sex with young girls when he's an old guy, but there must be more something more interesting about a life led backwards. Instead what i saw was a 2:45 hour lasting agony. This guy Benjamin has the most boring life ever! He's just born one day and dies another.Don't get me wrong. I love the Fincher movies (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac) and I like Brad Pitt in almost all of his movies. But what everyone who's concerned with this movie (director, actors, producers, Oscar-nominators) seems to forget is that a movie has to have a story. And there is non, it's non-existent. It's like making a three hour long movie about John Doe.We don't see that much acting as for a woman who's in a near-death state of living all the time and we hear a semi-emotional narration by Pitt which reminds too much of Forest Gump, except that he had a life worth telling. OK i do admit, Cat Blanchett does act, but it's outrageous over the top annoying with some phony accent without any emotional depth whatsoever.Benjamin Button's dad is a guy who made a fortune making buttons, you believe that? Now that's a story worth telling! He has a big house, his whole family was in the business of making buttons and he owns a boat etc. But no... the story about his son's boring life is what's shown instead.I guess the point i'm trying to make is that i didn't like the movie and don't understand why the life story of Benjamin Button is worth telling with mediocre acting all the way. No wonder most reviews lack any basis for a high rating or Oscar nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Curiously Boring Case of Benjamin Button</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a reason why everybody is praising this movie so much? Definitely Brad Pitt's worst film to date. Benjamin Button attempts to be deep and meaningful, but falls unbelievably short. The film is way to slow and wayyyy to long. I found myself looking at my watch repeatedly throughout the film. Once the film starts and he is an old child, you begin to realize that you now must wait 3 hours for him to grow "old" and die.True, the film is beautiful looking, but beyond that, it is painfully boring. The movie doesn't ever pick up until about the last 20 minutes or so, and in a 3 hour film that's a death sentence. The love story was pointless and never even explained. How does a young girl fall in love with an elderly looking kid? Nobody knows, and it is never explained or discussed. The lighting, CGI, and effects were all beautifully done, but the story was so insanely pointless. The movie could have been shortened immensely, even cut in half. This is a movie that the critics will love, and few others will claim it's beautiful and moving, when really it's just another piece of crap pushing to be meaningful. And i agree with many of the posts, don't even compare it to Forrest Gump. They are in no way similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. I can see lots of people really enjoyed it, which is fine, but I think this was a really bad film.My reasons are: The storyline was based around an incredibly simplistic premise that wasn't discussed interestingly, just told in a boring narrative that had absolutely no intrigue or complexity. Watching it unfold was like watching paint dry.The acting and script were so bland (especially Brad Pitt) that it was almost completely impossible to feel anything at all for the characters, apart from 'woah Brad Pitt looks old and small'.The whole thing looked and sounded like a bad TV show (like the Adventures of Young Indiana Jones or something similar).The fact that Brad Pitt has been nominated for an award for this piece of trash is just indicative of the shallow gimickery that gets people awards. It doesn't have anything to do with acting - it's the equivalent of the 'don't go FULL retard' speech so aptly made by Robert Downey Junior's character in Tropic Thunder, (which by the way is pretty funny).A massive pile of cheap looking drivel, that's really boring. There are only a few films that have actually make me upset with myself for having bothered to waste my time watching them, and this is one. Almost as bad as 'The Illusionist'.</fullReview>

Though some of the scenery was excellent and the makeup exceptional, it did little to tweak my interest. I left the theater feeling I had wasted my time and my money on a film so lacking in any thought-provoking ideas or interest.

		<shortDescription>A pretty interesting exercise of style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely, a beautiful movie! Superbly shot, with obvious plastic virtues, and a keen eye for epoch reconstruction and historical precision. A real feast for the sore eyes.The script itself, however, is quite linear, devoid of logic and imagination. One should remember that the genre of fantastic realism supposes certain rules that must be followed. Once we propose a fantastic premise - here, the "curious case of" a child born old and gradually regressing to youth and infancy - we must construct its relationship with the real world, rational and natural as we know it, in a coherent and credible form. This is how we achieve that "state of real" which makes the basis of any successful fantastic story.In this case, the state of real is sorely amiss. Although aware of the protagonist's oddity, the people around react in an apathetic and conventional way. As such, paradoxically, the convention doesn't function (or, in other words, "conventionalism kills the convention"). As a result, the much needed conflict is weak and fragmentary. The writers show a surprising lack of creative imagination, just going with the flow. And the flow is slow. And low.One should also point out that the script departs its own referential frame. So, our character "turns young", with all the consequences as such derived. But, dearies, sclerosis, Alzheimer and any other forms of senile dementia are 100% results or the brain's physical degrading (the neurotransmitters' failings, the proteins' faulty processing, and so on!) As such, WHY does the "old child" B.B. turns senile, when his brain is literally young and vital? BY CONTRARY, in that instance, we really had a high potential for drama: an individual having all the knowledge and living experience of eight decades of life, amplified by the super-intelligent and vivid mind of a child! A "wonder-kid", a "genius", not due to any super-powers, but strictly as a result of his own peculiarity: age regression! THIS was the true ending of the story - and how dramatic and compelling it would have been! A real ending to remember! As such (and following also the total lack of depth and fantasy of the story, plus the stereotype profile of B.B. - who has no personality at all), everything remains shallow, useless, slow-paced, boring and insignificant. Thank God, the plastic departments are sublimely represented! At least for cinematography, sets, costumes and, of course, first of all make-up, this movie would deserve some Oscars (but only in those fields!)</fullReview>
